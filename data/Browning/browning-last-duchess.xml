                            <note>"My Last Duchess" was first printed in the third volume ("Dramatic Lyrics") of <hi rend="italic">Bells and Pomegranates</hi>, an 8-part self-published collection, under the title "I. Italy." This was the first part of a longer piece in two parts called "Italy and France." It was first printed under its more familiar title in the 1849 collection <hi rend="italic">Dramatic Romances and Lyrics</hi>. The poem is frequently anthologized as an example of a dramatic monologue. "Ferrara" is the poetic speaker--this is most likely meant to represent Alfonso II (1533-1598), the fifth duke of Ferrara.</note>

                    <l n="3">That piece a wonder, now: Frà Pandolf's hands</l>
                    <l n="4">Worked busily a day, and there she stands.</l>
                    <l n="5">Will 't please you sit and look at her? I said</l>
                    <l n="6">"Frà Pandolf" by design, for never read</l>

                    <l n="11">And seemed as they would ask me, if they durst,</l>
                    <l n="12">How such a glance came there; so, not the first</l>
                    <l n="13">Are you to turn and ask thus. Sir, 'twas not</l>

                    <l n="15">Of joy into the Duchess' cheek: perhaps</l>
                    <l n="16">Frà Pandolf chanced to say, "Her mantle laps</l>

                    <l n="20">Was courtesy, she thought, and cause enough</l>
                    <l n="21">For calling up that spot of joy. She had</l>
                    <l n="22">A heart . . . how shall I say? . . . too soon made glad,</l>
                    <l n="23">Too easily impressed; she liked whate'er</l>

                    <l n="25">Sir, 'twas all one! My favour at her breast,</l>
                    <l n="26">The dropping of the daylight in the West,</l>
                    <l n="27">The bough of cherries some officious fool</l>
                    <l n="28">Broke in the orchard for her, the white mule</l>

                    <l n="30">Would draw from her alike the approving speech,</l>
                    <l n="31">Or blush, at least. She thanked men,--good; but thanked</l>
                    <l n="32">Somehow . . . I know not how . . . as if she ranked</l>
                    <l n="33">My gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name</l>
                    <l n="34">With anybody's gift. Who'd stoop to blame</l>

                    <l n="36">In speech--(which I have not)--to make your will</l>
                    <l n="37">Quite clear to such an one, and say, "Just this</l>
                    <l n="38">Or that in you disgusts me; here you miss,</l>
                    <l n="39">Or there exceed the mark"--and if she let</l>

                    <l n="41">Her wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse,</l>
                    <l n="42">--E'en then would be some stooping; and I chuse</l>
                    <l n="43">Never to stoop. Oh, sir, she smiled, no doubt,</l>
                    <l n="44">Whene'er I passed her; but who passed without</l>
                    <l n="45">Much the same smile? This grew; I gave commands;</l>
                    <l n="46">Then all smiles stopped together. There she stands</l>
                    <l n="47">As if alive. Will 't please you rise? We'll meet</l>
                    <l n="48">The company below, then. I repeat,</l>

                    <l n="50">Is ample warrant that no just pretence</l>
                    <l n="51">Of mine for dowry will be disallowed;</l>
                    <l n="52">Though his fair daughter's self, as I avowed</l>
                    <l n="53">At starting, is my object. Nay, we'll go</l>
                    <l n="54">Together down, Sir! Notice Neptune, though,</l>
