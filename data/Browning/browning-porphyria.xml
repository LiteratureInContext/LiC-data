                            <note>"My Last Duchess" was first printed in the third volume ("Dramatic Lyrics") of <hi rend="italic">Bells and Pomegranates</hi>, an 8-part self-published collection, under the title "I. Italy." This was the first part of a longer piece in two parts called "Italy and France." It was first printed under its more familiar title in the 1849 collection <hi rend="italic">Dramatic Romances and Lyrics</hi>. The poem is frequently anthologized as an example of a dramatic monologue. "Ferrara" is the poetic speaker--this is most likely meant to represent Alfonso II (1533-1598), the fifth duke of Ferrara.</note>

                        <l n="1">The rain set early in to-night,</l>
                        <l n="2" rend="indent">The sullen wind was soon awake,</l>
                        <l n="3">It tore the elm-tops down for spite, </l>
                        <l n="4" rend="indent">And did its worst to vex the lake: </l>
                        <l n="5" rend="indent">I listened with heart fit to break. </l>
                        <l n="6">When glided in Porphyria; straight </l>
                        <l n="7" rend="indent">She shut the cold out and the storm, </l>
                        <l n="8">And kneeled and made the cheerless grate</l>
                        <l n="9" rend="indent">Blaze up, and all the cottage warm; </l>
                        <l n="10" rend="indent">Which done, she rose, and from her form </l>
                        <l n="11">Withdrew the dripping cloak and shawl, </l>
                        <l n="12" rend="indent">And laid her soiled gloves by, untied </l>
                        <l n="13">Her hat and let the damp hair fall, </l>
                        <l n="14" rend="indent">And, last, she sat down by my side </l>
                        <l n="15" rend="indent">And called me. When no voice replied, </l>
                        <l n="16">She put my arm about her waist, </l>
                        <l n="17" rend="indent">And made her smooth white shoulder bare,</l>
                        <l n="18">And all her yellow hair displaced, </l>
                        <l n="19" rend="indent">And, stooping, made my cheek lie there, </l>
                        <l n="20" rend="indent">And spread, o'er all, her yellow hair,</l>
                        <l n="21">Murmuring how she loved me — she </l>
                        <l n="22" rend="indent">Too weak, for all her heart's endeavour,</l>
                        <l n="23">To set its struggling passion free </l>
                        <l n="24" rend="indent">From pride, and vainer ties dissever,</l>
                        <l n="25" rend="indent">And give herself to me for ever. </l>
                        <l n="26">But passion sometimes would prevail, </l>
                        <l n="27" rend="indent">Nor could to-night's gay feast restrain</l>
                        <l n="28">A sudden thought of one so pale </l>
                        <l n="29" rend="indent">For love of her, and all in vain: </l>
                        <l n="20" rend="indent">So, she was come through wind and rain.</l>
                        <l n="31">Be sure I looked up at her eyes </l>
                        <l n="32" rend="indent">Happy and proud; at last I knew </l>
                        <l n="33">Porphyria worshipped me; surprise </l>
                        <l n="34" rend="indent">Made my heart swell, and still it grew</l>
                        <l n="35" rend="indent">While I debated what to do. </l>
                        <l n="36">That moment she was mine, mine, fair,</l>
                        <l n="37" rend="indent">Perfectly pure and good: I found </l>
                        <l n="38">A thing to do, and all her hair </l>
                        <l n="39" rend="indent">In one long yellow string I wound </l>
                        <l n="40" rend="indent">Three times her little throat around, </l>
                        <l n="41">And strangled her. No pain felt she; </l>
                        <l n="42" rend="indent">I am quite sure she felt no pain. </l>
                        <l n="43">As a shut bud that holds a bee, </l>
                        <l n="44" rend="indent">I warily oped her lids: again </l>
                        <l n="45" rend="indent">Laughed the blue eyes without a stain.</l>
                        <l n="46">And I untightened next the tress </l>
                        <l n="47" rend="indent">About her neck; her cheek once more </l>
                        <l n="48">Blushed bright beneath my burning kiss:</l>
                        <l n="49" rend="indent">I propped her head up as before, </l>
                        <l n="50" rend="indent">Only, this time my shoulder bore </l>
                        <l n="51">Her head, which droops upon it still: </l>
                        <l n="52" rend="indent">The smiling rosy little head, </l>
                        <l n="53">So glad it has its utmost will, </l>
                        <l n="54" rend="indent">That all it scorned at once is fled, </l>
                        <l n="55" rend="indent">And I, its love, am gained instead! </l>
                        <l n="56">Porphyria's love: she guessed not how </l>
                        <l n="57" rend="indent">Her darling one wish would be heard.</l>
                        <l n="58">And thus we sit together now, </l>
                        <l n="59" rend="indent">And all night long we have not stirred,</l>
                        <l n="60" rend="indent">And yet God has not said a word! </l>
