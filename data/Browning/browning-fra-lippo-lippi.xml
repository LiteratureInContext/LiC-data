                    <l n="257">I can't unlearn ten minutes afterwards.</l>

                <lg>
                    <l n="258">You understand me: I'm a beast, I know.</l>
                    <l n="259">But see, now--why, I see as certainly</l>
                    <l n="260">As that the morning-star's about to shine,</l>
                    <l n="261">What will hap some day. We've a youngster here</l>
                    <l n="262">Comes to our convent, studies what I do,</l>
                    <l n="263">Slouches and stares and lets no atom drop:</l>
                    <l n="264">His name is Guidi--he'll not mind the monks--</l>
                    <l n="265">They call him Hulking Tom, he lets them talk--</l>
                    <l n="266">He picks my practice up--he'll paint apace.</l>
                    <l n="267">I hope so--though I never live so long,</l>
                    <l n="268">I know what's sure to follow. You be judge!</l>
                    <l n="269">You speak no Latin more than I, belike;</l>
                    <l n="270">However, you're my man, you've seen the world</l>
                    <l n="271">--The beauty and the wonder and the power,</l>
                    <l n="272">The shapes of things, their colours, lights and shades,</l>
                    <l n="273">Changes, surprises,--and God made it all!</l>
                    <l n="274">--For what? Do you feel thankful, ay or no,</l>
                    <l n="275">For this fair town's face, yonder river's line,</l>
                    <l n="276">The mountain round it and the sky above,</l>
                    <l n="277">Much more the figures of man, woman, child,</l>
                    <l n="278">These are the frame to? What's it all about?</l>
                    <l n="279">To be passed over, despised? or dwelt upon,</l>
                    <l n="280">Wondered at? oh, this last of course!--you say.</l>
                    <l n="281">But why not do as well as say,--paint these</l>
                    <l n="282">Just as they are, careless what comes of it?</l>
                    <l n="283">God's works--paint any one, and count it crime</l>
                    <l n="284">To let a truth slip. Don't object, "His works</l>
                    <l n="285">Are here already; nature is complete:</l>
                    <l n="286">Suppose you reproduce her--(which you can't)</l>
                    <l n="287">There's no advantage! you must beat her, then."</l>
                    <l n="288">For, don't you mark? we're made so that we love</l>
                    <l n="289">First when we see them painted, things we have passed</l>
                    <l n="290">Perhaps a hundred times nor cared to see;</l>
                    <l n="291">And so they are better, painted--better to us,</l>
                    <l n="292">Which is the same thing. Art was given for that;</l>
                    <l n="293">God uses us to help each other so,</l>
                    <l n="294">Lending our minds out. Have you noticed, now,</l>
                    <l n="295">Your cullion's hanging face? A bit of chalk,</l>
                    <l n="296">And trust me but you should, though! How much more,</l>
                    <l n="297">If I drew higher things with the same truth!</l>
                    <l n="298">That were to take the Prior's pulpit-place,</l>
                    <l n="299">Interpret God to all of you! Oh, oh,</l>
                    <l n="300">It makes me mad to see what men shall do</l>
                    <l n="301">And we in our graves! This world's no blot for us,</l>
                    <l n="302">Nor blank; it means intensely, and means good:</l>
                    <l n="303">To find its meaning is my meat and drink.</l>
                    <l n="304">"Ay, but you don't so instigate to prayer!"</l>
                    <l n="305">Strikes in the Prior: "when your meaning's plain</l>
                    <l n="306">It does not say to folk--remember matins,</l>
                    <l n="307">Or, mind you fast next Friday!" Why, for this</l>
                    <l n="308">What need of art at all? A skull and bones,</l>
                    <l n="309">Two bits of stick nailed crosswise, or, what's best,</l>
                    <l n="310">A bell to chime the hour with, does as well.</l>
                    <l n="311">I painted a Saint Laurence six months since</l>
                    <l n="312">At Prato, splashed the fresco in fine style:</l>
                    <l n="313">"How looks my painting, now the scaffold's down?"</l>
                    <l n="314">I ask a brother: "Hugely," he returns--</l>
                    <l n="315">"Already not one phiz of your three slaves</l>
                    <l n="316">Who turn the Deacon off his toasted side,</l>
                    <l n="317">But's scratched and prodded to our heart's content,</l>
                    <l n="318">The pious people have so eased their own</l>
                    <l n="319">With coming to say prayers there in a rage:</l>
                    <l n="320">We get on fast to see the bricks beneath.</l>
                    <l n="321">Expect another job this time next year,</l>
                    <l n="322">For pity and religion grow i' the crowd--</l>
                    <l n="323">Your painting serves its purpose!" Hang the fools!</l>
                    <l n="324">--That is--you'll not mistake an idle word</l>
                    <l n="325">Spoke in a huff by a poor monk, God wot,</l>
                    <l n="326">Tasting the air this spicy night which turns</l>
                    <l n="327">The unaccustomed head like Chianti wine!</l>
                    <l n="328">Oh, the church knows! don't misreport me, now!</l>
                    <l n="329">It's natural a poor monk out of bounds</l>
                    <l n="330">Should have his apt word to excuse himself:</l>
                    <l n="331">And hearken how I plot to make amends.</l>
                    <l n="332">I have bethought me: I shall paint a piece</l>
                    <l n="333">... There's for you! Give me six months, then go, see</l>
                    <l n="334">Something in Sant' Ambrogio's! Bless the nuns!</l>
                    <l n="335">They want a cast o' my office. I shall paint</l>
                    <l n="336">God in the midst, Madonna and her babe,</l>
                    <l n="337">Ringed by a bowery, flowery angel-brood,</l>
                    <l n="338">Lilies and vestments and white faces, sweet</l>
                    <l n="339">As puff on puff of grated orris-root</l>
                    <l n="340">When ladies crowd to Church at midsummer.</l>
                    <l n="341">And then i' the front, of course a saint or two--</l>
                    <l n="342">Saint John' because he saves the Florentines,</l>
                    <l n="343">Saint Ambrose, who puts down in black and white</l>
                    <l n="344">The convent's friends and gives them a long day,</l>
                    <l n="345">And Job, I must have him there past mistake,</l>
                    <l n="346">The man of Uz (and Us without the z,</l>
                    <l n="347">Painters who need his patience). Well, all these</l>
                    <l n="348">Secured at their devotion, up shall come</l>
                    <l n="349">Out of a corner when you least expect,</l>
                    <l n="350">As one by a dark stair into a great light,</l>
                    <l n="351">Music and talking, who but Lippo! I!--</l>
                    <l n="352">Mazed, motionless, and moonstruck--I'm the man!</l>
                    <l n="353">Back I shrink--what is this I see and hear?</l>
                    <l n="354">I, caught up with my monk's-things by mistake,</l>
                    <l n="355">My old serge gown and rope that goes all round,</l>
                    <l n="356">I, in this presence, this pure company!</l>
                    <l n="357">Where's a hole, where's a corner for escape?</l>
                    <l n="358">Then steps a sweet angelic slip of a thing</l>
                    <l n="359">Forward, puts out a soft palm--"Not so fast!"</l>
                    <l n="360">--Addresses the celestial presence, "nay--</l>
                    <l n="361">He made you and devised you, after all,</l>
                    <l n="362">Though he's none of you! Could Saint John there draw--</l>
                    <l n="363">His camel-hair make up a painting brush?</l>
                    <l n="364">We come to brother Lippo for all that,</l>
                    <l n="365"><hi rend="italic">Iste perfecit opus!</hi> So, all smile--</l>
                    <l n="366">I shuffle sideways with my blushing face</l>
                    <l n="367">Under the cover of a hundred wings</l>
                    <l n="368">Thrown like a spread of kirtles when you're gay</l>
                    <l n="369">And play hot cockles, all the doors being shut,</l>
                    <l n="370">Till, wholly unexpected, in there pops</l>
                    <l n="371">The hothead husband! Thus I scuttle off</l>
                    <l n="372">To some safe bench behind, not letting go</l>

                    <l n="376">And so all's saved for me, and for the church</l>
