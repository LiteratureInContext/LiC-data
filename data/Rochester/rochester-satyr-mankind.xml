                     Wilmot, first earl of Rochester on April 1st, 1647, in Oxfordshire, England. In
                     1658, at age eleven, John Wilmot succeeded his fathers’ Earldom. Just three
                     years later, Wilmot received an M.A. from Wadham College, Oxford. Charles II,
                     King of Great Britain and Ireland at the time, appointed Rochester a tutor to

                     time at court, Wilmot became one of the most famous poets and controversial
                     satirists of the Restoration period. In the collection <hi rend="italic"> The
                        Poems of John Wilmot</hi>, editor Keith Walker notes that Rochester’s
                     raucous lifestyle and many vices--some characteristics of his
                     libertinism--often garnered contempt from the king’s court. Though he was a
                     notable poet, Rochester acted as a patron to many playwrights including John
                     Dryden and John Fletcher. The latter part of the 1670s saw Rochester contribute
                     more seriously to the affairs of the state. On his deathbed, Rochester called
                     upon his close friend, the bishop of Salisbury, Gilbert Burnet, to recant his
                     past libertinism and convert to Christianity. Rochester died on July 26th,
                     1680, in Oxfordshire, at the age of thirty-three. </note></docAuthor></byline>

                  being asked here by a hypothetical clergyman (the "formal band and beard," above).
                  The clergyman describes Rochester's mind as "degen[e]rate," and his way of
                  thinking, deviant. Rochester’s poem is a
                  “Satire against Reason and Mankind”; it is fundamentally skeptical of the
                  ability--or desirability--of reason and law to ameliorate baser human interests. </note>

                  libertinism. Libertinism in the
                  Restoration period was characterized by a vivid, almost nihilistic sexuality. As
                  Jeremy Webster argues in <hi rend="italic">Performing Libertinism in Charles II’s
                     Court</hi>, “[l]ibertines...performed traditionally secretive acts— excessive
                  drinking, carnality, sodomy, sedition, assault, and sacrilege—in the public sphere
                  in a variety of ways” (2). In a brief article for the British Library on Restoration comedy, <ref target="https://www.bl.uk/restoration-18th-century-literature/articles/an-introduction-to-restoration-comedy">Diane Maybank</ref> notes that behind the "wit and sexual escapades" characteristic of the Restoration mode, there is a "deep unease" that
                  scholars have traced both to the disorder that marked the Civil Wars
                  and to the influential views of Thomas Hobbes. In <hi rend="italic">Leviathan</hi> (1651), Hobbes argued
                  that humans are completely driven by the primary drives of appetite and aversion;
                  people are selfish at their root. In the state of nature, which is a state of war,
                  “there is no place for industry...; no account of time, no arts, no letters, no
                  society, and, which is worst of all, continual fear and danger of violent death,
                  and the life of man solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short” (<ref target="https://www.bartleby.com/34/5/13.html">Paragraph 9,
                     Chapter 13, <hi rend="italic">Leviathan</hi></ref>). To avoid this chaotic, violent state of nature and
                  maintain a civilization governed by law rather than desire, human societies
                  contract with strong leaders. However, the libertinism of the court wits, which is
                  characterized by a performative sexuality at odds with the moral and civil codes
                  of liberal contractualism, “disturb[s] the self-evident” Restoration of order
                  heralded by the return of Charles II to the throne (<ref target="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23242168">Tindemans 135</ref>; see also Jeremy
                  Webster, <hi>Performing Libertinism in Charles II’s Court</hi>). In lines 104-105 below, Rochester points out that his libertine "Reason...helps" him "t'enjoy" and "renew[s]" the "Appetites" that the moralist "wou'd destroy."</note>
