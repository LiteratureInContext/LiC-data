                        ><graphic url="/notes/John-Wilmot-2nd-Earl-of-Rochester.jpg"/>John Wilmot,
                     second earl of Rochester, was born to Anne St. John, Countess of Rochester and
                     Henry Wilmot, first earl of Rochester on April 1st, 1647, in Oxfordshire,
                     England. In 1658, at age eleven, John Wilmot succeeded his fathers’ Earldom.
                     Just three years later, Wilmot received an M.A. from Wadham College, Oxford.
                     Charles II, King of Great Britain and Ireland at the time, appointed Rochester
                     a tutor to be mentored by. Rochester and his tutor, Sir Andrew Balfour
                     travelled through France and Italy until 1664 when Rochester returned to
                     Charles’ court. In his time at court, Wilmot became one of the most famous
                     poets and controversial satirists of the Restoration period. In the collection
                        <hi rend="italic"> The Poems of John Wilmot</hi>, editor Keith Walker notes
                     that Rochester’s raucous lifestyle and many vices--some characteristics of his
                     libertinism--often garnered contempt from the king’s court. Though he was a
                     notable poet, Rochester acted as a patron to many playwrights including John
                     Dryden and John Fletcher. The latter part of the 1670s saw Rochester contribute
                     more seriously to the affairs of the state. On his deathbed, Rochester is said
                     to have called upon his close friend, the bishop of Salisbury, Gilbert Burnet,
                     to recant his past libertinism and convert to Christianity. Rochester died on
                     July 26th, 1680, in Oxfordshire, at the age of thirty-three. The image included

                  pleasure that, once enjoyed, brings causes the enjoyer to fear or hate that
                  pleasure. This fear is in part existential or philosophical--pleasure brings with

                  who writes about the performative quality of Restoration libertinism, Rochester's
                  libertinism was a deliberate assertion of privilege designed to cultivate power in

                  poem is a response to the question being asked here by a hypothetical clergyman
                  (the "formal band and beard"). Here, he is performing the persona of the pedantic,
                  prudish curate ultimately to mock him and his moral philosophy, thereby
                  cultivating a witty superiority.</note>

                  >Rochester became identified with philosophical and sexual libertinism of the
                  Restoration, which was characterized by the public, even performative pursuit of
                  pleasure and a vivid, almost nihilistic sexuality. Libertinism was underpinned by
                  a selective reading of Thomas Hobbes' theory of human nature. Hobbes, according to
                  Christopher Tilmouth, "declar[ed] that the passions, not reason, constituted the
                  proper, primary determinants of human conduct" and "posited...a new ideal of
                  happiness, equating felicity with a constant motion of the self from the
                  satisfaction of one appetite to the next, and he accorded fear and the lust for
                  power critical roles in this kinetic process" (<ref
                     target="https://books.google.com/books?id=DipmhwkFfQMC">Tilmouth 4-5</ref>).
                     <ref target="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hobbes-moral">Hobbes</ref>
                  characterized humankind in nature as in a permanent state of conflict and
                  struggle, governed by their appetites and their passions, and to avoid this
                  chaotic, violent state of nature, human societies contract with strong leaders to
                  bring order to passion and law to desire: "it is manifest that, during the time
                  men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, they are in that
                  condition which is called war, and such a war as is of every man against every
                  man" (<hi rend="italic">Leviathan</hi>, XIII, para. 8). Rochester positions his
                  libertinism as a moral freedom beyond the civil codes of contractual law. For more

                  infallibly and always according to the best ends ("the best of all possible
                  worlds"). He wrote several books, including <hi rend="italic">On the Immortality
                     of the Soul</hi>, where he sought to counter the Hobbesian view of life outside
                  of society as "nasty, brutish, and short" and instead to prove "the exsitence of

                  Nature, which connected the material world to the spiritual. Like other Platonists
                  of the 17th century, he believed that the immortality of the soul proved an
                  afterlife, characterized by damnation or salvation. Rochester disagreed with this
