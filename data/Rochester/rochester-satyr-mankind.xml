               <l n="30">Who was so proud, so witty, and so wise:</l>
               <l n="31">Pride drew him in, as Cheats their Bubbles catch,</l>

               <l n="96">And bear a cripled Carcass through the Sky.</l>
               <l n="97">'Tis this exalted Pow'r, whose Business lies</l>

               <l n="99">This made a whimsical Philosopher,</l>
               <l n="100">Before the spacious World his Tub prefer:</l>
               <l n="101">And we have many modern Coxcombs, who</l>
               <l n="102">Retire to think, 'cause they have nought to do.</l>
               <l n="103">But Thoughts were giv'n for Actions Govemen;</l>
               <l n="104">Where Action ceases, Thought's impertinent.</l>
               <l n="105">Our Sphere of Action is Life's Happiness,</l>

               <l n="117">Perversely yours, your Appetite does mock;</l>
               <l n="118">This asks for Food, that answers what's a Clock?</l>

               <l n="120">Tis not true Reason I despise, but yours.</l>
               <l n="121">Thus, I think Reason righted: But for Man,</l>
               <l n="122">I'll ne'er recant, defend him if you can.</l>

               <l n="126">Those Creatures are the wisest, who attain,</l>

               <l n="132">You see how far Man's Wisdom here extends:</l>
               <l n="133">Look next if Human Nature makes amends;</l>
               <l n="134">Whose Principles are most gen'rous and just;</l>
               <l n="135">And to whose Morals you wou'd sooner trust.</l>
               <l n="136">Be Judge your self, I'll bring it to the Test,</l>
               <l n="137">Which is the basest Creature; Man, or Beast:</l>
               <l n="138">Birds feed on Birds, Beasts on each other prey;</l>
               <l n="139">But savage Man alone does Man betray.</l>
               <l n="140">Prest by necessity, <hi rend="italic">They</hi>kill for Food;</l>
               <l n="141">Man undoes Man, to do himself no good.</l>
               <l n="142">With Teeth and Claws by Nature arm'd, <hi rend="italic">They</hi>hunt</l>
               <l n="143">Nature's Allowance, to supply their Want:</l>
               <l n="144">But Man, with Smiles, Embraces, Friendships, Praise,</l>
               <l n="145">Inhumanly his Fellow's Life betrays:</l>
               <l n="146">With voluntary Pains works his Distress;</l>
               <l n="147">Not through Necessity, but Wantonness.</l>
               <l n="148">For Hunger or for Love, <hi rend="italic">They</hi> bite or tear,</l>
               <l n="149">Whilst wretched Man is tsill in Arms for Fear:</l>
               <l n="150">For Fear he arms, and is of Arms afraid;</l>
               <l n="151">From Fear to Fear successively betray'd,</l>
               <l n="152">Base Fear, the Source when his best Passions came,</l>
               <l n="153">His boasted Honour, and his dear-bought Fame:</l>
               <l n="154">The Lust of Pow'r, to which he's such a Slave,</l>
               <l n="155">And for the which alone he dares be brave:</l>
               <l n="156">To which his various Projects are defign'd</l>
               <l n="157">Which makes him generous, affable, and kind:</l>
               <l n="158">For which he takes such Pains to be thought Wise,</l>
               <l n="159">And screws his Actions, in a forc'd Disguise:</l>
               <l n="160">Leads a most tedious Life, in Misery,</l>
               <l n="161">Under laborious, mean, Hypocrisie.</l>
               <l n="162">Look to the Bottom of his vast Design,</l>
               <l n="163">Wherein Man's Wisdom, Pow'r and Glory join,</l>
               <l n="164">The Good he acts, the Ill he does endure,</l>
               <l n="165">'Tis all from Fear, to make himself secure.</l>
               <l n="166">Meerly for Safety, after Fame they thirst;</l>
               <l n="167">For all Men would be Cowards if they durst:</l>
               <l n="168">And Honesty's against all common Sense:</l>
               <l n="169">Men must be Knaves; 'tis in their own Defence,</l>
               <l n="170">Mankind's dishonest; if you think it fair,</l>
               <l n="171">Amongst known Cheats, to play upon the square,</l>
               <l n="172">You'll be undone</l>
               <l n="173">Nor can weak Truth your Reputation save;</l>
               <l n="174">The Knaves will all agree to call you Knave.</l>
               <l n="175">Wrong'd shall he live, insulted o'er, opprest,</l>
               <l n="176">Who dares be less a Villain than the rest.</l>
               <l n="177">Thus here you see what Human Nature craves,</l>
               <l n="178">Most Men are Cowards, all Men should, be Knaves.</l>
               <l n="179">The Difference lies, as far as I can see,</l>
               <l n="180">Not in the Thing it self, but the Degree;</l>
               <l n="181">And all the Subject Matter of Debate,</l>
               <l n="182">Is only who's a Knave of the First Rate.</l>
