               <l n="21">To swim with Bladders of Philosophy:</l>
               <l n="22">In hopes still to o'ertake the skipping Light,</l>
               <l n="23">The Vapour dances in the dazzled Sight,</l>
               <l n="24">Till spent, it leaves him to eternal Night.</l>
               <l n="25">Then old Age, and Experience, hand in hand,</l>
               <l n="26">Lead him to Death, and make him understand,</l> 
               <l n="27">After a Search so painful, and so long,</l>
               <l n="28">That all his Life he has been in the wrong.</l>
               <l n="29">Hudled in Dirt, this reas'ning Engine lies,</l>
               <l n="30">Who was so proud, so witty, and so wise:</l>
               <l n="31">Pride drew him in, as Cheats their Bubbles catch,</l>
               <l n="32">And made him venture to be a Wretch:</l>
               <l n="33">His Wisdom did his Happiness destroy,</l>
               <l n="34">Aiming to know the World he should enjoy.</l>
               <l n="35">And <hi rend="italic">Wit</hi>was his vain, frivolous Pretence,</l>
               <l n="36">Of pleasing others at his own Expence.</l>
               <l n="37">For <hi rend="italic">Wits</hi>are treated just like<hi rend="italic">Common Whores</hi>;</l>
               <l n="38">First they're enjoy'd, and then kick'd out of Doors.</l>
               <l n="39">The Pleasure past, a threat'ning Doubt remains</l>
               <l n="49">That frights th'Enjoyer with succeeding Pains.</l>
               <l n="50"><hi rend="italic">Women</hi>, and<hi rend="italtic">Men of Wit</hi>, are dang'rous Tools,</l>
               <l n="51">And ever fatal to admiring Fools.</l>
               <l n="52">Pleasure allures, and when the Fops escape,</l>
               <l n="53">'Tis not that they're belov'd, but fortunate;</l>
               <l n="54">And therefore what they fear, at Heart they hate.</l>
               <l n="55">But now, methinks, some formal Band and Beard</l>
               <l n="56">Takes me to task; Come on, Sir, I'm prepar'd</l>

               <l n="60">Upon this Point, not to be too severe,</l>
               <l n="61">Perhaps my Muse were fitter for this part:</l>
               <l n="62">For, I profess, I can be very smart</l>
               <l n="63">On <hi rend="italic">Wit</hi>which I abhor with all my Heart</l>
               <l n="64">I long to last it, in some sharp Essay,</l>
               <l n="65">But your grand indiscretion bids me stay,</l>
               <l n="66">And turns my Tide of Ink another way.</l>
               <l n="67">What Rage ferments in your degen'rate Mind,</l>

               <l n="74">To dignify his Nature above Beast.</l>
               <l n="75">Reason, by whose aspiring Influence,</l>
               <l n="76">We take a Flight beyond material Sense,</l>
               <l n="77">Dive into Mysteries, then soaring pierce</l>
               <l n="78">The flaming Limits of the Universe,</l>
               <l n="79">Search Heav'n and Hell, find out what's acted there,</l>
               <l n="80">And give the World true Grounds of Hope and Fear.</l>
