                               Franklin worked on his "life" or "autobiography" over the course of several decades, but did not complete the work before his death in 1790. The manuscript was printed in stages in the course of the first half of the nineteenth century, and did not take the form with which most readers are familiar until about the middle of that period. (It is an interesting story, but a more complicated story one than is worth going into here.) Our text is based on the University of Virginia Library’s Electronic Text Center’s digital edition, created in the 1990s and early 2000s. This digital text was produced from the print edition edited by Charles Eliot and published by P. F. Collier and Son in New York in 1909. The page images are from the original manuscript that is held at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California. The notes were added by faculty and students in the graduate program in English at the University of Virginia.</note>

        <p>TWYFORD, at the <ref target="a0002" corresp="n0002">Bishop of St. Asaph's,</ref><lb/>
            1771.<lb/>	
        </p>
        <p>DEAR <ref target="a0003" corresp="n0003">SON</ref>: I have ever had pleasure in obtaining any little anecdotes of my ancestors. You may remember the inquiries I made among the remains of my relations when you were with me in England, and the journey I undertook for that purpose. Imagining it may be equally agreeable to you to know the circumstances of my life, many of which you are yet unacquainted with, and expecting the enjoyment of a week's uninterrupted leisure in my present country retirement, I sit down to write them for you. To which I have besides some other inducements. Having emerged from the poverty and obscurity in which I was born and bred, to a state of affluence and some degree of reputation in the world, and having gone so far through life with a considerable share of felicity, the conducing means I made use of, which with the blessing of God so well succeeded, my posterity may like to know, as they may find some of them suitable to their own situations, and therefore fit to be imitated.
        </p>
        <p>That felicity, when I reflected on it, has induced me sometimes to say, that were it offered to my choice, I should have no objection to a repetition of the same life from its beginning, <ref target="a0004" corresp="n0004">only asking the advantages authors have in a second edition to correct some faults of the first.</ref> So I might, besides correcting the faults, change some <ref target="a0005" corresp="n0005">sinister</ref> accidents and events of it for others more favorable. But though this were denied, I should still accept the offer. Since such a repetition is not to be expected, the next thing most like living one's life over again seems to be a recollection of that life, and to make that recollection as durable as possible by putting it down in writing.
            
        </p><p>Hereby, too, I shall indulge the inclination so natural in old men, to be talking of themselves and their own past actions; and I shall indulge it without being tiresome to others, who, through respect to age, might conceive themselves obliged to give me a hearing, since this may be read or not as any one pleases. And, lastly (I may as well confess it, since my denial of it will be believed by nobody), perhaps I shall a good deal gratify my own vanity. Indeed, I scarce ever heard or saw the introductory words,<hi rend="italic">"Without vanity I may say,"</hi> &amp;c., but some vain thing immediately followed. Most people dislike vanity in others, whatever share theyhave of it themselves; but I give it fair quarter wherever I meet with it, being persuaded that it is often productive of good to the possessor, and to others that are within his sphere of action; and therefore, in many cases, it would not be altogether absurd if a man were to thank God for his vanity among the other comforts of life.
        </p>
        <p>And now I speak of thanking God, I desire with all humility to acknowledge that I owe the mentioned happiness of my past life to His kind providence, which lead me to the means I used and gave them success. My belief of this induces me to <hi rend="italic">hope,</hi> though I must not <hi rend="italic">presume,</hi> that the same goodness will still be exercised toward me, in continuing that happiness, or enabling me to bear a fatal reverse, which I may experience as others have done: the complexion of my future fortune being known to Him only in whose power it is to bless to us even our afflictions.
        </p>
        <p>The notes one of my uncles (who had the same kind of curiosity in collecting family anecdotes) once put into my hands, furnished me with several particulars relating to our ancestors. From these notes I learned that the family had lived in the same village, Ecton, in Northamptonshire, for three hundred years, and how much longer he knew not (perhaps from the time when the name of <ref target="a0006" corresp="n0006">Franklin</ref>, that before was the name of an order of people, was assumed by them as a surname when others took surnames all over the kingdom), on a <ref target="a0007" corresp="n0007">freehold</ref> of about thirty acres, aided by the smith's business, which had continued in the family till his time, the eldest son being always bred to that business; a custom which he and my father followed as to their eldest sons. When I searched the registers at Ecton, I found an account of their births, marriages and burials from the year 1555 only, there being no registers kept in that parish at any time preceding. By that register I perceived that I was the youngest son of the youngest son for five generations back. My grandfather Thomas, who was born in 1598, lived at Ecton till he grew too old to follow business longer, when he went to live with his son John, a dyer at Banbury, in Oxfordshire, with whom my father served an apprenticeship. There my grandfather 
            <pb n="2" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p2.jpg"/>
            died and lies buried. We saw his gravestone in 1758. His eldest son Thomas lived in the house at Ecton, and left it with the land to his only child, a daughter, who, with her husband, one Fisher, of Wellingborough, sold it to Mr. Isted, now lord of the manor there. My grandfather had four sons that grew up, viz.: Thomas, John, Benjamin and Josiah.  I will give you what account I can of them, at this distance from my papers, and if these are not lost in my absence, you will among them find many more particulars.
        </p>
    <p>Thomas was bred a smith under his father; but, being ingenious, and encouraged in learning (as all my brothers were) by an Esquire Palmer, then the principal gentleman in that parish, he qualified himself for the business of <ref target="a0008" corresp="n0008">scrivener</ref>; became a considerable man in the county; was a chief mover of all public-spirited undertakings for the county or town of Northampton, and his own village, of which many instances were related of him; and much taken notice of and patronized by the then Lord Halifax. <ref target="a0009" corresp="n0009">He died in 1702, January 6, old style, just four years to a day before I was born.</ref>  The account we received of his life and character from some old people at Ecton, I remember, struck you as something extraordinary, from its similarity to what you knew of mine.
        </p>
        <p>"Had he died on the same day," you said, "one might have supposed a transmigration."
        </p>
        <p>John was bred a dyer, I believe of woolens. Benjamin was bred a silk dyer, serving an apprenticeship at London. 
            <pb n="3" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p3.jpg"/>
            
            He was an ingenious man.  I remember him well, for when I was a boy he came over to my father in Boston, and lived in the house with us some years. He lived to a great age. His grandson, Samuel Franklin, now lives in Boston. He left behind him two quarto volumes, <ref target="a0010" corresp="n0010">MS.</ref>, of his own poetry, consisting of little occasional pieces addressed to his friends and relations, of which the following, sent to me, is a specimen.

           He had formed a short-hand of his own, which he taught me, but, never practising it, I have now forgot it. I was named after this uncle, there being a particular affection between him and my father. He was very pious, a great attender of sermons of the best preachers, which he took down in his short-hand, and had with him many volumes of them. He was also much of a politician; too much, perhaps, for his station. There fell lately into my hands, in London, a collection he had made of all the principal pamphlets, relating to public affairs, from 1641 to 1717; many of the volumes are wanting as appears by the numbering, but there still remain <ref target="a0011" corresp="n0011">eight volumes in folio, and twenty-four in quarto and in octavo.</ref> A dealer in old books met with them, and knowing me by my sometimes buying of him, he brought them to me. It seems my uncle must have left them here, when he went to America, which was about fifty years since. There are many of his notes in the margins.
        </p>
       <p>This obscure family of ours was early in the Reformation, and continued Protestants through the reign 
           <pb n="4" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p4.jpg"/>
           
           of Queen Mary, when they were sometimes in danger of trouble on account of their zeal <ref target="a0012" corresp="n0012">against popery</ref>. They had got an <ref target="a0013" corresp="n0013">English Bible</ref>, and to conceal and secure it, it was fastened open with tapes under and within the cover of a joint-stool. When my great-great-grandfather read it to his family, he turned up the joint-stool upon his knees, turning over the leaves then under the tapes. One of the children stood at the door to give notice if he saw the apparitor coming, who was an officer of the spiritual court. In that case the stool was turned down again upon its feet, when the Bible remained concealed under it as before. This anecdote I had from my uncle Benjamin. The family continued all of the Church of England till about the end of Charles the Second's reign, when some of the ministers that had been <ref target="a0014" corresp="n0014">outed for non-conformity holding conventicles</ref> in Northamptonshire, Benjamin and Josiah adhered to them, and so continued all their lives: the rest of the family remained with the Episcopal Church.
        </p>
        <p>Josiah, my father, married young, and carried his wife with three children into New England, about 1682. The conventicles having been forbidden by law, and frequently disturbed, induced some considerable men of his acquaintance to remove to that country, and he was prevailed with to accompany them thither, where they expected to enjoy their mode of religion with freedom. By the same wife he had four children more born there, and by a second 
            <pb n="5" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p5.jpg"/>
            wife ten more, in all seventeen; of which I remember thirteen sitting at one time at his table, who all grew up to be men and women, and married; I was the youngest son, and the youngest child but two, and was born in Boston, New England. My mother, the second wife, was Abiah Folger, daughter of <ref target="a0015" corresp="n0015">Peter Folger</ref>, one of the first settlers of New England, of whom honorable mention is made by <ref target="a0016" corresp="n0016">Cotton Mather</ref> in his church history of that country, entitled Magnalia Christi Americana, as <hi rend="italic">"a godly, learned Englishman,"</hi> if I remember the words rightly.  I have heard that he wrote sundry small occasional pieces, but only one of them was printed, which I saw now many years since. It was written in 1675, in the home-spun verse of that time and people, and addressed to those then concerned in the government there. It was in favor of liberty of conscience, and in behalf of the Baptists, Quakers, and other sectaries that had been under persecution, ascribing the Indian wars, and other distresses that had befallen the country, to that persecution, as so many judgments of God to punish so heinous an offense, and exhorting a repeal of those uncharitable laws.
            
            The whole appeared to me as written with a good deal of decent plainness and manly freedom.  The six concluding lines I remember, though I have forgotten the two first of the stanza; but the purport of them was, that his censures proceeded from good-will, and, therefore, he would be known to be the author.

I was put to the grammar-school at eight years of age, my father intending to devote me, as the tithe of his sons, to the service of the Church.</ref> My early readiness in learning to read (which must have been very early, as I do not remember when I could not read), and the opinion of all his friends, that I should certainly make a good scholar, encouraged him in this purpose of his.  My uncle Benjamin, too, approved of it, and proposed to give me all his short-hand volumes of sermons, I suppose as a stock to set up with, if I would learn his character.  I continued, however, at the grammar-school not quite one year, though in that time I had risen gradually from the middle of the class of that year to be the head of it, and farther was removed into the next class above it, in order to go with that into the third at the end of the year. But my father, in the meantime, from a view of the expense of a college education, which having so large a family he could not well afford, and the mean living many so educated were afterwards able to obtain reasons that be gave to his friends in my hearing altered his first intention, took me from the grammar-school, and sent me to a school for writing and arithmetic, kept by a then famous man, <ref target="a0018" corresp="n0018">Mr. George Brownell</ref>, very successful in his

       profession generally, and that by mild, encouraging methods. Under him I acquired fair writing pretty soon, but I failed in the arithmetic, and made no progress in it. At ten years old I was taken home to assist my father in his business, which was that of a tallow-chandler and sope-boiler; a business he was not bred to, but had assumed on his arrival in New England, and on finding his dying trade would not maintain his family, being in little request. Accordingly, I was employed in cutting wick for the candles, filling the dipping mold and the molds for cast candles, attending the shop, going of errands, etc.

        <p>There was a salt-marsh that bounded part of the mill-pond, on the edge of which, at high water, we used to stand to fish for minnows.  By much trampling, we had made it a mere quagmire.  My proposal was to build a wharff there fit for us to stand upon, and I showed my comrades a large heap of stones, which were intended for a new house near the marsh, and which would very well suit

The next morning the workmen were surprised at missing the stones, which were found in our wharff.  Inquiry was made after the removers; we were discovered and complained of; several of us were corrected by our fathers; and though I pleaded the usefulness of the work, mine convinced me that nothing was useful which was not honest.
        </p><p>I think you may like to know something of his person and character.  He had an excellent constitution of body, was of middle stature, but well set, and very strong; he was ingenious, could draw prettily, was skilled a little in music, and had a clear pleasing voice, so that when he played psalm tunes on his violin and sung withal, as he sometimes did in an evening after the business of the day was over, it was extremely agreeable to hear.  He had a mechanical genius too, and, on occasion, was very handy in the use of other tradesmen's tools; but his great excellence lay in a sound understanding and solid judgment in prudential matters, both in private and publick affairs.  In the latter, indeed, he was never employed, the numerous family he had to educate and the straitness of his circumstances keeping him close to his trade; but I remember well his being frequently visited by leading people, who consulted him for his opinion in affairs of the town or of the church he belonged to, and showed a good deal of respect for his judgment 
       <pb n="8" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p8.jpg"/>
       and advice: he was also much consulted by private persons about their affairs when any difficulty occurred, and frequently chosen an arbitrator between contending parties.
        </p><p>At his table he liked to have, as often as he could, some sensible friend or neighbor to converse with, and always took care to start some ingenious or useful topic for discourse, which might tend to improve the minds of his children.  By this means he turned our attention to what was good, just, and prudent in the conduct of life; and little or no notice was ever taken of what related to the victuals on the table, whether it was well or ill dressed, in or out of season, of good or bad flavor, preferable or inferior to this or that other thing of the kind, so that I was bro't up in such a perfect inattention to those matters as to be quite indifferent what kind of food was set before me, and so unobservant of it, that to this day if I am asked I can scarce tell a few hours after dinner what I dined upon.  This has been a convenience to me in travelling, where my companions have been sometimes very unhappy for want of a suitable gratification of their more delicate, because better instructed, tastes and appetites.

I never knew either my father or mother to have any sickness but that of which they dy'd, he at 89, and she at 85 years of age. They lie buried together at Boston, where I some years since placed a marble over their grave, with this inscription:

        </p><p>To return: I continued thus employed in my father's business for two years, that is, till I was twelve years old; and my brother John, who was bred to that business, having left my father, married, and set up for himself at Rhode Island, there was all appearance that I was destined to supply his place, and become a tallow-chandler.  But my dislike to the trade continuing, my father was under apprehensions that if he did not find one for me more agreeable, I should break away and get to sea, as his son Josiah had done, to his great vexation.  He therefore sometimes took me to walk with him, and see joiners, bricklayers, turners, braziers, etc., at their work, that he might observe my inclination, and endeavor to fix it on some trade or other on land.  It has ever since been a pleasure to me to see good workmen handle their tools; and it has been useful to me, having learnt so much by it as to be able to do little jobs myself in my house when a workman could not readily be got, and to construct little machines <pb n="10" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p10.jpg"/>for my experiments, while the intention of making the experiment was fresh and warm in my mind.  My father at last fixed upon the cutler's trade, and my uncle Benjamin's son Samuel, who was bred to that business in London, being about that time established in Boston, I was sent to be with him some time on liking.  But his expectations of a fee with me displeasing my father, I was taken home again.

            
        </p><p>From a child I was fond of reading, and all the little money that came into my hands was ever laid out in books. Pleased with the Pilgrim's Progress, my first collection was of John Bunyan's works in separate little volumes.  I afterward sold them to enable me to buy <ref target="a0021" corresp="n0021">R. Burton's Historical Collections</ref>; they were small chapmen's books, and cheap, 40 or 50 in all.  My father's little library consisted chiefly of books in polemic divinity, most of which I read, and have since often regretted that, at a time when I had such a thirst for knowledge, more proper books had not fallen in my way since it was now resolved I should not be a clergyman.  Plutarch's Lives there was in which I read abundantly, and I still think that time spent to great advantage. There was also a book of De Foe's, called an <ref target="a0022" corresp="n0022">Essay on Projects</ref>, and another of Dr. Mather's, called <ref target="a0023" corresp="n0023">Essays to do Good</ref>, which perhaps gave me a turn of thinking that had an influence on some of the principal future events of my life.
            
        </p><p>This bookish inclination at length determined my father to make me a printer, though he had already one son (James) of that profession.  In 1717 my brother James returned from England with a press and letters to set up his business in Boston.  I liked it much better than that of my father, but still

            had a hankering for the sea.  To prevent the apprehended effect of such an inclination, my father was impatient to have me bound to my brother.  I stood out some time, but at last was persuaded, and signed the indentures when I was yet but twelve years old.  I was to serve as an apprentice till I was <ref target="a0024" corresp="n0024">twenty-one years of age</ref>, only I was to be allowed journeyman's wages during the last year.  In a little time I made great proficiency in the business, and became a useful hand to my brother.  I now had access to better books.  An acquaintance with the apprentices of booksellers enabled me sometimes to borrow a small one, which I was careful to return soon and clean. Often I sat up in my room reading the greatest part of the night, when the book was borrowed in the evening and to be returned early in the morning, lest it should be missed or wanted.
        </p>
       <p>And after some time an ingenious tradesman, Mr. Matthew Adams, who had a pretty collection of books, and who frequented our printing-house, took notice of me, invited me to his library, and very kindly lent me such books as I chose to read.  I now took a fancy to poetry, and made some little pieces; my brother, thinking it might turn to account, encouraged me, and put me on composing occasional ballads. One was called <hi rend="italic">The Lighthouse Tragedy,</hi> and contained an account of the drowning of Captain Worthilake, with his two daughters: the other was a sailor's song, on the taking of <hi rend="italic">Teach</hi> (or Blackbeard) the pirate.<ref target="a0025" corresp="n0025">They were wretched stuff</ref>, in the Grub-street-ballad style; and when they were printed he sent me about the town to sell them. The first sold wonderfully, the event being recent, having made a great noise.  This flattered my vanity; but my father discouraged me by ridiculing my performances, and telling me verse-makers were generally beggars.  So I escaped being a poet, most probably a very bad one; but as prose writing bad been of great use to me in the course of my life, and was a principal means of my advancement, 

           <pb n="12" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p12.jpg"/>
           I shall tell you how, in such a situation, I acquired what little ability I have in that way.
       </p>
       <p>There was another bookish lad in the town, John Collins by name, with whom I was intimately acquainted.  We sometimes disputed, and very fond we were of argument, and very desirous of confuting one another, which disputatious turn, by the way, is apt to become a very bad habit, making people often extremely disagreeable in company by the contradiction that is necessary to bring it into practice; and thence, besides souring and spoiling the conversation, is productive of disgusts and, perhaps enmities where you may have occasion for friendship.  I had caught it by reading my father's books of dispute about religion.  Persons of good sense, I have since observed, seldom fall into it, except lawyers, university men, and men of all sorts that have been bred at Edinborough.
           
       </p><p>A question was once, somehow or other, started between Collins and me, of the propriety of educating the female sex, and their abilities for study.  He was of opinion that it was improper, and that they were naturally unequal to it.  I took the contrary side, perhaps a little for dispute's sake.  He was naturally more eloquent, had a ready plenty of words; and sometimes, as I thought, bore me down more by his fluency than by the strength of his reasons. As we parted without settling the point, and were not to see 
           <pb n="13" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p13.jpg"/>
           one another again for some time, I sat down to put my arguments in writing, which I copied fair and sent to him. He answered, and I replied.  Three or four letters of a side had passed, when my father happened to find my papers and read them.  Without entering into the discussion, he took occasion to talk to me about the manner of my writing; observed that, though I had the advantage of my antagonist in correct spelling and  <ref target="a0026" corresp="n0026">pointing</ref> (which I ow'd to the printing-house), I fell far short in elegance of expression, in method and in perspicuity, of which he convinced me by several instances.  I saw the justice of his remark, and thence grew more attentive to the manner in writing, and determined to endeavor at improvement.
           
       </p><p>About this time I met with an odd volume of the <ref target="a0027" corresp="n0027"><hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi></ref>. It was <ref target="a0028" corresp="n0028">the third</ref>. I had never before seen any of them.  I bought it, read it over and over, and was much delighted with it.  I thought the writing excellent, and wished, if possible, to imitate it.  With this view I took some of the papers, and, making short hints of the sentiment in each sentence, laid them by a few days, and then, without looking at the book, try'd to compleat the papers again, by expressing each hinted sentiment at length, and as fully as it had been expressed before, in any suitable words that should come to hand.  Then I compared my <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> with the original, discovered some of my faults, and corrected them. But I found I wanted a stock of words, or a readiness in recollecting and using them, which I thought I should have acquired before that time if I had gone on making verses; since the continual occasion for words of the same import, but of different length, to suit the measure, or of different sound for the rhyme, would have laid me under a constant necessity of searching for variety, and also 
           <pb n="14" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p14.jpg"/>
           have tended to fix that variety in my mind, and make me master of it. Therefore I took some of the tales and turned them into verse; and, after a time, when I had pretty well forgotten the prose, turned them back again.  I also sometimes jumbled my collections of hints into confusion, and after some weeks endeavored to reduce them into the best order, before I began to form the full sentences and compleat the paper.  This was to teach me method in the arrangement of thoughts.  By comparing my work afterwards with the original, I discovered many faults and amended them; but I sometimes had the pleasure of fancying that, in certain particulars of small import, I had been lucky enough to improve the method or the language, and this encouraged me to think I might possibly in time come to be a tolerable English writer, of which I was extremely ambitious.  My time for these exercises and for reading was at night, after work or before it began in the morning, or on Sundays, when I contrived to be in the printing-house alone, evading as much as I could the common attendance on public worship which my father used to exact on me when I was under his care, and which indeed I still thought a duty, though I could not, as it seemed to me, afford time to practise it.
           
       </p><p>When about 16 years of age I happened to meet with a book, written by one Tryon, recommending <ref target="a0029" corresp="n0029">a vegetable diet</ref>. I determined to go into it.  My brother, being 
           <pb n="15" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p15.jpg"/>
           yet unmarried, did not keep house, but boarded himself and his apprentices in another family.  My refusing to eat flesh occasioned an inconveniency, and I was frequently chid for my singularity. I made myself acquainted with Tryon's manner of preparing some of his dishes, such as boiling potatoes or rice, making  <ref target="a0030" corresp="n0030">hasty pudding</ref>, and a few others, and then proposed to my brother, that if he would give me, weekly, half the money he paid for my board, I would board myself.  He instantly agreed to it, and I presently found that I could save half what he paid me.  This was an additional fund for buying books.  But I had another advantage in it.  My brother and the rest going from the printing-house to their meals, I remained there alone, and, despatching presently my light repast, which often was no more than a bisket or a slice of bread, a handful of raisins or a tart from the pastry-cook's, and a glass of water, had the rest of the time till their return for study, in which I made the greater progress, from that greater clearness of head and quicker apprehension which usually attend temperance in eating and drinking.
           
       </p><p>And now it was that, being on some occasion made asham'd of my ignorance in figures, which I had twice failed in learning when at school, I took <ref target="a0031" corresp="n0031">Cocker's book of Arithmetick</ref>, and went through the whole by myself with great ease.  I also read <ref target="a0032" corresp="n0032">Seller's and Shermy's books of Navigation</ref>, and became acquainted with the little geometry they contain; but never proceeded far in that science.  And I read about this time <ref target="s0033" corresp="n0033">Locke <hi rend="italic">On Human Understanding,</hi></ref> and <ref target="a0034" corresp="n0034">the <hi rend="italic">Art of Thinking,</hi> by Messrs. du Port Royal</ref>.
           
       </p><p>While I was intent on improving 
           <pb n="16" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p16.jpg"/>
           my language, I met with an English grammar (I think it was <ref target="a0035" corresp="n0035">Greenwood's)</ref>, at the end of which there were two little sketches of the arts of rhetoric and logic, the latter finishing with a specimen of a dispute in the Socratic method; and soon after I procur'd <ref target="a036" corresp="n0036">Xenophon's Memorable Things of Socrates</ref>, wherein there are many instances of the same method.  I was charm'd with it, adopted it, dropt my abrupt contradiction and positive argumentation, and put on the humble inquirer and doubter. And being then, from reading <ref target="a0037" corresp="n0037">Shaftesbury and Collins</ref>, become a real doubter in many points of our religious doctrine, I found this method safest for myself and very embarrassing to those against whom I used it; therefore I took a delight in it, practis'd it continually, and grew very artful and expert in drawing people, even of superior knowledge, into concessions, the consequences of which they did not foresee, entangling them in difficulties out of which they could not extricate themselves, and so obtaining victories that neither myself nor my cause always deserved.  I continu'd this method some few years, but gradually left it, retaining only the habit of expressing myself in terms of modest diffidence; never using, when I advanced any thing that may possibly be disputed, the words <hi rend="italic">certainly, undoubtedly,</hi> or any others that give the air of positiveness to an opinion; but rather say, I conceive or apprehend a thing to be so and so; it appears to me, or 
           
           <pb n="17" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p17.jpg"/>
           <hi rend="italic">I should think it so or so,</hi> for such and such reasons; or,<hi rend="italics">I imagine it to be so;</hi> or <hi rend="italic">it is so, if I am not mistaken</hi>.  This habit, I believe, has been of great advantage to me when I have had occasion to inculcate my opinions, and persuade men into measures that I have been from time to time engag'd in promoting; and, as the chief ends of conversation are to <hi rend="italics">inform</hi> or to be <hi rend="italics">informed,</hi> to <hi rend="italic">please</hi> or to <hi rend="italic">persuade,</hi> I wish well-meaning, sensible men would not lessen their power of doing good by a positive, assuming manner, that seldom fails to disgust, tends to create opposition, and to defeat every one of those purposes for which speech was given to us, to wit, giving or receiving information or pleasure.  For, if you would inform, a positive and dogmatical manner in advancing your sentiments may provoke contradiction and prevent a candid attention.  If you wish information and improvement from the knowledge of others, and yet at the same time express yourself as firmly fix'd in your present opinions, modest, sensible men, who do not love disputation, will probably leave you undisturbed in the possession of your error.  And by such a manner, you can seldom hope to recommend yourself in pleasing your hearers, or to persuade those whose concurrence you desire.<ref target="a0038" corresp="n0038">Pope says, judiciously</ref>:

   <p>Men should be taught as if you taught them not,
   And things unknown propos'd as things forgot,</p>

   <p> farther recommending it to us,</p>
       <p>To speak tho' sure, with seeming Diffidence.       
   </p>
      <p> And he might have coupled with this line that which he has coupled with another, I think, less properly,
       <lg type="line"><l> <hi rend="italics">"For want of modesty is want of sense."</hi></l></lg>
       If you ask, Why less properly? I must repeat the lines,

           <l><hi rend="italics">For want of modesty is want of sense."</hi></l></lg></q>
Now, is not <hi rend="italics">want of sense</hi> (where a man is so unfortunate as to want it) some apology for his <hi rend="italic">want of modesty?</hi> and would not the lines stand more justly thus?
       
     
       <q><lg type="stanza"><l>"Immodest words admit <hi rend="italic">but</hi> this defense,</l>
           <l>That want of modesty is want of sense."</l></lg></q>
       This, however, I should submit to better judgments.</p>
       <p>My brother had, in 1720 or 1721, begun to print a newspaper.
           It was the second that appeared in America, and was called <ref target="a0039" corresp="n0039"><hi rend="italics">The New England Courant</hi>. The only one before it was <hi rend="italics">The Boston News-Letter</hi></ref>.  I remember his being dissuaded by some of his friends from the undertaking, as not likely to succeed, one newspaper being, in their judgment, enough for America. At this time (1771) there are not less than five-and-twenty.  He went on, however, with the undertaking, and after having worked in composing the types and printing off the sheets, I was employed to carry the papers thro' the streets to the customers.</p>
       
<p>He had some ingenious men among his friends, who amus'd themselves by writing little pieces for this paper, which gain'd it credit and made it more in demand, and these gentlemen often visited us.  Hearing their conversations, and their accounts of the approbation their papers were received with, 
    
    <pb n="19" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p19.jpg"/>
    
I was excited to try my hand among them; but, being still a boy, and suspecting that my brother would object to printing anything of mine in his paper if he knew it to be mine, I contrived to disguise my hand, and, <ref target="a0040" corresp="n0040">writing an anonymous paper</ref>, I put it in at night under the door of the printing-house.  It was found in the morning, and communicated to his writing friends when they call'd in as usual.  They read it, commented on it in my hearing, and I had the exquisite pleasure of finding it met with their approbation, and that, in their different guesses at the author, none were named but men of some character among us for learning and ingenuity.  I suppose now that I was rather lucky in my judges, and that perhaps they were not really so very good ones as I then esteem'd them.</p>
          
       <p>Encourag'd, however, by this, I wrote and convey'd in the same way to the press several more papers which were equally approv'd; and I kept my secret till my small fund of sense for such performances was pretty well exhausted and then I discovered it, when I began to be considered a little more by my brother's acquaintance, and in a manner that did not quite please him, as he thought, probably with reason, that it tended to make me too vain.  And, perhaps, this might be one occasion of the differences that we began to have about this time.  Though a brother, he considered himself as my master, and me as his apprentice, and accordingly, expected 
           <pb n="20" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p20.jpg"/>
           
the same services from me as he would from another, while I thought he demean'd me too much in some he requir'd of me, who from a brother expected more indulgence.  Our disputes were often brought before our father, and I fancy I was either generally in the right, or else a better pleader, because the judgment was generally in my favor.  But my brother was passionate, and had often beaten me, which I took extreamly amiss; and, thinking my apprenticeship very tedious, I was continually wishing for some opportunity of shortening it, which at length offered in a manner unexpected.</p>
       
       <p>One of the Pieces in our Newspaper on some political point, which I have now forgotten, gave offense to the Assembly. He was taken up, censur'd, and imprison'd for a month, by the speaker's warrant, I suppose, because he would not discover his author. I too was taken up and examin'd before the council; but, tho' I did not give them any satisfaction, they content'd themselves with admonishing me, and dismissed me, considering me, perhaps, as an apprentice, who was bound to keep his master's secrets.</p>
       
      <p>During my brother's confinement, which I resented a good deal, notwithstanding our private differences, I had the management of the paper; and I made bold to give our rulers some rubs in it, which my brother took very kindly,while others began to consider me in an unfavorable 
          
          <pb n="21" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p21.jpg"/>
          
light, as a young genius that had a turn for libelling and satyr. My brother's discharge was accompany'd with an order of the House (a very odd one), that <hi rend="italic">"James Franklin should no longer print the paper called the New England Courant."</hi>
       </p>
       <p>There was a consultation held in our printing-house among his friends, what he should do in this case.  Some proposed to evade the order by changing the name of the paper; but my brother, seeing inconveniences in that, it was finally concluded on as a better way, to let it be printed for the future under the name of <hi rend="italics">Benjamin Franklin</hi>; and to avoid the censure of the Assembly, that might fall on him as still printing it by his apprentice, the contrivance was that my old indenture should be return'd to me, with a full discharge on the back of it, to be shown on occasion, but to secure to him the benefit of my service, I was to sign new indentures for the remainder of the term, which were to be kept private.  A very flimsy scheme it was; however, it was immediately executed, and the paper went on accordingly, under my name for several months.
       </p>
       <p>At length, a fresh difference arising between my brother  and me, I took upon me to assert my freedom, presuming that he would not venture to produce the new indentures. It was not fair in me to take this 
           
           <pb n="22" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p22.jpg"/>
           
advantage, and this I therefore reckon one of the first errata of my life; but the unfairness of it weighed little with me, when under the impressions of resentment for the blows his passion too often urged him to bestow upon me, though he was otherwise not an ill-natur'd man: perhaps I was too saucy and provoking.
       </p>  
 <p>When he found I would leave him, he took care to preveny my getting employment in any other printing-house ofthe town, by going round and speaking to every master, who accordingly refus'd to give me work. I then thought of going to New York, as the nearest place where there was a printer; and I was rather inclin'd to leave Boston when I reflected that I had already made myself a little obnoxious to the governing party, and, from the arbitrary proceedings of the Assembly in my brother's case, it was likely I might, if I stay'd, soon bring myself into scrapes; and farther, that my indiscrete disputations about religion began to make me pointed at with horror by good people as an infidel or atheist.  I determin'd on the point, but my father now siding with my brother, I was sensible that, if I attempted to go openly, means would be used to prevent me. My friend Collins, therefore, undertook to manage a little for me.  He agreed with the captain of a New York sloop for my passage, under the notion of my being a young acquaintance of his, that had got a naughty girl with child, whose friends would compel me to marry her, and therefore I could not appear or come away publicly.</p>

<p>So I sold some of my books to raise a little money, was taken on board, and as we had a fair wind, in three days I found myself in New York, near 300 miles from home, a boy of but 17, but without the least recommendation, or knowledge of any person in the place, and with very little money in my pocket.
 </p>
       <pb n="23" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p23.jpg"/>
       
       <p>My inclinations for the sea were by this time worne out, or I might now have gratify'd them. But, having a trade, and supposing myself a pretty good workman, I offer'd my service to the printer in the place, old <ref target="a0041" corresp="n0041">Mr. William Bradford</ref>, who had been the first printer in Pennsylvania, but removed from thence upon the quarrel of George Keith.  He could give me no employment, having little to do, and help enough already; but says he, "My son at Philadelphia has lately lost his principal hand, Aquila Rose, by death; if you go thither, I believe he may employ you." Philadelphia was a hundred miles further; I set out, however, in a boat for <ref target="a0042" corresp="n0042">Amboy</ref>, leaving my chest and other things to follow me round by sea.
       </p>
       <p>In crossing the bay, we met with a squall that tore our rotten sails to pieces, prevented our getting into the <ref target="a0043" corresp="n0043">Kill</ref> and drove us upon Long Island. In our way, a drunken Dutchman, who was a passenger too, fell overboard; when he was sinking, I reached through the water to his <ref target="a0044" corresp="n0044">shock pate</ref>, and drew him up, so that we got him in again.  His ducking sobered him a little, and he went to sleep, taking first out of his pocket a book, which he desir'd I would dry for him. It proved to be my old favorite author, Bunyan's <hi rend="italic">Pilgrim's Progress</hi>, in Dutch, finely printed on good paper, with <ref target="a0045" corresp="n0045">copper cuts</ref>, a dress better than I had ever 
           <pb n="24" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p24.jpg"/>
           
           seen it wear in its own language. I have since found that it has been translated into most of the languages of Europe, and suppose it has been more generally read than any other book, except perhaps the Bible.  Honest John was the first that I know of who mix'd narration and dialogue; a method of writing very engaging to the reader, who in the most interesting parts finds himself, as it were, brought into the company and present at the discourse. <ref target="a0046" corresp="n0046">De Foe in his Cruso, his Moll Flanders, Religious Courtship, Family Instructor, and other pieces, has imitated it with success</ref>;and <ref target="a0047" corresp="n0047">Richardson has done the same, in his Pamela, etc.</ref>
       </p>
       <p>When we drew near the island, we found it was at a place where there could be no landing, there being a great surff on the stony beach.  So we dropt anchor, and swung round towards the shore. Some people came down to the water edge and hallow'd to us, as we did to them; but the wind was so high, and the surff so loud, that we could nothear so as to understand each other. There were canoes on the shore, and we made signs, and hallow'd that they should fetch us; but they either did not understand us, or thought it impracticable, so they went away, 
           <pb n="25" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p25.jpg"/>
           and night coming on, we had no remedy but to wait till the wind should abate; and, in the meantime, the boatman and I concluded to sleep, if we could; and so crowded into the scuttle, with the Dutchman, who was still wet, and the spray beating over the head of our boat, leak'd thro' to us, so that we were soon almost as wet as he. In this manner we lay all night, with very little rest; but, the wind abating the next day, we made a shift to reach Amboy before night, having been thirty hours on the water, without victuals, or any drink but a bottle of filthy rum, and the water we sail'd on being salt.
       </p>
       <p>In the evening I found myself very feverish, and went in to bed; but, having read somewhere that cold water drank plentifully was good for a fever, I follow'd the prescription, sweat plentiful most of the night, my fever left me, and in the morning, crossing the ferry, I proceeded on my journey on foot, having fifty miles to Burlington, where I was told I should find boats that would carry me the rest of the way to Philadelphia.
          </p>
       <p>It rained very hard all the day; I was thoroughly soak'd, and by noon a good deal tired; so I stopt at a poor 
           <pb n="26" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p26.jpg"/>
           inn, where I staid all night, beginning now to wish that I had never left home.  I cut so miserable a figure, too, that I found, by the questions ask'd me, I was suspected to be some runaway servant, and in danger of being taken up on that suspicion.  However, I proceeded the next day, and got in the evening  to an inn, within eight or ten milesn of Burlington, kept by one Dr. Brown.  He entered into conversation with me while I took some refreshment, and, finding I had read a little, became very sociable and friendly. Our acquaintance continu'd as long as he liv'd. He had been, I imagine, an <ref target="a0048" corresp="n0048">itinerant</ref> doctor, for there was no town in England, or country in Europe, of which he could not give a very particular account. He had some letters, and was ingenious, but much of an unbeliever, and <ref target="a0049" corresp="n0049">wickedly undertook, some years after, to travestie the Bible in doggrel verse as Cotton had done Virgil</ref>.  By this means he set many of the facts in a very ridiculous light, and might have hurt weak minds if his work had been published; but it never was.
       </p>
       <p>At his house I lay that night, and the next morning reach'd Burlington, but had the mortification to find that the regular boats<pb n="27" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p27.jpg"/> were gone a little before my coming, and no other expected to go before Tuesday, this being Saturday; wherefore I returned to an old woman in the town, of whom I had bought gingerbread to eat on the water, and ask'd her advice.  She invited me to lodge at her house till a passage by water should offer; and being tired with my foot travelling, I accepted the invitation.  She understanding I was a printer, would have had me stay at that town and follow my business, being ignorant of the stock necessary to begin with.  She was very hospitable, gave me a dinner of ox-cheek with great good will, accepting only a pot of ale in return; and I thought myself fixed till Tuesday should come.  However, walking in the evening by the side of the river, a boat came by, which I found was going towards Philadelphia, with several people in her. They took me in, and, as there was no wind, we row'd all the way; and about midnight, not having yet seen the city, some of the company were confident we must have passed it, and would row no farther; the others knew not where we were; so we put toward the shore, got into a creek, landed near an old fence, with the rails of which we made a fire, the night being cold, in October, and there we remained till daylight. Then one of the company knew the place to be Cooper's Creek, a little above Philadelphia, which we saw as soon as we got out of the creek, and arriv'd there about eight or nine o'clock on the Sunday morning, and landed at the Market-street wharf.
</p>
       <p>I have been the more particular in this description of my journey, and shall be so of my first entry into that city, that you may in your mind compare such unlikely beginnings with the figure I have since made there. I was in my working dress, my best cloaths being to come round by sea. I was dirty from my journey; my pockets were stuff'd out with shirts and stockings, and I knew no soul nor where  to look for lodging. I was fatigued with travelling, rowing, and want of rest, I was very hungry; and my whole stock of cash consisted of a Dutch dollar, and about a shilling in copper. The latter I gave the people of the boat for my passage, who at first refus'd it, on account 
           <pb n="28" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p28.jpg"/>
           of my rowing; but I insisted on their taking it.  A man being sometimes more generous when he has but a little money than when he has plenty, perhaps thro' fear of being thought to have but little.
       </p>
       <p>Then I walked up the street, gazing about till near the market-house I met a boy with bread.  I had made many a meal on bread, and, inquiring where he got it, I went immediately to the baker's he directed me to, in Second-street, and ask'd for bisket, intending such as we had in Boston; but they, it seems, were not made in Philadelphia. Then I asked for a three-penny loaf, and was told they had none such.  So not considering or knowing the difference of money, and the greater cheapness nor the names of his bread, I made him give me three-penny worth of any sort. He gave me, accordingly, three great puffy rolls.  I was surpriz'd at the quantity, but took it, and, having no room in my pockets, walk'd off with a roll under each arm, and eating the other.  Thus I went up Market-street as far as Fourth-street, passing by the door of Mr. Read, my future wife's father; when she, standing at the door, saw me, and thought I made, as I certainly did, a most awkward, ridiculous appearance.  Then I turned and went down Chestnut-street and part of Walnut-street, eating my roll all the way, and, coming round, found myself again at Market-street wharf, near the boat I came in, to which I went for a draught of the river water; and, being filled with one of my rolls, gave the other two to a woman and her child that came down the river in the boat with us, and were waiting to go farther.</p>
       
       <pb n="29" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p29.jpg"/>
       <p>Thus refreshed, I walked again up the street, which by this time had many clean-dressed people in it, who were all walking the same way.  I joined them, and thereby was led into the great meeting-house of the Quakers near the market.  I sat down among them, and, after looking round awhile and hearing nothing said, being very drowsy thro' labor and want of rest the preceding night, I fell fast asleep, and continued so till the meeting broke up, when one was kindenough to rouse me.  This was, therefore, the first house I was in, or slept in, in Philadelphia.
       </p>
       <p>Walking down again toward the river, and, looking in the faces of people, I met a young Quaker man, whose countenance I lik'd, and, accosting him, requested he would tell me where a stranger could get lodging.  We were then near the sign of the Three Mariners.  "Here," says he, "is one place that entertains strangers, but it is not a reputable house; if thee wilt walk with me, I'll show thee a better." He brought me to the Crooked Billet in Water-street.  Here I got a dinner; and, while I was eating it, several sly questions were asked me, as it seemed to be suspected from my youth and appearance, that I might be some runaway.
           
           <pb n="30" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p30.jpg"/>
       </p>
       <p>After dinner, my sleepiness return'd, and being shown to a bed, I lay down without undressing, and slept till six in the evening, was call'd to supper, went to bed again very early, and slept soundly till next morning.  Then I made myself as tidy as I could, and went to Andrew Bradford the printer's.  I found in the shop the old man his father, whom I had seen at New York, and who, travelling on horseback, had got to Philadelphia before me.  He introduc'd me to his son, who receiv'd me civilly, gave me a breakfast, but told me he did not at present want a hand, being lately suppli'd with one; but there was another printer in town, lately set up, one <ref target="a0050" corresp="n0050">Keimer</ref>, who, perhaps, might employ me; if not, I should be welcome to lodge at his house, and he would give me a little work to do now and then till fuller business should offer.
       </p>
       <p>The old gentleman said he would go with me to the new printer; and when we found him, "Neighbor," says Bradford, "I have brought to see you a young man of your business; perhaps you may want such a one." He ask'd me a few questions, put a composing stick in my hand to see how I work'd, and then said he would employ me soon, though he had just then nothing for me to do; and, taking old Bradford, whom he had never seen before, to be one of the town's people that had a good will for him, enter'd into a conversation on his present undertaking and projects; while Bradford, not
           <pb n="31" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p31.jpg"/>
           discovering that he was the other printer's father, on Keimer's saying he expected soon to get the greatest part of the business into his own hands, drew him on by artful questions, and starting little doubts, to explain all his views, what interests he reli'd on, and in what manner he intended to proceed.  I, who stood by and heard all, saw immediately that one of them was a crafty old sophister, and the other a mere novice.  Bradford left me with Keimer, who was greatly surpris'd when I told him who the old man was.
       </p>
       <p>Keimer's printing-house, I found, consisted of an old shatter'd press, and one small, worn-out font of English  which he was then using himself, composing an <ref target="a0051" corresp="n0051">Elegy on Aquila Rose</ref>, before mentioned, an ingenious young man, of excellent character, much respected in the town, clerk of the Assembly, and a pretty poet.  Keimer made verses too, but very indifferently.  He could not be said to write them, for his manner was to compose them in the types directly out of his head.  So there being no copy, but one pair of cases, and the Elegy likely to require all the letter, no one could help him.  I endeavor'd to put his press (which he had not yet us'd, and of which he understood nothing) into order fit to be work'd with; and, promising to come and print off his Elegy as soon as he should have got it ready, I return'd to Bradford's, who gave me a little job to do for the present, and there I lodged and dieted, A few days after, Keimer sent for me to print off the Elegy.  And  <pb n="32" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p32.jpg"/>now he had got another pair of cases, and a pamphlet to reprint, on which he set me to work.
       </p>
       <p>These two printers I found poorly qualified for their business. Bradford had not been bred to it, and was very illiterate; and Keimer, tho' something of a scholar, was a <ref target="a0052" corresp="n0052">mere compositor, knowing nothing of presswork</ref>. He had been one of the <ref target="a0053" corresp="n0053">French prophets</ref>, and could act their enthusiastic agitations.  At this time he did not profess any particular religion, but something of all on occasion; was very ignorant of the world, and had, as I afterward found, a good deal of the knave in his composition.  He did not like my lodging at Bradford's while I work'd with him.  He had a house, indeed, but without furniture, so he could not lodge me; but he got me a lodging at Mr. Read's, before mentioned, who was the owner of his house; and, my chest and  clothes being come by this time, I made rather a more respectable appearance in the eyes of Miss Read than I had done when she first happen'd to see me eating my roll in the street.
       </p>
       <p>I began now to have some acquaintance among the young people of the town, that were lovers of reading, with whom I spent my evenings very pleasantly; and gaining money by my industry and frugality, I lived very agreeably, forgetting Boston as much as I could, and not desiring that any there should know where I resided, except my friend Collins, who was in my secret, and kept it when I wrote to him.  At length, an incident happened that sent me back again much sooner than I had intended.  <pb n="33" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p33.jpg"/> I had a brother-in-law, Robert Holmes, master of a sloop that traded between Boston and Delaware.  He being at Newcastle, forty miles below Philadelphia, heard there of me, and wrote me a letter mentioning the concern of my friends in Boston at my abrupt departure, assuring me of their good will to me, and that every thing would be accommodated to my mind if I would return, to which he exhorted me very earnestly I wrote an answer to his letter, thank'd him for his advice, but stated my reasons for quitting Boston fully and in such a light as to convince him I was not so wrong as he had apprehended.
       </p>
       <p><ref target="a0054" corresp="n0054">Sir William Keith, governor of the province</ref>, was then at  Newcastle, and Captain Holmes, happening to be in company with him when my letter came to hand, spoke to him of me, and show'd him the letter.  The governor read it, and seem'd surpris'd when he was told my age.  He said I appear'd a young man of promising parts, and therefore should be encouraged; the printers at Philadelphia were wretched ones; and, if I would set up there, he made no doubt I should succeed; for his part, he would procure me the public business, and do me every other service in his power.  This my brother-in-law afterwards told me in Boston, but I knew as yet nothing of it; when, one day, Keimer and I being at  <pb n="34" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p34.jpg"/>work together near the window, we saw the governor and another gentleman (which proved to be Colonel French, of Newcastle), finely dress'd, come directly across the street to our house, and heard them at the door.
       </p>
       <p>Keimer ran down immediately, thinking it a visit to him; but the governor inquir'd for me, came up, and with a condescension of politeness I had been quite unus'd to, made me many compliments, desired to be acquainted with me, blam'd me kindly for not having made myself known to him when I first came to the place, and would have me away with him to the tavern, where he was going with <ref target="a0055" corresp="n0055">Colonel French to taste, as he said, some excellent Madeira</ref>. I was not a little surprised, and Keimer star'd like a pig poison'd.  I went, however, with the governor and Colonel French to a tavern, at the corner of Third-street, and over the Madeira he propos'd my setting up my business, laid before me the probabilities of success, and both he and Colonel French assur'd me I should have their interest and influence in procuring the public business of both governments. On my doubting whether my father would assist me in it, Sir William said he would give me a letter to him, in which he would state the advantages, and he did not doubt of prevailing with him.  So it was concluded I should return to Boston in the first vessel, with the governor's letter recommending me to my father.  In the mean time the intention was to be kept a secret, and I went on working with Keimer as usual, the governor sending for me now and then to dine with him, a very great honor I thought it, and conversing with me in the most affable, familiar, and  friendly manner imaginable. <pb n="35" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p35.jpg"/>
       </p>
       <p>About the end of April, 1724, a little vessel offer'd for Boston.  I took leave of Keimer as going to see my friends. The governor gave me an ample letter, saying many flattering things of me to my father, and strongly recommending the project of my setting up at Philadelphia as a thing that must make my fortune.  We struck on a <ref target="a0056" corresp="n0056">shoal</ref> in going down the bay, and sprung a leak; we had a blustering time at sea, and were oblig'd to pump almost continually, at which I took my turn.  We arriv'd safe, however, at Boston in about a <ref target="a0057" corresp="n0057">fortnight</ref>.  I had been absent seven months, and my friends had heard nothing of me; for my br.  Holmes was not yet return'd, and had not written about me.  My unexpected appearance surpriz'd the family; all were, however, very glad to see me, and made me welcome, except my brother.  I went to see him at his printing-house.  I was better dress'd than ever while in his service, having a genteel new suit from head to foot, a watch, and my pockets lin'd with near five pounds sterling in silver.  He receiv'd me not very frankly, look'd me all over, and turn'd to his work again.
       </p>
       <p>The journeymen were inquisitive where I had been, what sort of a country it was, and how I lik'd it.  I prais'd it much, the happy life I led in it, expressing strongly my intention of returning to it; and, one of them asking what kind of money we had there, I produc'd a handful of silver, and spread it before them, which was a kind of <ref target="a0058" corresp="n0058">raree-show</ref> they had not been us'd to, paper being the money of Boston. Then I took an opportunity of letting them see my watch; and, lastly (my brother still grum and sullen), I gave them a piece of eight to drink, and took my leave.  <pb n="36" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p36.jpg"/> This visit of  mine offended him extreamly; for, when my mother some time after spoke to him of a reconciliation, and of her wishes to see us on good terms together, and that we might live for the future as brothers, he said I had insulted him in such a manner before his people that he could never forget or forgive it.  In this, however, he was mistaken.
       </p>
       <p>My father received the governor's letter with some apparent surprise, but said little of it to me for some days, when Capt. Holmes returning he showed it to him, ask'd him if he knew Keith, and what kind of man he was; adding his opinion that he must be of small discretion to think of setting a boy up in business who wanted yet three years of being at man's estate.  Holmes said what he could in favor of the project, but my father was clear in the impropriety of it, and at last gave a flat denial to it.  Then he wrote a civil letter to Sir William, thanking him for the patronage he had so kindly offered me, but declining toassist me as yet in setting up, I being, in his opinion, too young to be trusted with the management of a business so important, and for which the preparation must be so expensive.</p>
       
       <p>My friend and companion <ref target="a0059" corresp="n0059">Collins</ref>, who was a clerk in the post-office, pleas'd with the account I gave him of my new country, determined to go thither also; and, while I waited  for my father's determination, he set out before me by land to Rhode Island, leaving his books, which were a pretty <pb n="37" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p37.jpg"/>collection of mathematicks and natural philosophy, to come with mine and me to New York, where he propos'd to wait for me.
</p>
       <p>My father, tho' he did not approve Sir William's proposition, was yet pleas'd that I had been able to obtain so advantageous a character from a person of such note where I had resided, and that I had been so industrious and careful as to equip myself so handsomely in so short a time; therefore,  seeing no prospect of an accommodation between my brother and me, he gave his consent to my returning again to Philadelphia, advis'd me to behave respectfully to the people there, endeavor to obtain the general esteem, and avoid <ref target="a0060" corresp="n0060">lampooning</ref> and libeling, to which he thought I had too much inclination; telling me, that by steady industry and a prudent parsimony I might save enough by the time I was one-and-twenty to set me up; and that, if I came near the matter, he would help me out with the rest.  This was all I could obtain, except some small gifts as tokens of his and my mother's love, when I embark'd again for New York, now with their approbation and their blessing.

       <p>The sloop putting in at Newport, Rhode Island, I visited my brother John, who had been married and settled there some years.  He received me very affectionately, for he always lov'd me.  A friend of his, one Vernon, having some money due to him in Pensilvania, about thirty-five pounds currency, desired I would receive it for him, and keep it till I had his directions what to remit it in.  Accordingly, he gave me an order.  This afterwards occasion'd me a good deal of uneasiness.
</p>
       <p>At Newport we took in a number of passengers for New York, among which were two <pb n="38" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p38.jpg"/>young women, companions, and a grave, sensible, matron-like Quaker woman, with her attendants.  I had shown an obliging readiness to do her some little services, which impress'd her I suppose with a degree of good will toward me; therefore, when she saw a daily growing familiarity between me and the two young women, which they appear'd to encourage, she took me aside, and said: "Young man, I am concern'd for thee, as thou has no friend with thee, and seems not to know much of the world, or of the snares youth is expos'd to; depend upon it, those are very bad women; I can see it in all their actions; and if thee art not upon thy guard, they will draw thee into some danger; they are strangers to thee, and I advise thee, in a friendly concern for thy welfare, to have no acquaintance with them." As I seem'd at first not to think so ill of them as she did, she mentioned some things she had observ'd and heard that had escap'd my notice, but now convinc'd me she was right.  I thank'd her for her kind advice, and promis'd to follow it.  When we arriv'd at New York, they told me where they liv'd, and invited me to come and see them; but I avoided it, and it was well I did; for the next day the captain miss'd a silver spoon and some other things, that had been taken out of his cabbin, and, knowing that these were a couple of <ref target="a0061" corresp="n0060">strumpets</ref>, he got a warrant to search their lodgings, found the stolen goods, and had the thieves punish'd. So, tho' we had escap'd a sunken rock, which we scrap'd upon in the passage, I thought this escape of rather more importance to me.
</p>
       <pb n="39" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p39.jpg"/>
       <p>At New York I found my friend Collins, who had arriv'd there some time before me.  We had been intimate from children, and had read the same books together; but he had the advantage of more time for reading and studying, and a wonderful genius for mathematical learning, in which he far outstript me.  While I liv'd in Boston most of my hours of leisure for conversation were spent with him, and he continu'd a sober as well as an industrious lad; was much respected for his learning by several of the clergy and other gentlemen, and seemed to promise making a good figure in life.  But, during my absence, he had acquir'd a habit of sotting with brandy; and I found by his own account, and what I heard from others, that he had been drunk every day since his arrival at New York, and behav'd very oddly. He had gam'd, too, and lost his money, so that I was oblig'd to discharge his lodgings, and defray his expenses to and at Philadelphia, which prov'd extremely inconvenient to me.
</p>
       <p>The then governor of New York, <ref target="a0062" corresp="n0062">Burnet (son of Bishop Burnet)</ref>, hearing from the captain that a young man, one of his passengers, had a great many books, desir'd he would bring me to see him.  I waited upon him accordingly, and should have taken Collins with me but that he was not sober. The gov'r. treated me with great civility, show'd me his library, which was a very large one, and we had a good deal of conversation about books and authors.  This was the second governor who had done me the honor to take <pb n="40" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p40.jpg"/> notice of me; which, to a poor boy like me, was very pleasing.
</p>
       <p>We proceeded to Philadelphia. I received on the way Vernon's money, without which we could hardly have finish'd our journey.  Collins wished to be employ'd in some counting-house, but, whether they discover'd his <ref target="a0063" corresp="n0063">dramming</ref> by his breath, or by his behaviour, tho' he had some recommendations, he met with no success in any application, and continu'd lodging and boarding at the same house with me, and at my expense.  Knowing I had that money of Vernon's, he was continually borrowing of me, still promising repayment as soon as he should be in business.  At length he had got so much of it that I was distress'd to think what I should do in case of being call'd on to remit it.
</p>
       <p>His drinking continu'd, about which we sometimes quarrell'd; for, when a little intoxicated, he was very fractious. Once, in a boat on the Delaware with some other young men, he refused to row in his turn.  "I will be row'd home," says he.  "We will not row you," says I. "You must, or stay all night on the water," says he, "just as you please.The others said, "Let us row; what signifies it?" But, my mind being soured with his other conduct, I continu'd to refuse.  So he swore he would make me row, or throw me overboard; and coming along, stepping on the thwarts, toward me, when he came up and struck at me, I clapped my hand under his crotch, and, rising, pitched him head-foremost into the river.  I knew he was a good swimmer, and so was under little concern about him; but before he could get round to lay hold of the boat, we had with a few strokes pull'd her out of his reach; and ever when he drew near the boat, we ask'd if he would row, striking a few strokes to slide her away from him.  He was ready to die with vexation, and obstinately would not promise to row. However, seeing him at last beginning to tire, we lifted him in and brought him home dripping wet in the evening. We hardly exchang'd a civil word afterwards, and a West India captain, who had a commission to procure a tutor for the sons of a gentleman at Barbadoes, happening to meet with him, agreed to carry him thither.  He left me then, promising to remit me the first money he should receive in order to discharge the debt; but I never heard of him after.
</p>
       <p>The breaking into this money of Vernon's was one of the first great <ref target="a0064" corresp="n0064">errata</ref> of my life; and this affair show'd that my father was not much out in his judgment when he suppos'd me too young to manage business of importance.  But Sir William, on reading his letter, said he was too prudent. <pb n="41" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p41.jpg"/>There was great difference in persons; and discretion did not always accompany years, nor was youth always without it. "And since he will not set you up," says he, "I will do it myself.  Give me an inventory of the things necessary to be had from England, and I will send for them. You shall repay me when you are able; I am resolv'd to have a good printer here, and I am sure you must succeed." This was spoken with such an appearance of cordiality, that I had not the least doubt of his meaning what he said.  I had hitherto kept the proposition of my setting up, a secret in Philadelphia, and I still kept it.  Had lt been known that I depended on the governor, probably some friend, that knew him better, would have advis'd me not to rely on him, as I afterwards heard it as his known character to be liberal of promises which he never meant to keep.  Yet, unsolicited as he was by me, how could I think his generous offers insincere? I believ'd him one of the best men in the world.
</p>
       <p>I presented him an inventory of a little printing-house, amounting by my computation to about <ref target="a0064a" corresp="n0064a">one hundred pounds sterling</ref> . He lik'd it, but ask'd me if my being on the spot in England to chuse the types, and see that every thing was  good of the kind, might not be of some advantage.  "Then," says he, <pb n="42" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p42.jpg"/> "when there, you may make acquaintances, and establish correspondences in the bookselling and stationery way." I agreed that this might be advantageous.  "Then," says he, "get yourself ready to go with <ref target="a0065" corresp="n0065">Annis</ref>;" which was the annual ship, and the only one at that time usually passing between London and Philadelphia.  But it would be some months before Annis sail'd, so I continu'd working with Keimer, fretting about the money Collins had got from me, and in daily apprehensions of being call'd upon by Vernon, which, however, did not happen for some years after.
</p>
       <p>I believe I have omitted mentioning that, in my first voyage from Boston, being <ref target="a0066" corresp="n0066">becalm'd</ref> off Block Island, our people set about catching cod, and hauled up a great many. Hitherto I had stuck to my resolution of not eating animal food, and on this occasion consider'd, with my master Tryon, the taking every fish as a kind of unprovoked murder, since none of them had, or ever could do us any injury that might justify the slaughter.  All this seemed very reasonable. But I had formerly been a great lover of fish, and, when this came hot out of the frying-pan, it smelt admirably well.  I balanc'd some time between principle and inclination, till I recollected that, when the fish were opened, I saw smaller fish taken out of their stomachs; then thought I, "If you eat one another, I don't see why we mayn't eat you." So I din'd upon cod very heartily, and continued to eat with other people, returning only now and then occasionally to a vegetable diet.  So convenient a thing it is to be a <hi rend="italic">reasonable creature,</hi> since it enables one to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind to do.
</p>
       <p>Keimer and I liv'd on a pretty good familiar footing, and agreed tolerably well, for he suspected nothing of my setting up. <pb n="43" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p43.jpg"/>He retained a great deal of his old enthusiasms and lov'd argumentation. We therefore had many disputations. I used to work him so with my Socratic method, and had <ref target="a0067" corresp="n0067">trepann'd</ref> him so often by questions apparently so distant from any point we had in hand, and yet by degrees lead to the point, and brought him into difficulties and contradictions, that at last he grew ridiculously cautious, and would hardly answer me the most common question, without asking first, <hi rend="italic">"What do you intend to infer from that?"</hi> However, it gave him so high an opinion of my abilities in the confuting way, that he seriously proposed my being his colleague in a project he had of setting up a new sect. He was to preach the doctrines, and I was to confound all opponents.  When he came to explain with me upon the doctrines, I found several conundrums which I objected to, unless I might have my way a little too, and introduce some of mine.
</p>
       <p>Keimer wore his beard at full length, because somewhere in the <ref target="a0068" corresp="n0068">Mosaic law</ref> it is said, <hi rend="italic">"Thou shalt not mar the corners of thy beard."</hi> He likewise kept the <ref target="a0069" corresp="n0069">Seventh day, Sabbath</ref>; and these two points were essentials with him.  I dislik'd  both; but agreed to admit them upon condition of his adopting the doctrine of using no animal food. "I doubt," said he, "my constitution will not bear that." I assur'd him it would, and that he would be the better for it.  He was usually a great glutton, and I promised myself some diversionin half starving him.  He agreed to try the practice, if I would keep him company.  I did so, and we held it for three months.  We had our victuals dress'd, and brought to us regularly by a woman in the neighborhood, who had from me a list of forty dishes to be prepar'd for us at different times, in all which there was neither fish, flesh, nor fowl, and the whim suited me the better at this time from the cheapness of it, not costing us above eighteenpence sterling each per week.  I have since kept several Lents most strictly, leaving the common diet for that, and that for the common, abruptly, without the least inconvenience, so that I think there is little in the advice of making those changes by easy gradations.  I went on pleasantly, but poor Keimer suffered grievously, tired of the project, long'd for the <ref target="a0070" corresp="n0070">flesh-pots</ref> of Egypt, and order'd a roast pig.  He invited me and two women friends to dine with him; but, it being brought too soon upon table, he could not resist the temptation, and ate the whole before we came.
</p>
       
       <p>I had made some courtship during this time to Miss Read. I had a great respect and affection for her, and had some reason to believe she had the same for me; but, as I was about to take a long voyage, and we were both very young, only a little above eighteen, it was thought most prudent by her mother to prevent our going too far at present, as a marriage, if it was to take place, would be more convenient after my return, when I should be, as I expected,set up in my business.  Perhaps, too, she thought my expectations not so well founded as I imagined them to be.
</p>
       <p>My chief acquaintances at this time were <ref target="a0071" corresp="n0071">Charles Osborne, Joseph Watson, and James Ralph</ref>, all lovers of reading. The two first were clerks to an eminent scrivener or conveyancer in the town, Charles Brogden; the other was clerk to a merchant. <pb n="44" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p44.jpg"/> Watson was a pious, sensible young man, of great integrity; the others rather more lax in their principles of religion, particularly Ralph, who, as well as Collins, had been unsettled by me, for which they both made me suffer.  Osborne was sensible, candid, frank; sincere and affectionate to his friends; but, in literary matters, too fond of criticising.  Ralph was ingenious, genteel in his manners, and extremely eloquent; I think I never knew a prettier talker.  Both of them great admirers of poetry, and began to try their hands in little pieces.  Many pleasant walks we four had together on Sundays into the woods, near <ref target="a0072" corresp="n0072">Schuylkill</ref>, where we read to one another, and conferr'd on what we read.
</p>
       <p>Ralph was inclin'd to pursue the study of poetry, not doubting but he might become eminent in it, and make his fortune by it, alleging that the best poets must, when they first began to write, make as many faults as he did.  Osborne dissuaded him, assur'd him he had no genius for poetry, and advis'd him to think of nothing beyond the business he was bred to; that, in the mercantile way, tho' he had no stock, he might, by his diligence and punctuality, recommend himself to employment as a factor, and in time acquire wherewith to trade on his own account.  I approv'd the amusing one's self with poetry now and then, so far as to improve one's language, but no farther.
</p>
       <p>On this it was propos'd that we should each of us, at our next meeting, produce a piece of our own composing, in order to improve by our mutual observations, criticisms, and corrections.  As language and expression were what we had in view, we excluded all considerations of invention by agreeing that the <pb n="45" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p45.jpg"/>task should be a version of the eighteenth Psalm, which describes the descent of a Deity. When the time of our meeting drew nigh, Ralph called on me first, and let me know his piece was ready.  I told him I had been busy, and, having little inclination, had done nothing.  He then show'd me his piece for my opinion, and I much approv'd it, as it appear'd to me to have great merit.  "Now," says he, "Osborne never will allow the least merit in any thing of mine, but makes 1000 criticisms out of mere envy.  He is not so jealous of you; I wish, therefore, you would take this piece, and produce it as yours; I will pretend not to have had time, and so produce nothing. We shall then see what he will say to it." It was agreed, and I immediately transcrib'd it, that it might appear in my own hand.
</p>
       <p>We met; Watson's performance was read; there were some beauties in it, but many defects.  Osborne's was read; it was much better; Ralph did it justice; remarked some faults, but applauded the beauties.  He himself had nothing to produce.  I was backward; seemed desirous of being excused; had not had sufficient time to correct, etc.; but no excuse could be admitted; produce I must.  It was read and repeated; Watson and Osborne gave up the contest, and join'd in applauding it.  Ralph only made 
           <pb n="46" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p46.jpg"/> some criticisms, and propos'd some amendments; but I defended my text.  Osborne was against Ralph, and told him he was no better a critic than poet, so he dropt the argument.  As they two went home together, Osborne expressed himself still more strongly in favor of what he thought my production;having restrain'd himself before, as he said, lest I should think it flattery.  "But who would have imagin'd," said he, "that Franklin had been capable of such a performance; such painting, such force, such fire! He has even improv'd the original.  In his common conversation he seems to have no choice of words; he hesitates and blunders; and yet, good God! how he writes!" When we next met, Ralph discovered the trick we had plaid him, and Osborne was a little laught at.
</p>
       
       <p>This transaction fixed Ralph in his resolution of becoming a poet.  I did all I could to dissuade him from it, but he continued scribbling verses till <ref target="a0073" corresp="n0073"><hi rend="italic">Pope</hi></ref> cured him.  He became, however, a pretty good prose writer.  More of him hereafter. But, as I may not have occasion again to mention the other two, I shall just remark here, that Watson died in my arms a few years after, much lamented, being the best of our set.  Osborne went to the West Indies, where he became an eminent lawyer and made money, but died young.  He and I had made a serious agreement, <pb n="47" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p47.jpg"/>that the one who happen'd first to die should, if possible, make a friendly visit to the other, and acquaint him how he found things in that separate state.  But he never fulfill'd his promise.
       </p>
       <p>The governor, seeming to like my company, had me frequently to his house, and his setting me up was always mention'd as a fixed thing.  I was to take with me letters recommendatory to a number of his friends, besides the letter of credit to furnish me with the necessary money for purchasing the press and types, paper, etc.  For these letters I was appointed to call at different times, when they were to be ready, but a future time was still named.  Thus he went on till the ship, whose departure too had been several times postponed, was on the point of sailing.  Then, when I call'd to take my leave and receive the letters, his secretary, Dr. Bard, came out to me and said the governor was extremely busy in writing, but would be down at Newcastle before the ship, and there the letters would be delivered to me.
       </p>
       <p>Ralph, though married, and having one child, had determined to accompany me in this voyage.  It was thought he intended to establish a correspondence, and obtain goods to sell on commission; but I found afterwards, that, thro' some discontent with his wife's relations, he purposed to leave her on their hands, and never return again.  Having taken leave of my friends, and interchang'd some promises with Miss Read, I left Philadelphia in the ship, which anchor'd at Newcastle.  The governor was there; but when I went to his lodging, the secretary came to me from him with the civillest message in the world, that he could not then see me, being engaged in business of the utmost importance, <pb n="48" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p48.jpg"/>but should send the letters to me on board, wish'd me heartily a good voyage and a speedy return, etc.  I returned on board a little puzzled, but still not doubting.
       </p>
       <p><ref target="a0074" corresp="n0074">Mr. Andrew Hamilton</ref>, a famous lawyer of Philadelphia, had taken passage in the same ship for himself and son, and with Mr. Denham, a Quaker merchant, and Messrs. Onion and Russel, masters of an iron work in Maryland, had engag'd the great cabin; so that Ralph and I were forced to take up with a berth in the steerage, and none on board knowing us, were considered as ordinary persons.  But Mr. Hamilton and his son (it was James, since governor) return'd from Newcastle to Philadelphia, the father being recall'd by a great fee to plead for a seized ship; and, just before we sail'd, Colonel French coming on board, and showing me great respect, I was more taken notice of, and, with my friend Ralph, invited by the other gentlemen to come into the cabin, there being now room.  Accordingly, we remov'd thither.
       </p>
       <p>Understanding that Colonel French had brought on board the governor's despatches, I ask'd the captain for those letters that were to be under my care.  He said all were put into the bag together and he could not then come at them; but, before we landed in England, I should have an opportunity of picking them out; so I was <pb n="49" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p49.jpg"/> satisfied for the present, and we proceeded on our voyage.  We had a sociable company in the cabin, and lived uncommonly well, having the addition of all Mr. Hamilton's stores, who had laid in plentifully.  In this passage Mr. Denham contracted a friendship for me that continued during his life.  The voyage was otherwise not a pleasant one, as we had a great deal of bad weather.
       </p>
       <p>When we came into the Channel, the captain kept his word with me, and gave me an opportunity of examining the bag for the governor's letters.  I found none upon which my name was put as under my care.  I picked out six or seven, that, by the handwriting, I thought might be the promised letters, especially as one of them was directed to Basket, the king's printer, and another to some stationer. We arriv'd in London the 24th of December, 1724.  I waited upon the stationer, who came first in my way, delivering  the letter as from Governor Keith.  "I don't know such a person," says he; but, opening the letter, "O! this is from Riddlesden.  I have lately found him to be a compleat rascal, and I will have nothing to do with him, nor receive anyletters from him." So, putting the letter into my hand, he turn'd on his heel and left me to serve some customer.I was surprized to find these were not the governor's letters; and, after recollecting and comparing circumstances, I beganto doubt his sincerity.  I found my friend <pb n="50" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p50.jpg"/> Denham, and opened the whole affair to him.  He let me into Keith'scharacter; told me there was not the least probability that he had written any letters for me; that no one, who knew him, had the smallest dependence on him; and he laught at the notion of the governor's giving me a letter of credit, having, as he said, no credit to give.  On my expressing some concern about what I should do, he advised me to endeavor getting some employment in the way of my business."Among the printers here," said he, "you will improve yourself, and when you return to America, you will set up to greater advantage."
       </p>
       <p>We both of us happen'd to know, as well as the stationer, that Riddlesden, the attorney, was a very knave.  He had half ruin'd Miss Read's father by persuading him to be bound for him.  By this letter it appear'd there was a secret scheme on foot to the prejudice of Hamilton (suppos'd to be then coming over with us); and that Keith was concerned in it with Riddlesden.  Denham, who was a friend of Hamilton's thought he ought to be acquainted with it; so, when he arriv'd in England, which was soon after, partly from resentment and ill-will to Keith and Riddlesden, and partly from good-will to him, I waited on him, and gave him the letter.  He thank'd me cordially, the information being of importance to him; and from that time he became my friend, greatly to my advantage afterwards on many occasions.
       </p>
       <p>But what shall we think of a governor's playing such pitiful tricks, and imposing so grossly on a poor ignorant boy! It was a habit he had acquired.  He wish'd to please everybody; and, having little to give, he gave expectations. He was otherwise an ingenious, sensible man, a pretty good writer, and a good governor for the people, tho' not for his constituents, the proprietaries, whose instructions he sometimes disregarded.  Several of our best laws were of his planning and passed during his administration.
       </p>
       <p>Ralph and I were inseparable companions.  We took lodgings together in <ref target="a0075" corresp="n0075">Little Britain</ref> at three shillings and sixpence a week as much as we could then afford.  He found some relations, but they were poor, and unable to assist him. He now let me know his intentions of remaining in London, and that he never meant to return to Philadelphia.  He had brought no money with him, the whole he could muster having been expended in paying his passage.  I had fifteen pistoles; so he borrowed occasionally of me to subsist, while he was looking out for business.  He first endeavored to get into the playhouse, believing himself qualify'd for an actor, but <ref target="a0076" corresp="n0076">Wilkes</ref>, to whom he apply'd, advis'd him candidly not to think of that employment, as it was impossible be should succeed in it.  Then he propos'd to Roberts, a publisher in Paternoster Row, to write for him a weekly <pb n="51" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p51.jpg"/>paper like the Spectator, on certain conditions, which Roberts did not approve.  Then he endeavored to get employment as a <ref target="a0077" corresp="n0077">hackney writer</ref>, to copy for the stationers and lawyers about the Temple, but could find no vacancy.
       </p>
       <p>I immediately got into work at <ref target="a0078" corresp="n0078">Palmer's, then a famous printing-house in Bartholomew Close</ref>, and here I continu'd near a year.  I was pretty diligent, but spent with Ralph a good deal of my earnings in going to plays and other places of amusement.  We had together consumed all my pistoles, and now just rubbed on from hand to mouth.  He seem'd quite to forget his wife and child, and I, by degrees, my engagements with Miss Read, to whom I never wrote more than one letter, and that was to let her know I was not likely soon to return.  This was another of the great errata of my life, which I should wish to correct if I were to live it over again.  In fact, by our expenses, I was constantly kept unable to pay my passage.
       </p>
       <p>At Palmer's I was employed in composing for the second edition of Wollaston's "Religion of Nature." Some of his reasonings not appearing to me well founded, I wrote a little metaphysical piece in which I made remarks on them. It was entitled <ref target="a0079" corresp="n0079">A Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure and Pain."</ref> I inscribed it to my friend Ralph; I printed a small number. It occasion'd my being more consider'd by Mr. Palmer as a young man of some ingenuity, tho' he seriously expostulated with me upon the principles of my pamphlet, which to him appear'd abominable.  My printing this pamphlet was another erratum.  <pb n="52" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p52.jpg"/>While I lodg'd in Little Britain, I made an acquaintance with one Wilcox, a bookseller, whose shop was at the next door. He had an immense collection of second-hand books.  Circulating libraries were not then in use; but we agreed that, on certain reasonable terms, which I have now forgotten, I might take, read, and return any of his books.  This I esteem'd a great advantage, and I made as much use of it as I could.
       </p>
       <p>My pamphlet by some means falling into the hands of one <ref target="a0080" corresp="n0080">Lyons, a surgeon, author of a book entitled "The Infallibility of Human Judgment,"</ref> it occasioned an acquaintance between us.  He took great notice of me, called on me often to converse on those subjects, carried me to the Horns, a pale alehouse in          <ref target="a0081" corresp="n0081">Lane,</ref>, Cheapside, and introduced me to <ref target="a0082" corresp="n0082">Dr. Mandeville, author of the "Fable of the Bees,"</ref> who had a club there, of which he was the soul, being a most facetious, entertaining companion.  Lyons, too, introduced me to Dr. Pemberton, at Batson's Coffee-house, who promised to give me an Opportunity some time or other of seeing Sir Isaac Newton, of which I was extremely desirous, but this never happened.
       </p>
       <p>I had brought over a few curiosities, among which the principal was a purse made of the asbestos, which purifies by fire. <ref target="a0083" corresp="n0083">Sir Hans Sloane</ref> heard of it, came to see me, and invited me to his House in Bloomsbury Square, where he show'd me all his curiosities, and persuaded me to let him add that to the number, for which he paid me handsomely.
       </p>
       <p>In our house there lodg'd a young woman, a <ref target="a0084" corresp="n0084">milliner, who, I think, had a shop in the Cloisters.</ref>  She had been genteelly bred, was sensible and lively, and of most pleasing conversation. Ralph read plays to her in the evenings, they grew intimate, she took another lodging, and he followed her. They liv'd together some time; but, he being still out of business, and her income not sufficient to maintain them with her child, he took a resolution of going from London, to try for a country school, which he thought himself well qualified to undertake, as he wrote an excellent hand, and was a master of arithmetic and accounts.  This, however, he deemed a business below him, and confident of future better fortune, when he should be unwilling to have it known that he once was so meanly employed, he changed his name, and did me the honor to assume mine; for I soon after had a letter from him, acquainting me that he was settled in a small village (in Berkshire, I think it was, where he taught reading and writing to ten or a dozen boys, at sixpence each per week), recommending Mrs. T to my care, and desiring me to write to him, directing for Mr. Franklin, schoolmaster, at such a place.
       </p>
       <p>He continued to write frequently, sending me large specimens of an epic poem which he was then composing, and desiring my remarks and corrections.  These I gave him from time to time, but endeavor'd rather to discourage his proceeding.  One of <ref target="a0085" corresp="n0085">Young's Satires</ref> was then just published. I copy'd and sent him a great part of it, which set in a strong light the folly of pursuing the Muses with any hope of advancement by them.  All was in vain; sheets of the poem continued to come by every post.  In the mean time, Mrs. T, having on his account lost her friends and business, was often in distresses, and us'd to send for me, and borrow what I could spare to help <pb n="53" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p53.jpg"/>her out of them.  I grew fond of her company, and, being at that time under no religious restraint, and presuming upon my importance to her, I attempted familiarities (another erratum) which she repuls'd with a proper resentment, and acquainted him with my behaviour.  This made a breach between us; and, when he returned again to London, he let me know he thought I had cancell'd all the obligations he had been under to me. So I found I was never to expect his repaying me what I lent to him, or advanc'd for him.  This, however, was not then of much consequence, as he was totally unable; and in the loss of his friendship I found myself relieved from a burthen.  I now began to think of getting a little money beforehand, and, expecting better work, I left Palmer's to work at <ref target="a0086" corresp="n0086">Watts's, near Lincoln's Inn Fields, a still greater printing-house</ref>.  Here I continued all the rest of my stay in London.
       </p>
       <p>At my first admission into this printing-house I took to working at press, imagining I felt a want of the bodily exercise I had been us'd to in America, where presswork is mix'd with composing.  I drank only water; the other workmen, near fifty in number, were great guzzlers of beer. On occasion, I carried up and down stairs a large form of types in each hand, when others carried but one in both hands. They wondered to see, from this and several instances, that the <hi rend="italic">Water-American,</hi> as they called me, was <hi rend="italic">stronger</hi> than themselves, who drank <hi rend="italic">strong</hi> beer! We had an alehouse boy who attended always in the house to supply the workmen.  My companion at the press drank every day a pint before breakfast, a pint at breakfast with his bread and cheese, <pb n="54" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p54.jpg"/> a pint between breakfast and dinner, a pint at dinner, a pint in the afternoon about six o'clock, and another when he had done his day's work.  I thought it a detestable custom; but it was necessary, he suppos'd, to drink strong beer, that he might be strong to labor.  I endeavored to convince him that the bodily strength afforded by beer could only be in proportion to the grain or flour of the barley dissolved in the water of which it was made; that there was more flour in a pennyworth of bread; and therefore, if he would eat that with a pint of water, it would give him more strength than a quart of beer.  He drank on, however, and had four or five shillings to pay out of his wages every Saturday night for that muddling liquor; an expense I was free from.  And thus these poor devils keep themselves always under.
       </p>
       <p>Watts, after some weeks, desiring to have me in the composing-room, I left the pressmen; a new <ref target="a0087" corresp="n0087">bien venu</ref> or sum for drink, being five shillings, was demanded of me by the compositors.  I thought it an imposition, as I had paid below; the master thought so too, and forbad my paying it.  I stood out two or three weeks, was accordingly considered as an excommunicate, and had so many little pieces of private mischief done me, <ref target="a0088" corresp="n0088">by mixing my sorts, transposing my pages, breaking my matter</ref>, etc., etc., if I were ever so little out of the room, and all ascribed to the chappel ghost, which they said ever haunted those not regularly admitted, that, <pb n="55" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p55.jpg"/>notwithstanding the master's protection, I found myself oblig'd to comply and pay the money, convinc'd of the folly of being on ill terms with those one is to live with continually.
       </p>
       <p>I was now on a fair footing with them, and soon acquir'd considerable influence. I propos'd some reasonable alterations in their <ref target="a0089" corresp="n0089">chappel</ref>laws, and carried them against all opposition.  From my example, a great part of them left their muddling breakfast of beer, and bread, and cheese, finding they could with me be suppli'd from a neighboring house with a large <ref target="a0090" corresp="n0090">porringer of hot water-gruel</ref>, sprinkled with pepper, crumbl'd with bread, and a bit of butter in it, for the price of a pint of beer, viz., three half-pence.  This was a more comfortable as well as cheaper breakfast, and kept their heads clearer.  Those who continued sotting with beer all day, were often, by not paying, out of credit at the alehouse, and us'd to make interest with me to get beer; their <hi rend="italic">light,</hi> as they phrased it, <hi rend="italic">being out.</hi>  I watch'd the pay-table on Saturday night, and collected what I stood engag'd for them, having to pay sometimes near thirty shillings a week on their account.  This, and my being esteem'd a pretty good <hi rend="italic">riggite,</hi> that is, a <ref target="a0091" corresp="n0091">jocular</ref> verbal satirist, supported my consequence in the society.  My constant attendance (I never <ref target="a0092" corresp="n0092">making a St. Monday</ref> recommended me to the master; and my uncommon quickness at composing occasioned my being put upon all work of dispatch, which was generally better paid.  So I went on now very agreeably.
       </p>
       <pb n="56" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p56.jpg"/>
       <p>My lodging in Little Britain being too remote, I found another in <ref target="a0093" corresp="n0093">Duke-street</ref>, opposite to the Romish Chapel. It was two pair of stairs backwards, at an Italian warehouse. A widow lady kept the house; she had a daughter, and a maid servant, and a journeyman who attended the warehouse, but lodg'd abroad.  After sending to inquire my character at the house where I last lodg'd she agreed to take me in at the same rate, 3s. 6d. three shillings and six pence per week; cheaper, as she said, from the protection she expected in having a man lodge in the house.  She was a widow, an elderly woman; had been bred a Protestant, being a clergyman's daughter, but was converted to the Catholic religion by her husband, whose memory she much revered; had lived much among people of distinction, and knew a thousand anecdotes of them as far back as the times of Charles the Second. She was lame in her knees with the gout, and, therefore, seldom stirred out of her room, so sometimes wanted company; and hers was so highly amusing to me, that I was sure to spend an evening with her whenever she desired it.  Our supper was only half an anchovy each, on a very little strip of bread and butter, and half a pint of ale between us; but the entertainment was in her conversation.  My always keeping good hours, and giving little trouble in the family, made her unwilling to part with me; so that, when I talk'd of a lodging I had heard of, nearer my business, for two shillings a week, which, intent as I now was on saving money, made some difference, she bid me not think of it, for she would abate me two shillings a week for the future; so I remained with her at one shilling and sixpence as long as I staid in London.
       </p>
       <p>In a <ref target="a0094" corresp="n0094">garret</ref> of her house there lived a maiden lady of seventy, in the most retired manner, of whom my landlady gave me this account: that she was a Roman Catholic, had been sent abroad when young, and lodg'd in a nunnery with an intent of becoming a nun; but, the country not agreeing with her, she returned to England, where, there being no nunnery, she had vow'd to lead the life of a nun, as near as might be done in those circumstances.  Accordingly, she had given all her estate to charitable uses, reserving only twelve pounds a year to live on, and out of this sum she still gave a great deal in charity, living herself on water-gruel only, and using no fire but to boil it.  She had lived many years in that garret, being permitted to remain there <ref target="a0095" corresp="n0095">gratis</ref> by successive Catholic tenants of the house below, as they deemed it a blessing to have her there.  A priest visited her to confess her every day.  "I have ask'd her," says my landlady, "how she, as she liv'd, could possibly find so much employment for a confessor?" "Oh," said she, "it is impossible to avoid <hi rend="italic">vain thoughts."</hi> I was permitted once to visit her, She was chearful and polite, and convers'd pleasantly. The room was clean, but had no other furniture than a matras, a table with a crucifix and book, a stool which she gave me to sit on, and a picture over the chimney of <ref target="a0096" corresp="n0096">Saint Veronica displaying her handkerchief, with the miraculous figure of Christ's bleeding face on it</ref>, which she explained to me with great seriousness.  She look'd pale, but was never sick; and I give it as another instance on how small an income life and health may be supported.
       </p>
       <p>At Watts's printing-house I contracted <pb n="57" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p57.jpg"/>an acquaintance with an ingenious young man, one Wygate, who, having wealthy relations, had been better educated than most printers; was a tolerable Latinist, spoke French, and lov'd reading.  I taught him and a friend of his to swim at twice going into the river, and they soon became good swimmers. They introduc'd me to some gentlemen from the country, who went to <ref target="a0097" corresp="n0097">Chelsea by water to see the College and Don Saltero's curiosities</ref>.  In our return, at the request of the company, whose curiosity Wygate had excited, I stripped and leaped into the river, and swam from near <ref target="a0098" corresp="n0098">Chelsea to Blackfryar's</ref>, performing on the way many feats of activity, both upon and under water, that surpris'd and pleas'd those to whom they were novelties.
       </p>
       <p>I had from a child been ever delighted with this exercise,had studied and practis'd all <ref target="a0099" corresp="n0099">Thevenot's motions and positions</ref>, added some of my own, aiming at the graceful and easy as well as the useful.  All these I took this occasion of exhibiting to the company, and was much flatter'd by their admiration; and Wygate, who was desirous of becoming a master, grew more and more attach'd to me on that account, as well as from the similarity of our studies.  He at length proposed to me travelling all over Europe together, supporting ourselves everywhere by working at our business.  I was once inclined to it; but, mentioning it to my good friend Mr. Denham, with whom I often spent an hour when I had leisure, he dissuaded me from it, advising me to think only of returning to Pennsilvania, which he was now about to do.
</p>
       <p>I must record one trait of this good man's character.  He had formerly been in business at Bristol, but failed in debt to a number of people, <ref target="a0100" corresp="n0100">compounded</ref>  and went to America. There, by a close application to business as a merchant, he acquir'd a plentiful fortune in a few years.  Returning to England in the ship with me, he invited his old creditors to an entertainment, at which he thank'd them for the easy composition they had favored him with, and, when they expected nothing but the treat, every man at the first remove found under his plate an order on a banker for the full amount of the unpaid remainder with interest.
       </p>
       <p>He now told me he was about to return to Philadelphia, and should carry over a great quantity of goods in order to open a store there.  He propos'd to take me over as his clerk, to keep his books, in which he would instruct me, copy his letters, and attend the store.  He added that, as soon as I should be <pb n="58" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p58.jpg"/>acquainted with mercantile business, he would promote me by sending me with a cargo of flour and bread,etc., to the West Indies, and procure me commissions from others which would be profitable; and, if I manag'd well, would establish me handsomely.  The thing pleas'd me; for I was grown tired of London, remembered with pleasure the happy months I had spent in Pennsylvania, and wish'd again to see it; therefore I immediately agreed on the terms of fifty pounds a year, Pennsylvania money; less, indeed, than my present gettings as a compositor, but affording a better prospect.
       </p>
       <p>I now took leave of printing, as I thought, for ever, and was daily employed in my new business, going about with Mr. Denham among the tradesmen to purchase various articles, and seeing them pack'd up, doing errands, calling upon workmen to dispatch, etc.; and, when all was on board, I had a few days' leisure.  On one of these days, I was, to my surprise, sent for by a great man I knew only by name, a Sir William Wyndham, and I waited upon him.  He had heard by some means or other of my swimming from Chelsea to Blackfriar's, and of my teaching Wygate and another young man to swim in a few hours.  He had two sons, about to set out on their travels; he wish'd to have them first taught swimming, and proposed to gratify me handsomely if I would teach them.  They were not yet come to town, and my stay was uncertain, so I could not undertake it; but, from this incident, I thought it likely that, if I were to remain in England and open a swimming-school, I might get a good deal of money; and it struck me so strongly, <pb n="59" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p59.jpg"/>that, had the overture been sooner made me, probably I should not so soon have returned to America.  After many years, you and I had something of more importance to do with <ref target="a0101" corresp="n0101">one of these sons of Sir William Wyndham, become Earl of Egremont, which I shall mention in its place</ref>.
       </p>
       <p>Thus I spent about eighteen months in London; most part of the time I work'd hard at my business, and spent but little upon myself except in <ref target="a0102" corresp="n0102">seeing plays</ref> and in books. My friend Ralph had kept me poor; he owed me about twenty-seven pounds, which I was now never likely to receive; a  great sum out of my small earnings! I lov'd him, notwithstanding, for he had many amiable qualities.  I had by no means improv'd my fortune; but I had picked up some very ingenious acquaintance, whose conversation was of great
advantage to me; and I had read considerably.</p>
       <p>We sail'd from Gravesend on the 23d of July, 1726.  For the incidents of the voyage, I refer you to my journal, where you will find them all minutely related.  Perhaps the most important part of that journal is the <hi rend="italic">plan</hi> to be found in it, which I formed at sea, for regulating my future conduct in life.  It is the more remarkable, as being formed when I was so young, and yet being pretty faithfully adhered to quite thro' to old age.
       </p>
       <p>We landed in Philadelphia on the 11th of October, where I found sundry alterations.  Keith was no longer governor, being superseded by Major Gordon.  I met him walking the streets as a common citizen. He seem'd a little asham'd at seeing me, but pass'd without saying anything.  I should have been as much asham'd at seeing Miss Read, had not her friends, despairing with reason of my return after the receipt of my letter, persuaded her to marry another, one Rogers, a potter, which was done in my absence. <pb n="60" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p60.jpg"/> With him, however, she was never happy, and soon parted from him, refusing to cohabit with him or bear his name, it being now said that he had another wife.  He was a worthless fellow, tho' an excellent workman, which was the temptation to her friends.  He got into debt, ran away in 1727 or 1728, went to the West Indies, and died there.  Keimer had got a better house, a shop well supply'd with stationery, plenty of new types, a number of hands, tho' none good, and seem'dto have a great deal of business.
       </p>
       <p> Mr. Denham took a store in Water-street, where we open'd our goods; I attended the business diligently, studied accounts, and grew, in a little time, expert at selling.  We lodg'd and, boarded together; he counsell'd me as a father, having a sincere regard for me.  I respected and lov'd him, and we might have gone on together very happy; but, in the beginning of February, 1726-7, when I had just pass'd my twenty-first year, we both were taken ill.  My distemper was a <ref target="a0103" corresp="n0103">pleurisy</ref>, which very nearly carried me off.  I suffered a good deal, gave up the point in my own mind, and was rather disappointed when I found myself recovering, regretting, in some degree, that I must now, some time or other, have all that disagreeable work to do over again.  I forget what his distemper was; it held him a long time, and at length carried him off.  He left me a small legacy in a <ref target="a0104" corresp="n0104">nuncupative will</ref>, as a token of his kindness for me, and <pb n="61" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p61.jpg"/>he left me once more to the wide world; for the store was taken into the care of his executors, and my employment under him ended.
       </p>
       <p>My brother-in-law, Holmes, being now at Philadelphia, advised my return to my business; and Keimer tempted me,with an offer of large wages by the year, to come and take the management of his printing-house, that he might better attend his stationer's shop.  I had heard a bad character of him in London from his wife and her friends, and was not fond of having any more to do with him.  I tri'd for farther employment as a merchant's clerk; but, not readily meeting with any, I clos'd again with Keimer.  I found in his house these hands: Hugh Meredith, a Welsh Pensilvanian, thirty years of age, bred to country work; honest, sensible, had a great deal of solid observation, was something of a reader, but given to drink.  Stephen Potts, a young countryman of full age, bred to the same, of uncommon natural parts, and great wit and humor, but a little idle.  These he had agreed with at extream low wages per week, to be rais'd a shilling every three months, as they would deserve by improving in their business; and the expectation of these high wages, to come on hereafter, was what he had drawn them in with. Meredith was to work at press, Potts at book-binding, which he, by agreement, was to teach them, though he knew neither one nor t'other.  John -----, a wild Irishman, brought up to no business, whose service, for four years, Keimer had purchased from the captain of a ship; he, too, was to be made a pressman.  George Webb, an Oxford scholar, whose <pb n="62" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p62.jpg"/> time for four years he had likewise bought, intending him for a compositor, of whom more presently; and David Harry, a country boy, whom he had taken apprentice.
       </p>
       <p>I soon perceiv'd that the intention of engaging me at wages so much higher than he had been us'd to give, was, to have these raw, cheap hands form'd thro' me; and, as soon as I had instructed them, then they being all articled to him, he should be able to do without me.  I went on, however, very cheerfully, put his printing-house in order, which had been in great confusion, and brought his hands by degrees to mind their business and to do it better.
       </p>
       <p>It was an odd thing to find an Oxford scholar in the situation of a bought servant.  He was not more than eighteen years of age, and gave me this account of himself; that he was born in Gloucester, educated at a grammar-school there, had been distinguish'd among the scholars for some apparent superiority in performing his part, when they exhibited plays; belong'd to the Witty Club there, and had written some pieces in prose and verse, which were printed in the Gloucester newspapers; thence he was sent to Oxford; where he continued about a year, but not well satisfi'd, wishing of all things to see London, and become a <ref target="a0105" corresp="n0105">player</ref>.  At length, receiving his quarterly allowance of fifteen guineas, instead of discharging his debts he walk'd out of <pb n="63" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p63.jpg"/>town, hid his gown in a furze bush, and footed it to London, where, having no friend to advise him, he fell into bad company, soon spent his guineas, found no means of being introduc'damong the players, grew necessitous, pawn'd his cloaths, and wanted bread.  Walking the street very hungry, and not knowing what to do with himself, a <ref target="a0106" corresp="n0106">crimp's</ref> bill was put into his hand, offering immediate entertainment and encouragement to such as would bind themselves to serve in America. He went directly, sign'd the indentures, was put into the ship, and came over, never writing a line to acquaint his friends what was become of him.  He was lively, witty, good-natur'd, and a pleasant companion, but idle, thoughtless, and imprudent to the last degree.
       </p>
       <p>John, the Irishman, soon ran away; with the rest I began to live very agreeably, for they all respected me the more, as they found Keimer incapable of instructing them, and that from me they learned something daily.  We never worked on Saturday, that being Keimer's Sabbath, so I had two days for reading.  My acquaintance with ingenious people in the town increased.  Keimer himself treated me with great civility and apparent regard, and nothing now made me uneasy but my debt to Vernon, which I was yet unable to pay, being hitherto but a poor oeconomist.  He, however, kindly made no demand of it.
       </p>
       <p>Our printing-house often wanted <ref target="a0107" corresp="n0107">sorts</ref>, and there was no <ref target="a0108" corresp="n0108">letter-founder</ref> in America; I had seen types cast at James's in London, but without much attention to the manner; however,I now contrived a mould, made use of the letters we had as puncheons, <ref target="a0109" corresp="n0109">struck the matrices in lead</ref>, And thus supply'd in a pretty tolerable way all deficiencies.  I also <pb n="64" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p64.jpg"/>engrav'd several things on occasion; I made the ink; I was  warehouseman, and everything, and, in short, quite a <ref target="a0110" corresp="n0110">factotum</ref>.
           
       </p><p>But, however serviceable I might be, I found that my services became every day of less importance, as the other hands improv'd in the business; and, when Keimer paid my second quarter's wages, he let me know that he felt them too heavy, and thought I should make an abatement. He grew by degrees less civil, put on more of the master, frequently found fault, was <ref target="a0111" corresp="n0111">captious</ref>, and seem'd ready for an outbreaking.  I went on, nevertheless, with a good deal of patience, thinking that his encumber'd circumstances were partly the cause.  At length a trifle snapt our connections; for, a great noise happening near the court-house, I put my head out of the window to see what was the matter.  Keimer, being in the street, look'd up and saw me,  call'd out to me in a loud voice and angry tone to mind my business, adding some reproachful words, that nettled me the more for their publicity, all the neighbors who were looking out on the same occasion being witnesses how I was treated. He came up immediately into the printing-house, continu'd the quarrel, high words pass'd on both sides, he gave me the quarter's warning we had stipulated, expressing a wish that he had not been oblig'd to so long a warning.  I told him his wish was unnecessary, for I would leave him that instant; and so, taking my hat, walk'd out of doors, <pb n="65" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p65.jpg"/>desiring Meredith, whom I saw below, to take care of some things I left, and bring them to my lodgings.</p>
      
      <p>Meredith came accordingly in the evening, when we talked my affair over. He had conceiv'd a great regard for me, and was very unwilling that I should leave the house while he remain'd in it. He dissuaded me from returning to my native country, which I began to think of; he  reminded me that Keimer was in debt for all he possess'd; that his creditors began to be uneasy; that he kept his shop miserably, sold often without profit for ready money, and often trusted without keeping accounts; that he must therefore fall, which would make a vacancy I might profit of. I objected my want of money. He then let me know that his father had a high opinion of me, and, from some discourse that had pass'd between them, he was sure would advance money to set us up, if I would enter into partnership with him. "My time," says he, "will be out with Keimer in the spring; by that time we may have our press and types in from London. I am sensible I am no workman; if you like it, your skill in the business shall be set against the stock I furnish, and we will share the profits equally."
</p>
       <p>The proposal was agreeable, and I consented; his father was in town and approv'd of it; the more as he saw I had great influence with his <pb n="66" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p66.jpg"/>Son, had prevail'd on him to abstain long from dram-drinking, and he hop'd might break him off that wretched habit entirely, when we came to be so closely connected. I gave an inventory to the father, who carry'd it to a merchant; the things were sent for, the secret was to be kept till they should arrive, and in the mean time I was to get work, if I could, at the other printing-house. But I found no vacancy there, and so remain'd idle a few days, when Keimer, on a prospect of being employ'd to print some <ref target="a0112" corresp="n0112">paper money in New Jersey, which would require cuts and various types that I only could supply</ref>, and apprehending Bradford might engage me and get the jobb from him, sent me a very civil message, that old friends should not part for a few words, the effect of sudden passion, and wishing me to return. Meredith persuaded me to comply, as it would give more opportunity for his improvement under my daily instructions; so I return'd, and we went on more smoothly than for some time before. The New jersey jobb was obtain'd, <ref target="a0113" corresp="n0113">I contriv'd a Copper Plate Press for it, the first that had been seen in the country; I cut several Ornaments and Checks for the Bills</ref>. We went together to Burlington, where I executed the whole to satisfaction; and he received <pb n="67" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p67.jpg"/>so large a sum for the work as to be enabled thereby to keep his head much longer above water.
</p>
       <p>At Burlington I made an Acquaintance with many principal people of the province. Several of them had been appointed by the Assembly a committee to attend the press, and take care that no more bills were printed than the law directed. They were therefore, by turns, constantly with us, and generally he who attended, brought with him a friend or two for company. My mind having been much more improv'd by reading than Keimer's, I suppose it was for that reason my conversation seem'd to he more valu'd. They had me to their houses, introduced me to their friends, and show'd me much civility; while he, tho' the master, was a little neglected. In truth, he was an odd fish; ignorant of common life, fond of rudely opposing receiv'd opinions, slovenly to extream dirtiness, enthusiastic in some points of religion, and a little knavish withal.
</p>
       <p>We continu'd there near three months; and by that time I could reckon among my acquired friends, Judge Allen, Samuel Bustill, the secretary of the Province, Isaac Pearson, Joseph Cooper, and several of the Smiths, members of Assembly, and Isaac Decow, the <ref target="a0114" corresp="n0114">surveyor-general</ref>. The latter was a shrewd, sagacious old man, who told me that he began for himself, when young, by <ref target="a0115" corresp="n0115">wheeling clay</ref> for the brick-makers, learned to write after be was of age, carri'd the chain for surveyors, who taught him surveying, and he had now by his industry, acquir'd a good estate; and says he, "I foresee that you will soon work this man out of business, and make a fortune in it at Philadelphia." He had not then the <pb n="68" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p68.jpg"/>least intimation of my intention to set up there or anywhere. These friends were afterwards of great use to me, as I occasionally was to some of them. They all continued their regard for me as long as they lived.
</p>
       <p>Before I enter upon my public appearance in business, it may be well to let you know the then state of my mind with regard to my principles and morals, that you may see how far those influenc'd the future events of my life. My parents had early given me religious impressions, and brought me through my childhood piously in the Dissenting way. But I was scarce fifteen, when, after doubting by turns of several points, as I found them disputed in the different books I read, I began to doubt of Revelation itself. Some books against <ref target="a0116" corresp="n0116">Deism</ref> fell into my hands; they were said to be the substance of sermons preached at <ref target="a0117" corresp="n0117">Boyle's Lectures.</ref> It happened that they wrought an effect on me quite contrary to what was intended by them; for the arguments of the Deists, which were quoted to be refuted, appeared to me much stronger than the refutations; in short, I soon became a thorough Deist. My arguments perverted some others, particularly Collins and Ralph; but, each of them having afterwards wrong'd me greatly without the least compunction, and recollecting Keith's conduct towards me (who was another freethinker), and my own towards Vernon and Miss Read, which at times gave me great trouble, <pb n="69" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p69.jpg"/>I began to suspect that this doctrine, tho' it might be true, was not very useful.<ref target="a0118" corresp="n0118"> My London pamphlet, which had for its motto these lines of Dryden</ref>:
<q><lg type="stanza"><l>"Whatever is, is right. Though purblind man</l>
<l>     Sees but a part o' the chain, the nearest link:</l>
<l>     His eyes not carrying to the equal beam,</l>
<l>     That poises all above;"</l></lg></q>
and from the attributes of God, his infinite wisdom, goodness and power, concluded that nothing could possibly be wrong in the world, and that vice and virtue were empty distinctions, no such things existing, appear'd now not so clever a performance as I once thought it; and I doubted whether some error had not insinuated itself unperceiv'd into my argument, so as to infect all that follow'd, as is common in metaphysical reasonings.
</p>
       <p>I grew convinc'd that <hi rend="italic">truth, sincerity</hi> and <hi rend="italic">integrity</hi> in dealings between man and man were of the utmost importance to the felicity of life; and I form'd written resolutions, which still remain in my journal book, to practice them ever while I lived. Revelation had indeed no weight with me, as such; but I entertain'd an opinion that, though certain actions might not be bad <hi rend="italic">because</hi> they were forbidden by it, or good <hi rend="italic">because</hi> it commanded them, <pb n="70" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p70.jpg"/>yet probably these actions might be forbidden <hi rend="italic">because</hi> they were bad for us, or commanded <hi rend="italic">because</hi> they were beneficial to us, in their own natures, all the circumstances of things considered. And this persuasion, with the kind hand of Providence, or some guardian angel, or accidental favorable circumstances and situations, or all together, preserved me, thro' this dangerous time of youth, and the hazardous situations I was sometimes in among strangers, remote from the eye and advice of my father, without any willful gross immorality or injustice, that might have been expected from my want of religion. I say willful, because the instances I have mentioned had something of <hi rend="italic">necessity</hi> in them, from my youth, inexperience, and the knavery of others. I had therefore a tolerable character to begin the world with; I valued it properly, and determin'd to preserve it.
</p>
       <p>We had not been long return'd to Philadelphia before the new types arriv'd from London. We settled with Keimer, and left him by his consent before he heard of it. We found a house to hire near the market, and took it. To lessen the rent, which was then but twenty-four pounds a year, tho' I have since known it to let for seventy, we took in Thomas Godfrey, a <ref target="a0119" corresp="n0119">glazier</ref>, and his family, who were to pay a considerable part of it to us, and we to board with them. <pb n="71" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p71.jpg"/>We had scarce opened our letters and put our press in order, before George House, an acquaintance of mine, brought a countryman to us, whom he had met in the street inquiring for a printer. All our cash was now expended in the variety of particulars we had been obliged to procure, and this countryman's five shillings, being our first-fruits, and coming so seasonably, gave me more pleasure than any crown I have since earned; and the gratitude I felt toward House has made me often more ready than perhaps I should otherwise have been to assist young beginners.
</p>
       <p>There are <ref target="a0120" corresp="n0120">croakers</ref> in every country, always boding its ruin. Such a one then lived in Philadelphia; a person of note, an elderly man, with a wise look and a very grave manner of speaking; his name was Samuel Mickle. This gentleman, a stranger to me, stopt one day at my door, and asked me if I was the young man who had lately opened a new printing-house. Being answered in the affirmative, he said he was sorry for me, because it was an expensive undertaking, and the expense would be lost; for Philadelphia was a sinking place, the people already half-bankrupts, or near being so; all appearances to the contrary, such as new buildings and the rise of rents, being to his certain knowledge <ref target="a0121" corresp="n0121">fallacious</ref>; for they were, in fact, among the things that would soon ruin us.  And he gave me such a detail of misfortunes now existing, or that were soon to exist, that he left me half melancholy. Had I known him before I engaged in this business, probably I never should have done it. This man continued to live in this decaying place, and to declaim in the same strain, refusing for many years to buy a house there, because all was going to destruction; and at last I had the pleasure of seeing him give five times as much for one as he might have bought it for when he first began his croaking.
</p>
       <p>I should have mentioned before, that, in the autumn of the preceding year, I had form'd most of my ingenious acquaintance into a club of mutual improvement, which we called the JUNTO; we met on Friday evenings. The rules that I drew up required that every member, in his turn, should produce one or more queries on any point of Morals, Politics, or Natural Philosophy, to be discuss'd by the company; and once in three months produce and read an essay of his own writing, on any subject he pleased. Our debates were to be under the direction of a president, and to be conducted in the sincere spirit of inquiry after truth, without fondness for dispute, or desire of victory; and, to prevent warmth, all expressions of positiveness in opinions, or direct contradiction, were after some time made contraband, and prohibited under small <ref target="a0122" corresp="n0122">pecuniary</ref> penalties.
</p>
       <pb n="72" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p72.jpg"/><p>The first members were <ref target="a0123" corresp="n0123">Joseph Breintnal</ref>, a copyer of deeds for the scriveners, a good-natur'd, friendly, middle-ag'd man, a great lover of poetry, reading all he could meet with, and writing some that was tolerable; very ingenious in many little Nicknackeries, and of sensible conversation.
</p> 
       <p>Thomas Godfrey, a self-taught mathematician, great in his way, and afterward inventor of what is now called Hadley's Quadrant. But he knew little out of his way, and was not a pleasing companion; as, like most great mathematicians I have met with, he expected universal precision in everything said, or was for ever denying or distinguishing upon trifles, to the disturbance of all conversation. He soon left us.
</p>
       <p>Nicholas Scull, a surveyor, afterwards surveyor-general, who lov'd books, and sometimes made a few verses.
</p>
       <p>William Parsons, bred a shoemaker, but loving reading, had acquir'd a considerable share of mathematics, which he first studied with a view to astrology, that he afterwards laught at it.He also became surveyor-general.
</p>
       <p>William Maugridge, a joiner, a most exquisite mechanic, and a solid, sensible man.
</p>
       <p>Hugh Meredith, Stephen Potts, and George Webb I have characteriz'd before.
</p>
       <p>Robert Grace, a young gentleman of some fortune, generous, lively, and witty; a lover of punning and of his friends.
</p>
       <p>And William Coleman, then a merchant's clerk, about my age, who had the coolest, clearest head, the best heart, and the exactest morals of almost any man I ever met with.He became afterwards a merchant of great note, and one of our provincial judges. Our friendship continued without interruption to his death, upward of forty years; and the club <pb n="73" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p73.jpg"/>continued almost as long, and was the best school of philosophy, morality, and politics that then existed in the province; for our queries, which were read the week preceding their discussion, put us upon reading with attention upon the several subjects, that we might speak more to the purpose; and here, too, we acquired better habits of conversation, every thing being studied in our rules which might prevent our disgusting each other. From hence the long continuance of the club, which I shall have frequent occasion to speak further of hereafter.
</p>
       <p>But my giving this account of it here is to show something of the interest I had, every one of these exerting themselves in recommending business to us. Breintnal particularly procur'd us from the Quakers the printing forty sheets of their history, the rest being to be done by Keimer; and upon this we work'd exceedingly hard, for the price was low.It was a folio, pro patria size, in pica, with long primer notes. I compos'd of it a sheet a day, and Meredith worked it off at press; it was often eleven at night, and sometimes later, before I had finished my distribution for the next day's work, for the little jobbs sent in by our other friends now and then put us back. But so determin'd I was to continue doing a sheet a day of the folio, that one night, when, having impos'd my forms, I thought my day's work over, one of them by accident was broken, and two pages reduced to <ref target="a0124" corresp="n0124">pi</ref>, I immediately distributed and compos'd it over again before I went to bed; and this industry, visible to our neighbors, began to give us character and credit; particularly, I was told, that mention being made of the new printing-office at the merchants' Every-night club, the general opinion was that it must fail, there being already two printers in the place, Keimer and Bradford; but Dr. Baird (whom you and I saw many years after at his native place, St. Andrew's in Scotland) gave a contrary opinion: "For the industry of that Franklin," says he, "is superior to any <pb n="74" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p74.jpg"/>thing I ever saw of the kind; I see him still at work when I go home from club, and he is at work again before his neighbors are out of bed." This struck the rest, and we soon after had offers from one of them to supply us with stationery; but as yet we did not chuse to engage in shop business.
</p> 
       <p>I mention this industry the more particularly and the more freely, tho' it seems to be talking in my own praise, that those of my posterity, who shall read it, may know the use of that virtue, when they see its effects in my favour throughout this relation.</p>
       
       <p>George Webb, who had found a female friend that lent him wherewith to purchase his time of Keimer, now came to offer himself as a journeyman to us. We could not then employ him; but I foolishly let him know as a secret that I soon intended to begin a newspaper, and might then have work for him. My hopes of success, as I told him, were founded on this, that the then only newspaper, printed by Bradford, was a paltry thing, wretchedly manag'd, no way entertaining, and yet was profitable to him; I therefore thought a good paper would scarcely fail of good encouragement. I requested Webb not to mention it; but he told it to Keimer, who immediately, to be beforehand with me, published proposals for printing one himself, on which Webb was to be employ'd. I resented this; and, to counteract them, as I could not yet begin our paper, I wrote several pieces of entertainment for Bradford's paper, under the title of the BUSY BODY, which Breintnal continu'd some months. By this means the attention of the publick was fixed on that paper, and Keimer's proposals, which we burlesqu'd and ridicul'd, were disregarded. <ref target="a0125" corresp="n0125">He began his paper, however, and, after carrying it on three quarters of a year, with at most only ninety subscribers, he offered it to me for <pb n="75" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p75.jpg"/>a trifle; and I, having been ready some time to go on with it, took it in hand directly; and it prov'd in a few years extremely profitable to me</ref>.
</p>
       <p>I perceive that I am apt to speak in the singular number, though our partnership still continu'd; the reason may be that, in fact, the whole management of the business lay upon me. Meredith was no compositor, a poor pressman, and seldom sober. My friends lamented my connection with him, but I was to make the best of it.
</p>
       <p><ref target="a0126" corresp="n0126">Our first papers made a quite different appearance from any before in the province; a better type, and better printed; but some spirited remarks of my writing, on the dispute then going on between Governor Burnet and the Massachusetts Assembly</ref>, struck the principal people, occasioned the paper and the manager of it to be much talk'd of, and in a few weeks brought them all to be our subscribers.
</p>
       <p>Their example was follow'd by many, and our number went on growing continually. This was one of the first good effects of my having learnt a little to scribble; another was, that the leading men, seeing a newspaper now in the hands of one who could also handle a pen, thought it convenient to oblige and encourage me. Bradford still printed the votes, and laws, and other publick business. He had printed an address of the House to the governor, in a coarse, blundering manner, we reprinted it elegantly and correctly, and sent one to every member. They were sensible of the difference: it strengthened the hands of our friends in the House, and they voted us their printers for the year ensuing.
</p>
       <p>Among my friends in the House <pb n="76" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p76.jpg"/>I must not forget <ref target="a0127" corresp="n0127">Mr. Hamilton, before mentioned</ref>, who was then returned from England, and had a seat in it. He interested himself for me strongly in that instance, as he did in many others afterward, continuing his patronage till his death.
</p>
       <p>Mr. Vernon, about this time, put me in mind of the debt I ow'd him, but did not press me. I wrote him an ingenuous letter of acknowledgment, crav'd his forbearance a little longer, which he allow'd me, and as soon as I was able, I paid the principal with interest, and many thanks; so that erratum was in some degree corrected.
</p>
       <p>But now another difficulty came upon me which I had never the least reason to expect. Mr. Meredith's father, who was to have paid for our printing-house, according to the expectations given me, was able to advance only one hundred pounds currency, which had been paid; and a hundred more was due to the merchant, who grew impatient, and su'd us all. We gave bail, but saw that, if the money could not be rais'd in time, the suit must soon come to a judgment and execution, and our hopeful prospects must, with us, be ruined, as the press and letters must be sold for payment, perhaps at half price.
</p>
       <p>In this distress two true friends, whose kindness I have never forgotten, nor ever shall forget while I can remember any thing, came <pb n="77" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p77.jpg"/>to me separately, unknown to each other, and, without any application from me, offering each of them to advance me all the money that should be necessary to enable me to take the whole business upon myself, if that should be practicable; but they did not like my continuing the partnership with Meredith, who, as they said, was often seen drunk in the streets, and playing at low games in alehouses, much to our discredit. These two friends were William Coleman and Robert Grace. I told them I could not propose a separation while any prospect remain'd of the Merediths' fulfilling their part of our agreement, because I thought myself under great obligations to them for what they had done, and would do if they could; but, if they finally fail'd in their performance, and our partnership must be dissolv'd, I should then think myself at liberty to accept the assistance of my friends.
</p>
       <p>Thus the matter rested for some time, when I said to my partner, "Perhaps your father is dissatisfied at the part you have undertaken in this affair of ours, and is unwilling to advance for you and me what he would for you alone. If that is the case, tell me, and I will resign the whole to you, and go about my business." "No," said he, "my father has really been disappointed, and is really unable; and I am unwilling to distress him farther. I see this is a <pb n="78" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p78.jpg"/>Business I am not fit for. I was bred a farmer, and it was a folly in me to come to town, and put myself, at thirty years of age, an apprentice to learn a new trade.  Many of our Welsh people are going to settle in North Carolina, where land is cheap. I am inclin'd to go with them, and follow my old employment. You may find friends to assist you. If you will take the debts of the company upon you; return to my father the hundred pound he has advanced; pay my little personal debts, and give me thirty pounds and a new saddle, I will relinquish the partnership, and leave the whole in your hands." I agreed to this proposal: it was drawn up in writing, sign'd, and seal'd immediately. I gave him what he demanded, and he went soon after to Carolina, from whence he sent me next year two long letters, containing the best account that had been given of that country, the climate, the soil, husbandry, etc., for in those matters he was very judicious. I printed them in the papers, and they gave great satisfaction to the publick.
</p>
       <p>As soon as he was gone, I recurr'd to my two friends; and because I would not give an unkind preference to either, I took half of <pb n="79" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p79.jpg"/>what each had offered and I wanted of one, and half of the other; paid off the company's debts, and went on with the business in my own name, advertising that the partnership was dissolved. I think this was in or about the year 1729.
</p>
       <p>About this time there was a cry among the people for more paper money, only fifteen thousand pounds being <ref target="a0128" corresp="n0128">extant</ref> in the province, and that soon to be sunk. The wealthy inhabitants oppos'd any addition, being against all paper currency, from an apprehension that it would depreciate, as it had done in New England, to the prejudice of all creditors. We had discuss'd this point in our Junto, where I was on the side of an addition, being persuaded that the first small sum struck in 1723 had done much good by increasing the trade, employment, and number of inhabitants in the province, since I now saw all the old houses inhabited, and many new ones building; whereas I remembered well, that when I first walk'd about the streets of Philadelphia, eating my roll, I saw most of the houses in Walnut-street, between Second and Front streets, with bills on their doors, "To be let"; and many likewise in Chestnut-street and other streets, which made me then think the inhabitants of the city were deserting it one after another.
</p>
       <p>Our <pb n="80" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p80.jpg"/>Debates possess'd me so fully of the subject, that I wrote and printed an anonymous pamphlet on it, entitled <ref target="a0129" corresp="n0129"><hi rend="italic">"The Nature and Necessity of a Paper Currency."</hi></ref> It was well receiv'd by the common people in general; but the rich men dislik'd it, for it increas'd and strengthen'd the clamor for more money, and they happening to have no writers among them that were able to answer it, their opposition slacken'd, and the point was carried by a majority in the House. My friends there, who conceiv'd I had been of some service, thought fit to reward me by employing me in printing the money; a very profitable jobb and a great help to me.  his was another advantage gain'd by my being able to write.
</p>
       <p>The utility of this currency became by time and experience so evident as never afterwards to be much disputed; so that it grew soon to fifty-five thousand pounds, and in 1739 to eighty thousand pounds, since which it arose during war to upwards of three hundred and fifty thousand pounds, trade, building, and inhabitants all the while increasing, till I now think there are limits beyond which the quantity may
be hurtful.
</p>
       <p>I soon after obtain'd, thro' my friend Hamilton, the printing of the Newcastle paper money, another profitable jobb as I then thought it; small things appearing great to those in small circumstances; and these, to me, <pb n="81" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p81.jpg"/>were really great advantages, as they were great encouragements. He procured for me, also, the printing of the laws and votes of that government, which continu'd in my hands as long as I follow'd the business.
</p>
       <p>I now open'd a little stationer's shop. I had in it blanks of all sorts, the <ref target="a0130" corresp="n0130">correctest</ref> that ever appear'd among us, being assisted in that by my friend Breintnal. I had also paper, parchment, chapmen's books, etc. One Whitemash, a compositor I had known in London, an excellent workman, now came to me, and work'd with me constantly and diligently; and I took an apprentice, the son of Aquila Rose.
</p>
       <p>I began now gradually to pay off the debt I was under for the printing-house. In order to secure my credit and character as a tradesman, I took care not only to be in <hi rend="italic">reality</hi> industrious and frugal, but to avoid all appearances to the contrary. I drest plainly; I was seen at no places of idle diversion. I never went out a fishing or shooting; a book, indeed, sometimes debauch'd me from my work, but that was seldom, snug, and gave no scandal; and, to show that I was not above my business, I sometimes brought home the paper I purchas'd at the stores thro' the streets on a wheelbarrow.  Thus being esteem'd an industrious, thriving young man, and paying duly for what I bought, the merchants who imported stationery solicited my custom; others proposed supplying me with books, and I went on swimmingly. In the mean <pb n="82" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p82.jpg"/>time, Keimer's credit and business declining daily, he was at last forc'd to sell his printing house to satisfy his creditors. He went to Barbadoes, and there lived some years in very poor Circumstances.
</p>
       <p>His apprentice, David Harry, whom I had instructed while I work'd with him, set up in his place at Philadelphia, having bought his materials. I was at first apprehensive of a powerful rival in Harry, as his friends were very able, and had a good deal of interest. I therefore propos'd a partner-ship to him which he, fortunately for me, rejected with scorn. He was very proud, dress'd like a gentleman, liv'd
expensively, took much diversion and pleasure abroad, ran in debt, and neglected his business; upon which, all business left him; and, finding nothing to do, he followed Keimer to Barbadoes, taking the printing-house with him. There this apprentice employ'd his former master as a journeyman; they quarrel'd often; Harry went continually behindhand, and at length was forc'd to sell his types and return to his country work in Pensilvania. The person that bought them employ'd Keimer to use them, but in a few years he died.
</p>
       <p>There remained now no competitor with me at Philadelphia but the old one, Bradford; who was rich and easy, did a little printing now and then by straggling hands, but was not very anxious about the business. <ref target="a0131" corresp="n0131">However, as he kept the post-office</ref>, it was imagined he had better opportunities of obtaining news; his paper was thought a better distributer of advertisements than mine, and therefore had many, more, which was a profitable thing to him, and a disadvantage to me; for, tho' I did indeed receive and send <pb n="83" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p83.jpg"/>papers by the post, yet the publick opinion was otherwise, for what I did send was by bribing the riders, who took them privately, Bradford being unkind enough to forbid it, which occasion'd some resentment on my part; and I thought so meanly of him for it, that, when I afterward came into his situation, I took care never to imitate it.
</p>
       <p>I had hitherto continu'd to board with Godfrey, who lived in part of my house with his wife and children, and had one side of the shop for his glazier's business, tho' he worked little, being always absorbed in his mathematics. Mrs. Godfrey projected a match for me with a relation's daughter, took opportunities of bringing us often together, till a serious courtship on my part ensu'd, the girl being in herself very deserving. The old folks encourag'd me by continual invitations to supper, and by leaving us together, till at length it was time to explain. Mrs. Godfrey manag'd our little treaty. I let her know that I expected as much money with their daughter as would pay off my remaining debt for the printing-house, which I believe was not then above a hundred pounds. She brought me word they had no such sum to spare; I said they might mortgage their house in the loan-office. The answer to this, after some days, was, that they did not approve the match; that, on inquiry of Bradford, they had been inform'd the printing business was not a profitable one; the types would soon be worn out, and more wanted; that S. Keimer and D. Harry had failed one after the other, and I should probably soon follow them; and, therefore, I was forbidden the house, and the daughter shut up.
</p>
       <p>Whether this was a real change of sentiment <pb n="84" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p84.jpg"/>or only artifice, on a supposition of our being too far engaged in affection to retract, and therefore that we should steal a marriage, which would leave them at liberty to give or withhold what they pleas'd, I know not; but I suspected the latter, resented it, and went no more. Mrs. Godfrey brought me afterward some more favorable accounts of their disposition, and would have drawn me on again; butI declared absolutely my resolution to have nothing moreto do with that family. This was resented by the Godfreys; we differ'd, and they removed, leaving me the whole house, and I resolved to take no more inmates.
</p>
       <p>But this affair having turned my thoughts to marriage, I look'd round me and made overtures of acquaintance in other places; but soon found that, the business of a printer being generally thought a poor one, I was not to expect money with a wife, unless with such a one as I should not otherwise think agreeable. In the mean time, that hard-to-be-governed passion of youth hurried me frequently into intrigues with low women that fell in my way, which were attended with some expense and great inconvenience, besides a continual risque to my health by a distemper which of all things I dreaded, though by great good luck I escaped it.</p>
       
       <p> A friendly Correspondence <pb n="85" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p85.jpg"/>as neighbors and old acquaintances had continued between me and Mrs. Read's family, who all had a regard for me from the time of my first lodging in their house. I was often invited there and consulted in their affairs, wherein I sometimes was of service. I piti'd poor Miss Read's unfortunate situation, who was generally dejected, seldom cheerful, and avoided company. I considered my giddiness and inconstancy when in London as in a great degree the cause of her unhappiness, tho' the mother was good enough to think the fault more her own than mine, as she had prevented our marrying before I went thither, and persuaded the other match in my absence. Our mutual affection was revived, but there were now great objections to our union. The match was indeed looked upon as invalid, a preceding wife being said to be living in England; but this could not easily be prov'd, because of the distance; and, tho' there was a report of his death, it was not certain. Then, tho' it should be true, he had left many debts, which his successor might be call'd upon to pay. We ventured, however, over all these difficulties, and <ref target="a0132" corresp="n0132">I took her to wife, September 1st, 1730.</ref> None of the inconveniences happened that we had apprehended, she proved a good and faithful helpmate, assisted me much by attending the shop; we throve together, and have ever mutually endeavored to make each other happy. Thus I corrected that great <hi rend="italic">erratum</hi> as well as I could.
</p>
       <pb n="86" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p86.jpg"/><p>About this time, our club meeting, not at a tavern, but in a little room of Mr. Grace's, set apart for that purpose, a proposition was made by me, that, since our books were often referr'd to in our disquisitions upon the queries, it might be convenient to us to have them altogether where we met, that upon occasion they might be consulted; and by thus clubbing our books to a common library, we should, while we lik'd to keep them together, have each of us the advantage of using the books of all the other members, which would be nearly as beneficial as if each owned the whole.  It was lik'd and agreed to, and we fill'd one end of the room with such books as we could best spare. The number was not so great as we expected; and tho' they had been of great use, yet some inconveniences occurring for want of due care of them, the collection, after about a year, was separated, and each took his books home again
</p>
       <p>And now I set on foot my first project of a public nature, that for a <ref target="a0133" corresp="n0133">subscription library</ref>.  I drew up the proposals, got them put into form by our great scrivener, Brockden, and, by the help of my friends in the Junto, procured fifty subscribers of forty shillings each to begin with, and ten shillings a year for fifty years, the term our company was to continue. We afterwards obtain'd a charter, the company being increased to one hundred: this was the mother of all the North American subscription libraries, now so numerous. It <pb n="87" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p87.jpg"/>is become a great thing itself, and continually increasing. These libraries have improved the general conversation of the Americans, made the common tradesmen and farmers as intelligent as most gentlemen from other countries, and perhaps have contributed in some degree to the stand so generally made throughout the colonies in defense of their privileges.

      <p>"MY DEAR AND HONORED FRIEND: I have often been
           desirous of writing to thee, but could not be reconciled
           to the thought that the letter might fall into
           the hands of the British, lest some printer or busy-body
           should publish some part of the contents, and give our friend
           pain, and myself censure.
       </p>
       <p>"Some time since there fell into my hands, to my great
           joy, about twenty-three sheets in thy own handwriting,
           containing an account of the parentage and life of thyself,
           directed to thy son, ending in the year 1730, with which
           there were notes, likewise in thy writing; a copy of which
           I inclose, in hopes it may be a means, if thou continued it
           up to a later period, that the first and latter part may be
           put together; and if it is not yet continued, I hope thee
           will not delay it.  Life is uncertain, as the preacher tells
           us; and what will the world say if kind, humane, and
           benevolent Ben.  Franklin should leave his friends and the
           world deprived of so pleasing and profitable a work; a work
           which would be useful and entertaining not only to a few,
           but to millions? The influence writings under that class
           have on the minds of youth is very great, and has nowhere
           appeared to me so plain, as in our public friend's journals.
           It almost insensibly leads the youth into the resolution of
           endeavoring to become as good and eminent as the journalist.
           Should thine, for instance, when published (and I think it
           could not fail of it), lead the youth to equal the industry
           and temperance of thy early youth, what a blessing with
           that class would such a work be! I know of no character
           living, nor many of them put together, who has so much in
           his power as thyself to promote a greater spirit of industry
           and early attention to business, frugality, and temperance
           with the American youth.  Not that I think the work would
           have no other merit and use in the world, far from it;
           but the first is of such vast importance that I know nothing
           that can equal it."</p>
       
       <p>The foregoing letter and the minutes accompanying it
being shown to a friend, I received from him the following:

	<hi rend="italic">Letter from Mr. Benjamin Vaughan</hi><lb/>

                    "PARIS, <hi rend="italic">January</hi> 31, 1783.<lb/>
</p><p>"My DEAREST SIR: When I had read over your sheets
of minutes of the principal incidents of your life, recovered
for you by your Quaker acquaintance, I told you I would
send you a letter expressing my reasons why I thought it
would be useful to complete and publish it as he desired.
Various concerns have for some time past prevented this
letter being written, and I do not know whether it was
worth any expectation; happening to be at leisure, however,
at present, I shall by writing, at least interest and instruct
myself; but as the terms I am inclined to use may tend
to offend a person of your manners, I shall only tell you
how I would address any other person, who was as good
and as great as yourself, but less diffident.  I would say to
him, Sir, I solicit the history of your life from the following
motives: Your history is so remarkable, that if you do not
give it, somebody else will certainly give it; and perhaps
so as nearly to do as much harm, as your own management
of the thing might do good.  It will moreover present a
table of the internal circumstances of your country, which
will very much tend to invite to it settlers of virtuous and
manly minds.  And considering the eagerness with which
such information is sought by them, and the extent of your
reputation, I do not know of a more efficacious advertisement
than your biography would give.  All that has happened
to you is also connected with the detail of the manners
and situation of a rising people; and in this respect I do
not think that the writings of Caesar and Tacitus can be
more interesting to a true judge of human nature and
society. But these, sir, are small reasons, in my opinion,
compared with the chance which your life will give for
the forming of future great men; and in conjunction with
your Art of Virtue (which you design to publish) of improving
the features of private character, and consequently
of aiding all happiness, both public and domestic.  The two
works I allude to, sir, will in particular give a noble rule
and example of self-education.  School and other education
constantly proceed upon false principles, and show a clumsy
apparatus pointed at a false mark; but your apparatus is
simple, and the mark a true one; and while parents and
young persons are left destitute of other just means of
estimating and becoming prepared for a reasonable course in
life, your discovery that the thing is in many a man's
private power, will be invaluable! Influence upon the private
character, late in life, is not only an influence late in life,
but a weak influence.  It is in youth that we plant our
chief habits and prejudices; it is in youth that we take our
party as to profession, pursuits and matrimony.  In youth,
therefore, the turn is given; in youth the education even
of the next generation is given; in youth the private and
public character is determined; and the term of life extending
but from youth to age, life ought to begin well from
youth, and more especially before we take our party as to
our principal objects.  But your biography will not merely
teach self-education, but the education of a wise man; and
the wisest man will receive lights and improve his progress,
by seeing detailed the conduct of another wise man.  And
why are weaker men to be deprived of such helps, when we
see our race has been blundering on in the dark, almost
without a guide in this particular, from the farthest trace
of time? Show then, sir, how much is to be done, both to
sons and fathers; and invite all wise men to become like
yourself, and other men to become wise.  When we see
how cruel statesmen and warriors can be to the human race,
and how absurd distinguished men can be to their acquaintance,
it will be instructive to observe the instances
multiply of pacific, acquiescing manners; and to find how
compatible it is to be great and domestic, enviable and yet
good-humored.

</p><p>"The little private incidents which you will also have to
relate, will have considerable use, as we want, above all
things, rules of prudence in ordinary affairs; and it will
be curious to see how you have acted in these.  It will be
so far a sort of key to life, and explain many things that all
men ought to have once explained to them, to give, them a
chance of becoming wise by foresight.  The nearest thing
to having experience of one's own, is to have other people's
affairs brought before us in a shape that is interesting;
this is sure to happen from your pen; our affairs and
management will have an air of simplicity or importance
that will not fail to strike; and I am convinced you have
conducted them with as much originality as if you had been
conducting discussions in politics or philosophy; and what
more worthy of experiments and system (its importance and
its errors considered) than human life?
</p><p>"Some men have been virtuous blindly, others have speculated
fantastically, and others have been shrewd to bad
purposes; but you, sir, I am sure, will give under your
hand, nothing but what is at the same moment, wise, practical
and good, your account of yourself (for I suppose
the parallel I am drawing for Dr. Franklin, will hold not
only in point of character, but of private history) will show
that you are ashamed of no origin; a thing the more important,
as you prove how little necessary all origin is to
happiness, virtue, or greatness.  As no end likewise happens
without a means, so we shall find, sir, that even you yourself
framed a plan by which you became considerable; but
at the same time we may see that though the event is flattering,
the means are as simple as wisdom could make
them; that is, depending upon nature, virtue, thought and
habit. Another thing demonstrated will be the propriety of
everyman's waiting for his time for appearing upon the
stage of the world.  Our sensations being very much fixed
to the  moment, we are apt to forget that more moments are
to follow the first, and consequently that man should arrange
his conduct so as to suit the whole of a life.  Your attribution
appears to have been applied to your life, and the
passing moments of it have been enlivened with content
and enjoyment instead of being tormented with foolish impatience or regrets.  Such a conduct is easy for those
who make virtue and themselves in countenance by examples
of other truly great men, of whom patience is so often
the characteristic.  Your Quaker correspondent, sir (for
here again I will suppose the subject of my letter resembling
Dr. Franklin), praised your frugality, diligence and temperance,
which he considered as a pattern for all youth;
but it is singular that he should have forgotten your modesty
and your disinterestedness, without which you never
could have waited for your advancement, or found your
situation in the mean time comfortable; which is a strong
lesson to show the poverty of glory and the importance of
regulating our minds.  If this correspondent had known
the nature of your reputation as well as I do, he would have
said, Your former writings and measures would secure attention
to your Biography, and Art of Virtue; and your Biography
and Art of Virtue, in return, would secure attention
to them.  This is an advantage attendant upon a various
character, and which brings all that belongs to it into
greater play; and it is the more useful, as perhaps more
persons are at a loss for the means of improving their
minds and characters, than they are for the time or the
inclination to do it.  But there is one concluding reflection,
sir, that will shew the use of your life as a mere piece
of biography.  This style of writing seems a little gone out of
vogue, and yet it is a very useful one; and your specimen of
it may be particularly serviceable, as it will make a subject
of comparison with the lives of various public cutthroats
and intriguers, and with absurd monastic self-tormentors or
vain literary triflers.  If it encourages more writings of
the same kind with your own, and induces more men to
spend lives fit to be written, it will be worth all Plutarch's
Lives put together.  But being tired of figuring to myself
a character of which every feature suits only one man in
the world, without giving him the praise of it, I shall end
my letter, my dear Dr. Franklin, with a personal application
to your proper self.  I am earnestly desirous, then, my
dear sir, that you should let the world into the traits of
your genuine character, as civil broils nay otherwise tend
to disguise or traduce it.  Considering your great age, the
caution of your character, and your peculiar style of thinking,
it is not likely that any one besides yourself can be
sufficiently master of the facts of your life, or the intentions
of your mind.  Besides all this, the immense revolution
of the present period, will necessarily turn our attention
towards the author of it, and when virtuous principles
have been pretended in it, it will be highly important to
shew that such have really influenced; and, as your own
character will be the principal one to receive a scrutiny, it
is proper (even for its effects upon your vast and rising
country, as well as upon England and upon Europe) that
it should stand respectable and eternal.  For the furtherance
of human happiness, I have always maintained that it is
necessary to prove that man is not even at present a vicious
and detestable animal; and still more to prove that good
management may greatly amend him; and it is for much
the same reason, that I am anxious to see the opinion
established, that there are fair characters existing among
the individuals of the race; for the moment that all men,
without exception, shall be conceived abandoned, good people
will cease efforts deemed to be hopeless, and perhaps think
of taking their share in the scramble of life, or at least of
making it comfortable principally for themselves.  Take then,
my dear sir, this work most speedily into hand: shew yourself
good as you are good; temperate as you are temperate;
and above all things, prove yourself as one, who from your
infancy have loved justice, liberty and concord, in a way
that has made it natural and consistent for you to have
acted, as we have seen you act in the last seventeen years
of your life.  Let Englishmen be made not only to respect,
but even to love you.  When they think well of individuals
in your native country, they will go nearer to thinking
well of your country; and when your countrymen see themselves
well thought of by Englishmen, they will go nearer
to thinking well of England.  Extend your views even
further; do not stop at those who speak the English tongue,
but after having settled so many points in nature and
politics, think of bettering the whole race of men.  As I
have not read any part of the life in question, but know
only the character that lived it, I write somewhat at hazard.
 I am sure, however, that the life and the treatise I allude
to (on the Art of Virtue) will necessarily fulfil the chief
of my expectations; and still more so if you take up the
measure of suiting these performances to the several views
above stated.  Should they even prove unsuccessful in all
that a sanguine admirer of yours hopes from them, you
will at least have framed pieces to interest the human
mind; and whoever gives a feeling of pleasure that is
innocent to man, has added so much to the fair side of a
life otherwise too much darkened by anxiety and too much
injured by pain.  In the hope, therefore, that you will
listen to the prayer addressed to you in this letter, I beg
to subscribe myself, my dearest sir, etc., etc.,

<hi rend="italic">Continuation of the Account of my Life, begun at<lb/>
          Passy, near Paris</hi>, 1784.<lb/>

</p><p>It is some time since I receiv'd the above letters, but I
have been too busy till now to think of complying with the
request they contain.  It might, too, be much better done
if I were at home among my papers, which would aid my
memory, and help to ascertain dates; but my return being
uncertain and having just now a little leisure, I will endeavor
to recollect and write what I can; if I live to get
home, it may there be corrected and improv'd.
</p><p>Not having any copy here of what is already written, I
know not whether an account is given of the means I used
to establish the Philadelphia public library, which, from a
small beginning, is now become so considerable, though
I remember to have come down to near the time of that
transaction (1730).  I will therefore begin here with an
account of it, which 

    <pb n="89" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p89.jpg"/>

may be struck out if found to have
been already given.
</p><p>At the time I establish'd myself in Pennsylvania, there
was not a good bookseller's shop in any of the colonies to
the southward of Boston.  In New York and Philad'a the
printers were indeed stationers; they sold only paper, etc.,
almanacs, ballads, and a few common school-books.  Those
who lov'd reading were oblig'd to send for their books
from England; the members of the Junto had each a few.
We had left the alehouse, where we first met, and hired
a room to hold our club in.  I propos'd that we should all
of us bring our books to that room, where they would not
only be ready to consult in our conferences, but become a
common benefit, each of us being at liberty to borrow
such as he wish'd to read at home.  This was accordingly
done, and for some time contented us.
</p><p>Finding the advantage of this little collection, I propos'd
to render the benefit from books more common, by commencing
a public subscription library.  I drew a sketch of the
plan and rules that would be necessary, and got a skilful
conveyancer, Mr. Charles Brockden, to put the whole in
form of articles of agreement to be subscribed, by which
each subscriber engag'd to pay a certain sum down for the
first purchase of books, and an annual contribution for
increasing them.  So few were the readers at that time in
Philadelphia, and the majority of us so poor, that I was
not able, with great industry, to find more than fifty persons,
mostly young tradesmen, willing to pay down for this purpose
forty shillings each, and ten shillings per annum.  On
this little fund we began.  The books were imported; the
library wag opened one day in the week for lending to the
subscribers, on their promissory notes to pay double the
value if not duly returned.  The institution soon manifested
its utility, was imitated by other towns, and in other
provinces.  The libraries were augmented by donations;
reading became fashionable; and our people, having no
publick amusements to divert their attention from study,
became 

    <pb n="90" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p90.jpg"/>

better acquainted with books, and in a few years
were observ'd by strangers to be better instructed and more
intelligent than people of the same rank generally are in
other countries.
</p><p>When we were about to sign the above-mentioned articles,
which were to be binding upon us, our heirs, etc.,
for fifty years, Mr. Brockden, the scrivener, said to us,
"You are young men, but it is scarcely probable that
any of you will live to see the expiration of the term fix'd
in the instrument." A number of us, however, are yet
living; but the instrument was after a few years rendered
null by a charter that incorporated and gave perpetuity to
the company.
</p><p>The objections and reluctances I met with in soliciting
the subscriptions, made me soon feel the impropriety of
presenting one's self as the proposer of any useful project,
that might be suppos'd to raise one's reputation in the
smallest degree above that of one's neighbors, when one has
need of their assistance to accomplish that project.  I therefore
put myself as much as I could out of sight, and stated
it as a scheme of a <hi rend="italic">number of friends</hi>, who had requested
me to go about and propose it to such as they thought lovers
of reading.  In this way my affair went on more smoothly,
and I ever after practis'd it on such occasions; and, from
my frequent successes, can heartily recommend it.  The
present little sacrifice of your vanity will afterwards be
amply repaid.  If it remains a while uncertain to whom
the merit belongs, some one more vain than yourself will
be encouraged to claim it, and then even envy will be
disposed to do you justice by plucking those assumed feathers,
and restoring them to their right owner.
</p><p>This library afforded me the means of improvement by
constant study, for which I set apart an hour or two each
day, and thus repair'd in some degree the loss of the learned
education my father once intended for me.  Reading was
the only amusement I allow'd myself.  I spent no time in
taverns, games, or frolicks of any kind; and my industry
in my business continu'd as indefatigable as it was necessary.
I was indebted for my printing-house; I had a young family
coming on to be educated, and I had to contend with for
business two printers, who were established in the place
before me.  My circumstances, however, grew daily easier.
My original habits of frugality continuing, and my father
having, among his instructions to me when a boy, frequently
repeated a proverb of Solomon, "Seest thou a man diligent
in his calling, he shall stand before kings, he shall not stand
before mean men," I from thence considered in-

    <pb n="91" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p91.jpg"/>

dustry as a
means of obtaining wealth and distinction, which encourag'd
me, tho' I did not think that I should ever literally <hi rend="italic">stand
before kings</hi>, which, however, has since happened; for I have
stood before <hi rend="italic">five</hi>, and even had the honor of sitting down
with one, the King of Denmark, to dinner.
</p><p>We have an English proverb that says, <hi rend="italic">"He that would
thrive, must ask his wife."</hi> It was lucky for me that I had
one as much dispos'd to industry and frugality as myself.
She assisted me cheerfully in my business, folding and stitching
pamphlets, tending shop, purchasing old linen rags for
the papermakers, etc., etc.  We kept no idle servants, our
table was plain and simple, our furniture of the cheapest.
For instance, my breakfast was a long time bread and milk
(no tea), and I ate it out of a twopenny earthen porringer,
with a pewter spoon.  But mark how luxury will enter
families, and make a progress, in spite of principle: being
call'd one morning to breakfast, I found it in a China bowl,
with a spoon of silver! They had been bought for me without
my knowledge by my wife, and had cost her the enormous
sum of three-and-twenty shillings, for which she had no other
excuse or apology to make, but that she thought her husband
deserv'd a silver spoon and China bowl as well as any of his
neighbors.  This was the first appearance of plate and China
in our house, which 

    <pb n="92" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p92.jpg"/>

afterward, in a course of years, as our
wealth increas'd, augmented gradually to several hundred
pounds in value.
</p><p>I had been religiously educated as a Presbyterian; and
tho' some of the dogmas of that persuasion, such as <hi rend="italic">the
eternal decrees of God, election, reprobation, etc</hi>., appeared
to me unintelligible, others doubtful, and I early absented
myself from the public assemblies of the sect, Sunday being
my studying day, I never was without some religious principles.
I never doubted, for instance, the existence of the
Deity; that he made the world, and govern'd it by his
Providence; that the most acceptable service of God was
the doing good to man; that our souls are immortal; and
that all crime will be punished, and virtue rewarded, either
here or hereafter.  These I esteem'd the essentials of every
religion; and, being to be found in all the religions we had
in our country, I respected them all, tho' with different
degrees of respect, as I found them more or less mix'd with
other articles, which, without any tendency to inspire, promote,
or confirm morality, serv'd principally to divide us,
and make us unfriendly to one another.  This respect to all,
with an opinion that the worst had some good effects, induc'd
me to avoid all discourse that might tend to lessen the good
opinion another might have of his own religion; and as our
province increas'd in people, and new places of worship were
continually wanted, and generally erected by voluntary contributions,
my mite for such purpose, whatever might be the
sect, was never refused.
</p><p>Tho' I seldom attended any public worship, I had still an
opinion of its propriety, and of its utility when rightly conducted,
and I regularly paid my annual subscription for the
support of the only Presbyterian 

    <pb n="93" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p93.jpg"/>

minister or meeting we had
in Philadelphia.  He us'd to visit me sometimes as a friend,
and admonish me to attend his administrations, and I was
now and then prevail'd on to do so, once for five Sundays
successively.  Had he been in my opinion a good preacher,
perhaps I might have continued, notwithstanding the occasion
I had for the Sunday's leisure in my course of study;
but his discourses were chiefly either polemic arguments, or
explications of the peculiar doctrines of our sect, and were
all to me very dry, uninteresting, and unedifying, since not
a single moral principle was inculcated or enforc'd, their aim
seeming to be rather to make us Presbyterians than good
citizens.
</p><p>At length he took for his text that verse of the fourth
chapter of Philippians, <hi rend="italic">"Finally, brethren, whatsoever things
are true, honest, just, pure, lovely, or of good report, if
there be any virtue, or any praise, think on these things."</hi>
And I imagin'd, in a sermon on such a text, we could not
miss of having some morality.  But he confin'd himself to
five points only, as meant by the apostle, viz.: 1. Keeping
holy the Sabbath day. 2. Being diligent in reading the
holy Scriptures. 3. Attending duly the publick worship.
4. Partaking of the Sacrament. 5. Paying a due respect to
God's ministers.  These might be all good things; but, as
they were not the kind of good things that I expected from
that text, I despaired of ever meeting with them from any
other, was disgusted, and attended his preaching no more.
I had some years before compos'd a little Liturgy, or form
of prayer, for my own private use (viz., in 1728), entitled,
<hi rend="italic">Articles of Belief</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Acts of Religion.</hi>  I return'd to the
use of this, and went no more to the public assemblies.  My
conduct might be blameable, but I leave it, without attempting
further to excuse it; my present purpose being to relate
facts, and not to make apologies for them.
</p><p>It was about this time I conceiv'd the bold and arduous
project of arriving at moral per-

    <pb n="94" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p94.jpg"/>

fection.  I wish'd to live
without committing any fault at any time; I would conquer
all that either natural inclination, custom, or company might
lead me into.  As I knew, or thought I knew, what was right
and wrong, I did not see why I might not always do the
one and avoid the other.  But I soon found I had undertaken
a task of more difficulty than I had imagined.  While
my care was employ'd in guarding against one fault, I was
often surprised by another; habit took the advantage
of inattention; inclination was sometimes too strong
for reason.  I concluded, at length, that the mere speculative
conviction that it was our interest to be completely
virtuous, was not sufficient to prevent our slipping;
and that the contrary habits must be broken, and good
ones acquired and established, before we can have any
dependence on a steady, uniform rectitude of conduct.
For this purpose I therefore contrived the following
method.
</p><p>In the various enumerations of the moral virtues I had
met with in my reading, I found the catalogue more or less
numerous, as different writers included more or fewer ideas
under the same name.  Temperance, for example, was by
some confined to eating and drinking, while by others it was
extended to mean the moderating every other pleasure, appetite,
inclination, or passion, bodily or mental, even to our
avarice and ambition.  I propos'd to myself, for the sake of
clearness, to use rather more names, with fewer ideas annex'd
to each, than a few names with more ideas; and I included
under thirteen names of virtues all that at that time occurr'd
to me as necessary or desirable, and annexed 

    <pb n="95" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p95.jpg"/>

to each a short
precept, which fully express'd the extent I gave to its
meaning.
</p><p>These names of virtues, with their precepts, were:

<lb/><lb/>
               1. TEMPERANCE.<lb/>
<lb/>

</p><p>My intention being to acquire the <hi rend="italic">habitude</hi> of all these
virtues, I judg'd it would be well not to distract my attention
by attempting the whole at once, but to fix it on one of
them at a time; and, when I should be master of that, then
to proceed to another, and so on, till I should have gone
thro' the thirteen; and, as the previous acquisition of some
might facilitate the acquisition of certain others, I arrang'd
them with that view, as they stand above. Temperance
first, as it tends to procure that coolness and clearness of
head, which is so necessary where constant vigilance was
to be kept up, and guard maintained against the unremitting
attraction of ancient habits, and the force of perpetual
temptations.  This being acquir'd and establish'd, Silence
would be more easy; and my desire being to gain knowledge
at the same time that I improv'd in virtue, and considering
that in conversation it was obtain'd rather by the use of
the ears than of the tongue, and therefore wishing to break
a habit I was getting into of prattling, punning, and joking,
which only made me acceptable to trifling company, I gave
<hi rend="italic">Silence</hi> the second place.  This and the next, <hi rend="italic">Order</hi>, I
expected would allow me more time for attending to my

    <pb n="97" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p97.jpg"/>

project and my studies.  <hi rend="italic">Resolution</hi>, once become habitual,
would keep me firm in my endeavors to obtain all the subsequent
virtues; <hi rend="italic">Frugality</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Industry</hi> freeing me from my
remaining debt, and producing affluence and independence,
would make more easy the practice of Sincerity and Justice,
etc., etc.  Conceiving then, that, agreeably to the advice of
Pythagoras in his Golden Verses, daily examination would
be necessary, I contrived the following method for conducting
that examination.
</p><p>I made a little book, in which I allotted a page for each
of the virtues.  I rul'd each page with red ink, so as to
have seven columns, one for each day of the week, marking
each column with a letter for the day.  I cross'd these
columns with thirteen red lines, marking the beginning of
each line with the first letter of one of the virtues, on which
line, and in its proper column, I might mark, by a little
black spot, every fault I found upon examination to have
been committed respecting that virtue upon that day.

       <pb n="98" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p98.jpg"/>

<p>I determined to give a week's strict attention to each of
the virtues successively.  Thus, in the first week, my great
guard was to avoid every the least offence against <hi rend="italic">Temperance,</hi>
leaving the other virtues to their ordinary chance,
only marking every evening the faults of the day.  Thus, if
in the first week I could keep my first line, marked T, clear
of spots, I suppos'd the habit of that virtue so much
strengthen'd and its opposite weaken'd, that I might venture
extending my attention to include the next, and for the
following week keep both lines clear of spots.  Proceeding
thus to the last, I could go thro' a course compleat in thirteen
weeks, and four courses in a year.  And like him who,
having a garden to weed, does not attempt to eradicate all
the bad herbs at once, which would exceed his reach and
his strength, but works on one of the beds at a time, and,
having accomplish'd the first, proceeds to a second, so I
should have, I hoped, the encouraging pleasure of seeing on
my pages the progress I made in virtue, by clearing successively
my lines of their spots, till in the end, by a number
of courses, I should he happy in viewing a clean book,
after a thirteen weeks' daily examination.
</p><p>This my little book had for its motto these lines from
Addison's <hi rend="italic">Cato:</hi>
<q><lg type="quatrain"><l>     "Here will I hold.  If there's a power above us</l>
<l>     (And that there is all nature cries aloud</l>
<l>     Thro' all her works), He must delight in virtue;</l>
<l>     And that which he delights in must be happy."</l></lg></q>
</p><p>Another from Cicero 

</p><p>O vitae Philosophia dux! O virtutum indagatrix expultrixque
vitiorum! Unus dies, bene et ex praeceptis tuis actus, peccanti
immortalitati est anteponendus."

</p><p>Another from the Proverbs of Solomon, speaking of
wisdom or virtue:

</p><p>"Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand riches
and honour.  Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths
are peace." iii. 16, 17.

    <pb n="99" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p99.jpg"/>

</p><p>And conceiving God to be the fountain of wisdom, I
thought it right and necessary to solicit his assistance for
obtaining it; to this end I formed the following little prayer, which was prefix'd to my tables of examination, for daily
use.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">"O powerful Goodness! bountiful Father! merciful Guide!
increase in me that wisdom which discovers my truest interest.
strengthen my resolutions to perform what that wisdom dictates.
Accept my kind offices to thy other children as the only return in
my power for thy continual favors to me." </hi>

</p><p>I used also sometimes a little prayer which I took from
Thomson's Poems viz.:

<q><lg type="stanza"><l>     "Father of light and life, thou Good Supreme!</l>
<l>     O teach me what is good; teach me Thyself!</l>
<l>     Save me from folly, vanity, and vice,</l>
<l>     From every low pursuit; and fill my soul</l>
<l>     With knowledge, conscious peace, and virtue pure;</l>
<l>     Sacred, substantial, never-fading bliss!"</l></lg></q>
</p>
<p>The precept of Order requiring that <hi rend="italic">every part of my
business should have its allotted time</hi>, one page in my little
book contain'd the following scheme of employment for the
twenty-four hours of a natural day:

</p><p>I enter'd upon the execution of this plan for self-examination,
and continu'd it with occasional intermissions for some
time.  I was surpris'd to find myself so much fuller of faults
than I had imagined; but I had the satisfaction of seeing
them diminish.  To avoid the trouble of renewing now and
then my little book, which, by scraping out the marks on
the paper of old faults to make room for new ones in a
new course, became full of holes, I transferr'd my tables
and precepts to the ivory leaves of a memorandum book,
on which the lines were drawn with red ink, that made a
durable stain, and on those lines I mark'd my faults with
a black-lead pencil, which marks I could easily wipe out
with a wet sponge.  After a while I went thro' one course
only in a year, and afterward only one in several years, till
at length I omitted them entirely, being employ'd in voyages
and business abroad, with a multiplicity of affairs that interfered;
but I always carried my little book with me.
</p><p>My scheme of ORDER gave me the most trouble; and I
found that, tho' it might be practicable where a man's business
was such as to leave him the disposition of his time,
that of a journeyman printer, for instance, it was not possible
to be exactly observed by a master, who must mix
with the world, and often receive people of business at their
own hours.  <hi rend="italic">Order,</hi> too, with regard to places for things,
papers, etc., I found extreamly difficult to acquire.  I had
not been early accustomed to it, and, having an exceeding
good memory, I was not so sensible of the inconvenience
attending want of method.  This article, therefore, cost me
so much painful attention, and my faults in it vexed me so
much, and I made so little progress in amendment, and had
such frequent relapses, that I was almost ready to give up
the attempt, and content myself with a faulty character in
that respect, like the man who, in buying an ax of a smith,
my neighbour, desired to have the whole of its surface as
bright as the edge.  The smith consented to grind it bright
for him if he would turn the wheel; he turn'd, 

    <pb n="101" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p101.jpg"/>

while the
smith press'd the broad face of the ax hard and heavily on
the stone, which made the turning of it very fatiguing.
The man came every now and then from the wheel to see
how the work went on, and at length would take his ax as it was, without farther grinding.  "No," said the smith,
"turn on, turn on; we shall have it bright by-and-by; as
yet, it is only speckled." "Yes," said the man, <hi rend="italic">"but I
think I like a speckled ax best."</hi> And I believe this may
have been the case with many, who, having, for want of
some such means as I employ'd, found the difficulty of
obtaining good and breaking bad habits in other points of
vice and virtue, have given up the struggle, and concluded
that <hi rend="italic">"a speckled ax was best"</hi>; for something, that pretended
to be reason, was every now and then suggesting to me that
such extream nicety as I exacted of myself might be a kind
of foppery in morals, which, if it were known, would make
me ridiculous; that a perfect character might be attended
with the inconvenience of being envied and hated; and that
a benevolent man should allow a few faults in himself, to
keep his friends in countenance.
</p><p>In truth, I found myself incorrigible with respect to
Order; and now I am grown old, and my memory bad, I
feel very sensibly the want of it.  But, on the whole, tho'
I never arrived at the perfection I had been so ambitious of
obtaining, but fell far short of it, yet I was, by the endeavour,
a better and a happier man than I otherwise should have
been if I had not attempted it; as those who aim at
perfect writing by imitating the engraved copies, tho' they
never reach the wish'd-for excellence of those copies, their
hand is mended by the endeavor, and is tolerable while it
continues fair and legible.
</p><p>It may be well my posterity should be informed that to
this little artifice, with the blessing of God, their ancestor
ow'd the constant felicity of his life, down to his 79th year,
in which this is written.  What reverses may attend the
remainder is in the hand of Providence; but, if they arrive,
the reflection on past happiness enjoy'd ought to help his
bearing them with more resignation.  To Temperance he
ascribes his long-continued health, and what is still left to him
of a good constitution; to Industry and Frugality, the early
easiness of his circumstances and acquisition of his fortune,
with all that knowledge that enabled him to be a useful
citizen, and obtained for him some degree of reputation
among the learned; to Sincerity and Justice, the confidence of his country, and the honorable employs it conferred upon
him; and to the joint influence of the whole mass of the
virtues, even in the imperfect state he was able to acquire
them, all that evenness of temper, and that cheerfulness in
conversation, which makes his company still sought for, and
agreeable even to his younger acquaintance.  I hope, therefore,
that some of my descendants may follow the example
and reap the benefit.
</p><p>It will be remark'd that, tho' my scheme was not wholly
without religion, there was 

    <pb n="102" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p102.jpg"/>

in it no mark of any of the
distingishing tenets of any particular sect.  I had purposely
avoided them; for, being fully persuaded of the utility and
excellency of my method, and that it might be serviceable
to people in all religions, and intending some time or other
to publish it, I would not have any thing in it that should
prejudice any one, of any sect, against it.  I purposed
writing a little comment on each virtue, in which I would
have shown the advantages of possessing it, and the mischiefs
attending its opposite vice; and I should have called
my book THE ART OF VIRTUE,
<ref target="Fra2Aut.8">[8]</ref>
because it would have shown
the means and manner of obtaining virtue, which would
have distinguished it from the mere exhortation to be good,
that does not instruct and indicate the means, but is like
the apostle's man of verbal charity, who only without showing
to the naked and hungry how or where they might get
clothes or victuals, exhorted them to be fed and clothed. 
James ii. 15, 16.
</p><p>But it so happened that my intention of writing and
publishing this comment was never fulfilled.  I did, indeed,
from time to time, put down short hints of the sentiments,
reasonings, etc., to be made use of in it, some of which I
have still by me; but the necessary close attention to private
business in the earlier part of thy life, and public business
since, have occasioned my postponing it; for, it being connected
in my mind with <hi rend="italic">a great and extensive project,</hi> that
required the whole man to execute, and which an unforeseen
succession of employs prevented my attending to, it has
hitherto remain'd unfinish'd.
</p><p>In this piece it was my design to explain and enforce this
doctrine, that vicious actions are not hurtful because they
are forbidden, but forbidden because they are hurtful, the
nature of man alone considered; that it was, therefore,
every 

    <pb n="103" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p103.jpg"/>

one's interest to be virtuous who wish'd to be happy
even in this world; and I should, from this circumstance
(there being always in the world a number of rich merchants,
nobility, states, and princes, who have need of honest
instruments for the management of their affairs, and such
being so rare), have endeavored to convince young persons
that no qualities were so likely to make a poor man's fortune
as those of probity and integrity.
</p><p>My list of virtues contain'd at first but twelve; but a
Quaker friend having kindly informed me that I was generally
thought proud; that my pride show'd itself frequently
in conversation; that I was not content with being in the
right when discussing any point, but was overbearing, and
rather insolent, of which he convinc'd me by mentioning
several instances; I determined endeavouring to cure myself,
if I could, of this vice or folly among the rest, and I added
Humility to my list) giving an extensive meaning to the
word.
</p><p>I cannot boast of much success in acquiring the <hi rend="italic">reality</hi>
of this virtue, but I had a good deal with regard to the
<hi rend="italic">appearance</hi> of it.  I made it a rule to forbear all direct contradiction
to the sentiments of others, and all positive assertion
of my own.  I even forbid myself, agreeably to the old
laws of our Junto, the use of every word or expression in
the language that imported a fix'd opinion, such as <hi rend="italic">certainly,
undoubtedly</hi>, etc., and I adopted, instead of them, <hi rend="italic">I conceive,
I apprehend,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">I imagine</hi> a thing to be so or so; or it
<hi rend="italic">so appears to me at present</hi>.  When another asserted something
that I thought an error, I deny'd myself the pleasure
of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing immediately
some absurdity in his proposition; and in answering I began
by observing that in certain cases or circumstances his
opinion would be right, but in the present case there <hi rend="italic">appear'd</hi>
or <hi rend="italic">seem'd</hi> to me some difference, etc.  I soon found the
advantage of this change in my manner; 

    <pb n="104" facs="pageImages/Franklin-p104.jpg"/>

the conversations
I engag'd in went on more pleasantly.  The modest way in
which I propos'd my opinions procur'd them a readier reception
and less contradiction; I had less mortification when I
was found to be in the wrong, and I more easily prevail'd
with others to give up their mistakes and join with me when
I happened to be in the right.
</p><p>And this mode, which I at first put on with some violence
to natural inclination, became at length so easy, and so
habitual to me, that perhaps for these fifty years past no
one has ever heard a dogmatical expression escape me.  And
to this habit (after my character of integrity) I think it
principally owing that I had early so much weight with my
fellow-citizens when I proposed new institutions, or alterations
in the old, and so much influence in public councils
when I became a member; for I was but a bad speaker,
never eloquent, subject to much hesitation in my choice of
words, hardly correct in language, and yet I generally
carried my points.
</p><p>In reality, there is, perhaps, no one of our natural passions
so hard to subdue as <hi rend="italic">pride.</hi>  Disguise it, struggle with it,
beat it down, stifle it, mortify it as much as one pleases,
it is still alive, and will every now and then peep out and
show itself; you will see it, perhaps, often in this history;
for, even if I could conceive that I had compleatly overcome
it, I should probably be proud of my humility.

       <p>[<hi rend="italic">"I am now about to write at home, August, 1788, but can<lb/>

<p>
HAVING mentioned a great and extensive project
which I had conceiv'd, it seems proper that some
account should be here given of that project and its
object.  Its first rise in my mind appears in the following
little paper, accidentally preserv'd, viz.:
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Observations</hi> on my reading history, in Library, May
19th, 1731.
</p><p>"That the great affairs of the world, the wars, revolutions,
etc., are carried on and affected by parties.
</p><p> "That the view of these parties is their present general
interest, or what they take to be such.
</p><p>"That the different views of these different parties occasion
all confusion.
</p><p>"That while a party is carrying on a general design, each
man has his particular private interest in view.
</p><p>"That as soon as a party has gain'd its general point,
each member becomes intent upon his particular interest;
which, thwarting others, breaks that party into divisions,
and occasions more confusion.
</p><p>"That few in public affairs act from a meer view of the
good of their country, whatever they may pretend; and,
tho' their actings bring real good to their country, yet men
primarily considered that their own and their country's
interest was united, and did not act from a principle of
benevolence.
</p>
       <p>"That fewer still, in public affairs, act with a view to
the good of mankind.
</p>
       <p>"There seems to me at present to be great occasion for
raising a United Party for Virtue, by forming the virtuous
and good men of all nations into a regular body, to
be govern'd by suitable good and wise rules, which good and
wise men may probably be more unanimous in their obedience
to, than common people are to common laws.
</p><p>"I at present think that whoever attempts this aright,
and is well qualified, can not fail of pleasing God, and of
meeting with success.                                B. F."
</p><p>Revolving this project in my mind, as to be undertaken
hereafter, when my circumstances should afford me the
necessary leisure, I put down from time to time, on pieces
of paper, such thoughts as occurr'd to me respecting it.
Most of these are lost; but I find one purporting to be the
substance of an intended creed) containing, as I thought,
the essentials of every known religion, and being free of
every thing that might shock the professors of any religion.
It is express'd in these words, viz.:
</p><p>"That there is one God, who made all things.
</p><p>"That he governs the world by his providence.
</p><p>"That he ought to be worshiped by adoration, prayer,
and thanksgiving.
</p><p> "But that the most acceptable service of God is doing
good to man.
</p><p>"That the soul is immortal.
</p><p>"And that God will certainly reward virtue and punish
vice either here or hereafter."
<ref target="Fra2Aut.10">[10]</ref>
</p><p>My ideas at that time were, that the sect should be begun
and spread at first among young and single men only; that
each person to be initiated should not only declare his assent
to such creed, but should have exercised himself with the
thirteen weeks' examination and practice of the virtues) as
in the before-mention'd model; that the existence of such
a society should he kept a secret, till it was become considerable,
to prevent solicitations for the admission of improper
persons, but that the members should each of them search
among his acquaintance for ingenuous, well-disposed youths,
to whom, with prudent caution, the scheme should be gradually
communicated; that the members should engage to
afford their advice, assistance, and support to each other in
promoting one another's interests, business, and advancement
in life; that, for distinction, we should be call'd <hi rend="italic">The Society
of the Free and Easy:</hi> free, as being, by the general practice
and habit of the virtues, free from the dominion of vice;
and particularly by the practice of industry and frugality,
free from debt, which exposes a man to confinement, and
a species of slavery to his creditors.
</p><p>This is as much as I can now recollect of the project,
except that I communicated it in part to two young men,
who adopted it with some enthusiasm; but my then narrow
circumstances, and the necessity I was under of sticking
close to my business, occasion'd my postponing the further
prosecution of it at that time; and my multifarious occupations,
public and private, induc'd me to continue postponing,
so that it has been omitted till I have no longer
strength or activity left sufficient for such an enterprise;
tho' I am still of opinion that it was a practicable scheme,
and might have been very useful, by forming a great number
of good citizens; and I was not discourag'd by the seeming
magnitude of the undertaking, as I have always thought
that one man of tolerable abilities may work great changes,
and accomplish great affairs among mankind, if he first
forms a good plan, and, cutting off all amusements or other
employments that would divert his attention, makes the execution
of that same plan his sole study and business.
</p><p>In 1732 I first publish'd my Almanack, under the name
	of <hi rend="italic">Richard Saunders</hi>; it was continu'd by me about twenty-five years, commonly call'd <hi rend="italic">Poor Richard's Almanac</hi>.  I
endeavor'd to make it both entertaining and useful, and it
accordingly came to be in such demand, that I reap'd considerable
profit from it, vending annually near ten thousand.
And observing that it was generally read, scarce any neighborhood
in the province being without it, I consider'd it as
a proper vehicle for conveying instruction among the common
people, who bought scarcely any other books; I therefore
filled all the little spaces that occurr'd between the
remarkable days in the calendar with proverbial sentences,
chiefly such as inculcated industry and frugality, as the
means of procuring wealth, and thereby securing virtue; it
being more difficult for a man in want, to act always honestly,
as, to use here one of those proverbs, <hi rend="italic">it is hard for an
empty sack to stand up-right.</hi>
</p>
       <p>These proverbs I found a page with a bunch of the quotes., which contained the wisdom of many
ages and nations, I assembled and form'd into a connected
discourse prefix'd to the Almanack of 1757, as the harangue of a wise old man to the people attending an auction.  The
bringing all these scatter'd counsels thus into a focus enabled
them to make greater impression. The piece, being universally
approved, was copied in all the newspapers of the Continent;
reprinted in Britain on a broad side, to be stuck up in
houses; two translations were made of it in French, and
great numbers bought by the clergy and gentry, to distribute
gratis among their poor parishioners and tenants.  In Pennsylvania,
as it discouraged useless expense in foreign superfluities,
some thought it had its share of influence in producing
that growing plenty of money which was observable
for several years after its publication.
</p>
       <p>I considered my newspaper, also, as another means of
communicating instruction, and in that view frequently
reprinted in it extracts from the Spectator, and other moral
writers; and sometimes publish'd little pieces of my own,
which had been first compos'd for reading in our Junto.  Of
these are a Socratic dialogue, tending to prove that, whatever
might be his parts and abilities, a vicious man could
not properly be called a man of sense; and a discourse on
self-denial, showing that virtue was not secure till its practice
became a habitude, and was free from the opposition of
contrary inclinations.  These may be found in the papers about the beginning of 1735.
</p>
       <p>In the conduct of my newspaper, I carefully excluded all
libelling and personal abuse, which is of late years become
so disgraceful to our country.  Whenever I was solicited
to insert anything of that kind, and the writers pleaded, as
they generally did, the liberty of the press, and that a newspaper
was like a stagecoach, in which any one who would
pay had a right to a place, my answer was, that I would
print the piece separately if desired, and the author might
have as many copies as he pleased to distribute himself,
but that I would not take upon me to spread his detraction;
and that, having contracted with my subscribers to furnish
them with what might be either useful or entertaining, I
could not fill their papers with private altercation, in which
they had no concern, without doing them manifest injustice.
Now, many of our printers make no scruple of gratifying
the malice of individuals by false accusations of the fairest
characters among ourselves, augmenting animosity even to
the producing of duels; and are, moreover, so indiscreet as
to print scurrilous reflections on the government of neighboring
states, and even on the conduct of our best national
allies, which may be attended with the most pernicious consequences.
These things I mention as a caution to young
printers, and that they may be encouraged not to pollute their
presses and disgrace their profession by such infamous practices,
but refuse steadily, as they may see by my example
that such a course of conduct will not, on the whole, be injurious
to their interests.
</p>
       <p>In 1733 I sent one of my journeymen to Charleston, South
Carolina, where a printer was wanting. I furnish'd him
with a press and letters, on an agreement of partnership,
by which I was to receive one-third of the profits of the
business, paying one-third of the expense.  He was a man
of learning, and honest but ignorant in matters of account;
and, tho' he sometimes made me remittances, I could get no
account from him, nor any satisfactory state of our partnership
while he lived.  On his decease, the business was continued
by his widow, who, being born and bred in Holland,
where, as I have been inform'd, the knowledge of accounts
makes a part of female education, she not only sent me as
clear a state as she could find of the transactions past, but
continued to account with the greatest regularity and exactness
every quarter afterwards, and managed the business
with such success, that she not only brought up reputably
a family of children, but, at the expiration of the term,
was able to purchase of me the printing-house, and establish
her son in it.
</p>
       <p>I mention this affair chiefly for the sake of recommending
that branch of education for our young females, as likely
to be of more use to them and their children, in case of widowhood, than either music or dancing, by preserving
them from losses by imposition of crafty men, and enabling
them to continue, perhaps, a profitable mercantile house,
with establish'd correspondence, till a son is grown up fit to
undertake and go on with it, to the lasting advantage and
enriching of the family.
</p>
       <p>About the year 1734 there arrived among us from Ireland a young Presbyterian preacher, named Hemphill, who delivered
with a good voice, and apparently extempore, most
excellent discourses, which drew together considerable numbers
of different persuasion, who join'd in admiring them.
Among the rest, I became one of his constant hearers, his
sermons pleasing me, as they had little of the dogmatical
kind, but inculcated strongly the practice of virtue, or what
in the religious stile figure out what stile means in a religious sense are called good works.  Those, however,
of our congregation, who considered themselves as orthodox
Presbyterians, disapprov'd his doctrine, and were join'd by
most of the old clergy, who arraign'd him of heterodoxy
before the synod, in order to have him silenc'd.  I became
his zealous partisan, and contributed all I could to raise a
party in his favour, and we combated for him a while with
some hopes of success.  There was much scribbling pro and
con upon the occasion; and finding that, tho' an elegant
preacher, he was but a poor writer, I lent him my pen and
wrote for him two or three pamphlets, and one piece in the
Gazette of April, 1735. Those pamphlets, as is generally
the case with controversial writings, tho' eagerly read at the
time, were soon out of vogue, and I question whether a
single copy of them now exists.
</p>
       <p>During the contest an unlucky occurrence hurt his cause
exceedingly.  One of our adversaries having heard him
preach a sermon that was much admired, thought he had
somewhere read the sermon before, or at least a part of it.
On search he found that part quoted at length, in one of
the British Reviews, from a discourse of Dr. Foster's.  This
detection gave many of our party disgust, who accordingly
abandoned his cause, and occasion'd our more speedy discomfiture
in the synod.  I stuck by him, however, as I rather
approv'd his giving us good sermons compos'd by others,
than bad ones of his own manufacture, tho' the latter was
the practice of our common teachers.  He afterward acknowledg'd
to me that none of those he preach'd were his own;
adding, that his memory was such as enabled him to retain
and repeat any sermon after one reading only.  On our
defeat, he left us in search elsewhere of better fortune, and
I quitted the congregation, never joining it after, tho' I
continu'd many years my subscription for the support of
its ministers.
</p>
       <p>I had begun in 1733 to study languages; I soon made
myself so much a master of the French as to be able to
read the books with ease. I then undertook the Italian. An
acquaintance, who was also learning it, us'd often to tempt
me to play chess with him. Finding this took up too much
of the time I had to spare for study, I at length refus'd
to play any more, unless on this condition, that the victor
in every game should have a right to impose a task, either
in parts of the grammar to be got by heart, or in translations,
etc., which tasks the vanquish'd was to perform upon
honour, before our next meeting.  As we play'd pretty
equally, we thus beat one another into that language. I
afterwards with a little painstaking, acquir'd as much of
the Spanish as to read their books also.
</p>
       <p>I have already mention'd that I had only one year's instruction
in a Latin school, and that when very young, after
which I neglected that language entirely.  But, when I had
attained an acquaintance with the French, Italian, and
Spanish, I was surpriz'd to find, on looking over a Latin
Testament, that I understood so much more of that language
than I had imagined, which encouraged me to apply myself
again to the study of it, and I met with more success, as those
preceding languages had greatly smooth'd my way.
</p><p>From these circumstances, I have thought that there is
some inconsistency in our common mode of teaching languages.
We are told that it is proper to begin first with
the Latin, and, having acquir'd that, it will be more easy
to attain those modern languages which are deriv'd from it;
and yet we do not begin with the Greek, in order more
easily to acquire the Latin.  It is true that, if you can
clamber and get to the top of a staircase without using the
steps, you will more easily gain them in descending; but
certainly, if you begin with the lowest you will with more
ease ascend to the top; and I would therefore offer it to
the consideration of those who superintend the education of
our youth, whether, since many of those who begin with
the Latin quit the same after spending some years without
having made any great proficiency, and what they have
learnt becomes almost useless, so that their time has been
lost, it would not have been better to have begun with the
French, proceeding to the Italian, etc.; for, tho', after
spending the same time, they should quit the study of languages
and never arrive at the Latin, they would, however,
have acquired another tongue or two, that, being in modern
use, might be serviceable to them in common life.
</p>
       <p>After ten years' absence from Boston, and having become
easy in my circumstances, I made a journey thither to visit
my relations, which I could not sooner well afford. In
returning, I call'd at Newport to see my brother, then settled
there with his printing-house. Our former differences were
forgotten, and our meeting was very cordial and affectionate.
He was fast declining in his health, and requested
of me that, in case of his death, which he apprehended not
far distant, I would take home his son, then but ten years
of age, and bring him up to the printing business. This I
accordingly perform'd, sending him a few years to school
before I took him into the office. His mother carried on
the business till he was grown up, when I assisted him with
an assortment of new types, those of his father being in a
manner worn out.  Thus it was that I made my brother
ample amends for the service I had depriv'd him of by
leaving him so early.
</p>
       <p>In 1736 I lost one of my sons, a fine boy of four years old, by the small-pox, taken in the common way.  I long
regretted bitterly, and still regret that I had not given it
to him by inoculation. This I mention for the sake of
parents who omit that operation, on the supposition that
they should never forgive themselves if a child died under
it; my example showing that the regret may be the same
either way, and that, therefore, the safer should be chosen.
</p>
       <p>Our club, the Junto, was found so useful, and afforded
such satisfaction to the members, that several were desirous
of introducing their friends, which could not well be done
without exceeding what we had settled as a convenient
number, viz., twelve.  We had from the beginning made it
a rule to keep our institution a secret, which was pretty well
observ'd; the intention was to avoid applications of improper
persons for admittance, some of whom, perhaps, we might
find it difficult to refuse.  I was one of those who were
against any addition to our number, but, instead of it, made
in writing a proposal, that every member separately should
endeavor to form a subordinate club, with the same rules
respecting queries, etc., and without informing them of the
connection with the Junto.  The advantages proposed were,
the improvement of so many more young citizens by the use
of our institutions; our better acquaintance with the general
sentiments of the inhabitants on any occasion, as the Junto
member might propose what queries we should desire, and
was to report to the Junto what pass'd in his separate club;
the promotion of our particular interests in business by more
extensive recommendation, and the increase of our influence
in public affairs, and our power of doing good by spreading
thro' the several clubs the sentiments of the Junto.
</p>
       <p>The project was approv'd, and every member undertook
to form his club, but they did not all succeed.  Five or six
only were compleated, which were called by different names,
as the Vine, the Union, the Band, etc.  They were useful to
themselves, and afforded us a good deal of amusement,
information, and instruction, besides answering, in some
considerable degree, our views of influencing the public
opinion on particular occasions, of which I shall give some
instances in course of time as they happened.
</p>
       <p>My first promotion was my being chosen, in 1736, clerk
of the General Assembly.  The choice was made that year
without opposition; but the year following, when I was
again propos'd (the choice, like that of the members, being
annual), a new member made a long speech against me, in
order to favour some other candidate.  I was, however,
chosen, which was the more agreeable to me, as, besides the
pay for the immediate service as clerk, the place gave me a
better opportunity of keeping up an interest among the
members, which secur'd to me the business of printing the votes, laws, paper money, and other occasional jobbs for
the public, that, on the whole, were very profitable.
</p>
       <p>I therefore did not like the opposition of this new member,
who was a gentleman of fortune and education, with talents
that were likely to give him, in time, great influence in the
House, which, indeed, afterwards happened.  I did not, however,
aim at gaining his favour by paying any servile respect
to him, but, after some time, took this other method.  Having
heard that he had in his library a certain very scarce
and curious book, I wrote a note to him, expressing my
desire of perusing that book, and requesting he would do
me the favour of lending it to me for a few days.  He sent
it immediately, and I return'd it in about a week with
another note, expressing strongly my sense of the favour.
When we next met in the House, he spoke to me (which he
had never done before), and with great civility; and he
ever after manifested a readiness to serve me on all occasions,
so that we became great friends, and our friendship
continued to his death.  This is another instance of the
truth of an old maxim I had learned, which says, <hi rend="italic">"He that
has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you
another, than he whom you yourself have obliged."</hi> And it
shows how much more profitable it is prudently to remove,
than to resent, return, and continue inimical proceedings.
</p>
       <p>In 1737, Colonel Spotswood, late governor of Virginia,
and then postmaster-general, being dissatisfied with the conduct
of his deputy at Philadelphia, respecting some negligence
in rendering, and inexactitude of his accounts, took
from him the commission and offered it to me. I accepted
it readily, and found it of great advantage; for, tho' the
salary was small, it facilitated the correspondence that
improv'd my newspaper, increas'd the number demanded, as
well as the advertisements to be inserted, so that it came to
afford me a considerable income.  My old competitor's newspaper
declin'd proportionably, and I was satisfy'd without
retaliating his refusal, while postmaster, to permit my papers
being carried by the riders.  Thus he suffer'd greatly from
his neglect in due accounting; and I mention it as a lesson
to those young men who may be employ'd in managing
affairs for others, that they should always render accounts,
and make remittances, with great clearness and punctuality.
The character of observing such a conduct is the most
powerful of all recommendations to new employments and
increase of business.
</p>
       <p>I began now to turn my thoughts a little to public affairs,
beginning, however, with small matters.  The city watch
was one of the first things that I conceiv'd to want regulation.
It was managed by the constables of the respective
wards in turn; the constable warned a number of housekeepers
to attend him for the night.  Those who chose never
to attend paid him six shillings a year to be excus'd, which
was suppos'd to be for hiring substitutes, but was, in reality,
much more than was necessary for that purpose, and made
the constableship a place of profit; and the constable, for a
little drink, often got such ragamuffins about him as a watch,
that respectable housekeepers did not choose to mix with.
Walking the rounds, too, was often neglected, and most of
the nights spent in tippling.  I thereupon wrote a paper, to
be read in Junto, representing these irregularities, but insisting
more particularly on the inequality of this six-shilling
tax of the constables, respecting the circumstances of those
who paid it, since a poor widow housekeeper, all whose
property to be guarded by the watch did not perhaps exceed
the value of fifty pounds, paid as much as the wealthiest
merchant, who had thousands of pounds worth of goods
in his stores.
</p>
       <p>On the whole, I proposed as a more effectual watch, the
hiring of proper men to serve constantly in that business;
and as a more equitable way of supporting the charge the
levying a tax that should be proportion'd to the property.
This idea, being approv'd by the Junto, was communicated
to the other clubs, but as arising in each of them; and
though the plan was not immediately carried into execution,
yet, by preparing the minds of people for the change, it
paved the way for the law obtained a few years after, when
the members of our clubs were grown into more influence.
</p>
       <p>About this time I wrote a paper (first to be read in
Junto, but it was afterward publish'd) on the different accidents
and carelessnesses by which houses were set on fire,
with cautions against them, and means proposed of avoiding
them.  This was much spoken of as a useful piece, and gave
rise to a project, which soon followed it, of forming a
company for the more ready extinguishing of fires, and
mutual assistance in removing and securing the goods when
in danger.  Associates in this scheme were presently found,
amounting to thirty.  Our articles of agreement oblig'd
every member to keep always in good order, and fit for use,
a certain number of leather buckets, with strong bags and
baskets (for packing and transporting of goods), which
were to be brought to every fire; and we agreed to meet
once a month and spend a social evening together, in discoursing
and communicating such ideas as occurred to us
upon the subject of fires, as might be useful in our conduct
on such occasions.
</p>
       <p>The utility of this institution soon appeared, and many
more desiring to be admitted than we thought convenient for
one company, they were advised to form another, which was
accordingly done; and this went on, one new company being
formed after another, till they became so numerous as to
include most of the inhabitants who were men of property;
and now, at the time of my writing this, tho' upward of
fifty years since its establishment, that which I first formed,
called the Union Fire Company, still subsists and flourishes,
tho' the first members are all deceas'd but myself and one,
who is older by a year than I am.  The small fines that have
been paid by members for absence at the monthly meetings
have been apply'd to the purchase of fire-engines, ladders,
fire-hooks, and other useful implements for each company,
so that I question whether there is a city in the world better
provided with the means of putting a stop to beginning conflagrations;
and, in fact, since these institutions, the city has
never lost by fire more than one or two houses at a time,
and the flames have often been extinguished before the
house in which they began has been half consumed.
</p>
       <p>In 1739 arrived among us from Ireland the Reverend Mr.
Whitefield, who had made himself remarkable there as an
itinerant preacher. He was at first permitted to preach in
some of our churches; but the clergy, taking a dislike to
him, soon refus'd him their pulpits, and he was oblig'd to
preach in the fields.  The multitudes of all sects and denominations that attended his sermons were enormous, and it
was matter of speculation to me, who was one of the number,
to observe the extraordinary influence of his oratory on
his hearers, and bow much they admir'd and respected him,
notwithstanding his common abuse of them, by assuring
them that they were naturally <hi rend="italic">half beasts and half devils.</hi>
It was wonderful to see the change soon made in the manners
of our inhabitants.  From being thoughtless or indifferent
about religion, it seem'd as if all the world were
growing religious, so that one could not walk thro' the
town in an evening without hearing psalms sung in different
families of every street.
</p>
       <p>And it being found inconvenient to assemble in the open
air, subject to its inclemencies, the building of a house to
meet in was no sooner propos'd, and persons appointed to
receive contributions, but sufficient sums were soon receiv'd
to procure the ground and erect the building, which was one
hundred feet long and seventy broad, about the size of
Westminster Hall; and the work was carried on with such
spirit as to be finished in a much shorter time than could
have been expected.  Both house and ground were vested
in trustees, expressly for the use of any preacher of any
religious persuasion who might desire to say something to
the people at Philadelphia; the design in building not being
to accommodate any particular sect, but the inhabitants in
general; so that even if the Mufti of Constantinople were
to send a missionary to preach Mohammedanism to us, he
would find a pulpit at his service.
</p>
       <p>>Mr. Whitefield, in leaving us, went preaching all the way
thro' the colonies to Georgia. The settlement of that
province had lately been begun, but, instead of being made
with hardy, industrious husbandmen, accustomed to labor,
the only people fit for such an enterprise, it was with families
of broken shop-keepers and other insolvent debtors, many
of indolent and idle habits, taken out of the jails, who, being
set down in the woods, unqualified for clearing land, and
unable to endure the hardships of a new settlement, perished
in numbers, leaving many helpless children unprovided for.
The sight of their miserable situation inspir'd the benevolent
heart of Mr. Whitefield with the idea of building an Orphan
House there, in which they might be supported and educated.
Returning northward, he preach'd up this charity, and made
large collections, for his eloquence had a wonderful power
over the hearts and purses of his hearers, of which I myself
was an instance.
</p>
       <p>I did not disapprove of the design, but, as Georgia was
then destitute of materials and workmen, and it was proposed
to send them from Philadelphia at a great expense,
I thought it would have been better to have built the house
here, and brought the children to it.  This I advis'd; but
he was resolute in his first project, rejected my counsel, and
I therefore refus'd to contribute.  I happened soon after to
attend one of his sermons, in the course of which I perceived
he intended to finish with a collection, and I silently
resolved he should get nothing from me, I had in my pocket
a handful of copper money, three or four silver dollars, and
five pistoles in gold. As he proceeded I began to soften,
and concluded to give the coppers. Another stroke of his
oratory made me asham'd of that, and determin'd me to
give the silver; and he finish'd so admirably, that I empty'd
my pocket wholly into the collector's dish, gold and all.  At
this sermon there was also one of our club, who, being of
my sentiments respecting the building in Georgia, and suspecting
a collection might be intended, had, by precaution,
emptied his pockets before he came from home. Towards
the conclusion of the discourse, however, he felt a strong
desire to give, and apply'd to a neighbour, who stood near
him, to borrow some money for the purpose. The application
was unfortunately [made] to perhaps the only man in
the company who had the firmness not to be affected by the
preacher. His answer was, "At any other time, Friend
Hopkinson, I would lend to thee freely; but not now, for
thee seems to be out of thy right senses."
</p>
       <p>Some of Mr. Whitefield's enemies affected to suppose that
he would apply these collections to his own private emolument;
but I who was intimately acquainted with him (being
employed in printing his Sermons and Journals, etc.), never
had the least suspicion of his integrity, but am to this day
decidedly of opinion that he was in all his conduct a perfectly
<hi rend="italic">honest man;</hi> and methinks my testimony in his favour ought to have the more weight, as we had no religious connection.
He us'd, indeed, sometimes to pray for my conversion,
but never had the satisfaction of believing that his
prayers were heard.  Ours was a mere civil friendship, sincere
on both sides, and lasted to his death.
</p>
       <p>The following instance will show something of the terms
on which we stood. Upon one of his arrivals from England
at Boston, he wrote to me that he should come soon to
Philadelphia, but knew not where he could lodge when there,
as he understood his old friend and host, Mr. Benezet, was
removed to Germantown. My answer was, "You know my
house; if you can make shift with its scanty accommodations,
you will be most heartily welcome." He reply'd, that
if I made that kind offer for Christ's sake, I should not miss
of a reward. And I returned, <hi rend="italic">"Don't let me be mistaken;
it was not for Christ's sake, but for your sake."</hi> One of our
common acquaintance jocosely remark'd, that, knowing it to
be the custom of the saints, when they received any favour,
to shift the burden of the obligation from off their own
shoulders, and place it in heaven, I had contriv'd to fix it
on earth.
</p>
       <p>The last time I saw Mr. Whitefield was in London, when
he consulted me about his Orphan House concern, and his
purpose of appropriating it to the establishment of a college.
</p>
       <p>He had a loud and clear voice, and articulated his words
and sentences so perfectly, that he might be heard and
understood at a great distance, especially as his auditories,
however numerous, observ'd the most exact silence. He
preach'd one evening from the top of the Court-house steps,
which are in the middle of Market-street, and on the west
side of Second-street, which crosses it at right angles. Both
streets were fill'd with his hearers to a considerable distance.
Being among the hindmost in Market-street, I had the
curiosity to learn how far he could be heard, by retiring
backwards down the street towards the river; and I found
his voice distinct till I came near Front-street, when some
noise in that street obscur'd it. Imagining then a semi-circle, of which my distance should be the radius, and that
it were fill'd with auditors, to each of whom I allow'd two
square feet, I computed that he might well be heard by more than thirty thousand.  This reconcil'd me to the newspaper
accounts of his having preach'd to twenty-five thousand
people in the fields, and to the antient histories of generals
haranguing whole armies, of which I had sometimes doubted.
</p>
       <p>By hearing him often, I came to distinguish easily between
sermons newly compos'd, and those which he had often
preach'd in the course of his travels.  His delivery of the
latter was so improv'd by frequent repetitions that every
accent, every emphasis, every modulation of voice, was so
perfectly well turn'd and well plac'd, that, without being interested
in the subject, one could not help being pleas'd with
the discourse; a pleasure of much the same kind with that
receiv'd from an excellent piece of musick.  This is an
advantage itinerant preachers have over those who are stationary,
as the latter can not well improve their delivery of
a sermon by so many rehearsals.
</p>
       <p>His writing and printing from time to time gave great
advantage to his enemies; unguarded expressions, and even
erroneous opinions, delivered in preaching, might have been
afterwards explain'd or qualifi'd by supposing others that
might have accompani'd them, or they might have been
deny'd; but <hi rend="italic">litera scripta manet.</hi> Critics attack'd his writings
violently, and with so much appearance of reason as to
diminish the number of his votaries and prevent their encrease;
so that I am of opinion if he had never written any
thing, he would have left behind him a much more numerous
and important sect, and his reputation might in that case
have been still growing, even after his death, as there being
nothing of his writing on which to found a censure and give
him a lower character, his proselytes would be left at liberty
to feign for him as great a variety of excellence as their
enthusiastic admiration might wish him to have possessed.
</p>
       <p>My business was now continually augmenting, and my
circumstances growing daily easier, my newspaper having
become very profitable, as being for a time almost the only
one in this and the neighbouring provinces.  I experienced,
too, the truth of the observation, <hi rend="italic">"that after getting the first
hundred pound, it is more easy to get the second,"</hi> money
itself being of a prolific nature.
</p>
       <p>The partnership at Carolina having succeeded, I was encourag'd to engage in others, and to promote several of my
workmen, who had behaved well, by establishing them with
printing-houses in different colonies, on the same terms with
that in Carolina. Most of them did well, being enabled at
the end of our term, six years, to purchase the types of me
and go on working for themselves, by which means several
families were raised. Partnerships often finish in quarrels;
but I was happy in this, that mine were all carried on and
ended amicably, owing, I think, a good deal to the precaution
of having very explicitly settled, in our articles, every
thing to be done by or expected from each partner, so that
there was nothing to dispute, which precaution I would
therefore recommend to all who enter into partnerships; for,
whatever esteem partners may have for, and confidence in
each other at the time of the contract, little jealousies and
disgusts may arise, with ideas of inequality in the care and
burden of the business, etc., which are attended often with
breach of friendship and of the connection, perhaps with
lawsuits and other disagreeable consequences.
</p>
       <p>I had, on the whole, abundant reason to be satisfied with
my being established in Pennsylvania. There were, however,
two things that I regretted, there being no provision for
defense, nor for a compleat education of youth; no militia,
nor any college. I therefore, in 1743, drew up a proposal
for establishing an academy; and at that time, thinking the
Reverend Mr. Peters, who was out of employ, a fit person
to superintend such an institution, I communicated the project
to him; but he, having more profitable views in the service
of the proprietaries, which succeeded, declin'd the undertaking;
and, not knowing another at that time suitable for
such a trust, I let the scheme lie a while dormant.  I succeeded
better the next year, 1744, in proposing and establishing
a Philosophical Society. The paper I wrote for that
purpose will be found among my writings, when collected.
</p><p>With respect to defense, Spain having been several years at war against Great Britain, and being at length join'd by
France, which brought us into great danger; and the
laboured and long-continued endeavour of our governor,
Thomas, to prevail with our Quaker Assembly to pass a
militia law, and make other provisions for the security of
the province, having proved abortive, I determined to try
what might be done by a voluntary association of the people.
To promote this, I first wrote and published a pamphlet,
entitled <ref target="s063">Plain Truth</ref><note id="s063">(DRAFT) Plain Truth was a political brochure that Franklin wrote in 1747 in response to foreign military action that had been taking place along the Delaware coast without any British interference. Franklin's pamphlet was successful and he was even asked to help plan the association in response. For more information and a copy of the text: https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-03-02-0091

Add picture</note>, in which I stated our defenceless
situation in strong lights, with the necessity of union and
discipline for our defense, and promis'd to propose in a few
days an association, to be generally signed for that purpose.
The pamphlet had a sudden and surprising effect.  I was
call'd upon for the instrument of association, and having
settled the draft of it with a few friends, I appointed a
meeting of the citizens in the large building before mentioned.
The house was pretty full; I had prepared a number of
printed copies, and provided pens and ink dispers'd all over
the room.  I harangued them a little on the subject, read the
paper, and explained it, and then distributed the copies, which
were eagerly signed, not the least objection being made.
</p><p>When the company separated, and the papers were collected,
we found above twelve hundred hands; and, other
copies being dispersed in the country, the subscribers
amounted at length to upward of ten thousand.  These all
furnished themselves as soon as they could with arms, formed
themselves into companies and regiments, chose their own
officers, and met every week to be instructed in the manual
exercise, and other parts of military discipline.  The women,
by subscriptions among themselves, provided silk colors,
which they presented to the companies, painted with different
devices and mottos, which I supplied.
</p><p>The officers of the companies composing the Philadelphia
regiment, being met, chose me for their colonel; but, conceiving
myself unfit, I declin'd that station, and recommended
Mr. Lawrence, a fine person, and man of influence,
who was accordingly appointed.  I then propos'd a lottery
to defray the expense of building a <ref target="f108">battery</ref><note id="f108">A gathering of artillery units. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> below the town,
and furnishing it with cannon.  It filled expeditiously, and
the battery was soon erected, the merlons being fram'd of
logs and fill'd with earth.  We bought some old cannon
from Boston, but, these not being sufficient, we wrote to
England for more, soliciting, at the same time, our proprietaries
for some assistance, tho' without much expectation of
obtaining it.
</p>
       <p>Meanwhile, Colonel Lawrence, William Allen, Abram
Taylor, Esqr., and myself were sent to New York by the
associators, commission'd to borrow some cannon of Governor
Clinton. He at first refus'd us peremptorily; but at
dinner with his council, where there was great drinking of
Madeira wine, as the custom of that place then was, he
softened by degrees, and said he would lend us six.  After
a few more bumpers he advanc'd to ten; and at length he
very good-naturedly conceded eighteen.  They were fine
cannon, eighteen-pounders, with their carriages, which we
soon transported and mounted on our battery, where the
associators kept a nightly guard while the war lasted, and
among the rest I regularly took my turn of duty there as a
common soldier.
</p>
       <p>My activity in these operations was agreeable to the governor
and council; they took me into confidence, and I
was consulted by them in every measure wherein their concurrence
was thought useful to the association.  Calling in
the aid of religion, I propos'd to them the proclaiming a
fast, to promote reformation, and implore the blessing of
Heaven on our undertaking.  They embrac'd the motion;
but, as it was the first fast ever thought of in the province,
the secretary had no precedent from which to draw the
proclamation.  My education in New England, where a fast
is proclaimed every year, was here of some advantage: I
drew it in the accustomed stile, it was translated into German,
printed in both languages, and divulg'd thro' the
province.  This gave the clergy of the different sects an
opportunity of influencing their congregations to join in the
association, and it would probably have been general among
all but Quakers if the peace had not soon interven'd.
</p>
       <p>It was thought by some of my friends that, by my activity
in these affairs, I should offend that sect, and thereby lose
my interest in the Assembly of the province, where they
formed a great majority.  A young gentleman who had likewise
some friends in the House, and wished to succeed me as
their clerk, acquainted me that it was decided to displace me
at the next election; and he, therefore, in good will, advis'd
me to resign, as more consistent with my honour than being
turn'd out.  My answer to him was, that I had read or
heard of some public man who made it a rule never to ask
for an office, and never to refuse one when offer'd to him.
"I approve," says I, "of his rule, and will practice it with
a small addition; I shall never <hi rend="italic">ask</hi>, never <hi rend="italic">refuse,</hi> nor ever
<hi rend="italic">resign</hi> an office.  If they will have my office of clerk to dispose
of to another, they shall take it from me.  I will not,
by giving it up, lose my right of some time or other making
reprisals on my adversaries." I heard, however, no more
of this; I was chosen again unanimously as usual at the
next election.  Possibly, as they dislik'd my late intimacy
with the members of council, who had join'd the governors
in all the disputes about military preparations, with which
the House had long been harass'd, they might have been
pleas'd if I would voluntarily have left them; but they did
not care to displace me on account merely of my zeal for
the association, and they could not well give another reason.
</p><p>Indeed I had some cause to believe that the defense of
the country was not disagreeable to any of them, provided
they were not requir'd to assist in it.  And I found that a
much greater number of them than I could have imagined,
tho' against offensive war, were clearly for the defensive.
Many pamphlets <hi rend="italic">pro</hi> and <hi rend="italic">con</hi> were publish'd on the subject,
and some by good Quakers, in favour of defense, which I
believe convinc'd most of their younger people.
</p><p>A transaction in our fire company gave me some insight
into their prevailing sentiments.  It had been propos'd that
we should encourage the scheme for building a battery by
laying out the present stock, then about sixty pounds, in
tickets of the lottery.  By our rules, no money could be
dispos'd of till the next meeting after the proposal.  The
company consisted of thirty members, of which twenty-two
were Quakers, and eight only of other persuasions.  We eight
punctually attended the meeting; but, tho' we thought that
some of the Quakers would join us, we were by no means
sure of a majority.  Only one Quaker, Mr. James Morris,
appear'd to oppose the measure.  He expressed much sorrow
that it had ever been propos'd, as he said <hi rend="italic">Friends</hi> were all
against it, and it would create such discord as might break
up the company.  We told him that we saw no reason for
that; we were the minority, and if <hi rend="italic">Friends</hi> were against
the measure, and outvoted us, we must and should, agreeably
to the usage of all societies, submit.  When the hour for
business arriv'd it was mov'd to put the vote; he allow'd we
might then do it by the rules, but, as he could assure us
that a number of members intended to be present for the
purpose of opposing it, it would be but candid to allow a
little time for their appearing.
</p>
       <p>While we were disputing this, a waiter came to tell me
two gentlemen below desir'd to speak with me. I went down,
and found they were two of our Quaker members. They
told me there were eight of them assembled at a tavern
just by; that they were determin'd to come and vote with
us if there should be occasion, which they hop'd would not
be the case, and desir'd we would not call for their assistance
if we could do without it, as their voting for such a measure
might embroil them with their elders and friends.  Being
thus secure of a majority, I went up, and after a little seeming
hesitation, agreed to a delay of another hour.  This Mr.
Morris allow'd to be extreamly fair.  Not one of his opposing
friends appear'd, at which he express'd great surprize;
and, at the expiration of the hour, we carry'd the resolution
eight to one; and as, of the twenty-two Quakers, eight were
ready to vote with us, and thirteen, by their absence, manifested
that they were not inclin'd to oppose the measure,
I afterward estimated the proportion of Quakers sincerely
against defense as one to twenty-one only; for these were
all regular members of that society, and in good reputation
among them, and had due notice of what was propos'd at
that meeting.
</p>
       <p>The honorable and learned Mr. Logan, who had always
been of that sect, was one who wrote an address to them,
declaring his approbation of defensive war, and supporting
his opinion by many strong arguments.  He put into my
hands sixty pounds to be laid out in lottery tickets for the
battery, with directions to apply what prizes might be drawn
wholly to that service.  He told me the following anecdote
of his old master, William Penn, respecting defense.  He
came over from England, when a young man, with that
proprietary, and as his secretary.  It was war-time, and their
ship was chas'd by an armed vessel, suppos'd to be an enemy.
Their captain prepar'd for defense; but told William Penn
and his company of Quakers, that he did not expect their
assistance, and they might retire into the cabin, which they
did, except James Logan, who chose to stay upon deck, and
was quarter'd to a gun.  The suppos'd enemy prov'd a
friend, so there was no fighting; but when the secretary
went down to communicate the intelligence, William Penn
rebuk'd him severely for staying upon deck, and undertaking
to assist in defending the vessel, contrary to the principles of
<hi rend="italic">Friends</hi>, especially as it had not been required by the captain.
This reproof, being before all the company, piqu'd the
secretary, who answer'd, <hi rend="italic">"I being thy servant, why did thee
not order me to come down? But thee was willing enough
that I should stay and help to fight the ship when thee thought
there was danger."</hi>
</p>
       <p>My being many years in the Assembly, the majority of
which were constantly Quakers, gave me frequent opportunities
of seeing the embarrassment given them by their
principle against war, whenever application was made to
them, by order of the crown, to grant aids for military purposes.
They were unwilling to offend government, on the
one hand, by a direct refusal; and their friends, the body
of the Quakers, on the other, by a compliance contrary to
their principles; hence a variety of evasions to avoid complying,
and modes of disguising the compliance when it became
unavoidable.  The common mode at last was, to grant
money under the phrase of its being <hi rend="italic">"for the king's use,"</hi>
and never to inquire how it was applied.
</p><p>But, if the demand was not directly from the crown, that
phrase was found not so proper, and some other was to be
invented.  As, when powder was wanting (I think it was
for the garrison at Louisburg), and the government of New
England solicited a grant of some from Pennsilvania, which
was much urg'd on the House by Governor Thomas, they
could not grant money to buy powder, because that was an
ingredient of war; but they voted an aid to New England
of three thousand pounds, to he put into the hands of the
governor, and appropriated it for the purchasing of bread,
flour, wheat, or <hi rend="italic">other grain.</hi>  Some of the council, desirous
of giving the House still further embarrassment, advis'd
the governor not to accept provision, as not being the thing
he had demanded; but be reply'd, "I shall take the money,
for I understand very well their meaning; other grain is
gunpowder," which he accordingly bought, and they never
objected to it.

</p><p>It was in allusion to this fact that, when in our fire company
we feared the success of our proposal in favour of the
lottery, and I had said to my friend Mr. Syng, one of our
members, "If we fail, let us move the purchase of a fire-engine with the money; the Quakers can have no objection
to that; and then, if you nominate me and I you as a committee
for that purpose, we will buy a great gun, which is certainly
a <hi rend="italic">fire-engine</hi>." "I see," says he, "you have improv'd
by being so long in the Assembly; your equivocal project
would be just a match for their wheat or <hi rend="italic">other grain</hi>."
</p>
       <p>These embarrassments that the Quakers suffer'd from
having establish'd and published it as one of their principles
that no kind of war was lawful, and which, being once published,
they could not afterwards, however they might change
their minds, easily get rid of, reminds me of what I think a
more prudent conduct in another sect among us, that of the
Dunkers.  I was acquainted with one of its founders, Michael Welfare, soon after it appear'd.  He complain'd to me that
they were grievously calumniated by the zealots of other
persuasions, and charg'd with abominable principles and practices,
to which they were utter strangers.  I told him this
had always been the case with new sects, and that, to put
a stop to such abuse, I imagin'd it might be well to publish
the articles of their belief, and the rules of their discipline.
He said that it had been propos'd among them, but not
agreed to, for this reason: "When we were first drawn
together as a society," says he, "it had pleased God to
enlighten our minds so far as to see that some doctrines,
which we once esteemed truths, were errors; and that
others, which we had esteemed errors, were real truths.
From time to time He has been pleased to afford us farther
light, and our principles have been improving, and our errors
diminishing.  Now we are not sure that we are arrived at
the end of this progression, and at the perfection of spiritual
or theological knowledge; and we fear that, if we should
once print our confession of faith, we should feel ourselves
as if bound and confin'd by it, and perhaps be unwilling
to receive farther improvement, and our successors still
more so, as conceiving what we their elders and founders
had done, to be something sacred, never to be departed
from."
</p>
       <p>This modesty in a sect is perhaps a singular instance in
the history of mankind, every other sect supposing itself in
possession of all truth, and that those who differ are so far
in the wrong; like a man traveling in foggy weather, those
at some distance before him on the road he sees wrapped
up in the fog, as well as those behind him, and also the
people in the fields on each side, but near him all appears
clear, tho' in truth he is as much in the fog as any of them.
To avoid this kind of embarrassment, the Quakers have of
late years been gradually declining the public service in the
Assembly and in the magistracy, choosing rather to quit
their power than their principle.
</p>
       <p>In order of time, I should have mentioned before, that
having, in 1742, invented an open stove for the better warming
of rooms, and at the same time saving fuel, as the fresh
air admitted was warmed in entering, I made a present of
the model to Mr. Robert Grace, one of my early friends,
who, having an iron-furnace, found the casting of the plates
for these stoves a profitable thing, as they were growing in
demand.  To promote that demand, I wrote and published a
pamphlet, entitled <hi rend="italic">"An Account of the new-invented
Pennsylvania Fireplaces; wherein their Construction and
Manner of Operation is particularly explained; their
Advantages above every other Method of warming Rooms
demonstrated; and all Objections that have been raised
against the Use of them answered and obviated</hi>" etc.  This
pamphlet had a good effect. Gov'r. Thomas was so pleas'd
with the construction of this stove, as described in it, that
he offered to give me a patent for the sole vending of them
for a term of years; but I declin'd it from a principle which
has ever weighed with me on such occasions, viz., <hi rend="italic">That, as
we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others,
we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any</hi>
<hi rend="italic">invention of ours; and this we should do freely and
generously.</hi>
</p>
       <p>An ironmonger in London however, assuming a good deal
of my pamphlet, and working it up into his own, and making
some small changes in the machine, which rather hurt its
operation, got a patent for it there, and made, as I was told,
a little fortune by it.  And this is not the only instance of
patents taken out for my inventions by others, tho' not
always with the same success, which I never contested, as
having no desire of profiting by patents myself, and hating
disputes.  The use of these fireplaces in very many houses,
both of this and the neighbouring colonies, has been, and is,
a great saving of wood to the inhabitants.
</p><p>Peace being concluded, and the association business therefore
at an end, I turn'd my thoughts again to the affair of
establishing an academy.  The first step I took was to associate
in the design a number of active friends, of whom the
Junto furnished a good part; the next was to write and
publish a pamphlet, entitled <hi rend="italic">Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pennsylvania.</hi>  This I distributed
among the principal inhabitants gratis; and as soon as I
could suppose their minds a little prepared by the perusal
of it, I set on foot a subscription for opening and supporting
an academy; it was to be paid in quotas yearly for five
years; by so dividing it, I judg'd the subscription might be
larger, and I believe it was so, amounting to no less, if I
remember right, than five thousand pounds.
</p>
       <p>In the introduction to these proposals, I stated their publication,
not as an act of mine, but of some <hi rend="italic">publick-spirited</hi>
gentlemen, avoiding as much as I could, according to my
usual rule, the presenting myself to the publick as the author
of any scheme for their benefit.
</p>
       <p>The subscribers, to carry the project into immediate
execution, chose out of their number twenty-four trustees,
and appointed Mr. Francis, then attorney-general, and myself
to draw up constitutions for the government of the
academy; which being done and signed, a house was hired,
masters engag'd, and the schools opened, I think, in the
same year, 1749.
</p>
       <p>The scholars increasing fast, the house was soon found
too small, and we were looking out for a piece of ground,
properly situated, with intention to build, when Providence
threw into our way a large house ready built, which, with a
few alterations, might well serve our purpose.  This was
the building before mentioned, erected by the hearers of Mr.
Whitefield, and was obtained for us in the following manner.
</p>
       <p>It is to be noted that the contributions to this building
being made by people of different sects, care was taken in
the nomination of trustees, in whom the building and ground
was to be vested, that a predominancy should not be given
to any sect, lest in time that predominancy might be a means
of appropriating the whole to the use of such sect, contrary
to the original intention.  It was therefore that one of each
sect was appointed, viz., one Church-of-England man, one
Presbyterian, one Baptist, one Moravian, etc., those, in case
of vacancy by death, were to fill it by election from among
the contributors.  The Moravian happen'd not to please his
colleagues, and on his death they resolved to have no other
of that sect.  The difficulty then was, how to avoid having
two of some other sect, by means of the new choice.
</p><p>Several persons were named, and for that reason not
agreed to.  At length one mention'd me, with the observation
that I was merely an honest man, and of no sect at all,
which prevail'd with them to chuse me.  The enthusiasm
which existed when the house was built had long since
abated, and its trustees had not been able to procure fresh
contributions for paying the ground-rent, and discharging
some other debts the building had occasion'd, which embarrass'd
them greatly.  Being now a member of both setts of
trustees, that for the building and that for the Academy,
I had a good opportunity of negotiating with both, and
brought them finally to an agreement, by which the trustees
for the building were to cede it to those of the academy, the
latter undertaking to discharge the debt, to keep for ever
open in the building a large hall for occasional preachers,
according to the original intention, and maintain a free-school for the instruction of poor children.  Writings were
accordingly drawn, and on paying the debts the trustees of
the academy were put in possession of the premises; and
by dividing the great and lofty hall into stories, and different
rooms above and below for the several schools, and
purchasing some additional ground, the whole was soon
made fit for our purpose, and the scholars remov'd into the
building. The care and trouble of agreeing with the workmen,
purchasing materials, and superintending the work,
fell upon me; and I went thro' it the more cheerfully, as
it did not then interfere with my private business, having
the year before taken a very able, industrious, and honest
partner, Mr. David Hall, with whose character I was well
acquainted, as he had work'd for me four years.  He took
off my hands all care of the printing-office, paying me punctually
my share of the profits.  This partnership continued
eighteen years, successfully for us both.
</p>
       <p>The trustees of the academy, after a while, were incorporated
by a charter from the governor; their funds were
increas'd by contributions in Britain and grants of land from
the proprietaries, to which the Assembly has since made
considerable addition; and thus was established the present
University of Philadelphia.  I have been continued one of
its trustees from the beginning, now near forty years, and
have had the very great pleasure of seeing a number of the
youth who have receiv'd their education in it, distinguish'd
by their improv'd abilities, serviceable in public stations and
ornaments to their country.
</p>
       <p>When I disengaged myself, as above mentioned, from
private business, I flatter'd myself that, by the sufficient tho'
moderate fortune I had acquir'd, I had secured leisure during
the rest of my life for philosophical studies and amusements.
I purchased all Dr. Spence's apparatus, who had
come from England to lecture here, and I proceeded in my
electrical experiments with great alacrity; but the publick,
now considering me as a man of leisure, laid hold of me
for their purposes, every part of our civil government, and
almost at the same time, imposing some duty upon me.  The
governor put me into the commission of the peace; the corporation
of the city chose me of the common council, and
soon after an alderman; and the citizens at large chose me
a burgess to represent them in Assembly.  This latter station
was the more agreeable to me, as I was at length
tired with sitting there to hear debates, in which, as clerk,
I could take no part, and which were often so unentertaining
that I was induc'd to amuse myself with making magic squares, or any thing to avoid weariness; and I
conceiv'd my becoming a member would enlarge my power
of doing good. I would not, however, insinuate that my
ambition was not flatter'd by all these promotions; it certainly
was; for, considering my low beginning, they were
great things to me; and they were still more pleasing, as
being so many spontaneous testimonies of the public good
opinion, and by me entirely unsolicited.
</p>
       <p>The office of justice of the peace I try'd a little, by attending
a few courts, and sitting on the bench to hear causes;
but finding that more knowledge of the common law than I
possess'd was necessary to act in that station with credit, I
gradually withdrew from it, excusing myself by my being
oblig'd to attend the higher duties of a legislator in the
Assembly.  My election to this trust was repeated every year
for ten years, without my ever asking any elector for his
vote, or signifying, either directly or indirectly, any desire
of being chosen.  On taking my seat in the House, my son
was appointed their clerk.
</p>
       <p>The year following, a treaty being to be held with the
Indians at Carlisle, the governor sent a message to the
House, proposing that they should nominate some of their
members, to be join'd with some members of council, as
commissioners for that purpose. The House named the
speaker (Mr. Norris) and myself; and, being commission'd,
we went to Carlisle, and met the Indians accordingly.
</p>
       <p>As those people are extreamly apt to get drunk, and,
when so, are very quarrelsome and disorderly, we strictly
forbad the selling any liquor to them; and when they complain'd
of this restriction, we told them that if they would
continue sober during the treaty, we would give them plenty
of rum when business was over.  They promis'd this, and
they kept their promise, because they could get no liquor,
and the treaty was conducted very orderly, and concluded
to mutual satisfaction.  They then claim'd and receiv'd the
rum; this was in the afternoon; they were near one hundred
men, women, and children, and were lodg'd in temporary
cabins, built in the form of a square, just without
the town. In the evening, hearing a great noise among
them, the commissioners walk'd out to see what was the
matter. We found they had made a great bonfire in the
middle of the square; they were all drunk, men and women,
quarreling and fighting. Their dark-colour'd bodies, half
naked, seen only by the gloomy light of the bonfire, running
after and beating one another with firebrands, accompanied
by their horrid yellings, form'd a scene the most resembling
our ideas of hell that could well be imagin'd; there was no
appeasing the tumult, and we retired to our lodging.  At
midnight a number of them came thundering at our door,
demanding more rum, of which we took no notice.
</p>
       <p>The next day, sensible they had misbehav'd in giving us
that disturbance, they sent three of their old counselors to
make their apology.  The orator acknowledg'd the fault, but
laid it upon the rum; and then endeavored to excuse the
rum by saying, <hi rend="italic">"The Great Spirit, who made all things,
made every thing for some use, and whatever use he
design'd any thing for, that use it should always be put to.
Now, when he made rum, he said 'Let this be for the Indians
to get drunk with,' and it must be so</hi>." And, indeed,
if it be the design of Providence to extirpate these savages
in order to make room for cultivators of the earth, it seems
not improbable that rum may be the appointed means.  It
has already annihilated all the tribes who formerly inhabited
the sea-coast.
</p>
       <p>In 1751, Dr. Thomas Bond, a particular friend of mine,
conceived the idea of establishing a hospital in Philadelphia
(a very beneficent design, which has been ascrib'd to me, but
was originally his), for the reception and cure of poor sick
persons, whether inhabitants of the province or strangers.
He was zealous and active in endeavouring to procure subscriptions
for it, but the proposal being a novelty in America,
and at first not well understood, he met with but small
success.
</p>
       <p>At length he came to me with the compliment that he
found there was no such thing as carrying a public-spirited
project through without my being concern'd in it.  "For,"
says he, "I am often ask'd by those to whom I propose subscribing, Have you consulted Franklin upon this business?
And what does he think of it? And when I tell
them that I have not (supposing it rather out of your line),
they do not subscribe, but say they will consider of it." I
enquired into the nature and probable utility of his scheme,
and receiving from him a very satisfactory explanation, I
not only subscrib'd to it myself, but engag'd heartily in the
design of procuring subscriptions from others.  Previously,
however, to the solicitation, I endeavoured to prepare the
minds of the people by writing on the subject in the newspapers,
which was my usual custom in such cases, but which
he had omitted.
</p>
       <p>The subscriptions afterwards were more free and generous;
but, beginning to flag, I saw they would be insufficient
without some assistance from the Assembly, and therefore
propos'd to petition for it, which was done.  The country
members did not at first relish the project; they objected
that it could only be serviceable to the city, and therefore
the citizens alone should be at the expense of it; and they
doubted whether the citizens themselves generally approv'd
of it.  My allegation on the contrary, that it met with such
approbation as to leave no doubt of our being able to raise
two thousand pounds by voluntary donations, they considered
as a most extravagant supposition, and utterly impossible.
</p><p>On this I form'd my plan; and asking leave to bring in a
bill for incorporating the contributors according to the
prayer of their petition, and granting them a blank sum of
money, which leave was obtained chiefly on the consideration
that the House could throw the bill out if they did not
like it, I drew it so as to make the important clause a conditional
one, viz., "And be it enacted, by the authority
aforesaid, that when the said contributors shall have met
and chosen their managers and treasurer, <hi rend="italic">and shall have
raised by their contributions a capital stock of value</hi>
(the yearly interest of which is to be applied to  the accommodating
of the sick poor in the said hospital, free of charge
for diet, attendance, advice, and medicines), <hi rend="italic">and shall make
the same appear to the satisfaction of the speaker of the
Assembly for the time being,</hi> that <hi rend="italic">then</hi> it shall and may be
lawful for the said speaker, and be is hereby required, to
sign an order on the provincial treasurer for the payment
of two thousand pounds, in two yearly payments, to the
treasurer of the said hospital, to be applied to the founding,
building, and finishing of the same."
</p>
       <p>This condition carried the bill through; for the members,
who had oppos'd the grant, and now conceiv'd they might
have the credit of being charitable without the expence,
agreed to its passage; and then, in soliciting subscriptions
among the people, we urg'd the conditional promise of the
law as an additional motive to give, since every man's donation
would be doubled; thus the clause work'd both ways.
The subscriptions accordingly soon exceeded the requisite
sum, and we claim'd and receiv'd the public gift, which
enabled us to carry the design into execution.  A convenient
and handsome building was soon erected; the institution has
by constant experience been found useful, and flourishes to
this day; and I do not remember any of my political
manoeuvres, the success of which gave me at the time more
pleasure, or wherein, after thinking of it, I more easily
excus'd myself for having made some use of cunning.
</p><p>It was about this time that another projector, the Rev.
Gilbert Tennent, came to me with a request that I would
assist him in procuring a subscription for erecting a new
meeting-house.  It was to he for the use of a congregation he
had gathered among the Presbyterians, who were originally
disciples of Mr. Whitefield.  Unwilling to make myself disagreeable
to my fellow-citizens by too frequently soliciting
their contributions, I absolutely refus'd.  He then desired
I would furnish him with a list of the names of persons I
knew by experience to be generous and public-spirited.  I
thought it would be unbecoming in me, after their kind
compliance with my solicitations, to mark them out to be
worried by other beggars, and therefore refus'd also to give
such a list.  He then desir'd I would at least give him my
advice.  "That I will readily do," said I; "and, in the first
place, I advise you to apply to all those whom you know
will give something; next, to those whom you are uncertain
whether they will give any thing or not, and show them the
list of those who have given; and, lastly, do not neglect
those who you are sure will give nothing, for in some of
them you may be mistaken." He laugh'd and thank'd me,
and said he would take my advice.  He did so, for he ask'd
of <hi rend="italic">everybody,</hi> and he obtained a much larger sum than he
expected, with which he erected the capacious and very
elegant meeting-house that stands in Arch-street.
</p>
       <p>Our city, tho' laid out with a beautiful regularity, the
streets large, strait, and crossing each other at right angles,
had the disgrace of suffering those streets to remain long
unpav'd, and in wet weather the wheels of heavy carriages
plough'd them into a quagmire, so that it was difficult to
cross them; and in dry weather the dust was offensive.  I
had liv'd near what was call'd the Jersey Market, and saw
with pain the inhabitants wading in mud while purchasing
their provisions.  A strip of ground down the middle of
that market was at length pav'd with brick, so that, being
once in the market, they had firm footing, but were often
over shoes in dirt to get there.  By talking and writing on
the subject, I was at length instrumental in getting the
street pav'd with stone between the market and the brick'd
foot-pavement, that was on each side next the houses.  This,
for some time, gave an easy access to the market dry-shod;
but, the rest of the street not being pav'd, whenever a
carriage came out of the mud upon this pavement, it shook
off and left its dirt upon it, and it was soon cover'd with
mire, which was not remov'd, the city as yet having no
scavengers.
</p>
       <p>After some inquiry I found a poor industrious man, who
was willing to undertake keeping the pavement clean, by
sweeping it twice a week, carrying off the dirt from before
all the neighbours' doors, for the sum of sixpence per month,
to be paid by each house.  I then wrote and printed a paper
setting forth the advantages to the neighbourhood that might
be obtain'd by this small expense; the greater ease in keeping
our houses clean, so much dirt not being brought in by
people's feet; the benefit to the shops by more custom, etc.,
etc., as buyers could more easily get at them; and by not
having, in windy weather, the dust blown in upon their
goods, etc., etc.  I sent one of these papers to each house,
and in a day or two went round to see who would subscribe
an agreement to pay these sixpences; it was unanimously
sign'd, and for a time well executed.  All the inhabitants
of the city were delighted with the cleanliness of the pavement
that surrounded the market, it being a convenience to
all, and this rais'd a general desire to have all the streets
paved, and made the people more willing to submit to a tax
for that purpose.
</p>
       <p>After some time I drew a bill for paving the city, and
brought it into the Assembly.  It was just before I went
to England, in 1757, and did not pass till I was gone,
and then with an alteration in the mode of assessment, which
I thought not for the better, but with an additional provision
for lighting as well as paving the streets, which was a
great improvement.  It was by a private person, the late
Mr. John Clifton, his giving a sample of the utility of lamps,
by placing one at his door, that the people were first impress'd
with the idea of enlighting all the city.  The honour
of this public benefit has also been ascrib'd to me but it
belongs truly to that gentleman.  I did but follow his
example, and have only some merit to claim respecting
the form of our lamps, as differing from the globe lamps
we were at first supply'd with from London. Those we
found inconvenient in these respects: they admitted no
air below; the smoke, therefore, did not readily go out
above, but circulated in the globe, lodg'd on its inside, and
soon obstructed the light they were intended to afford; giving,
besides, the daily trouble of wiping them clean; and an
accidental stroke on one of them would demolish it, and
render it totally useless.  I therefore suggested the composing
them of four flat panes, with a long funnel above
to draw up the smoke, and crevices admitting air below, to
facilitate the ascent of the smoke; by this means they were
kept clean, and did not grow dark in a few hours, as the
London lamps do, but continu'd bright till morning, and
an accidental stroke would generally break but a single
pane, easily repair'd.
</p>
       <p>I have sometimes wonder'd that the Londoners did not,
from the effect holes in the bottom of the globe lamps us'd
at Vauxhall have in keeping them clean, learn to have such
holes in their street lamps.  But, these holes being made
for another purpose, viz., to communicate flame more suddenly
to the wick by a little flax hanging down thro' them,
the other use, of letting in air, seems not to have been
thought of; and therefore, after the lamps have been lit
a few hours, the streets of London are very poorly
illuminated.
</p>
       <p>The mention of these improvements puts me in mind of
one I propos'd, when in London, to Dr. Fothergill, who
was among the best men I have known, and a great promoter
of useful projects.  I had observ'd that the streets,
when dry, were never swept, and the light dust carried
away; but it was suffer'd to accumulate till wet weather
reduc'd it to mud, and then, after lying some days so deep
on the pavement that there was no crossing but in paths
kept clean by poor people with brooms, it was with great
labour rak'd together and thrown up into carts open above,
the sides of which suffer'd some of the slush at every jolt
on the pavement to shake out and fall, sometimes to the annoyance
of foot-passengers.  The reason given for not
sweeping the dusty streets was, that the dust would fly into
the windows of shops and houses.
</p>
       <p>An accidental occurrence had instructed me how much
sweeping might be done in a little time.  I found at my
door in Craven-street, one morning, a poor woman sweeping
my pavement with a birch broom; she appeared very pale
and feeble, as just come out of a fit of sickness.  I ask'd
who employ'd her to sweep there; she said, "Nobody, but
I am very poor and in distress, and I sweeps before gentlefolkses
doors, and hopes they will give me something."
I bid her sweep the whole street clean, and I would give
her a shilling; this was at nine o'clock; at 12 she came for
the shilling.  From the slowness I saw at first in her working,
I could scarce believe that the work was done so soon,
and sent my servant to examine it, who reported that the
whole street was swept perfectly clean, and all the dust
plac'd in the gutter, which was in the middle; and the
next rain wash'd it quite away, so that the pavement and
even the kennel were perfectly clean.
</p>
       <p>I then judg'd that, if that feeble woman could sweep such a street in three hours, a strong, active man might
have done it in half the time.  And here let me remark the
convenience of having but one gutter in such a narrow
street, running down its middle, instead of two, one on each
side, near the footway; for where all the rain that falls
on a street runs from the sides and meets in the middle, it
forms there a current strong enough to wash away all the
mud it meets with; but when divided into two channels, it
is often too weak to cleanse either, and only makes the
mud it finds more fluid, so that the wheels of carriages
and feet of horses throw and dash it upon the foot-pavement,
which is thereby rendered foul and slippery, and sometimes
splash it upon those who are walking.  My proposal,
communicated to the good doctor, was as follows:
</p>
       <p>"For the more effectual cleaning and keeping clean the
streets of London and Westminster, it is proposed that the
several watchmen be contracted with to have the dust swept
up in dry seasons, and the mud rak'd up at other times, each
in the several streets and lanes of his round; that they be
furnish'd with brooms and other proper instruments for
these purposes, to be kept at their respective stands, ready
to furnish the poor people they may employ in the service.
</p>
       <p>"That in the dry summer months the dust be all swept
up into heaps at proper distances, before the shops and
windows of houses are usually opened, when the scavengers,
with close-covered carts, shall also carry it all away.
</p>
       <p>"That the mud, when rak'd up, be not left in heaps to
be spread abroad again by the wheels of carriages and
trampling of horses, but that the scavengers be provided
with bodies of carts, not plac'd high upon wheels, but low
upon sliders, with lattice bottoms, which, being cover'd with
straw, will retain the mud thrown into them, and permit the
water to drain from it, whereby it will become much lighter,
water making the greatest part of its weight; these bodies
of carts to be plac'd at convenient distances, and the mud
brought to them in wheel-barrows; they remaining where
plac'd till the mud is drain'd, and then horses brought to
draw them away."
</p>
       <p>I have since had doubts of the practicability of the latter
part of this proposal, on account of the narrowness of some

<pb n="128"/>

streets, and the difficulty of placing the draining-sleds so as
not to encumber too much the passage; but I am still of
opinion that the former, requiring the dust to be swept up
and carry'd away before the shops are open, is very practicable
in the summer, when the days are long; for, in
walking thro' the Strand and Fleet-street one morning at
seven o'clock, I observ'd there was not one shop open, tho'
it had been daylight and the sun up above three hours; the
inhabitants of London chusing voluntarily to live much by
candle-light, and sleep by sunshine, and yet often complain,
a little absurdly, of the duty on candles and the high price
of tallow.
</p><p>Some may think these trifling matters not worth minding
or relating; but when they consider that tho' dust blown
into the eyes of a single person, or into a single shop on a
windy day, is but of small importance, yet the great number
of the instances in a populous city, and its frequent repetitions
give it weight and consequence, perhaps they will not
censure very severely those who bestow some attention to
affairs of this seemingly low nature.  Human <ref target="f126">felicity</ref><note id="f126">Happiness. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> is
produc'd not so much by great pieces of good fortune that
seldom happen, as by little advantages that occur every
day.  Thus, if you teach a poor young man to shave himself,
and keep his razor in order, you may contribute more to
the happiness of his life than in giving him a thousand
guineas.  The money may be soon spent, the regret only
remaining of having foolishly consumed it; but in the other
case, he escapes the frequent vexation of waiting for barbers,
and of their sometimes dirty fingers, offensive breaths, and
dull razors; he shaves when most convenient to him, and
enjoys daily the pleasure of its being done with a good
instrument.  With these sentiments I have hazarded the
few preceding pages, hoping they may afford hints which
some time or other may be useful to a city I love, having
lived many years in it very happily, and perhaps to some
of our towns in America.
</p><p>Having been for some time employed by the postmaster-general of America as his <ref target="f127">comptroller</ref><note id="f127">A manager of expenditures or a treasurer. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> in regulating several
offices, and bringing the officers to account, I was, upon his
death in 1753, appointed, jointly with Mr. William Hunter,

<pb n="129"/>

to succeed him, by a commission from the postmaster-general in England.  The American office never had hitherto
paid any thing to that of Britain.  We were to have six
hundred pounds a year between us, if we could make that
sum out of the profits of the office.  To do this, a variety
of improvements were necessary; some of these were
inevitably at first expensive, so that in the first four years
the office became above nine hundred pounds in debt to us.
But it soon after began to repay us; and before I was displac'd
by a freak of the ministers, of which I shall speak
hereafter, we had brought it to yield three times as much
clear revenue to the crown as the postoffice of Ireland.
Since that imprudent transaction, they have receiv'd from
it not one farthing!
</p><p>The business of the postoffice occasion'd my taking a
journey this year to New England, where the College of
Cambridge, of their own motion, presented me with the
degree of Master of Arts.  Yale College, in Connecticut,
had before made me a similar compliment.  Thus, without
studying in any college, I came to partake of their honours.
They were conferr'd in consideration of my improvements
and discoveries in the electric branch of natural philosophy.
</p><p>In 1754, war with France being again apprehended, a
congress of commissioners from the different colonies was,
by an order of the Lords of Trade, to be assembled at Albany,
there to confer with the chiefs of the Six Nations concerning
the means of defending both their country and ours.
Governor Hamilton, having receiv'd this order, acquainted
the House with it, requesting they would furnish proper
presents for the Indians, to be given on this occasion; and
naming the speaker (Mr. Norris) and myself to join Mr.
Thomas Penn and Mr. Secretary Peters as commissioners
to act for Pennsylvania.  The House approv'd the nomination,
and provided the goods for the present, and tho' they
did not much like treating out of the provinces; and we
met the other commissioners at Albany about the middle of
June.
</p><p>In our way thither, I projected and drew a plan for the
union of all the colonies under one government, so far as
might be necessary for defense, and other important general

<pb n="130"/>

purposes.  As we pass'd thro' New York, I had there shown
my project to Mr. James Alexander and Mr. Kennedy, two
gentlemen of great knowledge in public affairs, and, being
fortified by their approbation, I ventur'd to lay it before
the Congress.  It then appeared that several of the commissioners
had form'd plans of the same kind.  A previous
question was first taken, whether a union should be established,
which pass'd in the affirmative unanimously.  A committee
was then appointed, one member from each colony,
to consider the several plans and report.  Mine happen'd to
be preferr'd, and, with a few amendments, was accordingly
reported.
</p><p>By this plan the general government was to be administered
by a president-general, appointed and supported by the crown,
and a grand council was to be chosen by the representatives
of the people of the several colonies, met in their
respective assemblies.  The debates upon it in Congress
went on daily, hand in hand with the Indian business.
Many objections and difficulties were started, but at length
they were all overcome, and the plan was unanimously agreed
to, and copies ordered to be transmitted to the Board of
Trade and to the assemblies of the several provinces.  Its
fate was singular: the assemblies did not adopt it, as they
all thought there was too much <hi rend="italic">prerogative</hi> in it, and in
England it was judg'd to have too much of the <hi rend="italic">democratic</hi>.
</p><p>The Board of Trade therefore did not approve of it, nor
recommend it for the approbation of his majesty; but
another scheme was form'd, supposed to answer the same
purpose better, whereby the governors of the provinces,
with some members of their respective councils, were to
meet and order the raising of troops, building of forts, etc.,
and to draw on the treasury of Great Britain for the expense,
which was afterwards to be refunded by an act of Parliament
laying a tax on America.  My plan, with my reasons
in support of it, is to be found among my political papers
that are printed.
</p><p>Being the winter following in Boston, I had much conversation
with Governor Shirley upon both the plans.  Part
of what passed between us on the occasion may also be seen
among those papers.  The different and contrary reasons

<pb n="131"/>

of dislike to my plan makes me suspect that it was really
the true medium; and I am still of opinion it would have
been happy for both sides the water if it had been adopted.
The colonies, so united, would have been sufficiently strong
to have defended themselves; there would then have been
no need of troops from England; of course, the subsequent
pretence for taxing America, and the bloody contest it occasioned,
would have been avoided.  But such mistakes are
not new; history is full of the errors of states and princes.
<q><lg type="couplet"><l>     Look round the habitable world, how few</l>
<l>     Know their own good, or, knowing it, pursue!</l></lg></q>
</p><p>Those who govern, having much business on their hands,
do not generally like to take the trouble of considering and
carrying into execution new projects.  The best public
measures are therefore seldom <hi rend="italic">adopted from previous wisdom,
but forc'd by the occasion.</hi>
</p><p>The Governor of Pennsylvania, in sending it down to the
Assembly, express'd his approbation of the plan, "as appearing
to him to be drawn up with great clearness and strength
of judgment, and therefore recommended it as well worthy
of their closest and most serious attention." The House,
however, by the management of a certain member, took it
up when I happen'd to be absent, which I thought not very
fair, and reprobated it without paying any attention to it at
all, to my no small mortification.
</p><p>In my journey to Boston this year, I met at New York
with our new governor, Mr. Morris, just arriv'd there from
England, with whom I had been before intimately acquainted.
He brought a commission to supersede Mr. Hamilton, who,
tir'd with the disputes his proprietary instructions subjected
him to, had resign'd.  Mr. Morris ask'd me if I thought he
must expect as uncomfortable an administration.  I said,
"No; you may, on the contrary, have a very comfortable
one, if you will only take care not to enter into any dispute
with the Assembly." "My dear friend," says he, pleasantly,
"how can you advise my avoiding disputes? You know
I love disputing; it is one of my greatest pleasures; however,
to show the regard I have for your counsel, I promise
you I will, if possible, avoid them." He had some reason
for loving to dispute, being eloquent, an acute sophister, and,

<pb n="132"/>

therefore, generally successful in argumentative conversation.
He had been brought up to it from a boy, his father,
as I have heard, accustoming his children to dispute with
one another for his diversion, while sitting at table after
dinner; but I think the practice was not wise; for, in the
course of my observation, these disputing, contradicting, and
confuting people are generally unfortunate in their affairs.
They get victory sometimes, but they never get good will,
which would be of more use to them.  We parted, he going
to Philadelphia, and I to Boston.
</p><p>In returning, I met at New York with the votes of the
Assembly, by which it appear'd that, notwithstanding his
promise to me, he and the House were already in high contention;
and it was a continual battle between them as long
as he retain'd the government.  I had my share of it; for,
as soon as I got back to my seat in the Assembly, I was
put on every committee for answering his speeches and
messages, and by the committees always desired to make
the drafts.  Our answers, as well as his messages, were
often tart, and sometimes indecently abusive; and, as he
knew I wrote for the Assembly, one might have imagined
that, when we met, we could hardly avoid cutting throats;
but he was so good-natur'd a man that no personal difference
between him and me was occasion'd by the contest, and we
often din'd together.
</p><p>One afternoon, in the height of this public quarrel, we
met in the street.  "Franklin," says he, "you must go home
with me and spend the evening; I am to have some company
that you will like;" and, taking me by the arm, he
led me to his house.  In gay conversation over our wine,
after supper, he told us, jokingly, that he much admir'd the
idea of Sancho Panza, who, when it was proposed to give
him a government, requested it might be a government of
blacks, as then, if he could not agree with his people, he
might sell them.  One of his friends, who sat next to me,
says, "Franklin, why do you continue to side with these
damn'd Quakers? Had not you better sell them? The proprietor
would give you a good price." "The governor," says
I, "has not yet <ref target="f128"><hi rend="italic">blacked</hi></ref><note id="f128">To make black, often in terms of making someone like an African American. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> them enough." He, indeed, had
labored hard to blacken the Assembly in all his messages,

<pb n="133"/>

but they wip'd off his coloring as fast as he laid it on, and
plac'd it, in return, thick upon his own face; so that, finding
he was likely to be negrofied himself, he, as well as Mr.
Hamilton, grew tir'd of the contest, and quitted the
government.
</p><p>
<ref target="Fra2Aut.14">[14]</ref>
These public quarrels were all at bottom owing to the
proprietaries, our hereditary governors, who, when any
expense was to be incurred for the defense of their province,
with incredible meanness instructed their deputies to pass
no act for levying the necessary taxes, unless their vast
estates were in the same act expressly excused; and they
had even taken bonds of these deputies to observe such instructions.
The Assemblies for three years held out against
this injustice, tho' constrained to bend at last.  At length
Captain Denny, who was Governor Morris's successor, ventured
to disobey those instructions; how that was brought
about I shall show hereafter.
</p><p>But I am got forward too fast with my story: there are
still some transactions to be mention'd that happened during
the administration of Governor Morris.
</p><p>War being in a manner commenced with France, the
government of Massachusetts Bay projected an attack upon
Crown Point, and sent Mr. Quincy to Pennsylvania, and
Mr. Pownall, afterward Governor Pownall, to New York,
to solicit assistance.  As I was in the Assembly, knew its
temper, and was Mr. Quincy's countryman, he appli'd to me
for my influence and assistance.  I dictated his address to
them, which was well receiv'd.  They voted an aid of ten
thousand pounds, to be laid out in provisions.  But the
governor refusing his assent to their bill (which included this
with other sums granted for the use of the crown), unless
a clause were inserted exempting the proprietary estate
from bearing any part of the tax that would be necessary,
the Assembly, tho' very desirous of making their grant to
New England effectual, were at a loss how to accomplish it.
Mr. Quincy labored hard with the governor to obtain his
assent, but he was obstinate.
</p><p>I then suggested a method of doing the business without
the governor, by orders on the trustees of the Loan Office,


<pb n="134"/>

which, by law, the Assembly had the right of drawing.
There was, indeed, little or no money at that time in the
office, and therefore I propos'd that the orders should be
payable in a year, and to bear an interest of five per cent.
With these orders I suppos'd the provisions might easily be
purchas'd.  The Assembly, with very little hesitation, adopted
the proposal.  The orders were immediately printed, and I
was one of the committee directed to sign and dispose of
them.  The fund for paying them was the interest of all the
paper currency then extant in the province upon loan, together
with the revenue arising from the <ref target="f129">excise</ref><note id="f129">Tax. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, which being
known to be more than sufficient, they obtain'd instant credit,
and were not only receiv'd in payment for the provisions,
but many money'd people, who had cash lying by them,
vested it in those orders, which they found advantageous,
as they bore interest while upon hand, and might on any
occasion be used as money; so that they were eagerly all
bought up, and in a few weeks none of them were to be seen.
Thus this important affair was by my means compleated.
My Quincy return'd thanks to the Assembly in a handsome
memorial, went home highly pleas'd with the success of his
embassy, and ever after bore for me the most cordial and
affectionate friendship.

over <ref target="f146">General Braddock</ref><note id="f146">Edward Braddock (1695-1755)
	Major general, Braddock was the commander-in-chief of the thirteen colonies.</note> with two regiments of regular
English troops for that purpose.  He landed at Alexandria,
in Virginia, and thence march'd to Frederictown, in Maryland,
where he halted for carriages.  Our Assembly apprehending,
from some information, that he had conceived
violent prejudices against them, as averse to the
service, wish'd me to wait upon him, not as from them,
but as postmaster-general, under the guise of proposing
to settle with him the mode of conducting with most

the governors of the several provinces, with whom he must

they propos'd to pay the expense.  My son accompanied me
on this journey.
</p><p>We found the general at Frederictown, waiting impatiently
for the return of those he had sent thro' the back
parts of Maryland and Virginia to collect waggons.  I
stayed with him several days, din'd with him daily, and had
full opportunity of removing all his prejudices, by the information
of what the Assembly had before his arrival
actually done, and were still willing to do, to facilitate his
operations.  When I was about to depart, the returns of
waggons to be obtained were brought in, by which it appear'd
that they amounted only to twenty-five, and not all
of those were in serviceable condition.  The general and
all the officers were surpris'd, declar'd the expedition was
then at an end, being impossible, and exclaim'd against the
ministers for ignorantly landing them in a country destitute
of the means of conveying their stores, baggage, etc., not
less than one hundred and fifty waggons being necessary.
</p><p>I happened to say I thought it was a pity they had not been
landed rather in Pennsylvania, as in that country almost
every farmer had his waggon.  The general eagerly laid
hold of my words, and said, "Then you, sir, who are a man
of interest there, can probably procure them for us; and I
beg you will undertake it." I ask'd what terms were to be
offer'd the owners of the waggons; and I was desir'd to put
on paper the terms that appeared to me necessary.  This I
did, and they were agreed to, and a commission and instructions
accordingly prepar'd immediately.  What those terms
were will appear in the advertisement I publish'd as soon as
I arriv'd at <ref target="f131">Lancaster</ref><note id="f131">A city in the Pennsylvania Colony. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, which being, from the great and
sudden effect it produc'd, a piece of some curiosity, I shall
insert it at length, as follows:

General Braddock having been pleased to empower me to
contract for the hire of the same, I hereby give notice that
I shall attend for that purpose at Lancaster from this day
to next Wednesday evening, and at York from next Thursday
morning till Friday evening, where I shall be ready to
agree for waggons and teams, or single horses, on the following
terms, viz.: I.  That there shall be paid for each
waggon, with four good horses and a driver, fifteen shillings
<ref target="f132">per diem</ref><note id="f132">"Per diem" is latin for "per day." Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>; and for each able horse with a pack-saddle, or

each able horse without a saddle, eighteen pence per diem.
2. That the pay commence from the time of their joining
the forces at Will's Creek, which must be on or before the
20th of May ensuing, and that a reasonable allowance be
paid over and above for the time necessary for their travelling
to Will's Creek and home again after their discharge.
3. Each waggon and team, and every saddle or pack horse,
is to be valued by indifferent persons chosen between me
and the owner; and in case of the loss of any waggon, team,
or other horse in the service, the price according to such
valuation is to be allowed and paid. 4. Seven days' pay is
to be advanced and paid in hand by me to the owner of each
waggon and team, or horse, at the time of contracting, if
required, and the remainder to be paid by General Braddock,
or by the paymaster of the army, at the time of their
discharge, or from time to time, as it shall be demanded.
5. No drivers of waggons, or persons taking care of the
hired horses, are on any account to be called upon to do the
duty of soldiers, or be otherwise employed than in conducting
or taking care of their carriages or horses. 6. All oats,
Indian corn, or other forage that waggons or horses bring to
the camp, more than is necessary for the subsistence of the
horses, is to be taken for the use of the army, and a reasonable
price paid for the same.

"Friends and Countrymen,<lb/>
</p><p>"Being occasionally at the camp at Frederic a few days
since, I found the general and officers extremely exasperated
on account of their not being supplied with horses and carriages,
which had been expected from this province, as most
able to furnish them; but, through the dissensions between
our governor and Assembly, money had not been provided,
nor any steps taken for that purpose.
</p><p>"It was proposed to send an armed force immediately
into these counties, to seize as many of the best carriages
and horses as should be wanted, and compel as many persons
into the service as would be necessary to drive and take care
of them.
</p><p>"I apprehended that the progress of British soldiers
through these counties on such an occasion, especially considering
the temper they are in, and their resentment against
us, would be attended with many and great inconveniences
to the inhabitants, and therefore more willingly took the
trouble of trying first what might be done by fair and
equitable means.  The people of these back counties have
lately complained to the Assembly that a sufficient currency
was wanting; you have an opportunity of receiving and
dividing among you a very considerable sum; for, if the
service of this expedition should continue, as it is more than
probable it will, for one hundred and twenty days, the hire
of these waggons and horses will amount to upward of
thirty thousand pounds, which will be paid you in silver
and gold of the king's money.
</p><p>"The service will be light and easy, for the army will
scarce march above twelve miles per day, and the waggons
and baggage-horses, as they carry those things that are
absolutely necessary to the welfare of the army, must march
with the army, and no faster; and are, for the army's sake,
always placed where they can be most secure, whether in a
march or in a camp.
</p><p>"If you are really, as I believe you are, good and loyal

<pb n="138"/>

subjects to his majesty, you may now do a most acceptable
service, and make it easy to yourselves; for three or four
of such as can not separately spare from the business of
their plantations a waggon and four horses and a driver,
may do it together, one furnishing the waggon, another one
or two horses, and another the driver, and divide the pay
proportionately between you; but if you do not this service
to your king and country voluntarily, when such good pay
and reasonable terms are offered to you, your loyalty will be
strongly suspected.  The king's business must be done; so
many brave troops, come so far for your defense, must not
stand idle through your backwardness to do what may be
reasonably expected from you; waggons and horses must be
had; violent measures will probably be used, and you will
be left to seek for a recompense where you can find it, and
your case, perhaps, be little pitied or regarded.
</p><p>"I have no particular interest in this affair, as, except
the satisfaction of endeavoring to do good, I shall have only
my labour for my pains.  If this method of obtaining the
waggons and horses is not likely to succeed, I am obliged
to send word to the general in fourteen days; and I suppose
Sir John St. Clair, the <ref target="f135">hussar</ref><note id="f135">A light calvary soldier. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, with a body of soldiers, will
immediately enter the province for the purpose, which I
shall be sorry to hear, because I am very sincerely and truly
your friend and well-wisher,                B. FRANKLIN."

</p><p>I received of the general about eight hundred pounds, to
be disbursed in advance-money to the waggon owners, etc.;
but, that sum being insufficient, I advanc'd upward of two
hundred pounds more, and in two weeks the one hundred and
fifty waggons, with two hundred and fifty-nine carrying
horses, were on their march for the camp.  The advertisement
promised payment according to the valuation, in case
any waggon or horse should be lost.  The owners, however,
alleging they did not know General Braddock, or what dependence
might be had on his promise, insisted on my bond
for the performance, which I accordingly gave them.
</p><p>While I was at the camp, <ref target="f136">supping</ref><note id="f136">To have supper with. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> one evening with the

his concern for the <ref target="f137">subalterns</ref><note id="f137">A person or person who are considered to be inferior or subordinate. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, who, he said, were generally

<pb n="139"/>

not in affluence, and could ill afford, in this dear country,
to lay in the stores that might be necessary in so long a
march, thro' a wilderness, where nothing was to be purchas'd.
I commiserated their case, and resolved to endeavor
procuring them some relief.  I said nothing, however, to him
of my intention, but wrote the next morning to the committee
of the Assembly, who had the disposition of some
public money, warmly recommending the case of these officers
to their consideration, and proposing that a present should
be sent them of necessaries and refreshments.  My son, who
had some experience of a camp life, and of its wants, drew
up a list for me, which I enclos'd in my letter.  The committee
approv'd, and used such diligence that, conducted by
my son, the stores arrived at the camp as soon as the waggons.
They consisted of twenty parcels, each containing
<list>
<item>6 lbs. loaf sugar.                 1 Gloucester cheese.</item>
<item>6 lbs. good <ref target="f138">Muscovado do</ref><note id="f138">Raw sugar. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>.  1 kegg containing 20 lbs. good butter</item>

<item>1-2 lb. pepper.  6 lbs. rice.</item>
<item>1 quart best white wine vinegar.   6 lbs. raisins.</item>

</list>
</p><p>These twenty parcels, well pack'd, were placed on as many
horses, each parcel, with the horse, being intended as a
present for one officer.  They were very thankfully receiv'd,
and the kindness acknowledg'd by letters to me from the
colonels of both regiments, in the most grateful terms.  The
general, too, was highly satisfied with my conduct in procuring
him the waggons, etc., and readily paid my account
of disbursements, thanking me repeatedly, and requesting my
farther assistance in sending provisions after him.  I undertook
this also, and was busily employ'd in it till we heard of
his defeat, advancing for the service of my own money,
upwards of one thousand pounds sterling, of which I sent
him an account.  It came to his hands, luckily for me, a few
days before the battle, and he return'd me immediately an
order on the paymaster for the round sum of one thousand
pounds, leaving the remainder to the next account.  I consider

<pb n="140"/>

this payment as good luck, having never been able to
obtain that remainder, of which more hereafter.
</p><p>This general was, I think, a brave man, and might probably
have made a figure as a good officer in some European
war.  But he had too much self-confidence, too high an
opinion of the validity of regular troops, and too mean a
one of both Americans and Indians.  George Croghan, our
Indian interpreter, join'd him on his march with one hundred
of those people, who might have been of great use to his
army as guides, scouts, etc., if he had treated them kindly;
but he slighted and neglected them, and they gradually left
him.
</p><p>In conversation with him one day, he was giving me some
account of his intended progress. "After taking Fort
Duquesne," says he, "I am to proceed to Niagara; and,
having taken that, to Frontenac, if the season will allow
time; and I suppose it will, for Duquesne can hardly detain
me above three or four days; and then I see nothing that
can obstruct my march to Niagara." Having before revolv'd
in my mind the long line his army must make in their march
by a very narrow road, to be cut for them thro' the woods
and bushes, and also what I had read of a former defeat of
fifteen hundred French, who invaded the Iroquois country,
I had conceiv'd some doubts and some fears for the event
of the campaign.  But I ventur'd only to say, "To be sure,
sir, if you arrive well before Duquesne, with these fine
troops, so well provided with artillery, that place not yet
compleatly fortified, and as we hear with no very strong
garrison, can probably make but a short resistance.  The
only danger I apprehend of obstruction to your march is
from <ref target="f141">ambuscades</ref><note id="f141">Ambushes. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> of Indians, who, by constant practice, are
dexterous in laying and executing them; and the slender
line, near four miles long, which your army must make, may
expose it to be attack'd by surprise in its flanks, and to be
cut like a thread into several pieces, which, from their distance,
can not come up in time to support each other."
</p><p>He smil'd at my ignorance, and reply'd, "These savages
may, indeed, be a formidable enemy to your raw American
militia, but upon the king's regular and disciplin'd troops,
sir, it is impossible they should make any impression." I

<pb n="141"/>

was conscious of an impropriety in my disputing with a
military man in matters of his profession, and said no more.
The enemy, however, did not take the advantage of his
army which I apprehended its long line of march expos'd
it to, but let it advance without interruption till within nine
miles of the place; and then, when more in a body (for it
had just passed a river, where the front had halted till
all were come over), and in a more open part of the woods
than any it had pass'd, attack'd its advanced guard by a
heavy fire from behind trees and bushes, which was the first
intelligence the general had of an enemy's being near him.
This guard being disordered, the general hurried the troops
up to their assistance, which was done in great confusion,
thro' waggons, baggage, and cattle; and presently the fire
came upon their flank: the officers, being on horseback, were
more easily distinguish'd, pick'd out as marks, and fell very
fast; and the soldiers were crowded together in a huddle,
having or hearing no orders, and standing to be shot at till
two-thirds of them were killed; and then, being seiz'd with
a panick, the whole fled with precipitation.
</p><p>The waggoners took each a horse out of his team and
scamper'd; their example was immediately followed by
others; so that all the waggons, provisions, artillery, and
stores were left to the enemy.  The general, being wounded,
was brought off with difficulty; his secretary, Mr. Shirley,
was killed by his side; and out of eighty-six officers, sixty-three were killed or wounded, and seven hundred and fourteen
men killed out of eleven hundred.  These eleven hundred
had been picked men from the whole army; the rest
had been left behind with Colonel Dunbar, who was to follow
with the heavier part of the stores, provisions, and
baggage.  The flyers, not being pursu'd, arriv'd at Dunbar's
camp, and the panick they brought with them instantly
seiz'd him and all his people; and, tho' he had now above
one thousand men, and the enemy who bad beaten Braddock
did not at most exceed four hundred Indians and French
together, instead of proceeding, and endeavoring to recover
some of the lost honour, he ordered all the stores, ammunition,
etc., to be destroy'd, that he might have more horses
to assist his flight towards the settlements, and less lumber

<pb n="142"/>

to remove.  He was there met with requests from the governors
of Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, that he
would post his troops on the frontiers, so as to afford some
protection to the inhabitants; but he continu'd his hasty
march thro' all the country, not thinking himself safe till
he arriv'd at Philadelphia, where the inhabitants could protect
him.  This whole transaction gave us Americans the
first suspicion that our exalted ideas of the prowess of
British regulars had not been well founded.
</p><p>In their first march, too, from their landing till they got
beyond the settlements, they had plundered and stripped the
inhabitants, totally ruining some poor families, besides insulting,
abusing, and confining the people if they <ref target="f142">remonstrated</ref><note id="f142">To point out or reveal. Source: Oxford Egnlish Dictionary</note>.
This was enough to put us out of conceit of such defenders,
if we had really wanted any.  How different was the conduct
of our French friends in 1781, who, during a march
thro' the most inhabited part of our country from Rhode
Island to Virginia, near seven hundred miles, occasioned not
the smallest complaint for the loss of a pig, a chicken, or
even an apple.
</p><p>Captain Orme, who was one of the general's <ref target="f143">aids-de-camp</ref><note id="f143">An assistant to a chief officer. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>,
and, being grievously wounded, was brought off with him,
and continu'd with him to his death, which happen'd in a

and at night only said, <hi rend="italic">"Who would have thought it?"</hi>
That he was silent again the following day, saying only at
last, <hi rend="italic">"We shall better know how to deal with them another
time;"</hi> and dy'd in a few minutes after.
</p><p>The secretary's papers, with all the general's orders, instructions,
and correspondence, falling into the enemy's
hands, they selected and translated into French a number of
the articles, which they printed, to prove the hostile intentions
of the British court before the declaration of war.
Among these I saw some letters of the general to the
ministry, speaking highly of the great service I had rendered
the army, and recommending me to their notice.  <ref target="f144">David

unfortunate, my service, it seems, was not thought of much
value, for those recommendations were never of any use
to me.

	Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> to rewards from himself, I ask'd only one, which was,
that he would give orders to his officers not to enlist any
more of our bought servants, and that he would discharge
such as had been already enlisted.  This he readily granted,
and several were accordingly return'd to their masters, on
my application.  Dunbar, when the command devolv'd on
him, was not so generous.  He being at Philadelphia, on his
retreat, or rather flight, I apply'd to him for the discharge
of the servants of three poor farmers of Lancaster county
that he had enlisted, reminding him of the late general's
orders on that bead.  He promised me that, if the masters
would come to him at Trenton, where he should be in a few
days on his march to New York, he would there deliver
their men to them.  They accordingly were at the expense
and trouble of going to Trenton, and there he refus'd to perform
his promise, to their great loss and disappointment.
</p><p>As soon as the loss of the waggons and horses was generally
known, all the owners came upon me for the valuation
which I had given bond to pay.  Their demands gave me
a great deal of trouble, my acquainting them that the money
was ready in the paymaster's hands, but that orders for
paying it must first be obtained from General Shirley, and
my assuring them that I had apply'd to that general by
letter; but, he being at a distance, an answer could not
soon be receiv'd, and they must have patience, all this was
not sufficient to satisfy, and some began to sue me.  General
Shirley at length relieved me from this terrible situation
by appointing commissioners to examine the claims,
and ordering payment.  They amounted to near twenty
thousand pound, which to pay would have ruined me.
</p><p>Before we had the news of this defeat, the two Doctors
Bond came to me with a subscription paper for raising money
to defray the expense of a grand firework, which it was
intended to exhibit at a rejoicing on receipt of the news
of our taking Fort Duquesne.  I looked grave, and said it
would, I thought, be time enough to prepare for the rejoicing

<pb n="144"/>

when we knew we should have occasion to rejoice.  They
seem'd surpris'd that I did not immediately comply with
their proposal.  "Why the d l!" says one of them, "you
surely don't suppose that the fort will not be taken?" "I
don't know that it will not be taken, but I know that the events
of war are subject to great uncertainty." I gave them the
reasons of my doubting; the subscription was dropt, and
the projectors thereby missed the mortification they would
have undergone if the firework had been prepared.  Dr.
Bond, on some other occasion afterward, said that he did
not like Franklin's forebodings.
</p><p>Governor Morris, who had continually worried the Assembly
with message after message before the defeat of
Braddock, to beat them into the making of acts to raise
money for the defense of the province, without taxing,
among others, the proprietary estates, and had rejected all
their bills for not having such an exempting clause, now
redoubled his attacks with more hope of success, the danger
and necessity being greater.  The Assembly, however, continu'd
firm, believing they had justice on their side, and that
it would be giving up an essential right if they suffered
the governor to amend their money-bills.  In one of the
last, indeed, which was for granting fifty thousand pounds,
his propos'd amendment was only of a single word.  The
bill expressed "that all estates, real and personal, were to
be taxed, those of the proprietaries not excepted." His
amendment was, for not read only: a small, but very material
alteration.  However, when the news of this disaster reached
England, our friends there, whom we had taken care to furnish
with all the Assembly's answers to the governor's messages,
rais'd a clamor against the proprietaries for their
meanness and injustice in giving their governor such instructions;
some going so far as to say that, by obstructing
the defense of their province, they forfeited their right to it.
They were intimidated by this, and sent orders to their
receiver-general to add five thousand pounds of their money
to whatever sum might be given by the Assembly for such
purpose.
</p><p>This, being notified to the House, was accepted in lieu
of their share of a general tax, and a new bill was form'd,

<pb n="145"/>

with an exempting clause, which passed accordingly.  By
this act I was appointed one of the commissioners for disposing
of the money, sixty thousand pounds.  I had been
active in modelling the bill and procuring its passage, and
had, at the same time, drawn a bill for establishing and
disciplining of a voluntary militia, which I carried thro' the
House without much difficulty, as care was taken in it to
leave the Quakers at their liberty.  To promote the association
necessary to form the militia, I wrote a dialogue,
<ref target="Fra2Aut.15">[15]</ref>
stating and answering all the objections I could think of to
such a militia, which was printed, and had, as I thought,
great effect.
</p><p>While the several companies in the city and country
were forming and learning their exercise, the governor prevail'd
with me to take charge of our North-western frontier,
which was infested by the enemy, and provide for the defense
of the inhabitants by raising troops and building a line of
forts.  I undertook this military business, tho' I did not conceive
myself well qualified for it.  He gave me a commission
with full powers, and a parcel of blank commissions for
officers, to be given to whom I thought fit.  I had but little
difficulty in raising men, having soon five hundred and sixty
under my command.  My son, who had in the preceding
war been an officer in the army rais'd against Canada, was
my aid-de-camp, and of great use to me.  The Indians had
burned Gnadenhut, a village settled by the Moravians, and
massacred the inhabitants; but the place was thought a
good situation for one of the forts.
</p><p>In order to march thither, I assembled the companies at
Bethlehem, the chief establishment of those people.  I was
surprised to find it in so good a posture of defense; the
destruction of Gnadenhut had made them apprehend danger.
The principal buildings were defended by a stockade; they
had purchased a quantity of arms and ammunition from
New York, and had even plac'd quantities of small paving
stones between the windows of their high stone houses, for
their women to throw down upon the heads of any Indians
that should attempt to force into them.  The armed brethren,


<pb n="146"/>

too, kept watch, and reliev'd as methodically as in any garrison
town.  In conversation with the bishop, Spangenberg,
I mention'd this my surprise; for, knowing they had obtained
an act of Parliament exempting them from military
duties in the colonies, I had suppos'd they were conscientiously
scrupulous of bearing arms.  He answer'd me that
it was not one of their established principles, but that, at
the time of their obtaining that act, it was thought to be a
principle with many of their people.  On this occasion, however,
they, to their surprise, found it adopted by but a few.
It seems they were either deceiv'd in themselves, or deceiv'd
the Parliament; but common sense, aided by present danger,
will sometimes be too strong for whimsical opinions.
</p><p>It was the beginning of January when we set out upon this
business of building forts.  I sent one detachment toward
the Minisink, with instructions to erect one for the security
of that upper part of the country, and another to the lower
part, with similar instructions; and I concluded to go
myself with the rest of my force to Gnadenhut, where a
fort was tho't more immediately necessary.  The Moravians
procur'd me five waggons for our tools, stores, baggage, etc.
</p><p>Just before we left Bethlehem, eleven farmers, who had
been driven from their plantations by the Indians, came to
me requesting a supply of firearms, that they might go back
and fetch off their cattle.  I gave them each a gun with
suitable ammunition.  We had not march'd many miles
before it began to rain, and it continued raining all day;
there were no habitations on the road to shelter us, till we
arriv'd near night at the house of a German, where, and in
his barn, we were all huddled together, as wet as water
could make us.  It was well we were not attack'd in our
march, for our arms were of the most ordinary sort, and
our men could not keep their gun locks dry.  The Indians
are dextrous in contrivances for that purpose, which we had
not.  They met that day the eleven poor farmers above
mentioned, and killed ten of them.  The one who escap'd
inform'd that his and his companions' guns would not go off,
the priming being wet with the rain.
</p><p>The next day being fair, we continu'd our march, and
arriv'd at the desolated Gnadenhut.  There was a saw-mill

<pb n="147"/>

near, round which were left several piles of boards, with
which we soon hutted ourselves; an operation the more
necessary at that inclement season, as we had no tents.  Our
first work was to bury more effectually the dead we found
there, who had been half <ref target="f147">interr'd</ref><note id="f147">Buried. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> by the country people.
</p><p>The next morning our fort was plann'd and mark'd out,
the circumference measuring four hundred and fifty-five
feet, which would require as many <ref target="f148">palisades</ref><note id="f148">Fences. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> to be made of
trees, one with another, of a foot diameter each.  Our axes,
of which we had seventy, were immediately set to work to
cut down trees, and, our men being dextrous in the use of
them, great despatch was made.  Seeing the trees fall so
fast, I had the curiosity to look at my watch when two men
began to cut at a pine; in six minutes they had it upon
the ground, and I found it of fourteen inches diameter.
Each pine made three palisades of eighteen feet long,
pointed at one end.  While these were preparing, our other
men dug a trench all round, of three feet deep, in which the
palisades were to be planted; and, our waggons, the bodys
being taken off, and the fore and hind wheels separated by
taking out the pin which united the two parts of the perch,
we had ten carriages, with two horses each, to bring the
palisades from the woods to the spot.  When they were set
up, our carpenters built a stage of boards all round within,
about six feet high, for the men to stand on when to fire
thro' the loopholes.  We had one swivel gun, which we
mounted on one of the angles, and fir'd it as soon as fix'd, to
let the Indians know, if any were within hearing, that we
had such pieces; and thus our fort, if such a magnificent
name may be given to so miserable a stockade, was finish'd
in a week, though it rain'd so hard every other day that the
men could not work.
</p><p>This gave me occasion to observe, that, when men are
employ'd, they are best content'd; for on the days they
worked they were good-natur'd and cheerful, and, with the
consciousness of having done a good day's work, they spent
the evening jollily; but on our idle days they were mutinous
and quarrelsome, finding fault with their pork, the
bread, etc., and in continual ill-humor, which put me in
mind of a sea-captain, whose rule it was to keep his men

<pb n="148"/>

constantly at work; and, when his mate once told him that
they had done every thing, and there was nothing further
to employ them about, <ref target="f149"><hi rend="italic">"Oh," says he, "Make them <ref target="f150">scour</ref><note id="f150">Polish. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>
the anchor."</hi></ref><note id="f149">An obviously meaningless task. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>
</p><p>This kind of fort, however contemptible, is a sufficient
defense against Indians, who have no cannon.  Finding ourselves
now posted securely, and having a place to retreat
to on occasion, we ventur'd out in parties to scour the adjacent
country.  We met with no Indians, but we found
the places on the neighboring hills where they had lain to
watch our proceedings.  There was an art in their contrivance
of those places, that seems worth mention. It
being winter, a fire was necessary for them; but a common
fire on the surface of the ground would by its light have
discovered their position at a distance.  They had therefore
dug holes in the ground about three feet diameter, and somewhat
deeper; we saw where they had with their hatchets
cut off the charcoal from the sides of burnt logs lying in
the woods.  With these coals they had made small fires in
the bottom of the holes, and we observ'd among the weeds
and grass the prints of their bodies, made by their laying
all round, with their legs hanging down in the holes to keep
their feet warm, which, with them, is an essential point.
This kind of fire, so manag'd, could not discover them, either
by its light, flame, sparks, or even smoke: it appear'd that
their number was not great, and it seems they saw we were
too many to be attacked by them with prospect of advantage.
</p><p>We had for our <ref target="f151">chaplain</ref><note id="f151">Priest. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> a zealous Presbyterian minister,
Mr. Beatty, who complained to me that the men did not
generally attend his prayers and <ref target="f152">exhortations</ref><note id="f152">Praises. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>.  When they
enlisted, they were promised, besides pay and provisions, a
<ref target="f153">gill</ref><note id="f153">One fourth of a pint. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> of rum a day, which was punctually serv'd out to them,
half in the morning, and the other half in the evening; and
I observ'd they were as punctual in attending to receive it;
upon which I said to Mr. Beatty, "It is, perhaps, below the
dignity of your profession to act as steward of the rum,
but if you were to deal it out and only just after prayers,
you would have them all about you." He liked the tho't,
undertook the office, and, with the help of a few hands to
measure out the liquor, executed it to satisfaction, and

<pb n="149"/>

never were prayers more generally and more punctually
attended; so that I thought this method preferable to the
punishment inflicted by some military laws for non-attendance
on divine service.
</p><p>I had hardly finish'd this business, and got my fort well
stor'd with provisions, when I receiv'd a letter from the
governor, acquainting me that he had call'd the Assembly,
and wished my attendance there, if the posture of affairs on
the frontiers was such that my remaining there was no
longer necessary.  My friends, too, of the Assembly, pressing
me by their letters to be, if possible, at the meeting,
and my three intended forts being now compleated, and the
inhabitants contented to remain on their farms under that
protection, I resolved to return; the more willingly, as a
New England officer, Colonel Clapham, experienced in Indian
war, being on a visit to our establishment, consented to
accept the command.  I gave him a commission, and, parading
the garrison, had it read before them, and introduc'd
him to them as an officer who, from his skill in military
affairs, was much more fit to command them than myself;
and, giving them a little exhortation, took my leave.  I was
escorted as far as Bethlehem, where I rested a few days to
recover from the fatigue I had undergone.  The first night,
being in a good bed, I could hardly sleep, it was so different
from my hard lodging on the floor of our hut at Gnaden
wrapt only in a blanket or two.
</p><p>While at Bethlehem, I inquir'd a little into the practice of
the Moravians: some of them had accompanied me, and all
were very kind to me.  I found they work'd for a common
stock, eat at common tables, and slept in common dormitories,
great numbers together.  In the dormitories I observed
loopholes, at certain distances all along just under
the ceiling, which I thought judiciously placed for change
of air.  I was at their church, where I was entertain'd with
good musick, the organ being accompanied with violins,
<ref target="f154">hautboys</ref><note id="f154">Oboes. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, flutes, clarinets, etc.  I understood that their sermons
were not usually preached to mixed congregations of
men, women, and children, as is our common practice, but
that they assembled sometimes the married men, at other
times their wives, then the young men, the young women,

<pb n="150"/>

and the little children, each division by itself.  The sermon
I heard was to the latter, who came in and were plac'd in
rows on benches; the boys under the conduct of a young
man, their tutor, and the girls conducted by a young woman.
The discourse seem'd well adapted to their capacities, and
was deliver'd in a pleasing, familiar manner, coaxing them,
as it were, to be good.  They behav'd very orderly, but
looked pale and unhealthy, which made me suspect they were
kept too much within doors, or not allow'd sufficient exercise.
</p><p>I inquir'd concerning the Moravian marriages, whether
the report was true that they were by <ref target="f155">lot</ref><note id="f155">Random selection. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>.  I was told that
lots were us'd only in particular cases; that generally, when
a young man found himself dispos'd to marry, he inform'd
the elders of his class, who consulted the elder ladies that
govern'd the young women.  As these elders of the different
sexes were well acquainted with the tempers and dispositions
of their respective pupils, they could best judge what matches
were suitable, and their judgments were generally <ref target="f156">acquiesc'd</ref><note id="f156">Agreed. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>
in; but if, for example, it should happen that two or three
young women were found to be equally proper for the
young man, the lot was then recurred to.  I objected, if the
matches are not made by the mutual choice of the parties,
some of them may chance to be very unhappy.  "And so
they may," answer'd my informer, "if you let the parties
chuse for themselves;" which, indeed, I could not deny.
</p><p>Being returned to Philadelphia, I found the association
went on swimmingly, the inhabitants that were not Quakers
having pretty generally come into it, formed themselves into
companies, and chose their captains, lieutenants, and <ref target="f157">ensigns</ref><note id="f157">(DRAFT) Soldiers. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>,
according to the new law.  Dr. B. visited me, and gave me
an account of the pains he had taken to spread a general
good liking to the law, and ascribed much to those endeavors.
I had had the vanity to ascribe all to my <hi rend="italic">Dialogue</hi>; however,
not knowing but that he might be in the right, I let him
enjoy his opinion, which I take to be generally the best way
in such cases.  The officers, meeting, chose me to be colonel
of the regiment, which I this time accepted.  I forget how
many companies we had, but we paraded about twelve hundred
well-looking men, with a company of artillery, who
had been furnished with six brass field-pieces, which they

<pb n="151"/>

had become so expert in the use of as to fire twelve times in
a minute.  The first time I reviewed my regiment they
accompanied me to my house, and would salute me with
some rounds fired before my door, which shook down and
broke several glasses of my electrical apparatus.  And my
new honour proved not much less brittle; for all our commissions
were soon after broken by a repeal of the law in
England.
</p><p>During this short time of my colonelship, being about to
set out on a journey to Virginia, the officers of my regiment
took it into their heads that it would be proper for them
to escort me out of town, as far as the Lower Ferry.  Just
as I was getting on horseback they came to my door, between
thirty and forty, mounted, and all in their uniforms.  I had
not been previously acquainted with the project, or I should
have prevented it, being naturally averse to the assuming
of state on any occasion; and I was a good deal chagrin'd
at their appearance, as I could not avoid their accompanying
me. What made it worse was, that, as soon as we began to
move, they drew their swords and rode with them naked all
the way.  Somebody wrote an account of this to the proprietor,
and it gave him great offense.  No such honor had
been paid him when in the province, nor to any of his
governors; and he said it was only proper to princes of the
blood royal, which may be true for aught I know, who was,
and still am, ignorant of the etiquette in such cases.
</p><p>This silly affair, however, greatly increased his <ref target="f158">rancour</ref><note id="f158">Resentment. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>
against me, which was before not a little, on account of my
conduct in the Assembly respecting the exemption of his
estate from taxation, which I had always oppos'd very
warmly, and not without severe reflections on his meanness
and injustice of contending for it.  He accused me to the
ministry as being the great obstacle to the king's service,
preventing, by my influence in the House, the proper form
of the bills for raising money, and he instanced this parade
with my officers as a proof of my having an intention to take
the government of the province out of his hands by force.
He also applied to Sir Everard Fawkener, the postmaster-general, to deprive me of my office; but it had no other effect
than to procure from Sir Everard a gentle admonition.

<pb n="152"/>

</p><p>Notwithstanding the continual wrangle between the governor
and the House, in which I, as a member, had so large
a share, there still subsisted a civil intercourse between that
gentleman and myself, and we never had any personal difference.
I have sometimes since thought that his little or
no resentment against me, for the answers it was known I
drew up to his messages, might be the effect of professional
habit, and that, being bred a lawyer, he might consider us
both as merely advocates for contending clients in a suit,
he for the proprietaries and I for the Assembly.  He would,
therefore, sometimes call in a friendly way to advise with
me on difficult points, and sometimes, tho' not often, take
my advice.
</p><p>We acted in <ref target="f159">concert</ref><note id="f159">"Agreement or harmony." Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> to supply Braddock's army with provisions;
and, when the shocking news arrived of his defeat,
the governor sent in haste for me, to consult with him on
measures for preventing the desertion of the back counties.
I forget now the advice I gave; but I think it was, that
Dunbar should be written to, and prevail'd with, if possible,
to post his troops on the frontiers for their protection, till,
by re-enforcements from the colonies, he might be able to
proceed on the expedition.  And, after my return from the
frontier, he would have had me undertake the conduct of
such an expedition with provincial troops, for the reduction
of Fort Duquesne, Dunbar and his men being otherwise
employed; and he proposed to commission me as general.
I had not so good an opinion of my military abilities as he
profess'd to have, and I believe his professions must have
exceeded his real sentiments; but probably he might think
that my popularity would facilitate the raising of the men,
and my influence in Assembly, the grant of money to pay
them, and that, perhaps, without taxing the proprietary
estate.  Finding me not so forward to engage as he expected,
the project was dropt, and he soon after left the government,
being superseded by Captain Denny.
</p><p>Before I proceed in relating the part I had in public affairs
under this new governor's administration, it may not be
amiss here to give some account of the rise and progress of
my philosophical reputation.
</p><p>In 1746, being at Boston, I met there with a Dr. Spence,

<pb n="153"/>

who was lately arrived from Scotland, and show'd me some
electric experiments.  They were imperfectly perform'd, as
he was not very expert; but, being on a subject quite new
to me, they equally surpris'd and pleased me.  Soon after my
return to Philadelphia, our library company receiv'd from
Mr. P. Collinson, Fellow of the <ref target="f161">Royal Society</ref><note id="f161">A British national scientific institution that was created to promote and further learning. Source: Wikipedia</note> of London, a
present of a glass tube, with some account of the use of it
in making such experiments.  I eagerly seized the opportunity
of repeating what I had seen at Boston; and, by
much practice, acquir'd great readiness in performing those,
also, which we had an account of from England, adding a
number of new ones.  I say much practice, for my house
was continually full, for some time, with people who came
to see these new wonders.
</p><p>To divide a little this <ref target="f160">incumbrance</ref><note id="f160">Burden. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> among my friends, I
caused a number of similar tubes to be blown at our glass-house, with which they furnish'd themselves, so that we had
at length several performers.  Among these, the principal
was Mr. Kinnersley, an ingenious neighbor, who, being out
of business, I encouraged to undertake showing the experiments
for money, and drew up for him two lectures, in which
the experiments were rang'd in such order, and accompanied
with such explanations in such method, as that the foregoing
should assist in comprehending the following.  He
procur'd an elegant apparatus for the purpose, in which all
the little machines that I had roughly made for myself were
nicely form'd by instrument-makers.  His lectures were well
attended, and gave great satisfaction; and after some time
he went thro' the colonies, exhibiting them in every capital
town, and pick'd up some money.  In the West India islands,
indeed, it was with difficulty the experiments could be made,
from the general moisture of the air.
</p><p>Oblig'd as we were to Mr. Collinson for his present of the
tube, etc., I thought it right he should be inform'd of our
success in using it, and wrote him several letters containing
accounts of our experiments.  He got them read in the Royal
Society, where they were not at first thought worth so
much notice as to be printed in their Transactions.  One
paper, which I wrote for Mr. Kinnersley, on the sameness
of lightning with electricity, I sent to Dr. Mitchel, an

<pb n="154"/>

acquaintance of mine, and one of the members also of that
society, who wrote me word that it had been read, but was
laughed at by the connoisseurs.  The papers, however, being
shown to Dr. Fothergill, he thought them of too much value
to be stifled, and advis'd the printing of them.  Mr. Collinson
then gave them to <hi rend="italic">Cave</hi> for publication in his Gentleman's
Magazine; but he chose to print them separately in a
pamphlet, and Dr. Fothergill wrote the preface.  Cave, it
seems, judged rightly for his profit, for by the additions
that arrived afterward they swell'd to a quarto volume,
which has had five editions, and cost him nothing for
copy-money.
</p><p>It was, however, some time before those papers were much
taken notice of in England.  A copy of them happening to
fall into the hands of the <ref target="f162">Count de Buffon</ref><note id="f162">George-Louis Leclerc or Comte de Buffon (1707-1788) was a French naturalist philosopher and mathematician. He is noted mostly for his influence on the field of naturalism. Source: Wikipedia</note>, a philosopher
deservedly of great reputation in France, and, indeed, all
over Europe, he prevailed with M. Dalibard to translate
them into French, and they were printed at Paris.  The
publication offended the <ref target="f163">Abbe Nollet</ref><note id="f163">Jean-Antoine Nollet or Abbe Nollet (1700-1770) was a French priest and physicist. Source: Wikipedia</note>, preceptor in Natural
Philosophy to the royal family, and an able experimenter,
who had form'd and publish'd a theory of electricity, which
then had the general <ref target="f164">vogue</ref><note id="f164">In general acceptance. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>.  He could not at first believe
that such a work came from America, and said it must have
been fabricated by his enemies at Paris, to decry his system.
Afterwards, having been assur'd that there really existed
such a person as Franklin at Philadelphia, which he had
doubted, he wrote and published a volume of Letters, chiefly
address'd to me, defending his theory, and denying the <ref target="f165">verity</ref><note id="f165">The truth. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>
of my experiments, and of the positions deduc'd from them.
</p><p>I once purpos'd answering the abbe, and actually began
the answer; but, on consideration that my writings contain'd
a description of experiments which any one might
repeat and verify, and if not to be verifi'd, could not be
defended; or of observations offer'd as conjectures, and not
delivered dogmatically, therefore not laying me under any
obligation to defend them; and reflecting that a dispute
between two persons, writing in different languages, might
be lengthened greatly by mistranslations, and thence misconceptions
of one another's meaning, much of one of the abbe's letters being founded on an error in the translation,
I concluded to let my papers shift for themselves, believing
it was better to spend what time I could spare from public
business in making new experiments, than in disputing about
those already made.  I therefore never answered M. Nollet,
and the event gave me no cause to repent my silence; for
my friend M. le Roy, of the Royal Academy of Sciences,
took up my cause and refuted him; my book was translated
into the Italian, German, and Latin languages; and the
doctrine it contain'd was by degrees universally adopted by
the philosophers of Europe, in preference to that of the
abbe; so that he lived to see himself the last of his sect,
except Monsieur B , of Paris, his <hi rend="italic">lve</hi> and immediate
disciple.
</p>
       <p>What gave my book the more sudden and general celebrity,
was the success of one of its proposed experiments, made by
Messrs.  Dalibard and De Lor at Marly, for drawing lightning
from the clouds. This engag'd the public attention
every where. M. de Lor, who had an apparatus for experimental
philosophy, and lectur'd in that branch of science,
undertook to repeat what he called the Philadelphia Experiments;
and, after they were performed before the king and
court, all the curious of Paris flocked to see them.  I will
not swell this narrative with an account of that capital
experiment, nor of the infinite pleasure I receiv'd in the
success of a similar one I made soon after with a kite at
Philadelphia, as both are to be found in the histories of
electricity.
</p>
       <p>Dr. Wright, an English physician, when at Paris, wrote
to a friend, who was of the Royal Society, an account of the
high esteem my experiments were in among the learned
abroad, and of their wonder that my writings had been so
little noticed in England.  The society, on this, resum'd the
consideration of the letters that had been read to them; and
the celebrated Dr. Watson drew up a summary account of
them, and of all I had afterwards sent to England on the
subject, which be accompanied with some praise of the
writer.  This summary was then printed in their Transactions;
and some members of the society in London, particularly
the very ingenious Mr. Canton, having verified the
experiment of procuring lightning from the clouds by a
pointed rod, and acquainting them with the success, they
soon made me more than amends for the slight with which
they had before treated me.  Without my having made any
application for that honor, they chose me a member, and
voted that I should be excus'd the customary payments,
which would have amounted to twenty-five guineas; and
ever since have given me their Transactions gratis.  They
also presented me with the gold medal of Sir Godfrey Copley
for the year 1753, the delivery of which was accompanied by
a very handsome speech of the president, Lord Macclesfield,
wherein I was highly honoured.
</p>
       <p>Our new governor, Captain Denny, brought over for me
the before-mentioned medal from the Royal Society, which
he presented to me at an entertainment given him by the
city.  He accompanied it with very polite expressions of his
esteem for me, having, as he said, been long acquainted with
my character.  After dinner, when the company, as was
customary at that time, were engag'd in drinking, he took
me aside into another room, and acquainted me that he had
been advis'd by his friends in England to cultivate a friendship
with me, as one who was capable of giving him the
best advice, and of contributing most effectually to the
making his administration easy; that he therefore desired
of all things to have a good understanding with me, and he
begg'd me to be assur'd of his readiness on all occasions to
render me every service that might be in his power.  He
said much to me, also, of the proprietor's good disposition
towards the province, and of the advantage it might be to
us all, and to me in particular, if the opposition that had
been so long continu'd to his measures was dropt, and harmony
restor'd between him and the people; in effecting
which, it was thought no one could be more serviceable than
myself; and I might depend on adequate acknowledgments
and recompenses, etc., etc.  The drinkers, finding we did not
return immediately to the table, sent us a decanter of
Madeira, which the governor made liberal use of, and in
proportion became more profuse of his solicitations and
promises.
</p>
       <p>My answers were to this purpose: that my circumstances,
thanks to God, were such as to make proprietary favours
unnecessary to me; and that, being a member of the Assembly,
I could not possibly accept of any; that, however, I had
no personal enmity to the proprietary, and that, whenever
the public measures he propos'd should appear to be for the
good of the people, no one should espouse and forward them
more zealously than myself; my past opposition having been
founded on this, that the measures which had been urged
were evidently intended to serve the proprietary interest,
with great prejudice to that of the people; that I was much
obliged to him (the governor) for his professions of regard
to me, and that he might rely on every thing in my power
to make his administration as easy as possible, hoping at
the same time that he had not brought with him the same
unfortunate instruction his predecessor had been hamper'd
with.
</p>
       <p>On this he did not then explain himself; but when he
afterwards came to do business with the Assembly, they
appear'd again, the disputes were renewed, and I was as
active as ever in the opposition, being the penman, first, of
the request to have a communication of the instructions, and
then of the remarks upon them, which may be found in the
votes of the time, and in the Historical Review I afterward
publish'd.  But between us personally no enmity arose; we
were often together; he was a man of letters, had seen
much of the world, and was very entertaining and pleasing
in conversation.  He gave me the first information that my
old friend Jas. Ralph was still alive; that he was esteem'd
one of the best political writers in England; had been employ'd
in the dispute between Prince Frederic and the king,
and had obtain'd a pension of three hundred a year; that
his reputation was indeed small as a poet, Pope having
damned his poetry in the Dunciad; but his prose was
thought as good as any man's.</p>
       
       <p>The Assembly finally finding the proprietary obstinately
persisted in manacling their deputies with instructions inconsistent
not only with the privileges of the people, but
with the service of the crown, resolv'd to petition the king
against them, and appointed me their agent to go over to
England, to present and support the petition.  The House
had sent up a bill to the governor, granting a sum of sixty
thousand pounds for the king's use (ten thousand pounds of
which was subjected to the orders of the then general, Lord Loudoun), which the governor absolutely refus'd to pass, in
compliance with his instructions.
</p>
       <p>I had agreed with Captain Morris, of the paquet at New
York, for my passage, and my stores were put on board,
when Lord Loudoun arriv'd at Philadelphia, expressly, as
he told me, to endeavor an accommodation between the
governor and Assembly, that his majesty's service might not
be obstructed by their dissensions.  Accordingly, he desir'd
the governor and myself to meet him, that he might hear
what was to be said on both sides.  We met and discuss'd
the business.  In behalf of the Assembly, I urg'd all the
various arguments that may be found in the public papers of
that time, which were of my writing, and are printed with
the minutes of the Assembly; and the governor pleaded his
instructions; the bond he had given to observe them, and
his ruin if he disobey'd, yet seemed not unwilling to hazard
himself if Lord Loudoun would advise it.  This his lordship
did not chuse to do, though I once thought I had nearly
prevail'd with him to do it; but finally he rather chose to
urge the compliance of the Assembly; and he entreated me
to use my endeavours with them for that purpose, declaring
that he would spare none of the king's troops for the defense
of our frontiers, and that, if we did not continue to provide
for that defense ourselves, they must remain expos'd to the
enemy.
</p>
       <p>I acquainted the House with what had pass'd, and, presenting
them with a set of resolutions I had drawn up,
declaring our rights, and that we did not relinquish our
claim to those rights, but  only suspended the exercise of
them on this occasion thro' <hi rend="italic">force,</hi> against which we protested,
they at length agreed to drop that bill, and frame another
conformable to the proprietary instructions.  This of course
the governor pass'd, and I was then at liberty to proceed on
my voyage.  But, in the meantime, the paquet had sailed
with my sea-stores, which was some loss to me, and my
only recompense was his lordship's thanks for my service,
all the credit of obtaining the accommodation falling to his
share.
</p>
       <p>He set out for New York before me; and, as the time
for dispatching the paquet-boats was at his disposition, and
there were two then remaining there, one of which, he said,
was to sail very soon, I requested to know the precise time,
that I might not miss her by any delay of mine.  His answer
was, "I have given out that she is to sail on Saturday next;
but I may let you know, <hi rend="italic">entre nous,</hi> that if you are there by
Monday morning, you will be in time, but do not delay
longer." By some accidental hinderance at a ferry, it was
Monday noon before I arrived, and I was much afraid she
might have sailed, as the wind was fair; but I was soon
made easy by the information that she was still in the harbor,
and would not move till the next day.  One would
imagine that I was now on the very point of departing for
Europe.  I thought so; but I was not then so well acquainted
with his lordship's character, of which <hi rend="italic">indecision</hi> was one of
the strongest features.  I shall give some instances.  It was
about the beginning of April that I came to New York, and I
think it was near the end of June before we sail'd.  There
were then two of the paquet-boats, which had been long in
port, but were detained for the general's letters, which were
always to be ready to-morrow.  Another paquet arriv'd;
she too was detain'd; and, before we sail'd, a fourth was
expected.  Ours was the first to be dispatch'd, as having been
there longest.  Passengers were engag'd in all, and some
extremely impatient to be gone, and the merchants uneasy
about their letters, and the orders they had given for insurance
(it being war time) for fall goods! but their anxiety
avail'd nothing; his lordship's letters were not ready; and
yet whoever waited on him found him always at his desk,
pen in hand, and concluded he must needs write abundantly.
</p>
       <p>Going myself one morning to pay my respects, I found in
his antechamber one Innis, a messenger of Philadelphia,
who had come from thence express with a paquet from Governor
Denny for the General.  He delivered to me some
letters from my friends there, which occasion'd my inquiring
when he was to return, and where be lodg'd, that I might
send some letters by him.  He told me he was order'd to
call to-morrow at nine for the general's answer to the governor,
and should set off immediately.  I put my letters into
his hands the same day.  A fortnight after I met him again
in the same place.  "So, you are soon return'd, Innis?"
<hi rend="italic">"Returned!</hi> no, I am not <hi rend="italic">gone</hi> yet." "How so?" "I have
called here by order every morning these two weeks past for
his lordship's letter, and it is not yet ready." "Is it possible,
when he is so great a writer? for I see him constantly at his
escritoire." "Yes," says Innis, "but he is like St. George
on the signs, <hi rend="italic">always on horseback, and never rides on."</hi>
This observation of the messenger was, it seems, well
founded; for, when in England, I understood that Mr. Pitt
gave it as one reason for removing this general, and sending
Generals Amherst and Wolfe, <hi rend="italic">that the minister never heard
from him, and could not know what he was doing.</hi>
</p>
       <p>This daily expectation of sailing, and all the three paquets
going down to Sandy Hook, to join the fleet there, the passengers
thought it best to be on board, lest by a sudden
order the ships should sail, and they be left behind.  There,
if I remember right, we were about six weeks, consuming
our sea-stores, and oblig'd to procure more.  At length the
fleet sail'd, the General and all his army on board, bound to
Louisburg, with intent to besiege and take that fortress; all
the paquet-boats in company ordered to attend the General's
ship, ready to receive his dispatches when they should be
ready.  We were out five days before we got a letter with
leave to part, and then our ship quitted the fleet and steered
for England.  The other two paquets he still detained, carried
them with him to Halifax, where he stayed some time
to exercise the men in sham attacks upon sham forts, then
alter'd his mind as to besieging Louisburg, and return'd to
New York, with all his troops, together with the two paquets
above mentioned, and all their passengers! During his
absence the French and savages had taken Fort George, on
the frontier of that province, and the savages had massacred
many of the garrison after capitulation.
</p>
       <p>I saw afterwards in London Captain Bonnell, who commanded
one of those paquets.  He told me that, when he
had been detain'd a month, he acquainted his lordship that
his ship was grown foul, to a degree that must necessarily
hinder her fast sailing, a point of consequence for a paquet-boat, and requested an allowance of time to heave her down
and clean her bottom.  He was asked how long time that would
require.  He answer'd, three days. The general replied, "If
you can do it in one day, I give leave; otherwise not; for
you must certainly sail the day after to-morrow." So he
never obtain'd leave, though detained afterwards from day
to day during full three months.
</p>
       <p>I saw also in London one of Bonnell's passengers, who
was so enrag'd against his lordship for deceiving and detaining
him so long at New York, and then carrying him to
Halifax and back again, that he swore he would sue for
damages.  Whether he did or not, I never heard; but, as he
represented the injury to his affairs, it was very considerable.
</p>
       <p>On the whole, I wonder'd much how such a man came to
be intrusted with so important a business as the conduct of
a great army; but, having since seen more of the great
world, and the means of obtaining, and motives for giving
places, my wonder is diminished.  General Shirley, on whom
the command of the army devolved upon the death of Braddock,
would, in my opinion, if continued in place, have made
a much better campaign than that of Loudoun in 1757, which
was frivolous, expensive, and disgraceful to our nation beyond
conception; for, tho' Shirley was not a bred soldier,
he was sensible and sagacious in himself, and attentive to
good advice from others, capable of forming judicious plans,
and quick and active in carrying them into execution.  Loudoun,
instead of defending the colonies with his great army,
left them totally expos'd while he paraded idly at Halifax,
by which means Fort George was lost, besides, he derang'd
all our mercantile operations, and distress'd our trade, by a
long embargo on the exportation of provisions, on pretence
of keeping supplies from being obtain'd by the enemy, but
in reality for beating down their price in favor of the contractors,
in whose profits, it was said, perhaps from suspicion
only, he had a share.  And, when at length the embargo was
taken off, by neglecting to send notice of it to Charlestown,
the Carolina fleet was detain'd near three months longer,
whereby their bottoms were so much damaged by the worm
that a great part of them foundered in their passage home.
</p>
       <p>Shirley was, I believe, sincerely glad of being relieved
from so burdensome a charge as the conduct of an army
must be to a man unacquainted with military business.  I
was at the entertainment given by the city of New York to
Lord Loudoun, on his taking upon him the command.  Shirley,
tho' thereby superseded, was present also.  There was a
great company of officers, citizens, and strangers, and, some
chairs having been borrowed in the neighborhood, there was
one among them very low, which fell to the lot of Mr.
Shirley.  Perceiving it as I sat by him, I said, "They have
given you, sir, too low a seat." "No matter," says he, "Mr.
Franklin, I find a low seat the easiest."
</p> 
       
       <p>While I was, as afore mention'd, detain'd at New York, I
receiv'd all the accounts of the provisions, etc., that I had
furnish'd to Braddock, some of which accounts could not
sooner be obtain'd from the different persons I had employ'd
to assist in the business.  I presented them to Lord Loudoun,
desiring to be paid the ballance.  He caus'd them to be regularly
examined by the proper officer, who, after comparing
every article with its voucher, certified them to be right; and
the balance due for which his lordship promis'd to give me
an order on the paymaster. This was, however, put off
from time to time; and, tho' I call'd often for it by appointment,
I did not get it.  At length, just before my departure,
he told me he had, on better consideration, concluded not to
mix his accounts with those of his predecessors.  "And you,"
says he, "when in England, have only to exhibit your
accounts at the treasury, and you will be paid immediately."
</p>
       <p>I mention'd, but without effect, the great and unexpected
expense I had been put to by being detain'd so long at New
York, as a reason for my desiring to be presently paid; and
on my observing that it was not right I should be put to
any further trouble or delay in obtaining the money I had
advanc'd, as I charged no commission for my service, "0,
sir," says he, "you must not think of persuading us that you
are no gainer; we understand better those affairs, and know
that every one concerned in supplying the army finds means,
in the doing it, to fill his own pockets." I assur'd him that
was not my case, and that I had not pocketed a farthing;
but he appear'd clearly not to believe me; and, indeed, I
have since learnt that immense fortunes are often made in
such employments.  As to my ballance, I am not paid it to
this day, of which more hereafter.
</p>
       <p>Our captain of the paquet had boasted much, before we
sailed, of the swiftness of his ship; unfortunately, when we
came to sea, she proved the dullest of ninety-six sail, to his
no small mortification.  After many conjectures respecting
the cause, when we were near another ship almost as dull
as ours, which, however, gain'd upon us, the captain ordered
all hands to come aft, and stand as near the ensign staff as
possible.  We were, passengers included, about forty persons.
While we stood there, the ship mended her pace, and
soon left her neighbour far behind, which prov'd clearly
what our captain suspected, that she was loaded too much
by the head.  The casks of water, it seems, had been all
plac'd forward; these he therefore order'd to be mov'd
further aft, on which the ship recover'd her character, and
proved the sailer in the fleet.
</p><p>The captain said she had once gone at the rate of thirteen
knots, which is accounted thirteen miles per hour.  We had
on board, as a passenger, Captain Kennedy, of the Navy,
who contended that it was impossible, and that no ship ever
sailed so fast, and that there must have been some error in
the division of the log-line, or some mistake in heaving the
log.  A wager ensu'd between the two captains, to be decided
when there should be sufficient wind.  Kennedy thereupon
examin'd rigorously the log-line, and, being satisfi'd with
that, he determin'd to throw the log himself.  Accordingly
some days after, when the wind blew very fair and fresh,
and the captain of the paquet, Lutwidge, said he believ'd
she then went at the rate of thirteen knots, Kennedy made
the experiment, and own'd his wager lost.
</p>
       <p>The above fact I give for the sake of the following observation.
It has been remark'd, as an imperfection in the
art of ship-building, that it can never be known, till she
is tried, whether a new ship will or will not be a good sailer;
for that the model of a good-sailing ship has been exactly
follow'd in a new one, which has prov'd, on the contrary,
remarkably dull. I apprehend that this may partly be occasion'd
by the different opinions of seamen respecting the
modes of lading, rigging, and sailing of a ship; each has
his system; and the same vessel, laden by the judgment
and orders of one captain, shall sail better or worse than
when by the orders of another.  Besides, it scarce ever happens
that a ship is form'd, fitted for the sea, and sail'd by
the same person.  One man builds the hull, another rigs her,
a third lades and sails her.  No one of these has the advantage
of knowing all the ideas and experience of the
others, and, therefore, can not draw just conclusions from
a combination of the whole.
</p>
       <p>Even in the simple operation of sailing when at sea, I
have often observ'd different judgments in the officers who
commanded the successive watches, the wind being the same.
One would have the sails trimm'd sharper or flatter than
another, so that they seem'd to have no certain rule to
govern by.  Yet I think a set of experiments might be
instituted, first, to determine the most proper form of the
hull for swift sailing; next, the best dimensions and properest
place for the masts: then the form and quantity of
sails, and their position, as the wind may be; and, lastly, the
disposition of the lading.  This is an age of experiments, and
I think a set accurately made and combin'd would be of great
use.  I am persuaded, therefore, that ere long some ingenious
philosopher will undertake it, to whom I wish success.
</p>
       <p>We were several times chas'd in our passage, but outsail'd
every thing, and in thirty days had soundings.  We had a
good observation, and the captain judg'd himself so near
our port, Falmouth, that, if we made a good run in the
night, we might be off the mouth of that harbor in the
morning, and by running in the night might escape the
notice of the enemy's privateers, who often crus'd near the
entrance of the channel.  Accordingly, all the sail was set
that we could possibly make, and the wind being very fresh
and fair, we went right before it, and made great way.
The captain, after his observation, shap'd his course, as he
thought, so as to pass wide of the Scilly Isles; but it seems
there is sometimes a strong indraught setting up St. George's
Channel, which deceives seamen and caused the loss of Sir Cloudesley Shovel's squadron.  This indraught was probably
the cause of what happened to us.
</p>
       <p>We had a watchman plac'd in the bow, to whom they
often called, <hi rend="italic">"Look well out before there,"</hi> and he as often
answered, <hi rend="italic">"Ay ay;"</hi> but perhaps had his eyes shut, and was
half asleep at the time, they sometimes answering, as is
said, mechanically; for he did not see a light just before
us, which had been hid by the studdingsails from the man at
the helm, and from the rest of the watch, but by an accidental
yaw of the ship was discover'd, and occasion'd a great
alarm, we being very near it, the light appearing to me as
big as a cart-wheel.  It was midnight, and our captain fast
asleep; but Captain Kennedy, jumping upon deck, and seeing
the danger, ordered the ship to wear round, all sails
standing; an operation dangerous to the masts, but it
carried us clear, and we escaped shipwreck, for we were
running right upon the rocks on which the light-house
was erected.  This deliverance impressed me strongly with
the utility of light-houses, and made me resolve to encourage
the building more of them in America, if I should live to
return there.
</p><p>In the morning it was found by the soundings, etc., that
we were near our port, but a thick fog hid the land from
our sight.  About nine o'clock the fog began to rise, and
seem'd to be lifted up from the water like the curtain at a
play-house, discovering underneath, the town of Falmouth,
the vessels in its harbor, and the fields that surrounded it.
This was a most pleasing spectacle to those who had been
so long without any other prospects than the uniform view
of a vacant ocean, and it gave us the more pleasure as we
were now free from the anxieties which the state of war
occasion'd.
</p>
       <p>I set out immediately, with my son, for London, and we
only stopt a little by the way to view Stonehenge on Salisbury
Plain, and Lord Pembroke's house and gardens, with
his very curious antiquities at Wilton.  We arrived in
London the 27th of July, 1757.<ref target="Fra2Aut.17">[17]</ref></p>

<p>AS SOON as I was settled in a lodging Mr. Charles had
provided for me, I went to visit Dr. Fothergill, to
whom I was strongly recommended, and whose counsel
respecting my proceedings I was advis'd to obtain.  He
was against an immediate complaint to government, and
thought the proprietaries should first be personally appli'd
to, who might possibly be induc'd by the interposition and
persuasion of some private friends, to accommodate matters
amicably.  I then waited on my old friend and correspondent,
Mr. Peter Collinson, who told me that John Hanbury, the
great Virginia merchant, had requested to be informed when
I should arrive, that he might carry me to Lord Granville's,
who was then President of the Council and wished to see
me as soon as possible.  I agreed to go with him the next
morning.  Accordingly Mr. Hanbury called for me and took
me in his carriage to that nobleman's, who receiv'd me with
great civility; and after some questions respecting the present
state of affairs in America and discourse thereupon, he
said to me: "You Americans have wrong ideas of the nature
of your constitution; you contend that the king's instructions
to his governors are not laws, and think yourselves at
liberty to regard or disregard them at your own discretion.
But those instructions are not like the pocket instructions
given to a minister going abroad, for regulating his conduct
in some trifling point of ceremony.  They are first drawn up
by judges learned in the laws; they are then considered,
debated, and perhaps amended in Council, after which they
are signed by the king.  They are then, so far as they relate
to you, the <hi rend="italic">law of the land,</hi> for the king is the LEGISLATOR
OF THE COLONIES." I told his lordship this was new doctrine
to me.  I had always understood from our charters
that our laws were to be made by our Assemblies, to be presented
indeed to the king for his royal assent, but that being
once given the king could not repeal or alter them.  And as
the Assemblies could not make permanent laws without
his assent, so neither could he make a law for them without
theirs.  He assur'd me I was totally mistaken.  I did not
think so, however, and his lordship's conversation having
a little alarm'd me as to what might be the sentiments of
the court concerning us, I wrote it down as soon as I
return'd to my lodgings.  I recollected that about 20 years
before, a clause in a bill brought into Parliament by the
ministry had propos'd to make the king's instructions laws
in the colonies, but the clause was thrown out by the Commons,
for which we adored them as our friends and friends
of liberty, till by their conduct towards us in 1765 it seem'd
that they had refus'd that point of sovereignty to the king
only that they might reserve it for themselves.
</p>
    <p>After some days, Dr. Fothergill having spoken to the
proprietaries, they agreed to a meeting with me at Mr. T.
Penn's house in Spring Garden.  The conversation at first
consisted of mutual declarations of disposition to reasonable
accommodations, but I suppose each party had its own ideas
of what should be meant by <hi rend="italic">reasonable</hi>.  We then went into
consideration of our several points of complaint, which I
enumerated. The proprietaries justify'd their conduct as
well as they could, and I the Assembly's.  We now appeared
very wide, and so far from each other in our opinions as to
discourage all hope of agreement.  However, it was concluded
that I should give them the heads of our complaints
in writing, and they promis'd then to consider them.  I did
so soon after, but they put the paper into the hands of their
solicitor, Ferdinand John Paris, who managed for them all
their law business in their great suit with the neighbouring
proprietary of Maryland, Lord Baltimore, which had subsisted
70 years, and wrote for them all their papers and messages
in their dispute with the Assembly.  He was a proud, angry
man, and as I had occasionally in the answers of the Assembly
treated his papers with some severity, they being
really weak in point of argument and haughty in expression,
he had conceived a mortal enmity to me, which discovering
itself whenever we met, I declin'd the proprietary's proposal
that he and I should discuss the heads of complaint
between our two selves, and refus'd treating with any one
but them.  They then by his advice put the paper into the
hands of the Attorney and Solicitor-General for their opinion
and counsel upon it, where it lay unanswered a year wanting
eight days, during which time I made frequent demands
of an answer from the proprietaries, but without obtaining
any other than that they had not yet received the opinion
of the Attorney and Solicitor-General.  What it was when
they did receive it I never learnt, for they did not communicate
it to me, but sent a long message to the Assembly
drawn and signed by Paris, reciting my paper, complaining
of its want of formality, as a rudeness on my part, and
giving a flimsy justification of their conduct, adding that
they should be willing to accommodate matters if the Assembly
would send out <hi rend="italic">some person of candour</hi> to treat with
them for that purpose, intimating thereby that I was not
such.
</p><p>The want of formality or rudeness was, probably, my not
having address'd the paper to them with their assum'd titles
of True and Absolute Proprietaries of the Province of Pennsylvania,
which I omitted as not thinking it necessary in a
paper, the intention of which was only to reduce to a certainty
by writing, what in conversation I had delivered
viva voce.
</p>
    <p>But during this delay, the Assembly having prevailed with
Gov'r Denny to pass an act taxing the proprietary estate
in common with the estates of the people, which was the
grand point in dispute, they omitted answering the message.
</p>
    <p>When this act however came over, the proprietaries, counselled
by Paris, determined to oppose its receiving the royal
assent. Accordingly they petition'd the king in Council, and
a hearing was appointed in which two lawyers were employ'd
by them against the act, and two by me in support of
it. They alledg'd that the act was intended to load the
proprietary estate in order to spare those of the people, and
that if it were suffer'd to continue in force, and the proprietaries
who were in odium with the people, left to their
mercy in proportioning the taxes, they would inevitably be
ruined.  We reply'd that the act had no such intention, and
would have no such effect. That the assessors were honest
and discreet men under an oath to assess fairly and equitably,
and that any advantage each of them might expect in
lessening his own tax by augmenting that of the proprietaries
was too trifling to induce them to perjure themselves.
This is the purport of what I remember as urged by both
sides, except that we insisted strongly on the mischievous
consequences that must attend a repeal, for that the money,
L100,000, being printed and given to the king's use, expended
in his service, and now spread among the people, the repeal
would strike it dead in their hands to the ruin of many, and
the total discouragement of future grants, and the selfishness
of the proprietors in soliciting such a general catastrophe,
merely from a groundless fear of their estate being
taxed too highly, was insisted on in the strongest terms.
On this, Lord Mansfield, one of the counsel rose, and beckoning
me took me into the clerk's chamber, while the lawyers
were pleading, and asked me if I was really of opinion
that no injury would be done the proprietary estate in the
execution of the act.  I said certainly.  "Then," says he,
"you can have little objection to enter into an engagement
to assure that point." I answer'd, "None at all." He
then call'd in Paris, and after some discourse, his lordship's
proposition was accepted on both sides; a paper to the
purpose was drawn up by the Clerk of the Council, which
I sign'd with Mr. Charles, who was also an Agent of the
Province for their ordinary affairs, when Lord Mansfield
returned to the Council Chamber, where finally the law
was allowed to pass.  Some changes were however recommended
and we also engaged they should be made by a
subsequent law, but the Assembly did not think them necessary;
for one year's tax having been levied by the act
before the order of Council arrived, they appointed a committee
to examine the proceedings of the assessors, and on
this committee they put several particular friends of the
proprietaries.  After a full enquiry, they unanimously sign'd
a report that they found the tax had been assess'd with
perfect equity.
</p>
    <p>The Assembly looked into my entering into the first part
of the engagement, as an essential service to the Province,
since it secured the credit of the paper money then spread
over all the country. They gave me their thanks in form
when I return'd.  But the proprietaries were enraged at
Governor Denny for having pass'd the act, and turn'd him
out with threats of suing him for breach of instructions
which he had given bond to observe.  He, however, having
done it at the instance of the General, and for His Majesty's
service, and having some powerful interest at court, despis'd
the threats and they were never put in execution. . . .

                The book that we know as Benjamin Franklin's "Autobiography" was composed in several stages over more than two decades, and was never printed or published in Franklin's lifetime. And Franklin's conception of what this book was and what its purposes should be changed over the years during which he was writing it. The first section was composed in the summer of 1771, when Franklin, then living in London and serving as the colonial representative for several of the American colonies, was on an extended visit to the country home of his friend Jonathan Shipley. The text, which Franklin thought of as his "memoir" or his "life," takes the form of a letter to his son William, though it is clear that this is a fiction, and that this was never a "letter" in the conventional sense, one intended to go through the post to its recipient. The later sections, composed in stages in the 1780s, seem addressed to a more general audience; as Franklin notes at the end of section one, he imagined that the first part contained "family Anecodotes of no Importance to others" but that latter parts of the text were "intended for the Public." This change in potential audience might been the result of Franklin's estrangement from his son in the intervening years, but also perhaps because Franklin saw this book as an opportunity to address a larger audience than he had originally planned.</p>
                
                <p>The manuscript, titled "The Life of Benjamin Franklin" by an unknown hand, is unfinished. Franklin picked up the manuscript in late 1789 and early 1790, but died before completing his memoir, which only goes up to the 1760s. How the manuscript was eventually published is a long and complicated story (at one point, the only edition available in English was one that had been re-translated from a French edition), and it was not for several decades the the "Autobiography" assumed the form and the title that it now generally bears. But since the middle of the nineteenth century, this has been a landmark of American literature, and is certainly the best-known autobiography by any American. Our edition includes page images of the original manuscript, which is housed at the Huntington Library in California.

Shipley became a good friend and correspondent of Franklin's. He was sympathetic to the cause of the American colonists in their conflict with the government in London. Franklin wrote the first section of this memoir while he was visiting Shipley and his family at Twyford House for several weeks in July and August 1771. <graphic url="notes/Jonathan-Shipley.jpg" style="float:right" width="300px"/> </p></note>

His mother has never been identified with confidence; it might have been Franklin's common-law wife Deborah Read, but it also might have been another woman whose identity is lost to history. William worked with his father in London, when Benjamin Franklin was serving as the representative of several of the American colonies to the government in Westminster. In 1771, when this part of the narrative was written, William Franklin held the position of the royal governor of New Jersey. Father and son would soon be estranged over the American Revolutionary War; William remained loyal to the British crown and became a leading Loyalist opposing the American rebels. This of course included his father, who could not understand how his son could oppose him. William and Benjamin met a few times after the war, but never really reconciled. <graphic url="notes/William_Franklin.jpg" style="float:right" width="300px"/></note>

By the eighteenth century England was several days behind the rest of Europe, which used the Gregorian calendar. Britain switched over to the Gregorian calendar in 1752 A.D. by an act of Parliament, resulting in the "loss" of several dates. For this reason, Franklin had to celebrate his birthday on the 17th of January instead of the 6th, resulting in his need for a clarification of the date as in the "old style."</note>

            <note xml:id="n0016" target="a0016" type="editorial" resp="editors.xml#EF"><p>Cotton Mather, born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1663 to one of the city's most influential families, became arguably the most prominent minister in the American colonies. <graphic url="notes/Cotton_Mather.jpg" style="float:right" width="300px"/> Indeed, his influence was so widely felt he could be described as one of the major transatlantic figures of the time. Ordained at Boston's North Church, he served there as minister for the entirety of his career. However, Mather's influence was not only limited to religion. He was politically active, and he studied science as well, eventually gaining admittance to London's Royal Society.</p>  
                <p> A prolific author, he published approximately 380 texts, including <hi rend="italic">Magnalia Christi Americana</hi> (on the movement of Christianity from Europe to America) and Bonifacius, <hi rend="italic">Essays to do Good</hi>. By the end of his life, Mather’s influence on Christianity in the colonies laid the groundwork for religious figures such as Jonathan Edwards. Mather died in February 1728 at the age of 65.</p>
                <p>Mather’s works were wide-reaching, so it is unsurprising that Franklin felt his influence—most notably through Mather’s <hi rend="italic">Essays to do Good</hi>. While working as an apprentice in his brother’s print shop in 1722, sixteen-year-old Franklin wrote essays under the pseudonym of Silence Dogood—the surname "Dogood" was surely taken directly from Mather’s title. The persona Franklin assumed as Silence Dogood was a middle-aged minister’s widow who wrote on a variety of social topics such as politics, fashion, and education. Franklin silently slid these essays under the door of his brother’s business, hoping for publication. His ploy worked, and Franklin's pseudonymous works were published until October of 1722. Some critics have suggested that the the pseudonym and some of the essays were actually a mockery of Mather since the initial run of essays from Silence Dogood appeared at approximately the same time as widespread debates surrounding inoculation, a practice opposed by James Franklin, Benjamin’s brother and owner of <hi rend="italic">The New England Courant.</hi></p>
                <p>For his part, Mather was a strong proponent of inoculation to the extent that in 1721, Mather and Dr. Zabdiel Boylston inoculated over 200 people during a smallpox epidemic, in the process eliciting a certain amount of public outcry. At the same time, James Franklin published numerous articles against inoculation in the Courant. Years later, and after his own child contracted smallpox, Franklin changed his position on inoculation, regretting his failure to inoculate his son.</p>
                <p>Though Mather and Benjamin Franklin held opposing views upon various matters, there is no doubt that Mather exerted major influence upon Franklin. For instance, <hi rend="italic">Essays to do Good</hi> provides practical tips for how to “do good” for the “Saviour, and for His People in the world.” The book is short and easily read, and its practicality and warmth made it popular throughout the colonies and in England. Franklin appears to have extrapolated not only the form, but the ethical substance from the book, publishing his own Poor Richard's Almanac, an annual journal consisting of practical tips, witty sayings, and household advice. In the Autobiography, he notes that his father’s library held a copy of Mather's book, and that reading it “perhaps gave me a Turn of Thinking that had an Influence on some of the principal future Events of my Life.” In a letter written to Mather’s son Samuel in 1773, Franklin acknowledged Mather’s influence: "When I was a boy, I met with a book, entitled “Essays to do good,” which, I think, was written by your father. It had been so little regarded by a former possessor, that several leaves of it were torn out: but the remainder gave me such a turn, for thinking, as to have an influence on my conduct through life; for I have always set a greater value on the character of a doer of good, than any other kind of reputation; and if I have been, as you seem to think, a useful citizen, the public owes the advantage of it to that book." </p></note>

This trend extended into the middle class as well, as often the younger sons were sent, as here, as a "tithe" to the church for both religious and practical reasons.</note>

            <note xml:id="n0024" target="a0024" type="editorial" resp="editors.xml#NT"><p>It is worth noting that this is an unusually long apprenticeship; most apprenticeships were for seven rather than nine years. We do not know why Benjamin's apprenticeship was stipulated to be that long. The provision that he get "journeyman's wages," that is, the salary of a flully-fledged printer, might have been offered as a compromise.</p>
                <p>The fact of Franklin's apprenticeship, and his early departure from his brother's ship, which is coming up in in a few pages, informs much of this early part of the narrative. During his trip from Boston to Philadelphia Franklin recounts being wary about attracting attention, noting, “it seemed to be suspected from my youth and appearance, that I might be some runaway.” This statement seems odd, considering Franklin technically was a runaway—he had left his apprenticeship with his brother against the will of the family. Why did Franklin not consider himself classed with other young runaways, when he did fear being mistaken for one and returned to Boston?  He certainly had run away from Boston, knowing that if he left openly, “means would be used to prevent [him].” Yet Franklin was in a somewhat unique position: he had technically run away without his brother’s permission, yet he knew that he would not be treated as a common runaway apprentice.</p>
                <p>Apprenticeship  in the American colonies had its roots in the practices of the English system, which dates back to the middle ages. One of the major pieces of legislation governing apprenticeship was the English Statute of Artificers (1563),  which required parents who did not otherwise provide for the education of their sons to bind them to a trade or the agricultural system. The seven year term, longer than the normal length of apprenticeship in France and Germany, “was designed to ensure English supremacy in handmade manufactures and to discourage the wandering and strolling that had characterized earlier periods of English life.”  Another aspect of English law and custom that influenced apprenticeship in the colonies was the English Poor Law (1601)  which required local authorities to bind poor or orphaned children into apprenticeship if their parents did not do so. Benjamin Franklin belonged to the class of apprentices who bound themselves “by their own free will and consent” to a master to learn his trade, not the apprentices involuntarily bound under the auspices of the Poor Law. </p>
                <p>These English statutes applied to the American colonies in theory. However, these laws and customs depended on the medieval guild system for enforcement—a system which never developed in the colonies. Eighteenth-century colonial America did not have the deep pool of skilled laborers that characterized the guild system and had no enforcement mechanism to monitor quality of work, admit members to the status of journeyman or master, or standardize apprentice training.  In the colonies, “anyone could call himself a master artisan, and any such artisan could take an apprentice”—or many apprentices at once.  During Franklin’s boyhood in Boston, the real wages of artisans were falling and apprenticeship contracts often did not demand fees from parents, except for those in high-status crafts. It was guild enforcement that kept wages high and ensured quality craft in the English system, because it created a closed labor market—no artisan could work without permission from his guild.</p>
                <p>In England, if an apprentice ran away from his master, there was an ironclad system in place to keep him from practicing his craft anywhere in the country. The guild system ensured that jurisdiction rules were enforced, and any new practitioner would have to be an approved guild member. In America, runaway penalties did not extend beyond the borders of each colony,  and, as Franklin’s narrative attests, the demand for skilled labor meant even a partially-trained apprentice would likely be hired, perhaps even with the status of a journeyman (though this label did not hold the weight it would in England).  If an American apprentice ran away, his master would circulate a description of the runaway with an offer of reward, and if returned, the apprentice would have to serve for a longer period.  The reward was the enforcement mechanism, meaning citizens might be on the lookout for apparent runaways.</p> 
                <p>Technically, to be legal, an apprenticeship contract (called an “indenture”) had to be registered with municipal authorities so it could be used as evidence in case of disputes. This was true even in the colonies.  However, the nature of indenture papers meant that possession of one’s half of the contract should have constituted evidence without consulting town records: “indenture”  papers were indented on both halves of the document so they could later be identified as one contract.  Benjamin Franklin’s original contract with his brother would probably have been properly registered—but the second set of indentures, which were secret, would only have been held by the master and the apprentice.  James probably could have proved that Benjamin was his apprentice by comparing the two halves of the indenture, but once his brother was out of Boston, this means of redress was impractical at best. And of course, in attempting to regain his apprentice, James would have had to admit his real ownership of the Courant.</p></note>

But what Franklin was doing was a fairly typical thing in this period; newspapers were often filled with poems about recent events, particularly events as notable and spectacular as the two mentioned here.  The death by drowning of George Worthilake, his wife and daughter (Franklin misremembers this as having been two daughters) as they were returning from church by boat to the lighthouse that Worthilake was in charge of in Novenber 1716 became known as the "Lighthouse Tragedy." Edward Teach, the pirate known as Blackbeard, was killed in a firefight with ships from the Royal Navy off the coast of North Carolina on November 22, 1718. The "Grub Street-ballad-style" that Franklin laments using here was nothing to be ashamed of; many authors in this period wrote popular ballads published in the kind of popular journals that became associated with "Grub Street," the physical home of mass market printing in London.</note>

He also publishes several religious works, including some that testify to his affiliation with the "French Prophets," a millenarian group that preached in London in the early part of the eighteenth century (about which more below). Keimer was jailed in 1715 for seditious libel; the best guess is that he printed something in support of a failed Jacobite uprising in that year, but we cannot be sure. He moved to the American colonies sometime around 1720, and by 1723 he was once again printing, this time in Philadelphia. Much of what we know of Keimer's career in Philadelphia comes from Franklin, who, as we will see, was often dismissive of his abilities as a printer and his character. After going bankrupt in Philadelphia, Keimer ended up in Barbados, and founded the first newspaper there, the  <hi rend="italic">Barbados Gazette</hi>. He died in Barbados in 1742.

They were begun by a small group of Huguenots, French Protestants who had fled persecution there by emigrating to England in 1706. They preached the imminent coming of the Messiah, and attracted a number of followers including, apparently for a while, Keimer. Like many people in this period, Franklin was suspicious of the kind of religious intensity displayed by Keimer and other millenarians, what Franklin calls "enthusiasm"; it shows up soon in his response, later, to the similarly intense preaching of George Whitfield, the evangelist and Methodist.</note>

After his dismissal in July 1715 in a political purge, he persuaded William Penn, the proprietor of Pennsylvania, to appoint him to the position of deputy governor (this was in effect the leading executive power in the colony, since the monarch had the official title of governor). When Penn died in 1718, Keith tried to gain more power by creating a power base in the assembly. A political falling out took place when Keith sided with tradesmen and merchants on the issue of paper currency in 1723. Because of this, Keith's political opponents worked to oust him, and he was dismissed from the governorship in 1726. After this, Keith returned to England to appeal to the king for the governorship of the three lower colonies, but he was unsuccessful. He also attempted a few other political maneuvers, including an attempt at the governorship of New Jersey and the creation of a new colony called Georgia. He was unsuccessful at these as well. Penn found himself in financial trouble which led to a case against him, and he spent 1734 and 1735 in debtor's prison. After this, he became a journalist, and he died on November 18, 1749 in London.

But, expensive and taxed, Madeira wine was a luxury item, and would have been quite a treat for a seventeen-year-old, which is perhaps why Franklin remembers it so clearly.</note>

Ralph (d. 1762) was probably born between 1695 and 1710, perhaps in the environs of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, or perhaps in Elizabethtown, New Jersey.

First published as a poem entitled "The Grumbling Hive" in 1705, the book took off when Mandeville added a prose gloss on the poem that made his thesis explicit. Mandeville scandalized people by arguing that individuals pursuing their own self-interest could lead to benefits for the society as a whole. This idea now is usually a central and uncontroversial assumption of modern capitalism, but in the early eighteenth century, his argument seemed outrageously cynical to many readers. The book was delared a public nuisance by a grand jury in Middlesex in 1723, and Mandeville was mocked as the "Man-Devil" by his detractors. But to other readers, like the young Franklin, Mandeville's cheerful brio about his argument and his brutal frankness was deeply appealing. At the time of this meeting, Mandeville was at the height of his fame and notoriety.</note>
                
                <note xml:id="n0083" target="a0083" type="editorial" resp="editors.xml#JOB">Sir Hans Sloane (1660–1753) <graphic url="notes/hans-sloane.jpg" style="float:right" width="300px"/>was a physician and naturalist who built one of the largest collection of antiquities and curiosities of anyone in this period. After his death in 1753, he willed the collection to the nation, and it became the core of the British Museum. By the 1720s, Sloane's interest in collecting things was well known and he had correspondents around the world sending him seeds, plants, geological specimens, and other curiosities. His house in Bloomsbury had also become a magnet for curiosity-seekers like Franklin. The asbestos purse that Sloane purchased from Franklin is now in the collection of the Natural History Museum in London. <graphic url="notes/purse.jpg" style="float:left" width="300px"/>What must have made the purse interesting to Sloane is that asbestos, while a naturally-occuring mineral, is hard to weave because it is so fine and delicate in its natural state. Years later, Franklin explained to the Finnish naturalist Pehr Kalm that if you left asbestos outside in the cold, the fibers would stiffen enough to be woven. It's possible that Franklin brought the purse to London for the purposes of selling it someone like Sloane.

The "College" to which Franklin refers is actually the Royal Hospital, built on the site of a closed theological college. The Royal Hospital, which is still in existence, was founded in 1682 as a home for veterans. The Chelsea Pensioners, as the residents of the Hospital are known, continue to  wear the distinctive scarlet uniforms that were first issued in the early eighteenth century. "Don Saltero's" was a coffee house on Cheyne Walk run by James Salter, who had been Sir Hans Sloane's servant. Salter opened a barber shop in 1695, and began displaying curiosities there that were passed down by Sloane (items included taxidermy animals like crocodiles and snakes as well as oddities like pieces of the True Cross, petrified peaches and pears, a piece of Queen Catherine's skin, and a vial with the "tears of Job.") The collection grew and attracted sightseers, leading Salter to find bigger premises nearby and reopen his business as a coffee shop/museum. Salter was dubbed "Don Saltero" by Richard Steele in the <hi rend="italic">Tatler</hi> in 1709, and the nickname stuck. Don Saltero's, pictured here in an 1850 drawing, remained a going business and tourist attraction well into the nineteenth century, long after Salter's death in 1728.<graphic url="notes/Don-Salteros_Tavern.jpg" style="float:right" width="300px"/> (Image source: Wikimedia Commons)</note>

These shortages were particularly acute in the American colonies. As early as 1690, the Massachusetts Bay Colony issued paper money. But paper currency remained deeply suspect to many Europeans and the residents of their colonial outposts. Presses in this period were not generally able to print notes that were distinctive enough that they could not easily be counterfeited. (As we shall see, Franklin come up with ingenious solutions to combat counterfeiting.) And it was possible for too many notes, real and counterfeit, to end up in circulation, causing inflation. Franklin became a strong advocate of paper money nonetheless, seeing it, probably correctly, as a important spur to commercial activity. It would also become a significant part of his printing business, so he had a self-interest in New Jersey and other colonies using paper currency.</note>

Metal plates such as copper plates are carved by a sharp instrument with the pattern or lines of text. The plate is then covered in ink, and wiped down to ensure that ink is only within the grooves of the plate. Next, damp paper (damp to make it easier to press and manipulate into the cuts) is laid atop the plate with a towel on top of it. The paper is then run through the press where even, strong pressure is applied across the sheet pushing it into the grooves. Once ran through the press once, a printed sheet is made.

It was never one thing, and people who thought of themselves as Deists disagreed on a lot of issues. But typically Deists rejected the authority of scripture, which they saw as incompatible with human reason. In an era when experimental science was enabling people to understand fundamental forces of the universe like gravity, thanks to the work of Isaac Newton, it seemed ridiculous to Deists continue to believe in miracles, for example, which now looked like a vestige of a superstitious past that the modern age was overcoming. Deists sometimes used the metaphor of God as a clockmaker, imagining him as having created a universe that could in effect run on its own, without his personal intervention at every step. During its heyday, which was right in the period when Franklin was growing up, Deism was also frequently attacked by orthodox Christian clerics, as in the books that Franklin is referring to here.</note>

In his will, he left and endowment to support a lecture series (still ongoing) that explored the relationship between religious faith and "natural philosophy," what we think of as the sciences. Boyle's intention was largely to demonstrate how modern science affirmed the divinity of God and his creation. Though he was not trying to refute Deists himself (since it was a minor movement in his lifetime), it sounds as though the books that fell into Franklin's hands at this point used points raised in some of these annual lectures to argue against Deist thought. </note>

It appears by their Votes and Proceedings, that they thought it an Imposition, contrary to their own Charter, and to <hi rend="italic">Magna Charta</hi>; and they judg'd that by the Dictates of Reason there should be a mutual Dependence between the <hi rend="italic">Governor</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Governed</hi>, and that to make an Governour independent of his People, would be dangerous, and destructive of their Liberties, and the ready Way to establish Tyranny: They thought likewise, that the Prince was not the less dependent on the Crown of <hi rend="italic">Great-Britain</hi>, by the Governour's depending immediately on them and hjis own good Conduct for an ample Support, because all Acts and Laws which me might be induc'd to pass, must neverless be constantly sent Home for Approbation in Order to continue in Force.

<p>Much deserved Praise has the deceas'd Governour received, for his steady Integrity in adhering to his Intructions, notwithstanding the great Difficulty and Opposition he met with, and the strong Temptations offer'd from tim to time to induce him to give up the Point.--And yet perhaps something is due to the <hi rend="italic">Assembly</hi> (as the Love and Zeal of the Country for the present Estalishment is too well known to suffer any Suspicion of Want of Loyalty) who continue thus resolutely to Abide by what <hi rend="italic">treahey Think</hi> their Right, and that of the People they represent, maugre all the Arts and Menaces of a Governour fam'd for his Cunning and Politicks, back'd with Instructions from Home, and powerfully aided by the great Advantage such an Officer always has of engaging the principal Men of a Place in his Party, by conferring where he pleases so many Posts of Profit and Honour. Their happy Mother Country will perhaps observe with Pleasure, that tho' her gallnt Cocks and matchless Dogs abate their native Fire and Intrepidity when transported to a Foreign Clime (as the common Notion is) yet her SONS in the remotest Part of the Earth, and even to the third and fourth Descent, still retain that ardent Spirit of Liberty, and that undaunted Courge in the Defense of it, which has in every Age so gloriously distinguished BRITONS and ENGLISHMEN from all the Rest of Mankind."</p>

  <note xml:id="n0127" target="a0127" type="editorial" resp="editors.xml#JOB">In the margin, Franklin writes "I got his Son once 500£." Andrew Hamilton was the Speaker of the Pennsylvania Assembly in this period; his son James became a friend of Franklin's and later served a couple of terms as Governor of Pennsylvania. We cannot be certain what Franklin is referring to when he talks about the £500 in his note, but Lemay and Zall observe in the Norton critical edition that in 1754, William Franklin got his salary, of precisely that amount, which had been disputed by the Pennsylvania Assembly. They suggest that Franklin may have intervened behind the scenes to make it happen.

As already noted, the shortfall of currency was endemic in the colonies. In the period that Franklin is recalling (accurately) here, the situtation was about to be exacerbated by the fact that some of the paper currency that had been issued a few years earlier was supposed to be withdrawn from circulation, or "sunk," according to the original terms of its issuance.</note>

The Assembly and the governor debated the topic in hopes of compromise. In 1729, Franklin anonymously published a pamphlet that argued in favor of the circulation of paper money. He argued that paper money is necessary for a community’s economy and the ways in which regulation and security of the money should be enacted. Here is a copy: https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-01-02-0041. Franklin was not completely disintersted on this topic; he would soon secure the contract to print paper money in Pennsylvania as he was already doing in Delaware.</note>

As Franklin points out, it put Bradford in position to get a great deal of news earlier than anyone else, and, even better, to be perceived as a source of breaking news. It is here that we can begin to understand why the post office became so central to Franklin's entire career. For many decades, Franklin had important roles in the post office, first in colonial America and then in the early United States. Franklin first became the deputy Postmaster General for Pennsylvania in 1737, when he took the job after Bradford had been shown to be derelict in his official duties. In 1753, Franklin and William Hunter of Virginia were appointed by the British government as Deputy Postmasters General for the American colonies; it was a job that Franklin had been lobbying for for a couple of years. Franklin continued in the position until 1774, when the government in London fired him for disloyalty and took direct control over the post. Upon his return to Philadelphia in 1775, Franklin was appointed by the Continental Congress to be the Postmaster General of the new Continental Post, a system that was now to be run independently of the Crown. Why would Franklin have sought out this position, and why did he want to hold it for so long?</p>
                        
                        <graphic url="notes/post-office.jpg" style="float:right" width="300px"/>
                        
                        <p>It is first important to recognize both how new and how significant the whole idea of the post office was in eighteenth-century Anglo-America. Up until the middle of the seventeenth century, mail delivery was largely private and was not particularly systematic. The King and the government obviously had to get their messages distributed throughout the realm. But if a private person wanted to send a letter, they typically had to find a courier. After the Restoration of the Stuart monarchy in 1660, mail distribution began to be at least somewhat more systematic. The most important development took place in 1710, when the Act of Queen Anne established the official roles of the Postmaster General and of his deputies throughout Britain and colonial America, funded the improvement of “post roads” to facilitate timely delivery, established uniform pricing, and (at least in theory) established a government monopoly on mail. The result was that the Post Office became the central institution for distributing information throughout the Anglosphere, effecting, as William Warner has put it, “as fundamental a mutation in communication practices as the Internet has in our own day.” For colonial America in particular, the development of the post office’s ability to distribute information was one of the reasons why white settlers scattered across a very big geographical area were able to imagine and then fight for political independence.</p>
                        
                        <p>When he became co-Deputy Postmaster General in 1753, Franklin undertook a long tour of regional post offices to survey the workings of the system, and then published a set of rules designed to increase its efficiency. Franklin’s reforms were sometimes ignored—it was easy for local postmasters, far from the central office in Philadelphia, to distribute mail on the side for a fee, and many reports from the time suggest that mail was in many places fairly easily stolen or diverted. But Franklin and Hunter did significantly improve the functioning of the colonial post office, and the proof of that was in the profits that they began to make. Franklin noted that he and Hunter had taken a loss of over 900 pounds during the first three years of their tenure, but he considered that to be a worthwhile investment; past that point, their positions became a steady source of income for them--generally 300 pounds a year for each--and revenue for the British crown. </p>
                        
                        <p>Franklin gained some ancillary benefits from his position. As Postmaster General, Franklin could assure that his newspapers and magazines were distributed as efficiently as possible. This had sometimes been a problem when Bradford had held the job of Philadelphia postmaster; Bradford had not always allowed Franklin to distribute his <hi rend="italic">Pennsylvania Gazette</hi> through the post, forcing Franklin to bribe the post riders to deliver it. Franklin claims here that when became postmaster, he took care “never to imitate” Bradford’s practice in showing bias towards some publishers over others. But the evidence suggests that he sometimes did just that, and that he did in fact retaliate against Bradford by limiting the access to the post of Bradford’s newspapers. The close relationship between the newspaper and the post in this period is indicated by how many newspapers carried the words “Post” or “Mail” in their titles. There were many practical advantages that would motivate a newspaper publisher to have control over the postal system.</p>
         
                        <p>But it seems clear that Franklin also believed in the mission of the Post Office at a fundamental level. Until well into middle age, Franklin imagined himself as a loyal member of the British empire, and imagined America’s best future as part of a global empire with Britain at its center. He came comparatively late to the cause of revolution; even as he started writing the essays that we now call the autobiography, he was doing so in an England that he thought of as home. The postal service was a powerful way to bind the Anglophone world together, as English-speaking people across the Atlantic would be able to create what Benedict Anderson has memorably called an “imagined community” through written correspondence and printed media. Franklin’s desire to improve and sustain the colonial post was, as often in his life, a situation where high-minded ideology and self-interest were mutually sustained.</p> [Image source: Wikimedia Commons]</note>

She married John Rogers, a potter who, it turned out, already had a wife in England. Rogers abandoned Deborah as well, running away to the Caribbean to escape his creditors; he was never heard from again. But because there was no way of proving that Roberts had been married before, Deborah and Franklin would have been liable to the charge of bigamy (which carried a possible penalty of thirty-nine lashes and life imprisonment) had they gotten legally married, so this common-law marriage was the most practical option available to them.
