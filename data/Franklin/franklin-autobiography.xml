        <p>TWYFORD, at the <ref target="a0002" corresp="n0002">Bishop of St. Asaph's,</ref><lb/>
            1771.<lb/>	
        </p>
        <p>DEAR <ref target="a0003" corresp="n0003">SON</ref>: I have ever had pleasure in obtaining any little anecdotes of my ancestors. You may remember the inquiries I made among the remains of my relations when you were with me in England, and the journey I undertook for that purpose. Imagining it may be equally agreeable to you to know the circumstances of my life, many of which you are yet unacquainted with, and expecting the enjoyment of a week's uninterrupted leisure in my present country retirement, I sit down to write them for you. To which I have besides some other inducements. Having emerged from the poverty and obscurity in which I was born and bred, to a state of affluence and some degree of reputation in the world, and having gone so far through life with a considerable share of felicity, the conducing means I made use of, which with the blessing of God so well succeeded, my posterity may like to know, as they may find some of them suitable to their own situations, and therefore fit to be imitated.
        </p>
        <p>That felicity, when I reflected on it, has induced me sometimes to say, that were it offered to my choice, I should have no objection to a repetition of the same life from its beginning, <ref target="a0004" corresp="n0004">only asking the advantages authors have in a second edition to correct some faults of the first.</ref> So I might, besides correcting the faults, change some <ref target="a0005" corresp="n0005">sinister</ref> accidents and events of it for others more favorable. But though this were denied, I should still accept the offer. Since such a repetition is not to be expected, the next thing most like living one's life over again seems to be a recollection of that life, and to make that recollection as durable as possible by putting it down in writing.
            
        </p><p>Hereby, too, I shall indulge the inclination so natural in old men, to be talking of themselves and their own past actions; and I shall indulge it without being tiresome to others, who, through respect to age, might conceive themselves obliged to give me a hearing, since this may be read or not as any one pleases. And, lastly (I may as well confess it, since my denial of it will be believed by nobody), perhaps I shall a good deal gratify my own vanity. Indeed, I scarce ever heard or saw the introductory words,<hi rend="italic">"Without vanity I may say,"</hi> &#x0026;amp;c., but some vain thing immediately followed. Most people dislike vanity in others, whatever share theyhave of it themselves; but I give it fair quarter wherever I meet with it, being persuaded that it is often productive of good to the possessor, and to others that are within his sphere of action; and therefore, in many cases, it would not be altogether absurd if a man were to thank God for his vanity among the other comforts of life.
        </p>
        <p>And now I speak of thanking God, I desire with all humility to acknowledge that I owe the mentioned happiness of my past life to His kind providence, which lead me to the means I used and gave them success. My belief of this induces me to <hi rend="italic">hope,</hi> though I must not <hi rend="italic">presume,</hi> that the same goodness will still be exercised toward me, in continuing that happiness, or enabling me to bear a fatal reverse, which I may experience as others have done: the complexion of my future fortune being known to Him only in whose power it is to bless to us even our afflictions.
        </p>
        <p>The notes one of my uncles (who had the same kind of curiosity in collecting family anecdotes) once put into my hands, furnished me with several particulars relating to our ancestors. From these notes I learned that the family had lived in the same village, Ecton, in Northamptonshire, for three hundred years, and how much longer he knew not (perhaps from the time when the name of <ref target="a0006" corresp="n0006">Franklin</ref>, that before was the name of an order of people, was assumed by them as a surname when others took surnames all over the kingdom), on a <ref target="a0007" corresp="n0007">freehold</ref> of about thirty acres, aided by the smith's business, which had continued in the family till his time, the eldest son being always bred to that business; a custom which he and my father followed as to their eldest sons. When I searched the registers at Ecton, I found an account of their births, marriages and burials from the year 1555 only, there being no registers kept in that parish at any time preceding. By that register I perceived that I was the youngest son of the youngest son for five generations back. My grandfather Thomas, who was born in 1598, lived at Ecton till he grew too old to follow business longer, when he went to live with his son John, a dyer at Banbury, in Oxfordshire, with whom my father served an apprenticeship. There my grandfather 
            <pb n="2" facs="https://s3.amazonaws.com/lic-assets-staging/Franklin/Franklin-p2.jpg"/>
            died and lies buried. We saw his gravestone in 1758. His eldest son Thomas lived in the house at Ecton, and left it with the land to his only child, a daughter, who, with her husband, one Fisher, of Wellingborough, sold it to Mr. Isted, now lord of the manor there. My grandfather had four sons that grew up, viz.: Thomas, John, Benjamin and Josiah.  I will give you what account I can of them, at this distance from my papers, and if these are not lost in my absence, you will among them find many more particulars.
        </p>
    <p>Thomas was bred a smith under his father; but, being ingenious, and encouraged in learning (as all my brothers were) by an Esquire Palmer, then the principal gentleman in that parish, he qualified himself for the business of <ref target="a0008" corresp="n0008">scrivener</ref>; became a considerable man in the county; was a chief mover of all public-spirited undertakings for the county or town of Northampton, and his own village, of which many instances were related of him; and much taken notice of and patronized by the then Lord Halifax. <ref target="a0009" corresp="n0009">He died in 17O2, January 6, old style, just four years to a day before I was born.</ref>  The account we received of his life and character from some old people at Ecton, I remember, struck you as something extraordinary, from its similarity to what you knew of mine.
        </p>
        <p>"Had he died on the same day," you said, "one might have supposed a transmigration."
        </p>
        <p>John was bred a dyer, I believe of woolens. Benjamin was bred a silk dyer, serving an apprenticeship at London.

            He was an ingenious man.  I remember him well, for when I was a boy he came over to my father in Boston, and lived in the house with us some years. He lived to a great age. His grandson, Samuel Franklin, now lives in Boston. He left behind him two quarto volumes, <ref target="a0100" corresp="n0100">MS.</ref>, of his own poetry, consisting of little occasional pieces addressed to his friends and relations, of which the following, sent to me, is a specimen.

           He had formed a short-hand of his own, which he taught me, but, never practising it, I have now forgot it. I was named after this uncle, there being a particular affection between him and my father. He was very pious, a great attender of sermons of the best preachers, which he took down in his short-hand, and had with him many volumes of them. He was also much of a politician; too much, perhaps, for his station. There fell lately into my hands, in London, a collection he had made of all the principal pamphlets, relating to public affairs, from 1641 to 1717; many of the volumes are wanting as appears by the numbering, but there still remain <ref target="a0011" corresp="n0011">eight volumes in folio, and twenty-four in quarto and in octavo.</ref> A dealer in old books met with them, and knowing me by my sometimes buying of him, he brought them to me. It seems my uncle must have left them here, when he went to America, which was about fifty years since. There are many of his notes in the margins.
        </p>
       <p>This obscure family of ours was early in the Reformation, and continued Protestants through the reign 
           <pb n="4" facs="https://s3.amazonaws.com/lic-assets-staging/Franklin/Franklin-p4.jpg"/>
           
           of Queen Mary, when they were sometimes in danger of trouble on account of their zeal <ref target="a0012" corresp="n0012">against popery</ref>. They had got an <ref target="a0013" corresp="n0013">English Bible</ref>, and to conceal and secure it, it was fastened open with tapes under and within the cover of a joint-stool. When my great-great-grandfather read it to his family, he turned up the joint-stool upon his knees, turning over the leaves then under the tapes. One of the children stood at the door to give notice if he saw the apparitor coming, who was an officer of the spiritual court. In that case the stool was turned down again upon its feet, when the Bible remained concealed under it as before. This anecdote I had from my uncle Benjamin. The family continued all of the Church of England till about the end of Charles the Second's reign, when some of the ministers that had been <ref target="a0014" corresp="n0014">outed for non-conformity holding conventicles</ref> in Northamptonshire, Benjamin and Josiah adhered to them, and so continued all their lives: the rest of the family remained with the Episcopal Church.
        </p>
        <p>Josiah, my father, married young, and carried his wife with three children into New England, about 1682. The conventicles having been forbidden by law, and frequently disturbed, induced some considerable men of his acquaintance to remove to that country, and he was prevailed with to accompany them thither, where they expected to enjoy their mode of religion with freedom. By the same wife he had four children more born there, and by a second 
            <pb n="5" facs="https://s3.amazonaws.com/lic-assets-staging/Franklin/Franklin-p5.jpg"/>
            wife ten more, in all seventeen; of which I remember thirteen sitting at one time at his table, who all grew up to be men and women, and married; I was the youngest son, and the youngest child but two, and was born in Boston, New England. My mother, the second wife, was Abiah Folger, daughter of <ref target="a0015" corresp="n0015">Peter Folger</ref>, one of the first settlers of New England, of whom honorable mention is made by <ref target="a0016" corresp="n0016">Cotton Mather</ref> in his church history of that country, entitled Magnalia Christi Americana, as <hi rend="italic">"a godly, learned Englishman,"</hi> if I remember the words rightly.  I have heard that he wrote sundry small occasional pieces, but only one of them was printed, which I saw now many years since. It was written in 1675, in the home-spun verse of that time and people, and addressed to those then concerned in the government there. It was in favor of liberty of conscience, and in behalf of the Baptists, Quakers, and other sectaries that had been under persecution, ascribing the Indian wars, and other distresses that had befallen the country, to that persecution, as so many judgments of God to punish so heinous an offense, and exhorting a repeal of those uncharitable laws.
            
            The whole appeared to me as written with a good deal of decent plainness and manly freedom.  The six concluding lines I remember, though I have forgotten the two first of the stanza; but the purport of them was, that his censures proceeded from good-will, and, therefore, he would be known to be the author.

        </p><p><ref target="a0017" corresp="n0017">My elder brothers were all put apprentices to different trades.  I was put to the grammar-school at eight years of age, my father intending to devote me, as the tithe of his sons, to the service of the Church.</ref> My early readiness in learning to read (which must have been very early, as I do not remember when I could not read), and the opinion of all his friends, that I should certainly make a good scholar, encouraged him in this purpose of his.  My uncle Benjamin, too, approved of it, and proposed to give me all his short-hand volumes of sermons, I suppose as a stock to set up with, if I would learn his character.  I continued, however, at the grammar-school not quite one year, though in that time I had risen gradually from the middle of the class of that year to be the head of it, and farther was removed into the next class above it, in order to go with that into the third at the end of the year. But my father, in the meantime, from a view of the expense of a college education, which having so large a family he could not well afford, and the mean living many so educated were afterwards able to obtain reasons that be gave to his friends in my hearing altered his first intention, took me from the grammar-school, and sent me to a school for writing and arithmetic, kept by a then famous man, <ref target="a0018" corresp="n0018">Mr. George Brownell</ref>, very successful in his 
       <pb n="6" facs="https://s3.amazonaws.com/lic-assets-staging/Franklin/Franklin-p6.jpg"/>
       profession generally, and that by mild, encouraging methods. Under him I acquired fair writing pretty soon, but I failed in the arithmetic, and made no progress in it. At ten years old I was taken home to assist my father in his business, which was that of a tallow-chandler and sope-boiler; a business he was not bred to, but had assumed on his arrival in New England, and on finding his dying trade would not maintain his family, being in little request. Accordingly, I was employed in cutting wick for the candles, filling the dipping mold and the molds for cast candles, attending the shop, going of errands, etc.

        <p>There was a salt-marsh that bounded part of the mill-pond, on the edge of which, at high water, we used to stand to fish for minnows.  By much trampling, we had made it a mere quagmire.  My proposal was to build a wharff there fit for us to stand upon, and I showed my comrades a large heap of stones, which were intended for a new house near the marsh, and which would very well suit 
            <pb n="7" facs="https://s3.amazonaws.com/lic-assets-staging/Franklin/Franklin-p7.jpg"/>
            our purpose. Accordingly, in the evening, when the workmen were gone, I assembled a number of my play-fellows, and working with them diligently like so many <ref target="a0020" corresp="n0020">emmets</ref>, sometimes two or three to a stone, we brought them all away and built our little wharff.  The next morning the workmen were surprised at missing the stones, which were found in our wharff.  Inquiry was made after the removers; we were discovered and complained of; several of us were corrected by our fathers; and though I pleaded the usefulness of the work, mine convinced me that nothing was useful which was not honest.
        </p><p>I think you may like to know something of his person and character.  He had an excellent constitution of body, was of middle stature, but well set, and very strong; he was ingenious, could draw prettily, was skilled a little in music, and had a clear pleasing voice, so that when he played psalm tunes on his violin and sung withal, as he sometimes did in an evening after the business of the day was over, it was extremely agreeable to hear.  He had a mechanical genius too, and, on occasion, was very handy in the use of other tradesmen's tools; but his great excellence lay in a sound understanding and solid judgment in prudential matters, both in private and publick affairs.  In the latter, indeed, he was never employed, the numerous family he had to educate and the straitness of his circumstances keeping him close to his trade; but I remember well his being frequently visited by leading people, who consulted him for his opinion in affairs of the town or of the church he belonged to, and showed a good deal of respect for his judgment

       and advice: he was also much consulted by private persons about their affairs when any difficulty occurred, and frequently chosen an arbitrator between contending parties.
        </p><p>At his table he liked to have, as often as he could, some sensible friend or neighbor to converse with, and always took care to start some ingenious or useful topic for discourse, which might tend to improve the minds of his children.  By this means he turned our attention to what was good, just, and prudent in the conduct of life; and little or no notice was ever taken of what related to the victuals on the table, whether it was well or ill dressed, in or out of season, of good or bad flavor, preferable or inferior to this or that other thing of the kind, so that I was bro't up in such a perfect inattention to those matters as to be quite indifferent what kind of food was set before me, and so unobservant of it, that to this day if I am asked I can scarce tell a few hours after dinner what I dined upon.  This has been a convenience to me in travelling, where my companions have been sometimes very unhappy for want of a suitable gratification of their more delicate, because better instructed, tastes and appetites.
            
        </p><p>My mother had likewise an excellent constitution: she suckled all her ten children.  I never knew either my father or mother to have any sickness but that of which they dy'd, he at 89, and she at 85 years of age. They lie buried together at Boston, where I some years since placed a marble over their grave, with this inscription:

        </p><p>To return: I continued thus employed in my father's business for two years, that is, till I was twelve years old; and my brother John, who was bred to that business, having left my father, married, and set up for himself at Rhode Island, there was all appearance that I was destined to supply his place, and become a tallow-chandler.  But my dislike to the trade continuing, my father was under apprehensions that if he did not find one for me more agreeable, I should break away and get to sea, as his son Josiah had done, to his great vexation.  He therefore sometimes took me to walk with him, and see joiners, bricklayers, turners, braziers, etc., at their work, that he might observe my inclination, and endeavor to fix it on some trade or other on land.  It has ever since been a pleasure to me to see good workmen handle their tools; and it has been useful to me, having learnt so much by it as to be able to do little jobs myself in my house when a workman could not readily be got, and to construct little machines for my experiments, while the intention of making the experiment was fresh and warm in my mind.  My father at last fixed upon the cutler's trade, and my uncle Benjamin's son Samuel, who was bred to that business in London, being about that time established in Boston, I was sent to be with him some time on liking.  But his expectations of a fee with me displeasing my father, I was taken home again.
            
        </p><p>From a child I was fond of reading, and all the little money that came into my hands was ever laid out in books. Pleased with the Pilgrim's Progress, my first collection was of John Bunyan's works in separate little volumes.  I afterward sold them to enable me to buy <ref target="a0021" corresp="n0021">R. Burton's Historical Collections</ref>; they were small chapmen's books, and cheap, 40 or 50 in all.  My father's little library consisted chiefly of books in polemic divinity, most of which I read, and have since often regretted that, at a time when I had such a thirst for knowledge, more proper books had not fallen in my way since it was now resolved I should not be a clergyman.  Plutarch's Lives there was in which I read abundantly, and I still think that time spent to great advantage. There was also a book of De Foe's, called an <ref target="a0022" corresp="n0022">Essay on Projects</ref>, and another of Dr. Mather's, called <ref target="a0023" corresp="n0023">Essays to do Good</ref>, which perhaps gave me a turn of thinking that had an influence on some of the principal future events of my life.
            
        </p><p>This bookish inclination at length determined my father to make me a printer, though he had already one son (James) of that profession.  In 1717 my brother James returned from England with a press and letters to set up his business in Boston.  I liked it much better than that of my father, but still had a hankering for the sea.  To prevent the apprehended effect of such an inclination, my father was impatient to have me bound to my brother.  I stood out some time, but at last was persuaded, and signed the indentures when I was yet but twelve years old.  I was to serve as an apprentice till I was <ref target="a0024" corresp="n0024">twenty-one years of age</ref>, only I was to be allowed journeyman's wages during the last year.  In a little time I made great proficiency in the business, and became a useful hand to my brother.  I now had access to better books.  An acquaintance with the apprentices of booksellers enabled me sometimes to borrow a small one, which I was careful to return soon and clean. Often I sat up in my room reading the greatest part of the night, when the book was borrowed in the evening and to be returned early in the morning, lest it should be missed or wanted.

                The book that we know as Benjamin Franklin's "Autobiography" was composed in several stages over more than two decades, and was never printed or published in Franklin's lifetime. And Franklin's conception of what this book was and what its purposes should be changed over time. The first section was composed in the summer of 1771, when Franklin, then living in London and serving as the colonial representative for several of the American colonies, was on an extended visit to the country home of his friend Jonathan Shipley. The text, which Franklin thought of as his "memoir" or his "life" took the ostensible form of a letter to his son William, though it is clear that this is a fiction, and that this was never a "letter" in the conventional sense, one intended to go through the post to its recipient. The later sections, composed in stages in the 1780s, seem addressed to a more general audience, in part perhaps because of Franklin's estrangement from his son, but also perhaps because Franklin saw this book as an opportunity to address a larger audience.</p>
                <p>The manuscript, here titled "The Life of Benjamin Franklin" by an unknown hand, is unfinished. Franklin picked up the manuscript in late 1789 and early 1790, but died before completing his memoir, which only goes up to the 1760s. The publication of the manuscript is complicated, and it was not for several decades the the "Autobiography" assumed the form and the title that it now generally bears. Our edition includes page images of the original manuscript, which is housed at the Huntington Library in California. We have edited it to make it legible to modern reader, expanding abbreviations and regularizing the spelling. Our annotations are designed to provide important contextual information that Franklin's first readers would have known.</p></note>

His mother has never been identified with confidence; it might have been Franklin's common-law wife Deborah Read, but it also might have been another woman whose identity is lost to history. William had worked with his father in London. In 1771, when this was written, he held the position of the royal governor of New Jersey. Father and son would later be estranged over the American Revolutionary War; William remained loyal to the British crown and became a leading Loyalist opposing the American rebels, who by this time included his father. William and Benjamin met a few times after the war, but never really reconciled. <graphic url="https://s3.amazonaws.com/lic-assets-staging/Franklin/William_Franklin.-by-Mather_brownjpg.jpg" style="float:left" width="300px"/></note>

Ordained at Boston's North Church, he served there as minister for the entirety of his career. However, Mather's influence was not only limited to religion. He was politically active, and he studied science as well, eventually gaining admittance to London's Royal Society.</p>  
                <p> A prolific author, he published approximately 380 texts, including <hi rend="italic">Magnalia Christi Americana</hi> (on the movement of Christianity from Europe to America) and Bonifacius, <hi rend="italic">Essays to do Good</hi>. By the end of his life, Mather’s influence on Christianity in the colonies laid the groundwork for religious figures such as Jonathan Edwards. Mather died in February 1728 at the age of 65.</p>
                <p>Mather’s works were wide-reaching, so it is unsurprising that Franklin felt his influence—most notably through Mather’s <hi rend="italic">Essays to do Good</hi>. While working as an apprentice in his brother’s print shop in 1722, sixteen-year-old Franklin wrote essays under the pseudonym of Silence Dogood—the surname "Dogood" was surely taken directly from Mather’s title. The persona Franklin assumed as Silence Dogood was a middle-aged minister’s widow who wrote on a variety of social topics such as politics, fashion, and education. Franklin silently slid these essays under the door of his brother’s business, hoping for publication. His ploy worked, and Franklin's pseudonymous works were published until October of 1722. Some critics have suggested that the the pseudonym and some of the essays were actually a mockery of Mather since the initial run of essays from Silence Dogood appeared at approximately the same time as widespread debates surrounding inoculation, a practice opposed by James Franklin, Benjamin’s brother and owner of <hi rend="italic">The New England Courant.</hi></p>
                <p>For his part, Mather was a strong proponent of inoculation to the extent that in 1721, Mather and Dr. Zabdiel Boylston inoculated over 200 people during a smallpox epidemic, in the process eliciting a certain amount of public outcry. At the same time, James Franklin published numerous articles against inoculation in the Courant. Years later, and after his own child contracted smallpox, Franklin changed his position on inoculation, regretting his failure to inoculate his son.</p>
                <p>Though Mather and Benjamin Franklin held opposing views upon various matters, there is no doubt that Mather exerted major influence upon Franklin. For instance, <hi rend="italic">Essays to do Good</hi> provides practical tips for how to “do good” for the “Saviour, and for His People in the world.” The book is short and easily read, and its practicality and warmth made it popular throughout the colonies and in England. Franklin appears to have extrapolated not only the form, but the ethical substance from the book, publishing his own Poor Richard's Almanac, an annual journal consisting of practical tips, witty sayings, and household advice. In the Autobiography, he notes that his father’s library held a copy of Mather's book, and that reading it “perhaps gave me a Turn of Thinking that had an Influence on some of the principal future Events of my Life.” In a letter written to Mather’s son Samuel in 1773, Franklin acknowledged Mather’s influence: "When I was a boy, I met with a book, entitled “Essays to do good,” which, I think, was written by your father. It had been so little regarded by a former possessor, that several leaves of it were torn out: but the remainder gave me such a turn, for thinking, as to have an influence on my conduct through life; for I have always set a greater value on the character of a doer of good, than any other kind of reputation; and if I have been, as you seem to think, a useful citizen, the public owes the advantage of it to that book." --Ellen French</p></note>

Because of this, the younger sons were often sent off to practice law, join the military, or become ministers in the church. This trend extended into the middle class as well, as often the younger sons were sent, as here, as a "tithe" to the church for both religious and practical reasons.</note>

We do not know why Benjamin's apprenticeship was stipulated to be that long. The provision that he get "journeyman's wages," that is, the salary of a flully-fledged printer, might have been offered as a comprimise.
                The fact of Franklin's apprenticeship, and his early departure from his brother's ship, which is coming up in in a few pages, informs much of this early part of the Autobiography. During his trip from Boston to Philadelphia Franklin recounts being wary about attracting attention, noting, “it seemed to be suspected from my youth and appearance, that I might be some runaway.” This statement seems odd, considering Franklin technically was a runaway—he had left his apprenticeship with his brother against the will of the family. Why did Franklin not consider himself classed with other young runaways, when he did fear being mistaken for one and returned to Boston?  He certainly had run away from Boston, knowing that if he left openly, “means would be used to prevent [him].” Yet Franklin was in a somewhat unique position: he had technically run away without his brother’s permission, yet he knew that he would not be treated as a common runaway apprentice.</p>
                <p>Apprenticeship  in the American colonies had its roots in the practices of the English system, which dates back to the middle ages. One of the major pieces of legislation governing apprenticeship was the English Statute of Artificers (1563),  which required parents who did not otherwise provide for the education of their sons to bind them to a trade or the agricultural system. The seven year term, longer than the normal length of apprenticeship in France and Germany, “was designed to ensure English supremacy in handmade manufactures and to discourage the wandering and strolling that had characterized earlier periods of English life.”  Another aspect of English law and custom that influenced apprenticeship in the colonies was the English Poor Law (1601)  which required local authorities to bind poor or orphaned children into apprenticeship if their parents did not do so. Benjamin Franklin belonged to the class of apprentices who bound themselves “by their own free will and consent” to a master to learn his trade, not the apprentices involuntarily bound under the auspices of the Poor Law. </p>
                <p>These English statutes applied to the American colonies in theory. However, these laws and customs depended on the medieval guild system for enforcement—a system which never developed in the colonies. Eighteenth-century colonial America did not have the deep pool of skilled laborers that characterized the guild system and had no enforcement mechanism to monitor quality of work, admit members to the status of journeyman or master, or standardize apprentice training.  In the colonies, “anyone could call himself a master artisan, and any such artisan could take an apprentice”—or many apprentices at once.  During Franklin’s boyhood in Boston, the real wages of artisans were falling and apprenticeship contracts often did not demand fees from parents, except for those in high-status crafts. It was guild enforcement that kept wages high and ensured quality craft in the English system, because it created a closed labor market—no artisan could work without permission from his guild.</p>
                <p>In England, if an apprentice ran away from his master, there was an ironclad system in place to keep him from practicing his craft anywhere in the country. The guild system ensured that jurisdiction rules were enforced, and any new practitioner would have to be an approved guild member. In America, runaway penalties did not extend beyond the borders of each colony,  and, as Franklin’s narrative attests, the demand for skilled labor meant even a partially-trained apprentice would likely be hired, perhaps even with the status of a journeyman (though this label did not hold the weight it would in England).  If an American apprentice ran away, his master would circulate a description of the runaway with an offer of reward, and if returned, the apprentice would have to serve for a longer period.  The reward was the enforcement mechanism, meaning citizens might be on the lookout for apparent runaways.</p> 
                <p>Technically, to be legal, an apprenticeship contract (called an “indenture”) needed to be registered with municipal authorities so it could be used as evidence in case of disputes. This was true even in the colonies.  However, the nature of indenture papers meant that possession of one’s half of the contract should have constituted evidence without consulting town records: “indenture”  papers were indented on both halves of the document so they could later be identified as one contract.  Benjamin Franklin’s original contract with his brother would probably have been properly registered—but the second set of indentures, which were secret, would only have been held by the master and the apprentice.  James probably could have proved Benjamin was his apprentice by comparing the two halves of the indenture, but once his brother was out of Boston, this means of redress was impractical at best. And of course, in attempting to regain his apprentice, James would have had to admit his real ownership of the Courant. --Natalie Thompson</p>
