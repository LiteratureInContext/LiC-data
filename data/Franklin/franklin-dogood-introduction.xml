                    "Silence Dogood" Essays <lb/><lb/><lb/>
                </head>
                <p>Benjamin Franklin was sixteen years old and working as an apprentice in the Boston print shop of his older brother James when, in April 1722, he began writing a series of essays to be published in the <hi>New-England Courant</hi> under the pseudonym of "Silence Dogood." In his Autobiography, Benjamin remembered slipping these essays, written in disguised handwriting, under the door of the <hi>Courant</hi>, which James was publishing; he assumed (probably correctly) that James would refuse to print an essay from him if he simply asked or submitted it under his own name. James published the essays, which became very popular among the newspaper's readers. Benjamin kept his authorship of the series a secret, even from his brother, until after he finished writing them in October 1722, at which point James printed an advertisement asking for "Silence Dogood" to come forth. Benjamin confessed that he was the author, which seems to have annoyed his older brother. It was not too long after that that Benjamin left his brother's shop--breaking his apprenticeship--and moved to Philadelphia.</p><lb/><lb/>

                <p>The Silence Dogood essays are written in the persona of a middle-aged woman, but the title character is very clearly indebted to Mr. Spectator, the avatar of Addison and Steele's <hi>Spectator</hi> series, published a decade earlier; it is testimony to how widely influential the <hi>Spectator</hi> was that even in colonial America, teenaged boys reading it and taking it as a model for their own writing. In the <hi>Autobiography</hi>, Franklin remembers how much he loved the <hi>Spectator</hi>, and how he first came across it at the age of sixteen: "<hi>an odd volume of the Spectator fell into my hands. This was a publication I had never seen. I bought the volume, and read it again and again. I was enchanted with it, thought the style excellent, and wished it were in my power to imitate it. With this view I selected some of the papers, made short summaries of the ſenſe of each period, and put them for a few days aside. I then, without looking at the book, endeavoured to restore the essays to their true form, and to express each thought at length, as it was in the original, employing the most appropriate words that occurred to my mind. I afterwards compared my Spectator with the original; I perceived some faults, which I corrected</hi>." If the <hi>Spectator</hi> gave Franklin a model for his prose style, so too did it give him a persona to inhabit; the "Silence" in Silence Dogood's name clearly alludes to the taciturn Mr. Spectator invented by Addison and Steele. The surname "Dogood" also has a famous colonial writer in mind, in this case the prolific Boston cleric Cotton Mather, whose 1710 collection <hi>Bonifacius: or, Essays to Do Good</hi>, advocating the reader to undertake charitable works, Franklin also remembered as a book that had a great impact on him as a young man. The startling thing about the Silence Dogood essays (in addition to the fact that they were written by a sixteen-year-old), is that Franklin adopts the persona of a woman, a persona that enables him adopt, but also gently mock, the kinds of sentiments expressed by authority figures like Mather. Franklin would continue to use personae, male and female, throughout his career, the most famous of these being the Poor Richard of his Almanack. And there's a sense in which the "Benjamin Franklin" of the <hi>Autobiography</hi> and of history was also a persona, a role that Franklin played on the public stage of the trans-Atlantic world.</p><lb/><lb/>
                <p>There were fourteen Silence Dogood essays in all, published every two weeks in the pages of the <hi>New England Courant</hi>, for which, as we have seen, James Franklin was the publisher.  The <hi>New England Courant</hi> was the first independently-published newspaper in colonial America; that is, it operated independently of government authority. So much so that the colonial government in Massachusetts frequently attempted to censor the newspaper and jailed James Franklin several times when he published articles that were thought to defame public officials (Cotton Mather, for example). During these periods, Benjamin was listed as the official publisher of the newspaper. It was finally closed for good in 1726; Benjamin had long since moved on, and was at this point finishing a stint as a journeyman printer in London, preparing to return to Philadelphia, where he opened a print shop of his own.</p><lb/><lb/>
