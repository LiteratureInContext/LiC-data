                <p>Sir,</p><lb/><lb/>
                <p>Discoursing lately with an intimate Friend of mine of the lamentable Condition of Widows, he put into my Hands a Book, wherein the ingenious Author proposes (I think) a certain Method for their Relief. I have often thought of some such Project for their Benefit my self, and intended to communicate my Thoughts to the Publick; but to prefer my own Proposals to what follows, would be rather an Argument of Vanity in me than Good Will to the many Hundreds of my Fellow-Sufferers now in New-England.</p><lb/><lb/>
                <p>“We have (says he) abundance of Women, who have been Bred well, and Liv’d well, Ruin’d in a few Years, and perhaps, left Young, with a House full of Children, and nothing to Support them; which falls generally upon the Wives of the Inferior Clergy, or of Shopkeepers and Artificers.</p><lb/><lb/>
                <p>“They marry Wives with perhaps £300 to £1000 Portion, and can settle no Jointure upon them; either they are Extravagant and Idle, and Waste it, or Trade decays, or Losses, or a Thousand Contingences happen to bring a Tradesman to Poverty, and he Breaks; the Poor Young Woman, it may be, has Three or Four Children, and is driven to a thousand shifts, while he lies in the Mint or Fryars under the <hi>Dilemma</hi> of a Statute of Bankrupt; but if he Dies, then she is absolutely Undone, unless she has Friends to go to.</p><lb/><lb/>
                <p>“Suppose an Office to be Erected, to be call’d <hi>An Office of Ensurance for Widows</hi>, upon the following Conditions;</p><lb/><lb/>
                <p>“Two thousand Women, or their Husbands for them, Enter their Names into a Register to be kept for that purpose, with the Names, Age, and Trade of their Husbands, with the Place of their abode, Paying at the Time of their Entring 5<hi>s</hi>. down with 1<hi>s</hi>. 4<hi>d</hi>. <hi>per</hi> Quarter, which is to the setting up and support of an Office with Clerks, and all proper Officers for the same; <hi>for there is no maintaining such without Charge</hi>; they receive every one of them a Certificate, Seal’d by the Secretary of the Office, and Sign’d by the Governors, for the Articles hereafter mentioned.</p><lb/><lb/>
                <p>“If any one of the Women becomes a Widow, at any Time after Six Months from the Date of her Subscription, upon due Notice given, and Claim made at the Office in form, as shall be directed, she shall receive within Six Months after such Claim made, the Sum of £500 in Money, without any Deductions, saving some small Fees to the Officers, which the Trustees must settle, that they may be known.</p><lb/><lb/>
                <p>“In Consideration of this, every Woman so Subscribing, Obliges her self to Pay as often as any Member of the Society becomes a Widow, the due Proportion or Share allotted to her to Pay, towards the £500 for the said Widow, provided her Share does not exceed the Sum of 5<hi>s</hi>.</p><lb/><lb/>
