                     The "Silence Dogood" Essays 
                </head>
                <p>Benjamin Franklin was sixteen years old and working as an apprentice in the Boston print shop of his older brother James when, in April 1722, he began writing a series of essays to be published in the <hi rend="italic">New-England Courant</hi> under the pseudonym of "Silence Dogood." In his <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi>, Benjamin remembered slipping these essays, written in disguised handwriting, under the door of the <hi rend="italic">Courant</hi>, which James was publishing; he assumed (probably correctly) that James would refuse to print an essay from him if he simply asked or submitted it under his own name. James published the essays, which became very popular among the newspaper's readers. Benjamin kept his authorship of the series a secret, even from his brother, until after he finished writing them in October 1722, at which point James printed an advertisement asking for "Silence Dogood" to come forth. Benjamin confessed that he was the author, which seems to have annoyed his older brother. It was not too long after that that Benjamin left his brother's shop--breaking his apprenticeship--and moved to Philadelphia.</p>
                <!-- Need link add to "autobiography" to Franklin Autobiography on our web-->
                <!-- Add picture -->
                <p>The Silence Dogood essays are written in the persona of a middle-aged woman, but the title character is very clearly indebted to Mr. Spectator, the avatar of Addison and Steele's <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> series, published a decade earlier; it is testimony to how widely influential the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> was that even in colonial America, teenaged boys were reading it and taking it as a model for their own writing. In the <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi>, Franklin remembers how much he loved the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi>, and how he first came across it at the age of sixteen: "<hi rend="italic">an odd volume of the Spectator fell into my hands. This was a publication I had never seen. I bought the volume, and read it again and again. I was enchanted with it, thought the style excellent, and wished it were in my power to imitate it. With this view I selected some of the papers, made short summaries of the ſenſe of each period, and put them for a few days aside. I then, without looking at the book, endeavoured to restore the essays to their true form, and to express each thought at length, as it was in the original, employing the most appropriate words that occurred to my mind. I afterwards compared my Spectator with the original; I perceived some faults, which I corrected</hi>." If the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> gave Franklin a model for his prose style, so too did it give him a persona to inhabit; the "Silence" in Silence Dogood's name clearly alludes to the taciturn Mr. Spectator invented by Addison and Steele. The surname "Dogood" also has a famous colonial writer in mind, in this case the prolific Boston cleric Cotton Mather, whose 1710 collection <hi rend="italic">Bonifacius: or, Essays to Do Good</hi>, advocating the reader to undertake charitable works, Franklin also remembered as a book that had a great impact on him as a young man. The startling thing about the Silence Dogood essays (in addition to the fact that they were written by a sixteen-year-old), is that Franklin adopts the persona of a woman, a persona that enables him adopt, but also gently mock, the kinds of sentiments expressed by authority figures like Mather. Franklin would continue to use personae, male and female, throughout his career, the most famous of these being the Poor Richard of his Almanack. And there's a sense in which the "Benjamin Franklin" of the <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> and of history was also a persona, a role that Franklin played on the public stage of the trans-Atlantic world.</p>
                <p>There were fourteen Silence Dogood essays in all, published every two weeks in the pages of the <hi rend="italic">New England Courant</hi>, for which, as we have seen, James Franklin was the publisher. The <hi rend="italic">New England Courant</hi> was the first independently-published newspaper in colonial America; that is, it operated independently of government authority. So much so that the colonial government in Massachusetts frequently attempted to censor the newspaper and jailed James Franklin several times when he published articles that were thought to defame public officials (Cotton Mather, for example). During these periods, Benjamin was listed as the official publisher of the newspaper. It was finally closed for good in 1726. Benjamin had long since moved on, and was at this point finishing a stint as a journeyman printer in London and preparing to return to Philadelphia, where he opened a print shop of his own.</p>

                <p>Sir,</p>
                <p>Histories of Lives are seldom entertaining, unless they contain something either admirable or exemplar: And since there is little or nothing of this Nature in my own Adventures, I will not tire your Readers with tedious Particulars of no Consequence, but will briefly, and in as few Words as possible, relate the most material Occurrences of my Life, and according to my Promise, confine all to this Letter.</p>
                <p>My Reverend master who had hitherto remained a Batchelor, (after much meditation on the <ref target="a001" corresp="n001">Eighteenth verse of the Second Chapter of Genesis</ref><note xml:id="n001" target="a001">DRAFT-give a brief summary, and explain how that fits into being batchelor if its not obvious</note>,) took up a Resolution to marry; and having made several unsuccessful fruitless Attempts on the <ref target="a002" corresp="n002">more topping Sort of our Sex</ref><note xml:id="n002" target="a002">DRAFT-explain</note>, and being tir'd with making troublesome Journeys and Visits to no Purpose, <ref target="a003" corresp="n003">he began unexpectedly to cast a loving Eye upon Me</ref><note xml:id="n003" target="a003">DRAFT-explain how common it was to marry a man so distantly above your age as I imagine this man would be a minimum of ten years older than her if not more</note>, whom he had brought up cleverly to his Hand.</p>
                <p>There is certainly scarce any Part of a Man's Life in which he appears more silly and ridiculous, than when he makes his first Onset in Courtship. The aukward Manner in which my Master first discover'd his Intentions, made me, in spite of my Reverence to his Person, burst out into an unmannerly Laughter: However, having ask'd his Pardon, and with much ado compos'd my Countenance, I promis'd him I would take his Proposal into serious Consideration, and speedily give him an Answer.</p>
                <p>As he had been a great Benefactor (and in a Manner a Father to me) I could not well deny his Request, when I once perceived he was in earnest. Whether it was Love, or Gratitude, or Pride, or all Three that made me consent, I know not; but it is certain, he found it no hard Matter, by the Help of his Rhetorick, to conquer my Heart, and perswade me to marry him.</p>
                <p>This unexpected Match was very astonishing to all the Country round about, and served to furnish them with Discourse for a long Time after; some approving it, others disliking it, as they were led by their various Fancies and Inclinations.</p>
                <p>We lived happily together in the Heighth of conjugal Love and mutual Endearments, for near Seven Years, in which Time we added Two likely Girls and a Boy to the Family of the Dogoods: But alas! When my <ref target="a004" corresp="n004">Sun was in its meridian Altitude</ref><note xml:id="n004" target="a004">DRAFT-explain</note>, inexorable unrelenting Death, as if he had envy'd my Happiness and Tranquility, and resolv'd to make me entirely miserable by the Loss of so good an Husband, hastened his Flight to the Heavenly World, by a sudden unexpected Departure from <ref target="a005" corresp="n005">this</ref><note xml:id="n005" target="a005">DRAFT-Should it say "this life"</note>.</p>
                <p>I have now remained in a State of Widowhood for several Years, but it is a State I never much admir'd, and I am apt to fancy that I could be easily perswaded to marry again, provided I was sure of a good-humour'd, sober, agreeable Companion: But one, even with these few good Qualities, being hard to find, I have lately relinquish'd all Thoughts of that Nature.</p>
                <p>At present I pass away my leisure Hours in Conversation, either with my honest Neighbour Rusticus and his Family, or with the ingenious Minister of our Town, who now lodges at my House, and by whose Assistance I intend now and then to beautify my Writings with a Sentence or two in the learned Languages, which will not only be fashionable, and pleasing to those who do not understand it, but will likewise be very ornamental.</p>
                <p>I shall conclude this with my own Character, which (one would think) I should be best able to give. <hi rend="italic">Know then</hi>, That I am an Enemy to Vice, and a Friend to Vertue. I am one of an extensive Charity, and a great Forgiver of <hi rend="italic">private</hi> Injuries: <ref target="a006" corresp="n006">A hearty Lover of the Clergy and all good Men, and a mortal Enemy to arbitrary Government and unlimited Power.

I have likewise a natural Inclination to observe and reprove the Faults of others, at which I have an excellent Faculty. I speak this by Way of Warning to all such whose Offences shall come under my Cognizance, for I never intend to wrap my Talent in a Napkin. To be brief; I am courteous and affable, good humour'd (unless I am first provok'd,) and handsome, and sometimes witty, but always, Sir, Your Friend and Humble Servant,</p>

                <p>Sir.</p>
                <p>It is undoubtedly the Duty of all Persons to serve the Country they live in, according to their Abilities; yet I sincerely acknowledge, that I have hitherto been very deficient in this Particular; whether it was for want of Will or Opportunity, I will not at present stand to determine: Let it suffice, that I now take up a Resolution, to do for the future all that <hi rend="italic">lies in my Way</hi> for the Service of my Countrymen.</p>
                <p>I have from my Youth been <ref target="a001" corresp="n001">indefatigably</ref><note xml:id="n001" target="a001">Tirelessly. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> studious to gain and treasure up in my Mind all useful and desireable Knowledge, especially such as tends to improve the Mind, and enlarge the Understanding: And as I have found it very beneficial to me, I am not without Hopes, that communicating my small Stock in this Manner, by <ref target="a002" corresp="n002">Peace-meal</ref><note xml:id="n002" target="a002">Piece by piece, or in small bits. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> to the Publick, may be at least in some Measure useful.</p>
                <p>I am very sensible that it is impossible for me, or indeed any one Writer to please all Readers at once. Various Persons have different Sentiments; and that which is pleasant and delightful to one, gives another a Disgust. He that would (in this Way of Writing) please all, is under a Necessity to make his Themes almost as numerous as his Letters. He must one while be merry and diverting, then more solid and serious; one while sharp and satyrical, then (to <ref target="a003" corresp="n003">mollify</ref><note xml:id="n003" target="a003">Soften; make tender.

                <p>According to this Method I intend to proceed, bestowing now and then a few gentle <ref target="a004" corresp="n004">Reproofs</ref><note xml:id="n004" target="a004">Censures or Rebukes; subject to blame or scorn.

And here I must not forget to invite the ingenious Part of your Readers, particularly those of my own Sex to enter into a Correspondence with me, assuring them, that their Condescension in this Particular shall be received as a Favour, and accordingly acknowledged.</p>
                <p>I think I have now finish'd the Foundation, and I intend in my next to begin to raise the Building.

                <p>Sir,</p>
                <p>Discoursing the other Day at Dinner with my Reverend Boarder, formerly mention'd, (whom for Distinction sake we will call by the Name of Clericus,) concerning the Education of Children, I ask'd his Advice about my young Son William, whether or no I had best bestow upon him Academical Learning, or (as our Phrase is) <hi rend="italic">bring him up at our College</hi>: He perswaded me to do it by all Means, using many weighty Arguments with me, and answering all the Objections that I could form against it; telling me withal, that he did not doubt but that the Lad would take his Learning very well, and not idle away his Time as too many there now-a-days do. These Words of Clericus gave me a Curiosity to inquire a little more strictly into the present Circumstances of that famous <ref target="a002" corresp="n002">Seminary</ref><note xml:id="n002" target="a002">A place of education such as a school or a college. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> of Learning; but the Information which he gave me, was neither pleasant, nor such as I expected.</p>
                <p>As soon as Dinner was over, I took a solitary Walk into my Orchard, still ruminating on Clericus's Discourse with much Consideration, until I came to my usual Place of Retirement under the <hi rend="italic">Great Apple-Tree</hi>; where having seated my self, and carelessly laid my Head on a <ref target="a003" corresp="n003">verdant</ref><note xml:id="n003" target="a003">Green; of vegetation. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> Bank, I fell by Degrees into a soft and undisturbed Slumber. My waking Thoughts remained with me in my Sleep, and before I awak'd again, I dreamt the following Dream.</p>
                <p>I fancy'd I was travelling over pleasant and delightful Fields and Meadows, and thro' many small Country Towns and Villages; and as I pass'd along, all Places resounded with the Fame of the Temple of Learning: Every Peasant, who had wherewithal, was preparing to send one of his Children at least to this famous Place; and in this Case most of them consulted their own Purses instead of their Childrens Capacities: So that I observed, a great many, <!-- YEA? -->yea, the most part of those who were travelling thither, were little better than Dunces and Blockheads. Alas! alas!</p>
                <p>At length I entred upon a spacious Plain, in the Midst of which was erected a large and stately Edifice: It was to this that a great Company of Youths from all Parts of the Country were going; so stepping in among the Crowd, I passed on with them, and presently arrived at the Gate.</p>
                <p>The Passage was kept by two sturdy <ref target="a004" corresp="n004">Porters</ref><note xml:id="n004" target="a004">Gatekeepers. Source: Oxford English Dictionoary</note> named <hi rend="italic">Riches and Poverty</hi>, and the latter obstinately refused to give Entrance to any who had not first gain'd the Favour of the former; so that I observed, many who came even to the very Gate, were obliged to travel back again as ignorant as they came, for want of this necessary Qualification. However, as a <ref target="a005" corresp="n005">Spectator</ref><note xml:id="n005" target="a005">(DRAFT-DC add more?)A nod to the series of letters, The Spectator, which Franklin used as a heavy influence for his Silence Dogood letters.</note> I gain'd Admittance, and with the rest entred directly into the Temple.</p>
                <p>In the Middle of the great Hall stood a stately and magnificent Throne, which was ascended to by two high and difficult Steps. On the Top of it sat Learning in awful State; she was apparelled wholly in Black, and surrounded almost on every Side with innumerable Volumes in all Languages. She seem'd very busily employ'd in writing something on half a Sheet of Paper, and upon Enquiry, I understood she was preparing a Paper, call'd, <hi rend="italic">The New-England Courant</hi>. On her Right Hand sat <hi rend="italic">English</hi>, with a pleasant smiling Countenance, and handsomely attir'd; and on her left were seated several <hi rend="italic">Antique Figures</hi> with their Faces vail'd. I was considerably puzzl'd to guess who they were, until one informed me, (who stood beside me,) that those Figures on her left Hand were <hi rend="italic">Latin</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Greek</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Hebrew</hi>, &amp;c. and that they were very much reserv'd, and seldom or never unvail'd their Faces here, and then to few or none, tho' most of those who have in this Place acquir'd so much Learning as to distinguish them from <hi rend="italic">English</hi>, pretended to an intimate Acquaintance with them. I then enquir'd of him, what could be the Reason why they continued vail'd, in this Place especially: He pointed to the Foot of the Throne, where I saw <hi rend="italic">Idleness</hi>, attended with <hi rend="italic">Ignorance</hi>, and these (he informed me) were they, who first vail'd them, and still kept them so.</p>
                <p>Now I observed, that the whole Tribe who entred into the Temple with me, began to climb the Throne; but the Work proving troublesome and difficult to most of them, they withdrew their Hands from the Plow, and contented themselves to sit at the Foot, with Madam <hi rend="italic">Idleness</hi> and her Maid <hi rend="italic">Ignorance</hi>, until those who were assisted by Diligence and a <ref target="a006" corresp="n006">docible</ref><note xml:id="n006" target="a006">Ready to be taught; submissive to instruction.

                <p>The other Step being in the same Manner ascended, and the usual Ceremonies at an End, every <ref target="a011" corresp="n011">Beetle-Scull</ref><note xml:id="n011" target="a011">(DRAFT)I assume this is some kind of insult but I can't find any reference to it except here.</note> seem'd well satisfy'd with his own Portion of Learning, tho' perhaps he was <hi rend="italic">e'en just</hi> as ignorant as ever. And now the Time of their Departure being come, they march'd out of Doors to make Room for another Company, who waited for Entrance: And I, having seen all that was to be seen, quitted the hall likewise, and went to make my Observations on those who were just gone out before me.</p>
                <p>Some I perceiv'd took to <ref target="a012" corresp="n012">Merchandizing</ref><note xml:id="n012" target="a012">Engaged in the selling and trade of goods.

                <p>After Thanks to my Correspondent for his Kindness in cutting out Work for me, I must assure him, that I find it a very difficult Matter to <ref target="a006" corresp="n006">reprove</ref><note xml:id="n006" target="a006">Rebuke; express disapproval. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> Women separate from the Men; for what Vice is there in which the Men have not as great a Share as the Women? and in some have they not a far greater, as in Drunkenness, Swearing, &amp;c.? And if they have, then it follows, that when a Vice is to be reproved, Men, who are most culpable, deserve the most Reprehension, and certainly therefore, ought to have it. But we will wave this Point at present, and proceed to a particular Consideration of what my Correspondent calls <hi rend="italic">Female Vice</hi>.</p>
                <p>As for Idleness, if I should <ref target="a007" corresp="n007">Quaere</ref><note xml:id="n007" target="a007">To question or query.

Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> and Idleness, yet if you go among the Women, you will learn, that <hi rend="italic">they have always more Work upon their Hands than they are able to do; and that a Woman's Work is never done</hi>, &amp;c. But however, Suppose we should grant for once, that we are generally more idle than the Men, (without making any Allowance for the <hi rend="italic">Weakness of the Sex</hi>,) I desire to know whose Fault it is? Are not the Men to blame for their Folly in maintaining us in Idleness? Who is there that can be handsomely Supported in Affluence, Ease and Pleasure by another, that will chuse rather to earn his Bread by the Sweat of his own Brows? And if a Man will be so fond and so foolish, as to labour hard himself for a Livelihood, and suffer his Wife in the mean Time to sit in Ease and Idleness, let him not blame her if she does so, for it is in a great Measure his own Fault.</p>
                <p>And now for the Ignorance and Folly which he <ref target="a010" corresp="n010">reproaches</ref><note xml:id="n010" target="a010">Scolds or censures. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> us with, let us see (if we are Fools and Ignoramus's) whose is the Fault, the Men's or our's. An ingenious Writer, having this Subject in Hand, has the following Words, wherein he lays the Fault wholly on the Men, for not allowing Women the Advantages of Education.</p>
                <p>"I have (says he) often thought of it as one of the most barbarous Customs in the World, considering us as a civiliz'd and Christian Country, that we deny the Advantages of Learning to Women. We reproach the Sex every Day with Folly and Impertinence, while I am confident, had they the Advantages of Education equal to us, they would be guilty of less than our selves. One would wonder indeed how it should happen that Women are <ref target="a011" corresp="n011">conversible</ref><note xml:id="n011" target="a011">Capable of being converted.

And I would but ask any who slight the Sex for their Understanding, What is a Man (a Gentleman, I mean) good for that is taught no more? If Knowledge and Understanding had been useless Additions to the Sex, God Almighty would never have given them Capacities, for he made nothing Needless. What has the Woman done to forfeit the Priviledge of being taught? Does she plague us with her Pride and <ref target="a013" corresp="n013">Impertinence</ref><note xml:id="n013" target="a013">Irrelevance. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>?

                <p>So much for Female Ignorance and Folly, and now let us a little consider the Pride which my Correspondent thinks is <hi rend="italic">intollerable</hi>. By this Expression of his, one would think he is some dejected <ref target="a015" corresp="n015">Swain</ref><note xml:id="n015" target="a015">(DRAFT-DC)An innocent, rose-coloured country lover, such as one found in pastoral poetry.

Notwithstanding, I believe there are more Instances of extravagant Pride to be found among Men than among Women, and this Fault is certainly more hainous in the former than in the latter.</p>
                <p>Upon the whole, I conclude, that it will be impossible to lash any Vice, of which the Men are not equally guilty with the Women, and consequently deserve an equal (if not a greater) Share in the Censure.

                <p>This Pride of Apparel will appear the more foolish, if we consider, that those airy Mortals, who have no other Way of making themselves considerable but by gorgeous Apparel, draw after them Crowds of Imitators, who hate each other while they endeavour after a Similitude of Manners.

                <p>It has been the Complaint of many Ingenious Foreigners, who have travell'd amongst us, <hi rend="italic">That good Poetry is not to be expected in New-England</hi>. I am apt to Fancy, the Reason is, not because our Countreymen are altogether void of a Poetical Genius, nor yet because we have not those Advantages of Education which other Countries have, but purely because we do not afford that Praise and Encouragement which is merited, when any thing extraordinary of this Kind is produc'd among us: Upon which Consideration I have determined, when I meet with a Good Piece of New-England Poetry, to give it a suitable <ref target="a002" corresp="n002">Encomium</ref><note xml:id="n002" target="a002">Grand expression of praise.

                </head>
                <p>Sir,</p>
                <p>I prefer the following Abstract from the London Journal to any Thing of my own, and therefore shall present it to your Readers this week without any further Preface.</p>
                <p>"Without Freedom of Thought, there can be no such Thing as Wisdom; and no such Thing as publick Liberty, without Freedom of Speech; which is the Right of every Man, as far as by it, he does not hurt or controul the Right of another: And this is the only Check it ought to suffer, and the only Bounds it ought to know.</p>
                <p>"This sacred Privilege is so essential to free Goverments, that the Security of Property, and the Freedom of Speech always go together; and in those wretched Countries where a Man cannot call his Tongue his own, he can scarce call any Thing else his own. Whoever would overthrow the Liberty of a Nation, must begin by subduing the Freeness of Speech; a <hi rend="italic">Thing</hi> terrible to Publick Traytors.</p>

                <p>"The Administration of Government, is nothing else but the Attendance of the <hi rend="italic">Trustees of the People</hi> upon the Interest and Affairs of the People: And as it is the Part and Business of the People, for whose Sake alone all publick Matters are, or ought to be transacted, to see whether they be well or ill transacted; so it is the Interest, and ought to be the Ambition, of all honest Magistrates, to have their Deeds openly examined, and publickly scann'd: Only the <hi rend="italic">wicked Governours</hi> of Men dread what is said of them; <ref target="a008" corresp="n008"><hi rend="italic">Audivit Tiberius probra queis lacerabitur, atque</hi> perculsus est</ref><note xml:id="n008" target="a008">(DRAFT-Translate)It appears to be from Cato's Letters</note>.

                <p>"Freedom of Speech is ever the Symptom, as well as the Effect of a good Government. In old Rome, all was left to the Judgment and Pleasure of the People, who examined the publick Proceedings with such Discretion, and censured those who administred them with such Equity and Mildness, that in the space of Three Hundred Years, not five publick Ministers suffered unjustly.

                <p>Sir,</p>
                <p>It has been for some Time a Question with me, Whether a Commonwealth suffers more by hypocritical Pretenders to Religion, or by the openly <ref target="a002" corresp="n002">Profane</ref><note xml:id="n002" target="a002">(draft-Does he mean 'atheist" by this?)</note>? But some late Thoughts of this Nature, have inclined me to think, that the Hypocrite is the most dangerous Person of the Two, especially if he sustains a Post in the Government, and we consider his Conduct as it regards the Publick. The first <ref target="a003" corresp="n003">Artifice</ref><note xml:id="n003" target="a003">Trickery, deceit. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> of a <hi rend="italic">State Hypocrite</hi> is, by a few savoury Expressions which cost him Nothing, to betray the best Men in his Country into an Opinion of his Goodness; and if the Country wherein he lives is noted for the Purity of Religion, he the more easily gains his End, and consequently may more justly be expos'd and detested. A notoriously profane Person in a private Capacity, ruins himself, and perhaps forwards the Destruction of a few of his Equals; but a publick Hypocrite every day deceives his betters, and makes them the Ignorant <ref target="a004" corresp="n004">Trumpeters</ref><note xml:id="n004" target="a004">Metaphorically one who praises and advocates for. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> of his supposed Godliness: They take him for a Saint, and pass him for one, without considering that they are (as it were) the Instruments of publick Mischief out of Conscience, and ruin their Country for God's sake.</p>
                <p>This Political Description of a Hypocrite, may (for ought I know) be taken for a new Doctrine by some of your Readers; but let them consider, that a <hi rend="italic">little Religion, and a little Honesty, goes a great way in Courts</hi>. 'Tis not inconsistent with Charity to distrust a Religious Man in Power, tho' he may be a good Man; he has many Temptations "to propagate <hi rend="italic">publick Destruction for Personal Advantages</hi> and Security": And if his Natural Temper be covetous, and his Actions often contradict his pious Discourse, we may with great Reason conclude, that he has some other Design in his Religion besides barely getting to Heaven. But the most dangerous Hypocrite in a Common-Wealth, is one <hi rend="italic">who leaves the Gospel for the sake of the Law</hi>: A Man compounded of Law and Gospel, is able to cheat a whole Country with his Religion, and then destroy them under <ref target="a005" corresp="n005"><hi rend="italic">Colour of Law</hi></ref><note xml:id="n005" target="a005">The apparent or de facto authority, as opposed to the actual authority established. Frequently said with negative connotations, suggesting that the authority is just a pretext for corrupt behavior. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>: And here the Clergy are in great Danger of being deceiv'd, and the People of being deceiv'd by the Clergy, until the Monster arrives to such Power and Wealth, that he is out of the reach of both, and can oppress the People without their own blind Assistance. And it is a sad Observation, that when the People too late see their Error, yet the Clergy still persist in their <ref target="a006" corresp="n006">Encomiums</ref><note xml:id="n006" target="a006">High-flown expressions of praise. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> on the Hypocrite; and when he happens to die <hi rend="italic">for the Good of his Country</hi>, without leaving behind him the Memory of <hi rend="italic">one good Action</hi>, he shall be sure to have his Funeral Sermon stuff'd with <hi rend="italic">Pious Expressions</hi> which he dropt at such a Time, and at such a Place, and on such an Occasion; than which nothing can be more prejudicial to the Interest of Religion, nor indeed to the Memory of the Person deceas'd. The Reason of this Blindness in the Clergy is, because they are honourably supported (as they ought to be) by their People, and see nor feel nothing of the Oppression which is obvious and burdensome to every one else.</p>
                <p>But this Subject raises in me an <ref target="a007" corresp="n007">Indignation</ref><note xml:id="n007" target="a007">Disdain or contempt.

                <p>I shall conclude with a Paragraph or two from an ingenious Political Writer in the <hi rend="italic">London Journal</hi>, the better to convince your Readers, that Publick Destruction may be easily carry'd on by <hi rend="italic">hypocritical Pretenders to Religion</hi>.</p>

                <p>“In the next Place, because Death is a Contingency, no Man can directly Calculate, and all that Subscribe must take the Hazard; yet that a Prejudice against this Notion may not be built on wrong Grounds, let’s examine a little the Probable hazard, and see how many shall die Annually out of 2000 Subscribers, accounting by the common proportion of Burials, to the number of the Living.</p>
                <p>“Sir William Petty in his <hi rend="italic">Political Arithmetick</hi>, by a very Ingenious Calculation, brings the Account of Burials in London, to be 1 in 40 Annually, and proves it by all the proper Rules of proportion’d Computation; and I’le take my Scheme from thence. If then One in Forty of all the People in England should Die, that supposes Fifty to Die every Year out of our Two Thousand Subscribers; and for a Woman to Contribute 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to every one, would certainly be to agree to Pay £12 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">per Ann</hi>. upon her Husband’s Life, to receive £500 when he Di’d, and lose it if she Di’d first; and yet this wou’d not be a hazard beyond reason too great for the Gain.</p>
                <p>“But I shall offer some Reasons to prove this to be impossible in our Case; First, Sir William Petty allows the City of London to contain about a Million of People, and our Yearly Bill of Mortality never yet amounted to 25000 in the most Sickly Years we have had, Plague Years excepted, sometimes but to 20000, which is but One in Fifty: Now it is to be consider’d here, that Children and Ancient People make up, one time with another, at least one third of our Bills of Mortality; and our <hi rend="italic">Assurances</hi> lies upon none but the Midling Age of the People, which is the only age wherein Life is any thing steady; and if that be allow’d, there cannot Die by his Computation, above One in Eighty of such People, every Year; but because I would be sure to leave Room for Casualty, I’le allow one in Fifty shall Die out of our Number Subscrib’d.</p>
                <p>“Secondly, It must be allow’d, that our Payments falling due only on the Death of Husbands, this One in Fifty must not be reckoned upon the Two thousand; for ’tis to be suppos’d at least as many Women shall die as Men, and then there is nothing to Pay; so that One in Fifty upon One Thousand, is the most that I can suppose shall claim the Contribution in a Year, which is Twenty Claims a Year at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, and is £5 <hi rend="italic">per Ann</hi>. and if a Woman pays this for Twenty Year, and claims at last, she is Gainer enough, and no extraordinary Loser if she never claims at all: And I verily believe any Office might undertake to demand at all Adventures not above £6 <hi rend="italic">per Ann</hi>. and secure the Subscriber £500 in case she come to claim as a Widow.”</p>
                <p>I would leave this to the Consideration of all who are concern’d for their own or their Neighbour’s <ref target="a016" corresp="n016">Temporal</ref><note xml:id="n016" target="a016">Temporary. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> Happiness; and I am humbly of Opinion, that the Country is ripe for many such <hi rend="italic">Friendly Societies</hi>, whereby every Man might help another, without any Disservice to himself. We have many charitable Gentlemen who Yearly give liberally to the Poor, and where can they better bestow their Charity than on those who become so by Providence, and for ought they know on themselves. But above all, the Clergy have the most need of coming into some such Project as this. They as well as poor Men (according to the Proverb) generally abound in Children; and how many Clergymen in the Country are forc’d to labour in their Fields, to keep themselves in a Condition above Want? How then shall they be able to leave any thing to their forsaken, dejected, and almost forgotten Wives and Children. For my own Part, I have nothing left to live on, but Contentment and a few Cows; and tho’ I cannot expect to be reliev’d by this Project, yet it would be no small Satisfaction to me to see it put in Practice for the Benefit of others.

                <p>Sir,</p>
                <p>It is no unprofitable tho' unpleasant Pursuit, diligently to inspect and consider the Manners and Conversation of Men, who, insensible of the greatest Enjoyments of humane Life, abandon themselves to Vice from a false Notion of <hi rend="italic">Pleasure and good Fellowship</hi>. A true and natural Representation of any Enormity, is often the best Argument against it and Means of removing it, when the most severe Reprehensions alone, are found ineffectual.</p>
                <p>I would in this letter improve the little Observation I have made on the Vice of <hi rend="italic">Drunkeness</hi>, the better to reclaim the <hi rend="italic">good Fellows</hi> who usually pay the Devotions of the Evening to <ref target="a002" corresp="n002">Bacchus</ref><note xml:id="n002" target="a002">The Roman god of wine. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>.</p>
                <p>I doubt not but <hi rend="italic">moderate Drinking</hi> has been improv'd for the Diffusion of Knowledge among the ingenious Part of Mankind, who want the Talent of a ready Utterance, in order to discover the Conceptions of their Minds in an entertaining and intelligible Manner. 'Tis true, drinking does not <hi rend="italic">improve</hi> our Faculties, but it enables us to <hi rend="italic">use</hi> them; and therefore I conclude, that much Study and Experience, and a little Liquor, are of absolute Necessity for some Tempers, in order to make them accomplish'd Orators. <ref target="a003" corresp="n003">Dic</ref><note xml:id="n003" target="a003">(DRAFT-why is this here?)</note>.

Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, but he passes for a Fool among those of small Observation, who never saw him the better for Drink. And here it will not be improper to observe, That the moderate Use of Liquor, and a well plac'd and well regulated Anger, often produce this same Effect; and some who cannot ordinarily talk but in broken Sentences and false Grammar, do in the Heat of Passion express themselves with as much Eloquence as Warmth. Hence it is that my own Sex are generally the most eloquent, because the most passionate. "It has been said in the Praise of some Men, (says an ingenious Author,) that they could talk whole Hours together upon any thing; but it must be owned to the Honour of the other Sex, that there are many among them who can talk whole Hours together upon Nothing.

                <p>But after all it must be consider'd, that no Pleasure can give Satisfaction or prove advantageous to a <hi rend="italic">reasonable Mind</hi>, which is not attended with the <hi rend="italic">Restraints of Reason</hi>. Enjoyment is not to be found by Excess in any sensual Gratification; but on the contrary, the immoderate Cravings of the <ref target="a008" corresp="n008">Voluptuary</ref><note xml:id="n008" target="a008">of or pertaining to sensuous or luxurious pleasures.</note>, are always succeeded with Loathing and a <ref target="a009" corresp="n009">palled</ref><note xml:id="n009" target="a009">Weakened or impaired.

Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> and Nonsense?</p>
                <p>I cannot pretend to account for the different Effects of Liquor on Persons of different Dispositions, who are guilty of Excess in the Use of it. 'Tis strange to see Men of a regular Conversation become <ref target="a011" corresp="n011">rakish</ref><note xml:id="n011" target="a011">Immoral or promiscuous.

                <p>Sir,</p>
                <p>It often happens, that the most zealous Advocates for any Cause find themselves disappointed in the first Appearance of Success in the Propagation of their Opinion; and the Disappointment appears unavoidable, when their easy <ref target="a002" corresp="n002">Proselytes</ref><note xml:id="n002" target="a002">(DRAFT)Converts. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> too suddenly start into Extreams, and are immediately fill'd with Arguments to invalidate their former Practice. This creates a Suspicion in the more considerate Part of Mankind, that those who are thus <hi rend="italic">given to Change</hi>, neither <hi rend="italic">fear God</hi>, nor <hi rend="italic">honour the King</hi>. In Matters of Religion, he that alters his Opinion on a <hi rend="italic">religious Account</hi>, must certainly go thro' much Reading, hear many Arguments on both Sides, and undergo many Struggles in his Conscience, before he can come to a full Resolution: Secular Interest will indeed make quick Work with an immoral Man, especially if, notwithstanding the Alteration of his Opinion, he can with any Appearance of Credit retain his Immorality. But, by this Turn of Thought I would not be suspected of Uncharitableness to those Clergymen at Connecticut, who have lately embrac'd the Establish'd Religion of our Nation, some of whom I hear made their Professions with a Seriousness becoming their Order: However, since they have deny'd the Validity of <hi rend="italic">Ordination</hi> by the Hands of <hi rend="italic">Presbyters</hi>, and consequently their Power of Administring the <hi rend="italic">Sacraments</hi>, &amp;c. we may justly expect a suitable Manifestation of their Repentance for invading the <hi rend="italic">Priests</hi> Office, and living so long in a <ref target="a003" corresp="n003">Corah-like</ref><note xml:id="n003" target="a003">(DRAFT-I have no idea what this means)</note> Rebellion. All I would endeavour to shew is, That an indiscreet Zeal for spreading an Opinion, hurts the Cause of the Zealot. There are too many blind Zealots among every Denomination of Christians; and he that propagates the Gospel among <ref target="a004" corresp="n004"><hi rend="italic">Rakes</hi></ref><note xml:id="n004" target="a004">Immoral or promiscuous people.

                <p>Much to my present Purpose are the Words of two Ingenious Authors of the Church of England, tho' in all Probability they were tainted with <ref target="a007" corresp="n007">Whiggish</ref><note xml:id="n007" target="a007">The Whig party was a political faction in the British Empire, opposed by the rival faction: the Tory Party.

                <p>"I would (says one) have every zealous Man examine his Heart thoroughly, and, I believe, he will often find that what he calls a Zeal for his Religion, is either Pride, Interest or Ill-nature. A Man who differs from another in Opinion sets himself above him in his own Judgment, and in several Particulars pretends to be the wiser Person. This is a great Provocation to the Proud Man, and gives a keen Edge to what he calls his Zeal. And that this is the Case very often, we may observe from the Behaviour of some of the most Zealous for Orthodoxy, who have often great Friendships and Intimacies with vicious immoral Men, provided they do but agree with them in the same Scheme of Belief. The Reason is, because the vicious Believer gives the Precedency to the virtuous Man, and allows the good Christian to be the worthier Person, at the same Time that he cannot come up to his Perfections. This we find exemplified in that trite Passage which we see quoted in almost every System of Ethicks, tho' upon another Occasion;</p>

                <p>"I have (says another) found by Experience, that it is impossible to talk distinctly without defining the Words of which we make use. There is not a Term in our Language which wants Explanation so much as the Word <hi rend="italic">Church</hi>. One would think when People utter it, they should have in their Minds Ideas of Virtue and Religion; but that important Monosyllable drags all the other Words in the Language after it, and it is made use of to express both Praise and Blame, according to the Character of him who speaks it. By this means it happens, that no one knows what his Neighbour means when he says such a one is for or against the Church. It has happen'd that he who is seen every Day at Church, has not been counted in the Eye of the World a Churchman; and he who is very zealous to oblige every one to frequent it but himself, has been a very good Son of the Church. This <ref target="a010" corresp="n010">Praepossession</ref><note xml:id="n010" target="a010">Prepossession: having take possession beforehand.

I have observed great Evils arise from this Practice, and not only the Cause of Piety, but also the secular Interest of Clergymen, has extreamly suffered by the general unexplained Signification of the Word <hi rend="italic">Church</hi>."
