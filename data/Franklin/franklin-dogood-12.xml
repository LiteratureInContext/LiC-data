                    September 10, 1722 [No. 12] <lb/><lb/>

                    To the Author of the <hi>New-England Courant</hi>. <lb/><lb/><lb/>
                </head>
                <p>Sir,</p><lb/><lb/>
                <p>It is no unprofitable tho' unpleasant Pursuit, diligently to inspect and consider the Manners and Conversation of Men, who, insensible of the greatest Enjoyments of humane Life, abandon themselves to Vice from a false Notion of <hi>Pleasure and good Fellowship</hi>. A true and natural Representation of any Enormity, is often the best Argument against it and Means of removing it, when the most severe Reprehensions alone, are found ineffectual.</p><lb/><lb/>
                <p>I would in this letter improve the little Observation I have made on the Vice of <hi>Drunkeness</hi>, the better to reclaim the <hi>good Fellows</hi> who usually pay the Devotions of the Evening to <ref target="a002" corresp="n002">Bacchus</ref><note xml:id="n002" target="a002">The Roman god of wine. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>.</p><lb/><lb/>
                <p>I doubt not but <hi>moderate Drinking</hi> has been improv'd for the Diffusion of Knowledge among the ingenious Part of Mankind, who want the Talent of a ready Utterance, in order to discover the Conceptions of their Minds in an entertaining and intelligible Manner. 'Tis true, drinking does not <hi>improve</hi> our Faculties, but it enables us to <hi>use</hi> them; and therefore I conclude, that much Study and Experience, and a little Liquor, are of absolute Necessity for some Tempers, in order to make them accomplish'd Orators. <ref target="a003" corresp="n003">Dic</ref><note xml:id="n003" target="a003">(DRAFT-why is this here?)</note>. Ponder discovers an excellent Judgment when he is inspir'd with a Glass or two of <ref target="a004" corresp="n004"><hi>Claret</hi></ref><note xml:id="n004" target="a004">A red wine. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, but he passes for a Fool among those of small Observation, who never saw him the better for Drink. And here it will not be improper to observe, That the moderate Use of Liquor, and a well plac'd and well regulated Anger, often produce this same Effect; and some who cannot ordinarily talk but in broken Sentences and false Grammar, do in the Heat of Passion express themselves with as much Eloquence as Warmth. Hence it is that my own Sex are generally the most eloquent, because the most passionate. "It has been said in the Praise of some Men, (says an ingenious Author,) that they could talk whole Hours together upon any thing; but it must be owned to the Honour of the other Sex, that there are many among them who can talk whole Hours together upon Nothing. I have known a Woman branch out into a long <ref target="a005" corresp="n005">extempore</ref><note xml:id="n005" target="a005">Of the moment, without preparation or premeditation.

                <p>But after all it must be consider'd, that no Pleasure can give Satisfaction or prove advantageous to a <hi>reasonable Mind</hi>, which is not attended with the <hi>Restraints of Reason</hi>. Enjoyment is not to be found by Excess in any sensual Gratification; but on the contrary, the immoderate Cravings of the <ref target="a008" corresp="n008">Voluptuary</ref><note xml:id="n008" target="a008">of or pertaining to sensuous or luxurious pleasures.</note>, are always succeeded with Loathing and a <ref target="a009" corresp="n009">palled</ref><note xml:id="n009" target="a009">Weakened or impaired.

What Pleasure can the Drunkard have in the Reflection, that, while in his Cups, he retain'd only the Shape of a Man, and acted the Part of a Beast; or that from reasonable Discourse a few Minutes before, he descended to <ref target="a010" corresp="n010">Impertinence</ref><note xml:id="n010" target="a010">Irrelevance. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> and Nonsense?</p><lb/><lb/>
                <p>I cannot pretend to account for the different Effects of Liquor on Persons of different Dispositions, who are guilty of Excess in the Use of it. 'Tis strange to see Men of a regular Conversation become <ref target="a011" corresp="n011">rakish</ref><note xml:id="n011" target="a011">Immoral or promiscuous.

                <p>And as the Effects of Liquor are various, so are the Characters given to its Devourers. It argues some Shame in the Drunkards themselves, in that they have invented numberless Words and Phrases to cover their Folly, whose proper Significations are harmless, or have no Signification at all. They are seldom known to be <hi>drunk</hi>, tho' they are very often <ref target="a016" corresp="n016"><hi>boozey, cogey, tipsey, fox'd, merry, mellow, fuddl'd, groatable, Confoundedly cut, See two Moons, are Among the Philistines, In a very good Humour, See the Sun, or, The Sun has shone upon them; they Clip the King's English, are Almost froze, Feavourish, In their Altitudes, Pretty well enter'd</hi>, &amp;c</ref><note xml:id="n016" target="a016">Here Franklin is giving a list of euphemistic ways drunkards will describe themselves to avoid using the negatively connotated word "drunk."</note>.
