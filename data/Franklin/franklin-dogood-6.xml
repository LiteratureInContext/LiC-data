                <p>Sir,</p><lb/><lb/>
                <p>Among the many reigning Vices of the Town which may at any Time come under my Consideration and Reprehension, there is none which I am more inclin'd to expose than that of <hi>Pride</hi>. It is acknowledg'd by all to be a Vice the most hateful to God and Man. Even those who nourish it in themselves, hate to see it in others. The proud Man aspires after Nothing less than an unlimited Superiority over his Fellow-Creatures. He has made himself a King in <ref target="a002" corresp="n002"><hi>Soliloquy</hi>S</ref><note xml:id="n002" target="a002">(DRAFT-DC how this was coded, why the second capital "S")A speech or talk given alone or aloud without addressing any person.

I speak it to my Shame, <ref target="a003" corresp="n003">I my self was a Queen from the Fourteenth to the Eighteenth Year of my Age</ref><note xml:id="n003" target="a003">(DRAFT-Explain this)</note>, and govern'd the World all the Time of my being govern'd by my Master. But this speculative Pride may be the Subject of another Letter: I shall at present confine my Thoughts to what we call <hi>Pride of Apparel</hi>. This Sort of Pride has been growing upon us ever since we parted with our Homespun Cloaths for <ref target="a004" corresp="n004"><hi>Fourteen Penny Stuffs</hi></ref><note xml:id="n004" target="a004">(DRAFT-Figure out what this means)</note>, &amp;c.

Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> the Truth of this Observation. Persons of small Fortune under the Dominion of this Vice, seldom consider their Inability to maintain themselves in it, but strive to imitate their Superiors in Estate, or Equals in Folly, until one Misfortune comes upon the Neck of another, and every Step they take is a Step backwards. By striving to appear rich they become really poor, and deprive themselves of that Pity and Charity which is due to the humble poor Man, who is made so more immediately by Providence.</p><lb/><lb/>
                <p>This Pride of Apparel will appear the more foolish, if we consider, that those airy Mortals, who have no other Way of making themselves considerable but by gorgeous Apparel, draw after them Crowds of Imitators, who hate each other while they endeavour after a Similitude of Manners. They destroy by Example, and envy one another's Destruction.</p><lb/><lb/>
                <p>I cannot dismiss this Subject without some Observations on a particular Fashion now reigning among my own Sex, the most immodest and inconvenient of any the Art of Woman has invented, namely, that of <ref target="a008" corresp="n008"><hi>Hoop-Petticoats</hi></ref><note xml:id="n008" target="a008">(DRAFT-Add Picture;maybe rephrase)An undergarment, more commonly known as a hoop skirt, that is worn underneath a womans skirt.
