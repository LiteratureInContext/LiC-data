                <p>Sir,</p><lb/><lb/>
                <p>It has been the Complaint of many Ingenious Foreigners, who have travell'd amongst us, <hi>That good Poetry is not to be expected in New-England</hi>. I am apt to Fancy, the Reason is, not because our Countreymen are altogether void of a Poetical Genius, nor yet because we have not those Advantages of Education which other Countries have, but purely because we do not afford that Praise and Encouragement which is merited, when any thing extraordinary of this Kind is produc'd among us: Upon which Consideration I have determined, when I meet with a Good Piece of New-England Poetry, to give it a suitable <ref target="a002" corresp="n002">Encomium</ref><note xml:id="n002" target="a002">Grand expression of praise. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, and thereby endeavour to discover to the World some of its Beautys, in order to encourage the Author to go on, and bless the World with more, and more Excellent Productions.</p><lb/><lb/>
                <p>There has lately appear'd among us a most Excellent Piece of Poetry, entituled, <hi>An Elegy upon the much Lamented Death of Mrs. Mehitebell Kitel, Wife of Mr. John Kitel of Salem, &amp;c</hi>. It may justly be said in its Praise, without Flattery to the Author, that it is the most <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Piece that ever was wrote in New-England. The Language is so soft and Easy, the Expression so moving and pathetick, but above all, the Verse and Numbers so Charming and Natural, that it is almost beyond Comparison,</p><lb/><lb/>

                    <l>The Muse disdains</l>

                <p>I find no English Author, Ancient or Modern, whose Elegies may be compar'd with this, in respect to the Elegance of Stile, or Smoothness of Rhime; and for the affecting Part, I will leave your Readers to judge, if ever they read any Lines, that would sooner make them <hi>draw their Breath</hi> and Sigh, if not shed Tears, than these following.</p><lb/><lb/>
                
                <lg>
                   <l>Come let us mourn, for we have lost a Wife, a Daughter, and <hi>a Sister</hi>,</l>
                    <l>Who has lately taken Flight, and greatly we have mist her.</l>

                  <l><hi>She said, I ne'er shall hear one Sermon more on Earth</hi>.</l>
                  <l>She kist her Husband <hi>some little Time</hi>before she expir'd,</l>
                  <l>Then lean'd her Head the Pillow on, just out of Breath and tir'd.</l>

           <p>is nothing Comparable to it. The latter only mentions three Qualifications of <hi>one</hi> Person who was deceased, which therefore could raise Grief and Compassion but for <hi>One</hi>. Whereas the former, (<hi>our most excellent Poet</hi>) gives his Reader a Sort of an Idea of the Death of <hi>Three Persons</hi>, viz.</p>
               
                <lg>

            <p>which is <hi>Three Times</hi> as great a Loss as the Death of <hi>One</hi>, and consequently must raise <hi>Three Times</hi> as much Grief and Compassion in the Reader.</p><lb/><lb/>
                <p>I should be very much straitned for Room, if I should attempt to discover even half the Excellencies of this Elegy which are obvious to me. Yet I  cannot omit one Observation, which is, that the Author has (to his Honour) invented a new Species of Poetry, which wants a Name, and was never before known. His Muse scorns to be confin'd to the old Measures and Limits, or to observe the dull Rules of Criticks;</p><lb/><lb/>

                <p>Now 'tis Pity that such an Excellent Piece should not be dignify'd with a particular Name; and seeing it cannot justly be called, either <ref target="a008" corresp="n008"><hi>Epic</hi>, <hi>Sapphic</hi>, <hi>Lyric</hi>, or <hi>Pindaric</hi></ref><note xml:id="n008" target="a008">A series of common poetical styles of the time.

                <p>It is certain, that those Elegies which are of our own Growth, (and our Soil seldom produces any other sort of Poetry) are by far the greatest part, wretchedly Dull and Ridiculous. Now since it is imagin'd by many, that our Poets are honest, well-meaning Fellows, who do their best, and that if they had but some Instructions how to govern Fancy with Judgment, they would make indifferent good Elegies; I shall here <ref target="a010" corresp="n010">subjoin</ref><note xml:id="n010" target="a010">Add to the end of a statement.
