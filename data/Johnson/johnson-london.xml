                <note xml:id="introduction" target="introduction_"><p><hi rend="italic">London</hi>,
                        published in 1738, represents Johnson's attempt to satirize the grubby world
                        of London and also to rise above it. The poem is an "imitation" of the third
                        Satire of the Roman poet Juvenal, which probably dates to the first century.
                        In this poem, Juvenal imagines a friend of the poet, named Umbricius, who is
                        sick and tired of the city of Rome and is leaving for the countryside for
                        good. In doing what was called an "imitation" of his classical source,
                        Johnson is not simply <hi rend="italic">translating</hi> Juvenal's poem, but
                            <hi rend="italic">updating</hi> it, finding modern correlations to the
                        Latin original. Here, London stands in for Rome, "Thales" stands in for
                        Juvenal's friend Umbricius, and the Tuscan countryside to which Umbricius
                        was headed becomes Wales. Exhausted by the filth, crowds, noise of London,
                        and the difficulty of making a living as a writer, Thales (believed by some
                        scholars to refer to <ref
                            target="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-Savage-English-writer"
                            >Richard Savage</ref>, another hack writer who had become a friend of
                        Johnson's) in some ways expresses Johnson's own frustrations. But <hi
                            rend="italic">London</hi> itself, published in a handsome folio edition,
                        written in the heroic couplet form that to readers of the 1730s identified
                        the high style of serious poetry, using the form of the imitation to signify
                        its neoclassical aspirations, and hyped in the pages of the <hi
                            rend="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</hi> (which published ads for the
                        poem, and also excerpted it), is clearly an attempt to Johnson to get out of
                        hackdom as soon as possible, to become a poet like <ref
                            target="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alexander-Pope-English-author"

                        tight fists of the booksellers and magazine editors.</p>
                    <p>The poem also positioned itself as part of the growing opposition to the
                        government of <ref
                            target="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-Walpole-1st-Earl-of-Orford"
                            >Sir Robert Walpole</ref>, who had dominated British politics since
                        taking over as the de facto Prime Minister (there was no such official
                        position yet) in 1721.</p>
                    <!-- Need Picture: Sir Robert Walpole -->
                    <p>Walpole successfully suppressed dissent through a mixture of brutality,
                        bribery, and control of the print media. By the late 1730s, however, attacks
                        on his regime were becoming more open and frequent, prompting new attempts
                        on the part of his government to suppress dissenting voices. In particular,
                        the Stage Licensing Act of 1737 called for theater managers to submit all
                        plays for government approval in advance of performance. Prompted in part by
                        satires against the regime like John Gay's <hi rend="italic">The Beggars
                            Opera</hi> (1728) and the satirical afterpieces by Henry Fielding that
                        had been very popular in the mid-1730s, the Stage Licensing Act had a
                        chilling effect on the theater. In particular, the passage of the Act
                        thwarted Johnson's attempt to become a playwright himself. Johnson had
                        arrived in London just that year with a half-finished tragedy in his
                        luggage, a play called <hi rend="italic">Irene</hi> that he probably
                        imagined as a vehicle by which he could make a lot of money and gain status
                        as an author. But in the aftermath of the <ref
                            target="https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100104279;jsessionid=924D23D9564A06F826870B888FA56197"
                            >Stage Licensing Act</ref>, theater managers became extremely cautious
                        about new plays in general, and <hi rend="italic">Irene</hi> was not staged
                        until 1749. By using Juvenal's Third Satire as a point of departure, <hi
                            rend="italic">London</hi> manages to critique the Walpole regime
                        indirectly and through coded references, but contemporary readers,
                        particularly those in sympathy with the opposition, were readily able to see
                        how the poem mocked Walpole's reign as corrupt.</p>
                    <p>Probably because of its political stance, <hi rend="italic">London</hi> seems
                        to have sold reasonably well, and Alexander Pope, the most famous poet of
                        the period (and a sympathizer with opposition politics), praised it. But as
                        a vehicle for establishing Johnson's reputation as a significant poet who
                        could make a living off his art it was a dead end. Johnson had to continue
                        to grind out work for hire for another decade and a half. It was not until
                        he achieved fame in the 1750s, first as the author of a <hi rend="italic"
                            >Spectator</hi>-like series of journalistic essays called <hi
                            rend="italic">The Rambler</hi> and then as the editor of the <hi
                            rend="italic">Dictionary of the English Language</hi>, which made him a
                        kind of national treasure, since he had single-handedly accomplished for
                        English what it had taken large teams of scholars to do for other European
                        languages. Here, let's read Johnson as eighteenth-century Grub Street's
                        finest product--and its most perceptive critic.</p></note>
