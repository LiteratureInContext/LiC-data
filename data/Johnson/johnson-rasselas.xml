                        ABISSINIA.</ref><note xml:id="Abissinia" target="Abisinnia_"><p><hi rend="italic">The Prince of Abyssinia</hi>, now often referred to as <hi rend="italic">Rasselas</hi> after its central character, became one of the most popular works of fiction of the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, reprinted again and again in the English-speaking world. Which might surprise a modern reader, for whom Samuel Johnson’s tale of a prince meditating on his future does not come across at first blush as the most exciting and absorbing subject matter for a novel. But Rasselas picks up many streams of thought and literature from this period so fully and deftly, and with such sincerity, that it remains a fascinating book, one that can still prompt the reader to think about its central concerns, which remain relevant: how should we think about our desires? is our imagination a good thing or potentially a dangerous thing? what is the task of an artist? how should we go about deciding what to do with our lives? The story goes that Samuel Johnson wrote this book quickly because he needed money to pay for his mother’s funeral, and there is clearly truth to that. But it was only possible for him to write Rasselas so quickly because the book built upon ideas that Johnson had been thinking about for a long time, and picked up strategies for incorporating those ideas into fiction that had developed over the previous few decades, a period that we can now see as crucial to the emergence of the English novel.</p><lb/>
                            
                            <p>One of those strategies was to move the action of the story to the area of the world that eighteenth-century Europeans called “the Orient.” For Europeans in this period, the “Orient” designated an area of the world that we would now call the middle and near East, an area embracing east Africa, as well as the eastern Mediterranean and Mesopotamia. Abyssinia, the central location for Johnson’s story, is now the modern state of Ethiopia, and had been a place that fascinated Johnson for a long time. His first published work was a translation and abridgment of a seventeenth-century travel narrative by the Portuguese Jesuit priest and missionary Jerome Lobo, a book that was one very few accounts in that period by a European that attempted to describe an African culture and the area’s natural resources. Johnson’s version was published as A Voyage to Abyssinia in 1735, when he was twenty-six years old. With <hi rend="italic">Rasselas</hi>, Johnson was returning in his imagination to an area of the world that had long fascinated him, but that he could not realistically visit himself. Writing what was would become known as an “Oriental tale” freed Johnson and other writers of this period who used the form to write about moral, philosophical, aesthetic, and political issues without having to engage directly with European politics and culture. An “Oriental” place like this was in effect a clean slate that a writer could use to imagine a way of being in the world that contrasted with the culture that the readers of the story lived in. Rasselas did not aim to present anything like a faithful representation of Abyssinian culture, but it also avoids either overly romanticizing or dismissing that culture. Rather, European and Oriental societies are put in constant tension with each other, each seen as places where happiness is wished for but elusive, and where human accomplishment is potentially both monumental but also fleeting.</p>
                            <lb/>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Rasselas</hi> is also what we might now call a young adult novel, a work of fiction expressly aimed at younger readers, and consciously shaped to offer positive and complex examples of other young people for readers to model themselves on. Johnson famously worried about the effects of novels on younger readers, and dedicated <hi>Rambler</hi> #4 to what is now a famous critique of the novel for its potential effects on the “young, the ignorant, and the idle” readers, who might easily be misled into taking some of the roguish protagonists of contemporary works of fiction like Henry Fielding’s <hi rend="italic">Tom Jones</hi> as models for their own behavior. The eighteenth century didn’t have a name such as ours for “young adult” fiction, but there was a rich body of works of fiction and nonfiction that aimed to teach young readers how to conduct themselves. There was also in this period a growing interest in books written for children and young people that were both educational and entertaining; scholars trace the origin of children’s literature to this period. <hi rend="italic">Rasselas</hi> is Johnson’s attempt to write the kind of fiction for young people that will help rather than harm them by offering positive models—Rasselas and his sister Nekayah—as its protagonists, and complicated moral and aesthetic ideas to contemplate. </p>
                            <lb/>
                            <p>For all of these reasons, Johnson’s publishers knew that there was a ready market for a book like this, and they were right. <hi rend="italic">Rasselas</hi> was a best-seller almost immediately, and was translated into all of the major European languages in just a few years. It’s a book that opens up more questions than it answers, but leaves us with the hope that human intelligence can discover meaning in the world.</p>  </note><lb/></titlePart>

                    cies of the present day will be supplied
                    by the morrow; attend to the history of
                    Rasselas prince of <placeName type="tgn" key="7032930">Abissinia</placeName>.</p>
                
                <p>
                    Rasselas was the fourth son of the
                    mighty emperour, in whose dominions
                    the Father of waters begins his course;
                    whose bounty pours down the streams
                    of plenty, and scatters over half the
                    world the harvests of <placeName type="tgn" key="7016833">Egypt</placeName>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to the custom which has
                    descended from age to age among the
                    monarchs of the torrid zone, Rasselas was
                    confined in a private palace, with the other
                    sons and daughters of Abissinian royalty,
                    till the order of succession should call him
                    to the throne.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The place, which the wisdom or policy of antiquity had destined for the residence of the Abissinian princes, was a
                
            <pb n="10"/>
                
                spacious valley in the kingdom of <placeName type="tgn" key="7594684">Amhara</placeName>, surrounded on every side by mountains, of which the summits overhang
                    the middle part. The only passage, by
                    which it could be entered, was a cavern
                    that passed under a rock, of which it has
                    long been disputed whether it was the
                    <ref target="work_" corresp="work">work of nature or of human industry.</ref><note xml:id="work" target="work_">That is, whether the tunnel was a natural formation or made by people.</note>
                    The outlet of the cavern was concealed
                    by a thick wood, and the mouth which
                    opened into the valley was closed with gates
                    of iron, forged by the artificers of ancient
                    days, so massy that no man could without the help of engines open or shut them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the mountains on every side, rivulets descended that filled all the valley
                    with verdure and fertility, and formed a
                    lake in the middle inhabited by fish of
                    every species, and frequented by every
                
            <pb n="11"/>
                
                    fowl whom nature has taught to dip the
                    wing in water. This lake discharged its
                    superfluities by a stream which entered a
                    dark cleft of the mountain on the northern
                    side, and fell with dreadful noise from
                    precipice to precipice till it was heard no
                    more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The sides of the mountains were covered with trees, the banks of the brooks
                    were diversified with flowers; every blast
                    shook spices from the rocks, and every
                    month dropped fruits upon the ground.
                    All animals that bite the grass, or
                    brouse the shrub, whether wild or tame,
                    wandered in this extensive circuit, secured from beasts of prey by the mountains which confined them. On one part
                    were flocks and herds feeding in the pastures, on another all the beasts of chase
                
            <pb n="12"/>
             
                    frisking in the lawns; the sprightly kid
                    was bounding on the rocks, the subtle
                    monkey frolicking in the trees, and the
                    solemn elephant reposing in the shade.
                    All the diversities of the world were
                    brought together, the blessings of nature
                    were collected, and its evils extracted
                    and excluded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The valley; wide and fruitful, supplied
                    its inhabitants with the necessaries of
                    life, and all delights and superfluities were
                    added at the annual visit which the emperour paid his children, when the iron
                    gate was opened to the sound of musick;
                    and during eight days every one that resided in the valley was required to propose whatever might contribute to make
                    seclusion pleasant, to fill up the vacancies of attention, and lessen the tedious-
                   
            <pb n="13"/>
              
                    ness of time. Every desire was immediately granted. All the artificers of
                    pleasure were called to gladden the festivity; the musicians exerted the power of
                    harmony, and the dancers shewed their
                    activity before the princes, in hope that
                    they should pass their lives in this blissful
                    captivity, to which these only were admitted whose performance was thought able
                    to add novelty to luxury. Such was
                    the appearance of security and delight
                    which this retirement afforded, that they
                    to whom it was new always desired that it
                    might be perpetual; and as those, on
                    whom the iron gate had once closed,
                    were never suffered to return, the effect of
                    longer experience could not be known.
                    Thus every year produced new schemes
                    of delight, and new competitors for imprisonment.
                </p>
            <pb n="14"/>
                <p>
                    The palace stood on an eminence raised
                    about thirty paces above the surface of
                    the lake. It was divided into many
                    squares or courts, built with greater or
                    less magnificence according to the rank
                    of those for whom they were designed.
                    The roofs were turned into arches of massy stone joined by a cement that grew
                    harder by time, and the building stood
                    from century to century, deriding the solstitial rains and equinocial hurricanes,
                    without need of reparation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This house, which was so large as to
                    be fully known to none but some ancient
                    officers who successively inherited the se-
                    crets of the place, was built as if sus-
                    picion herself had dictated the plan. To
                    every room there was an open and secret
                    passage, every square had a communica-
                
            <pb n="15"/>
               
                    tion with the rest, either from the upper
                    stories by private galleries, or by subterranean passages from the lower apartments.
                    Many of the columns had unsuspected
                    cavities, in which a long race of monarchs had reposited their treasures. They
                    then closed up the opening with marble,
                    which was never to be removed but in the
                    utmost exigencies of the kingdom; and
                    recorded their accumulations in a book
                    which was itself concealed in a tower
                    not entered but by the emperour, attended by the prince who stood next in
                    succession.

                <head type="sub">The discontent of Rasselas in the happy valley.</head>
                   <p> HERE the sons and daughters of Abissinia lived only to know the
                    soft vicissitudcs of pleasure and repose,
                    attended by all that were skilful to delight, and gratified with whatever the
                    senses can enjoy. They wandered in gardens of fragrance, and slept in the fortresses of security. Every art was practised to make them pleased with their
                    own condition. The sages who instructed them, told them of nothing but the
                    miseries of publick life, and described all
                    beyond the mountains as regions of ca-
                
            <pb n="17"/>
                
                    lamity, where discord was always raging, and where man preyed upon man.</p>
                
                <p>
                    To heighten their opinion of their
                    own felicity, they were daily entertained
                    with songs, the subject of which was the
                    happy valley. Their appetites were excited by frequent enumerations of different enjoyments, and revelry and merriment was the business of every hour from
                    the dawn of morning to the close of
                    even.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These methods were generally successful; few of the Princes had ever wished
                    to enlarge their bounds, but passed their
                    lives in full conviction that they had all
                    within their reach that art or nature could
                    bestow, and pitied those whom fate had
                    excluded from this feat of tranquility, as
                
            <pb n="18"/>
             
                    the sport of chance, and the slaves of misery.</p>
               
                <p>
                    Thus they rose in the morning and
                    lay down at night, pleased with each
                    other and with themselves, all but Rasselas, who, in the twenty-sixth year
                    of his age, began to withdraw himself
                    from their pastimes and assemblies, and
                    to delight in solitary walks and silent meditation. He often sat before tables co-
                    vered with luxury, and forgot to taste
                    the <ref target="dainties_" corresp="dainties">dainties</ref><note xml:id="dainties" target="dainties_">delicacies; treats</note>that were placed before him:
                    he rose abruptly in the midst of the song,
                    and hastily retired beyond the sound of
                    musick. His attendants observed the
                    change and endeavoured to renew his love
                    of pleasure: he neglected their officiousness, repulsed their invitations, and
                    spent day after day on the banks of ri-
                
            <pb n="19"/>
               
                    vulets sheltered with trees, where he
                    sometimes listened to the birds in the
                    branches, sometimes observed the fish
                    playing in the stream, and anon cast his
                    eyes upon the pastures and mountains
                    filled with animals, of which some were
                    biting the herbage, and some sleeping
                    among the bushes.</p>

                    him much observed. One of the Sages,
                    in whose conversation, he had formerly
                    delighted, followed him secretly, in hope
                    of discovering the cause of his disquiet.
                    Rasseas, who knew not that any one was
                    near him, having for some time fixed
                    his eyes upon the goats that were brousing among the rocks, began to compare
                    their condition with his own.

                    "What," said he, " makes the difference between man and all the rest of the
                    animal creation? Every beast that strays
                    beside me has the same corporal necessities with myself; he is hungry and crops
                    the grass, he is thirsty and drinks the
                    stream, his thirst and hunger are appeased, he is satisfied and sleeps; he rises
                    again and is hungry, he is again fed and
                    is at reft. I am hungry and thirsty like
                    him, but when thirst and hunger cease
                    I am not at rest; I am, like him, pained
                    with want, but am not, like him, satisfied with fulness. The intermediate
                    hours are tedious and gloomy; I long
                    again to be hungry that I may again
                    quicken my attention. The birds peck
                    the berries or the corn, and fly away to
                    the groves where they sit in seeming happiness on the branches, and waste their

                    lives in tuning one unvaried series of
                    sounds. I likewise can call the <ref target="lutanist_" corresp="lutanist">lutanist</ref><note xml:id="lutanist" target="lutanist_">lute-player</note>
                    and the singer, but the sounds that pleased
                    me yesterday weary me to day, and will
                    grow yet more wearisome to morrow. I
                    can discover within me no power of perception which is not glutted with its proper pleasure, yet I do not feel myself delighted. Man has surely some latent
                    sense for which this place affords no gratification, or he has some desires distinct
                    from sense which must be satisfied before
                    he can be happy."

                <p>
                    After this he lifted up his head, and
                    seeing the moon rising, walked towards
                    the palace. As he passed through the
                    fields, and saw the animals around him,
                    "Ye, said he, are happy, and need not
                    envy me that walk thus among you, bur-

                    thened with myself; nor do I, ye gentle
                    beings, envy your felicity; for it is not
                    the felicity of man. I have many distresses from which ye are free; I fear
                    pain when I do not feel it; I sometimes
                    shrink at evils recollected, and sometimes start at evils anticipated: surely
                    the equity of providence has ballanced
                    peculiar sufferings with peculiar enjoy-
                    ments."

                <p>
                    With observations like these the prince
                    amused himself as he returned, utering
                    them with a plaintive voice, yet with a
                    look that discovered him to feel some
                    complacence in his own perspicacity, and
                    to receive some solace of the miseries of
                    life, from consciousnes of the delicacy
                    with which he felt, and the eloquence
                    with which he bewailed them. He min-

                    gled cheerfully in the diversions of the

                    <p>ON the next day his old instructor,
                    imagining that he had now made
                    himself acquainted with his <ref target="disease_" corresp="disease">disease of

                    of conference, which the prince, having
                    long considered him as one whose intellects
                    were exhausted, was not very willing to
                    afford: "Why, said he, does this man
                    thus intrude upon me; shall I be never

                    suffered to forget those lectures which
                    please only while they were new, and to
                    become new again must be forgotten?"
                    He then walked into the wood, and composed himself to his usual meditations;
                    when before his thoughts had taken any
                    settled form, he perceived his persuer at
                    his side, and was at first prompted by his
                    impatience to go hastily away; but, being unwilling to offend a man whom he
                    had once reverenced and still loved, he
                    invited him to sit down with him on the
                    bank.</p>
                
                <p>
                    The old man, thus encouraged, be-
                    gan to lament the change which had been
                    lately observed in the prince, and to enquire why he so often retired from the
                    pleasures of the palace, to loneliness and
                    silence. "I fly from pleasure, said the
                
            <pb n="25"/>
                
                    prince, because pleasure has ceased to
                    please; I am lonely because I am miserable, and am unwilling to cloud with
                    my presence the happiness of others."
                    "You, Sir, said the sage, are the first
                    who has complained of misery in the happy valley. I hope to convince you that
                    your complaints have no real cause. You
                    are here in full possession of all that the
                    emperour of Abissinia can bestow; here
                    is neither labour to be endured nor danger to be dreaded, yet here is all that
                    labour or danger can procure or purchase.
                    Look round and tell me which of your
                    wants is without supply: if you want
                    nothing, how are you unhappy?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "That I want nothing, said the prince,
                    or that I know not what I want, is the
                    cause of my complaint; if I had any
               
            <pb n="26"/>
              
                    known want, I should have a certain wish;
                    that wish would excite endeavour, and
                    I should not then repine to see the sun
                    move so slowly towards the western mountain, or lament when the day breaks and
                    sleep will no longer hide me from myself.
                    When I see the <ref target="kids_" corresp="kids">kids</ref><note xml:id="kids" target="kids_">baby goats</note> and the lambs chasing one another, I fancy that I should be
                    happy if I had something to persue.
                    But, possessing all that I can want, I
                    find one day and one hour exactly like
                    another, except that the latter is still
                    more tedious than the former. Let your
                    experience inform me how the day may
                    now seem as short as in my childhood,
                    while nature was yet fresh, and every moment shewed me what I never had observed
                    before. I have already enjoyed too much;
                    give me something to desire."

                    The old man was surprized at this new
                    species of affliction, and knew not what
                    to reply, yet was unwilling to be silent.
                    "Sir, said he, if you had seen the miseries of the world, you would know
                    how to value your present state." "Now,
                    said the prince, you have given me some-
                    thing to desire; I shall long to see the
                    miseries of the world, since the sight of
                    them is necessary to happiness."

                    produced the only conclusion which they
                    were intended to prevent. But in the
                    decline of life shame and grief are of
                    short duration; whether it be that we
                    bear easily what we have born long, or
                    that, finding ourselves in age less regarded, we less regard others; or, that we
                    look with slight regard upon afflictions,
                    to which we know that the hand of death
                    is about to put an end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The prince, whose views were extended to a wider space, could not speedily
                    quiet his emotions. He had been before terrified at the length of life which
                    nature promised him, because he considered that in a long time much must be
                    endured; he now rejoiced in his youth, because in many years much might be
                    done.
                </p>
            <pb n="29"/>
                <p>
                    This first beam of hope, that had
                    been ever darted into his mind, rekindled
                    youth in his cheeks, and doubled the
                    lustre of his eyes. He was fired with
                    the desire of doing something, though
                    he knew not yet with distinctness, either
                    end or means.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He was now no longer gloomy and
                    unsocial; but, confidering himself as
                    master of a secret stock of happiness,
                    which he could enjoy only by concealing
                    it, he affected to be busy in all schemes
                    of diversion, and endeavoured to make
                    others pleased with the state of which he
                    himself was weary. But pleasures never can be so multiplied or continued,

                    as not to leave much of life unemployed;
                    there were many hours, both of the night
                    and day, which he could spend without
                    suspicion in solitary thought. The load
                    of life was much lightened: he went
                    eagerly into the assemblies, because he
                    supposed the frequency of his presence
                    necessary to the success of his purposes;
                    he retired gladly to privacy, because he
                    had now a subject of thought.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His chief amusement was to picture
                    to himself that world which he had never
                    seen; to place himself in various conditions; to be entangled in imaginary dif\ficulties, and to be engaged in wild adventures: but his benevolence always
                    terminated his projects in the relief of
                    distress, the detection of fraud, the de-
                
            <pb n="31"/>
                
                    feat of oppression, and the diffusion of
                    happiness.

                <p>
                    Thus passed twenty months of the life
                    of Rasselas. He busied himself so intensely in visionary bustle, that he forgot
                    his real solitude; and, amidst hourly
                    preparations for the various incidents of
                    human affairs, neglected to confider by
                    what means he should mingle with mankind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One day, as he was sitting on a bank,
                    he <ref target="feigned_" corresp="feigned">feigned to himself</ref><note xml:id="feigned" target="feigned_">imagined</note> an orphan virgin
                    robbed of her little portion by a treacherous lover, and crying after him for
                    restitution and redress. So strongly was
                    the image impressed upon his mind, that
                    he started up in the maid's defence, and
                    run forward to seize the plunderer with
                
            <pb n="32"/>
                
                    all the eagerness of real persuit. Fear
                    naturally quickens the flight of guilt.
                    Rasselas could not catch the fugitive with
                    his utmost efforts; but, resolving to weary, by perseverance, him whom he could

                    the foot of the mountain stopped his
                    course.

                <p>
                    Here he recollected himself, and smiled
                    at his own useless impetuosity. Then
                    raising his eyes to the mountain, "This,
                    said he, is the fatal obstacle that hinders
                    at once the enjoyment of pleasure, and
                    the exercise of virtue. How long is it
                    that my hopes and wishes have flown
                    beyond this boundary of my life, which
                    yet I never have attempted to surmount!

                <p>
                    Struck with this reflection, he sat
                    down to muse, and remembered, that
                    since he first resolved to escape from his
                    confinement, the sun had passed twice
                    over him in his annual course. He now
                    felt a degree of regret with which he had
                    never been before acquainted. He considered how much might have been done
                    in the time which had passed, and left
                    nothing real behind it. He compared
                    twenty months with the life of man.
                    "In life, said he, is not to be counted
                    the ignorance of infancy, or imbecility
                    of age. We are long before we are able
                    to think, and we soon cease from the
                    power of acting. The true period of
                    human existence may be reasonably estimated as forty years, of which I have
                    mused away <ref target="part_" corresp="part">the four and twentieth part</ref><note xml:id="part" target="part_">The language here is confusing. Earlier, Johnson writes that Rasselas was twenty-six. After spending twenty months musing, he would have to be at least twenty-seven by this point. Is Rasselas saying that he became cognizant of his thoughts at age three, or is this just an error on Johnson's part?</note>.
                    What I have lost was certain, for I have

                    certainly possessed it; but of twenty

                <p>
                    The consciousness of his own folly
                    pierced him deeply, and he was long before he could be reconciled to himself.
                    ''The rest of my time, said he, has
                    been lost by the crime or folly of my ancestors, and the absurd institutions of my
                    country; I remember it with disgust, yet
                    without remorse: but the months that
                    have passed since new light darted into
                    my soul, since I formed a scheme of reasonable felicity, have been squandered by
                    my own fault. I have lost that which
                    can never be restored: I have seen the
                    sun rise and set for twenty months, an
                    idle gazer on the light of heaven: In
                    this time the birds have left the nest of
                    their mother, and committed themselves

                    by degrees to climb the rocks in quest of
                    independant sustenance. I only have
                    made no advances, but am still helpless
                    and ignorant. The moon by more than
                    twenty changes, admonished me of the
                    flux of life; the stream that rolled before my feet upbraided my inactivity. I
                    sat feasting on intellecual luxury, regardless alike of the examples of the
                    earth, and the instructions of the planets. Twenty months are past, who
                    shall restore them!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    These sorrowful meditations fastened
                    upon his mind; he past four months
                    in resolving to lose no more time in idle
                    resolves, and was awakened to more
                    vigorous exertion by hearing a maid,

                    that what cannot be repaired is not to be
                    regretted.

                <p>
                    This was obvious; and Rasselas re-
                    proached himself that he had not disco-
                    vered it, having not known, or not con-
                    sidered, how many useful hints are ob-
                    tained by chance, and how often the
                    mind, hurried by her own ardour to dis-
                    tant views, neglects the truths that lie
                    open before her. He, for a few hours,
                    regretted his regret, and from that time
                    bent his whole mind upon the means of
                    escaping from the valley of happiness.

                    <p>He now found that it would be very
                    difficult to effect that which it was
                    very easy to suppose effected. When he
                    looked round about him, he saw himself confined by the bars of nature which
                    had never yet been broken, and by the
                    gate, through which none that once had
                    passed it were ever able to return. He
                    was now impatient as an eagle in a
                    grate. He passed week after week in
                    clambering the mountains, to see if there
                    was any aperture which the bushes might
                    conceal, but found all the summits inaccessible by their prominence. The iron
                
            <pb n="38"/>
              
                    gate he despaired to open; for it was not
                    only secured with all the power of art,
                    but was always watched by successive sentinels, and was by its position exposed
                    to the perpetual observation of all the inhabitants.

                    He then examined the cavern through
                    which the waters of the lake were discharged; and, looking down at a time
                    when the sun shone strongly upon its
                    mouth, he discovered it to be full of broken rocks, which, though they permitted
                    the stream to flow through many narrow
                    passages, would stop any body of solid
                    bulk. He returned discouraged and dejected; but, having now known the blessing of hope, resolved never to despair.

                <p>
                    In these fruitless searches he spent ten
                    months. The time, however, passed
                    chearfully away: in the morning he rose
                    with new hope, in the evening applauded his own diligence, and in the night
                    slept sound after his fatigue. He met a
                    thousand amusements which beguiled his
                    labour, and diversified his thoughts.
                    He discerned the various instincts of animals, and properties of plants, and found
                    the place replete with wonders, of which
                    he purposed to solace himself with the
                    contemplation, if he should never be
                    able to accomplish his flight; rejoicing
                    that his endeavours, though yet unsucessful, had supplied him with a source of
                    inexhaustible enquiry.

                    But his original curiosity was not yet
                    abated; he resolved to obtain some know-

                    ledge of the ways of men. His wish
                    still continued, but his hope grew less.
                    He ceased to survey any longer the walls
                    of his prison, and spared to search by new
                    toils for interstices which he knew could
                    not be found, yet determined to keep his
                    design always in view, and lay hold on
                    any expedient that time should offer.

                    <p>Among the artists that had
                    been allured into the happy valley, to labour for the accommodation and
                    pleasure of its inhabitants, was a man
                    eminent for his knowledge of the mechanick powers, who had contrived ma-
               
            <pb n="41"/>
                
                    ny engines both of use and recreation.
                    By a wheel, which the stream turned, he
                    forced the water into a tower, whence
                    it was distributed to all the apartments of
                    the palace. He erected a pavillion in the
                    garden, around which he kept the air
                    always cool by artificial showers. One
                    of the groves, appropriated to the ladies,
                    was ventilated by fans, to which the rivulet that run through it gave a constant
                    motion; and instruments of soft musick
                    were placed at proper distances, of which
                    some played by the impulse of the wind,
                    and some by the power of the stream.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This artist was sometimes visited by
                    Rasselas, who was pleased with every
                    kind of knowledge, imagining that the
                    time would come when all his acquisitions
                
            <pb n="42"/>
               
                    should be of use to him in the open world.
                    He came one day to amuse himself in his
                    usual manner, and found the master busy
                    in building a failing chariot: he saw
                    that the design was practicable upon a level surface, and with expressions of great
                    esteem solicited its completion. The
                    workman was pleased to find himself so
                    much regarded by the prince, and resolved to gain yet higher honours. "Sir,
                    said he, you have seen but a small part
                    of what the mechanick sciences can perform. I have been long of opinion, that,
                    instead of the tardy conveyance of ships
                    and chariots, man might use the swifter
                    migration of wings; that the fields of
                    air are open to knowledge; and that only ignorance and idleness need crawl upon
                    the ground."
                </p>
           
            <pb n="43"/>
                <p>
                    This hint rekindled the prince's desire
                    of passing the mountains; having seen
                    what the mechanist had already performed, he was willing to fancy that he
                    could do more; yet resolved to enquire
                    further before he suffered hope to afflict
                    him by disappointment. "I am afraid,
                    said he to the artist, that your imagination prevails over your skill, and that
                    you now tell me rather what you wish
                    than what you know. Every animal has
                    his element assigned him; the birds have
                    the air, and man and beasts the earth."
                    "So, replied the mechanist, fishes have
                    the water, in which yet beasts can swim
                    by nature, and men by art. He that can
                    swim needs not despair to fly: to swim is
                    to fly in a grosser fluid, and to fly is to
                    swim in a subtler. We are only to proportion our power of resistance to the
                
            <pb n="44"/>
          
                    different density of the matter through
                    which we are to pass. You will be necessarily upborn by the air, if you can
                    renew any impulse upon it, faster than the
                    air can recede from the pressure."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "But the exercise of swimming, said
                    the prince, is very laborious; the strong-est limbs are soon wearied; I am afraid
                    the act of flying will be yet more violent,
                    and wings will be of no great use,
                    unless we can fly further than we can
                    swim."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "The labour of rising from the
                    ground, said the artist, will be great, as
                    we see it in the heavier domestick fowls;
                    but, as we mount higher, the earth's attraction, and the body's gravity, will be gra-
                    dually diminished, till we shall arrive at
               
            <pb n="45"/>
                
                    a region where the man will float in
                    the air without any tendency to fall: no
                    care will then be necessary, but to move
                    forwards, which the gentlest impulse
                    will effect. You, Sir, whose curiosity
                    is so extensive, will easily conceive with
                    what pleasure a philosopher, furnished
                    with wings, and hovering in the sky, would
                    see the earth, and all it's inhabitants, rolling beneath him, and presenting to
                    him successively, by it's diurnal motion,
                    all the countries within the same parallel.
                    How must it amuse the pendent spectator to see the moving scene of land and
                    ocean, cities and desarts! To survey
                    with equal security the marts of trade,
                    and the fields of battle; mountains infested by barbarians, and fruitful regions
                    gladdened by plenty, and lulled by
                    peace! How easily shall we then trace

                <p>
                    "All this, said the prince, is much to
                    be desired, but I am afraid that no man
                    will be able to breathe in these regions of
                    speculation and tranquility. I have been

                    lofty mountains, yet from these precipices, though so high as to produce great

                    therefore I suspect, that from any height,

                    the folding continuity of the bat's wings
                    most easily accomodated to the human
                    form. Upon this model I shall begin
                    my task to morrow, and in a year expect
                    to tower into the air beyond the malice or
                    persuit of man. But I will work only
                    on this condition, that the art shall not
                    be divulged, and that you shall not require me to make wings for any but
                    ourselves."

                    "Why, said Rasselas, should you envy others so great an advantage? All
                    skill ought to be exerted for universal
                    good; every man has owed much to
                    others, and ought to repay the kindness
                    that he has received."

                    the artist, 1 should with great alacrity
                    teach them all to fly. But what would
                    be the security of the good, if the bad
                    could at pleasure invade them from the
                    sky? Against an army sailing through
                    the clouds neither walls, nor mountains,
                    nor seas, could afford any security. A
                    flight of northern savages might hover
                    in the wind, and light at once with irresistible violence, upon the capital of a
                    fruitful region that was rolling under
                    them. Even this valley, the retreat of
                    princes, the abode of happiness, might
                    be violated by the sudden descent of some
                    of the naked nations that swarm on the

                    time to time, observed its progress, and
                    remarked many ingenious contrivances to
                    facilitate motion, and unite levity with
                    strength. The artist was every day
                    more certain that he should leave vultures and eagles behind him, and the
                    contagion of his confidence seized upon

                    on a morning appointed, the maker appeared furnished for flight on a little
                    promontory: he waved his pinions a
                    while to gather air, then leaped from
                    his stand, and in an instant dropped into
                    the lake. His wings, which were of no
                    use in the air, sustained him in the water,
                    and the prince drew him to land, half
                    dead with terrour and vexation.

                    The prince was not much afflicted
                    by this disaster, having suffered
                    himself to hope for a happier event, only because he had no other means of escape
                    in view. He still persisted in his design
                    to leave the happy valley by the first

                    His imagination was now at a stand;
                    he had no prospect of entering into the
                    world; and, notwithstanding all his endeavours to support himself, discontent
                    by degrees preyed upon him, and he began again to lose his thoughts in sadness

                    countries is periodical, made it inconvenient to wander in the woods.

                    The rain continued longer and with
                    more violence than had been ever known:
                    the clouds broke on the surrounding
                    mountains, and the torrents streamed in to the plain on every side, till the cavern was too narrow to discharge the water. The lake overflowed its banks, and
                    all the level of the valley was covered
                    with the inundation. The eminence, on
                    which the palace was built, and some
                    other spots of rising ground, were all that
                    the eye could now discover. The herds
                    and flocks left the pastures, and both
                    the wild beasts and the tame retreated to
                    the mountains.

                    This inundation confined all the princes to domestick amusements, and the
                    attention of Rasselas was particularly
                    seized by a poem, which Imlac rehearsed upon the various conditions of
                    humanity. He commanded the poet
                    to attend him in his apartment, and recite his verses a second time; then
                    entering into familiar talk, he thought
                    himself happy in having found a man
                    who knew the world so well, and could
                    so skilfully paint the scenes of life. He
                    asked a thousand questions about things,
                    to which, though common to all other
                    mortals, his confinement from childhood
                    had kept him a stranger. The poet pitied his ignorance, and loved his curiosity, and entertained him from day to
                    day with novelty and instruction, so that
                    the prince regretted the necessity of sleep,

                    As they were sitting together, the
                    prince commanded Imlac to relate
                    his history, and to tell by what accident
                    he was forced, or by what motive
                    induced, to close his life in the happy valley. As he was going to begin
                    his narrative, Rasselas was called to a
                    concert, and obliged to restrain his curiosity till the evening.

                    musick ceased, and the princesses retired.
                    Rasselas then called for his companion and
                    required him to begin the story of his

                    "Sir, said Imlac, my history will
                    not be long: the life that is devoted
                    to knowledge pases silently away, and
                    is very little diversified by events. To
                    talk in publick, to think in solitude, to
                    read and to hear, to inquire, and answer
                    inquiries, is the business of a scholar.

                    "Surely, said the prince, my father

                    the natural effect of virtue animated
                    by youth: the time will come when you,
                    will acquit your father, and perhaps hear
                    with less impatience of the governour.
                    Oppression is, in the Abissinian dominions,
                    neither frequent nor tolerated; but no
                    form of government has been yet discovered; by which cruelty can be wholly prevented. Subordination supposes
                    power on one part and subjection on the
                    other; and if power be in the hands
                    of men, it will sometimes be abused.
                    The vigilance of the supreme magistrate
                    may do much, but much will still remain undone. He can never know all

                    education, than such as might qualify
                    me for commerce; and discovering in
                    me great strength of memory, and quickness of apprehension, often declared his
                    hope that I should be some time the richest man in Abissinia."

                    cannot both be right, but, imputed to
                    man, they may both be true. Yet diversity is not inconsistency. My father
                    might expect a time of greater security.
                    However, some desire is necessary to
                    keep life in motion, and he, whose real
                    wants are supplied, must admit those of

                    I was twenty years old before his tenderness would expose me to the fatigue of
                    travel, in which time I had been instructed, by successive matters, in all the literature of my native country. As every
                    hour taught me something new, I lived
                    in a continual course of gratifications;
                    but, as I advanced towards manhood,
                    1 lost much of the reverence with which I
                    had been used to look on my instructors;
                    because, when the lesson was ended, I did
                    not find them wiser or better than common men.

                    seeing the manners of other nations,

                    to some other country. I had no motives

                    sufficient for me that, wherever I wandered, I should see a country which I

                    of land, I looked round about me with
                    pleasing terrour, and thinking my soul
                    enlarged by the boundless prospect, imagined that I could gaze round for ever
                    without satiety; but, in a short time, I
                    grew weary of looking on barren uniformity, where I could only see again
                    what I had already seen. I then descended into the ship, and doubted for a while
                    whether all my future pleasures would not
                    end like this in disgust and disappoint-

                    and the land are very different; the only
                    variety of water is rest and motion, but
                    the earth has mountains and vallies, desarts and cities: it is inhabited by men
                    of different customs and contrary opinions ; and I may hope to find variety in
                    life, though I should miss it in nature.

                    sometimes by learning from the sailors
                    the art of navigation, which I have never practiced, and sometimes by forming

                    <p>WHEREVER I went, I foundthat Poetry was considered as the
                    highest learning, and regarded with a veneration somewhat approaching to that
                    which man would pay to the Angelick
                    Nature. And it yet fills me with wonder, that, in almost all countries, the
                    most ancient poets are considered as the
                    best: whether it be that every other
                    kind of knowledge is an acquisition
                    gradually attained, and poetry is a gift
                    conferred at once; or that the first
                    poetry of every nation surprised them as

                 novelty, and retained the credit by consent which it received by accident at first:
                    or whether, as the province of poetry is
                    to describe Nature and Passion, which
                    are always the same, the first writers took
                    possession of the most striking objects for
                    description, and the most probable occurrences for fiction, and left nothing to
                    those that followed them, but transcription of the same events, and new combinations of the same images. Whatever
                    be the reason, it is commonly observed that
                    the early writers are in possession of nature,
                    and their followers of art: that the first
                    excel in strength and invention, and the
                    latter in elegance and refinement.</p>

                    "I was desirous to add my name to this

                    I soon found that no man was ever great
                    by imitation. My desire of excellence
                    impelled me to transfer my attention to
                    nature and to life. Nature was to be
                    my subject, and men to be my auditors:
                    I could never describe what I had not
                    seen: I could not hope to move those
                    with delight or terrour, whose interests

                    everything with a new purpose; my sphere
                    of attention was suddenly magnified: no
                    kind of knowledge was to be overlooked.
                    I ranged mountains and deserts for images
                    and resemblances, and pictured upon my
                    mind every tree of the forest and flower
                    of the valley. I observed with equal

                    and sometimes watched the changes of the
                    summer clouds. To a poet nothing can be
                    useless. Whatever is beautiful, and whatever is dreadful, must be familiar to his
                    imagination: he must be conversant with
                    all that is awfully vast or elegantly little. The plants of the garden, the animals of the wood, the minerals of the
                    earth, and meteors of the sky, must all
                    concur to store his mind with inexhaustible variety : for every idea is useful for
                    the inforcement or decoration of moral or
                    religious truth; and he, who knows most,
                    will have most power of diversifying his
                    scenes, and of gratifying his reader with

                    you must surely have left much unob-
                    served. I have lived, till now, within
                    the circuit of these mountains, and yet
                    cannot walk abroad without the sight of
                    something which I had never beheld before, or never heeded."

                    "The business of a poet, said Imlac, is to examine, not the individual,
                    but the species; to remark general properties and large appearances: he does
                    not number the streaks of the tulip, or
                    describe the different shades in the ver-

                    portraits of nature such prominent and
                    striking features, as recal the original to
                    every mind; and must neglect the
                    minuter discriminations, which one may
                    have remarked, and another have neglected, for those characteristicks which are
                    alike obvious to vigilance and carelesness.

                    His character requires that he estimate the
                    happiness and misery of every condition;
                    observe the power of all the passions in all
                    their combinations, and trace the changes

                    decrepitude. He must divest himself of
                    the prejudices of his age or country; he
                    must consider right and wrong in their
                    abstracted and invariable state; he must
                    disregard present laws and opinions,
                    and rise to general and transcendental
                    truths, which will always be the fame:
                    he must therefore content himself with
                    the flow progress of his name; contemn the applause of his own time,
                    and commit his claims to the justice of posterity. He must write as the interpreter
                    of nature, and the legislator of mankind,
                    and consider himself as presiding over
                    the thoughts and manners of future

                    and all knowledge; whose armies are irresistible, and whose fleets command the

                    compared these men with the natives of
                    our own kingdom, and those that surround us, they appeared almost another
                    order of beings. In their countries it is
                    cificult to wish for any thing that may
                    not be obtained: a thousand arts, of

                    "By what means, said the prince, are
                    the Europeans thus powerful? or why,
                    since they can so easily visit Asia and Africa for trade or conquest, cannot the
                    Asiaticks and Africans invade their coasts,
                    plant colonies in their ports, and give
                    laws to their natural princes? The same

                    "They are more powerful, Sir, than
                    we, answered Imlac, because they are
                    wiser; knowledge will always predominate over ignorance, as man governs the
                    other animals. But why their knowledge is more than ours, I know not what
               
            <pb n="81"/>
              
                    reason can be given, but the unsearchable
                    will of the Supreme Being."

                <p>
                    "When, said the prince with a sigh,
                    shall I be able to visit Palestine, and mingle with this mighty confluence of nations? Till that happy moment shall
                    arrive, let me fill up the time with such
                    representations as thou canst give me. I
                    am not ignorant of the motive that assembles such numbers in that place, and
                    cannot but consider it as the center of
                    wisdom and piety, to which the best and
                    wisest men of every land must be continually resorting."

                    "There are some nations, said Imlac,
                    that send few visitants to Palestine; for,
                    many numerous and learned sects in
                    Europe, concur to censure pilgrimage
                
            <pb n="82"/>
               
                    as superstitious, or deride it as ridiculous."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "You know, said the prince, how
                    little my life has made me acquainted
                    with diversity of opinions: it will be too
                    long to hear the arguments on both
                    sides; you, that have considered them,
                    tell me the result."

                <p>
                    Pilgrimage, said Imlac, like many
                    other acts of piety, may be reasonable
                    or superstious, according to the principles upon which it is performed. Long
                    journies in search of truth are not com manded. Truth, such as is necessary to
                    the regulation of life, is always found
                    where it is honestly sought. Change of
                    place is no natural cause of the increase
                    of piety, for it inevitably produces dis-
                
            <pb n="83"/>
              
                    sipation of mind. Yet, since men go
                    every day to view the fields where great
                    actions have been performed, and return
                    with stronger impressions of the event,
                    curiosity of the fame kind may naturally
                    dispose us to view that country whence
                    our religion had its beginning; and I
                    believe no man surveys those awful scenes
                    without some confirmation of holy resolutions. That the Supreme Being may
                    be more easily propitiated in one place
                    than in another, is the dream of idle
                    superstition; but that some places may
                    operate upon our own minds in an uncommon manner, is an opinion which
                    hourly experience will justify. He who
                    supposes that his vices may be more successfully combated in Palestine, will,
                    perhaps, find himself mistaken, yet he
                    may go thither without folly: he who
              
            <pb n="84"/>
                    thinks they will be more freely pardoned, dishonours at once his reason and
                    religion."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "These, said the prince, are European distintions. I will consider them
                    another time. What have you found to
                    be the effect of knowledge? Are those
                    nations happier than we?"

                <p>
                    "There is so much infelicity, said the
                    poet, in the world, that scarce any man
                    has leisure from his own distresses to estimate the comparative happiness of others.
                    Knowledge is certainly one of the means
                    of pleasure, as is confessed by the natural desire which every mind feels of
                    increaring its ideas. Ignorance is mere
                    privation, by which nothing can be produced: it is a vacuity in which the soul
                    fits motionless and torpid for want of at-
                
            <pb n="85"/>
              
                    traction; and, without knowing why, we
                    always rejoice when we learn, and grieve
                    when we forget. I am therefore inclined to
                    conclude, that, if nothing counteracts the
                    natural consequence of learning, we grow
                    more happy as our minds take a wider

                    languish and perish. We suffer inclemencies of weather which they can obviate. They have engines for the despatch
                    of many laborious works, which we

            <p>I AM not yet willing, said the prince,
                    I to suppose that happiness is so parsimoniously distributed to mortals; nor
                    can believe but that, if I had the choice
                    of life, I should be able to fill every day
                    with pleasure. I would injure no man,
                    and should provoke no resentment: I
                    would relieve every distress, and should
                    enjoy the benedictions of gratitude. I
                    would choose my friends among the wise,
                    and my wife among the virtuous; and
                    therefore should be, in no danger from
                    treachery, or unkindness. My children
                    should, by my care, be learned and pious,

                    and would repay to my age what their
                    childhood had received. What would
                    dare to molest him who might call on
                    every side to thousands enriched by
                    his bounty, or assisted by his power?
                    And why should not life glide quietly
                    away in the soft reciprocation of protection and reverence? All this may be
                    done without the help of European refinements, which appear by their effects
                    to be rather specious than useful. Let

                    moment as wasted which did not bring
                    me nearer to Abissinia. I hastened into
                    Egypt, and, notwithstanding my impatience, was detained ten months in the contemplation of its ancient magnificence, and
                    in enquiries after the remains of its ancient
                    learning. I found in <placeName type="tgn" key="7001215">Cairo</placeName> a mixture of
                    all nations; some brought thither by the

                    after their own manner without observation, and of lying hid in the obscurity of
                    multitudes: for, in a city, populous as
                    Cairo, it is possible to obtain at the same
                    time the gratifications of society, and
                    the secrecy of solitude.

                    and embarked on the Red Sea, passing along the coast till I arrived at the port
                    from which I had departed twenty years
                    before. Here I joined myself to a caravan and re-entered my native country.

                    But I was soon convinced that my thoughts
                    were vain. My father had been dead
                    fourteen years, having divided his wealth
                    among my brothers, who were removed
                    to some other provinces. Of my companions the greater part was in the grave,
                    of the rest some could with difficulty remember me, and some considered me as

                    kingdom: they admitted me to their tables, heard my story, and dismissed me.

                    longer on the opinion or caprice of others.
                    I waited for the time when the gate of
                    the happy valley should open that I might
                    bid farewell to hope and fear: the day

                    speak the truth: I know not one of all
                    your attendants who does not lament the
                    hour when he entered this retreat. I am
                    less unhappy than the rest, because I have
                    a mind replete with images, which I can
                    vary and combine at pleasure. I can
                    amuse my solitude by the renovation of
                    the knowledge which begins to fade from
                    my memory, and by recollection of the
                    accidents of my past life. Yet all this
                    ends in the sorrowful consideration, that
                    my acquirements are now useless, and
                    that none of my pleasures can be again

                    no impression but of the present moment,
                    are either corroded by malignant passions,
                    or sit stupid in the gloom of perpetual
                    vacancy."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "What passions can infest those, said
                    the prince, who have no rivals? We
                    are in a place where impotence precludes
                    malice, and where all envy is repressed
                    by community of enjoyments."

                    "There may be community, said Imlac, of material possessions, but there can
                    never be community of love or of esteem.
                    It must happen that one will please more
                    than another; he that knows himself despised will always be envious; and still
                    more envious and malevolent, if he is

                    who despise him. The invitations, by
                    which they allure others to a state which
                    they feel to be wretched, proceed from
                    the natural malignity of hopeless misery.
                    They are weary of themselves, and of
                    each other, and expect to find relief in
                    new companions. They envy the liberty which their folly has forfeited, and
                    would gladly see all mankind imprisoned
                    like themselves.

                    "From this crime, however, I am
                    wholly free. No man can say that he is
                    wretched by my persuasion. I look with
                    pity on the crowds who are annually soliciting admission to captivity, and wish
                    that it were lawful for me to warn them

                    My dear Imlac, said the prince, I
                    will open to thee my whole heart. I
                    have long meditated an escape from the
                    happy valley. I have examined the
                    mountains on every side, but find myself
                    insuperably barred: teach me the way
                    to break my prison; thou shalt be the
                    companion of my flight, the guide of
                    my rambles, the partner of my fortune,
                    and my sole director in the choice of

                    will be difficult, and, perhaps, you may
                    soon repent your curiosity. The world,
                    which you figure to yourself smooth and
                    quiet as the lake in the valley, you will
                    find a sea foaming with tempests, and
                    boiling with whirlpools: you will be
                    sometimes overwhelmed by the waves of

                    violence, and sometimes dashed against
                    the rocks of treachery. Amidst wrongs
                    and frauds, competitions and anxieties,
                    you will wish a thousand times for these
                    feats of quiet, and willingly quit hope
                    to be free from fear."

                    to see what thou hast seen; and, since thou
                    art thyself weary of the valley, it is evident, that thy former state was better than
                    this. Whatever be the consequence of
                    my experiment, I am resolved to judge
                    with my own eyes of the various conditions of men, and then to make deliberately my choice of life."

                    <p>THE prince now dismissed his favourite to rest, but the narrative
                    of wonders and novelties filled his
                    mind with perturbation. He revolved
                    all that he had heard, and prepared innumerable questions for the morning.

                <p>
                    Much of his uneasiness was now removed. He had a friend to whom he

                    could impart his thoughts, and whose
                    experience could assist him in his designs.
                    His heart was no longer condemned to
                    swell with silent vexation. He thought
                    that even the happy valley might be endured
                    with such a companion, and that, if they
                    could range the world together, he should
                    have nothing further to desire.

                    In a few days the water was discharged,
                    and the ground dried. The prince and
                    Imlac then walked out together to converse without the notice of the rest. The
                    prince, whose thoughts were always on
                    the wing, as he passed by the gate, said,
                    with a countenance of sorrow, "Why
                    art thou so strong, and why is man so
                    weak?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Man is not weak, answered his companion; knowledge is more than equivalent to force. The master of mechanicks laughs at strength. I can burst the
                    gate, but cannot do it secretly. Some
                    other expedient must be tried."
                </p>
                <p>
                    As they were walking on the side of
                    the mountain, they observed that the
                    <ref target="conies_" corresp="conies">conies</ref><note xml:id="conies" target="conies_">Rabbits or hares.</note>, which the rain had driven from
                    their burrows, had taken shelter among
                    the bushes, and formed holes behind
                    them, tending upwards in an oblique
                    line. "It has been the opinion of antiquity, said Imlac, that human reason
                    borrowed many arts from the instinct
                    of animals; let us, therefore, not think
                    ourselves degraded by learning from the
                    coney. We may escape by piercing the
                    mountain in the same direction. We

                    will begin where the summit hangs over
                    the middle part, and labour upward till
                    we shall issue out beyond the prominence."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The eyes of the prince, when he heard
                    this proposal, sparkled with joy. The
                    execution was easy, and the success certain.

                <p>
                    No time was now lost. They hastened early in the morning to chuse a place
                    proper for their mine. They clam-
                    bered with great fatigue among crags
                    and brambles, and returned without having discovered any part that favoured
                    their design. The second and the third
                    day were spent in the same manner, and
                    with the same frustration. But, on the
                    fourth, they found a small cavern, con-

                    cealed by a thicket, where they resolved
                    to make their experiment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Imlac procured instruments proper to
                    hew stone and remove earth, and they
                    fell to their work on the next day with
                    more eagerness than vigour. They were
                    presently exhausted by their efforts, and
                    sat down to pant upon the grass. The
                    prince, for a moment, appeared to be
                    discouraged. "Sir, said his companion,
                    practice will enable us to continue our labour for a longer time; mark, however,
                    how far we have advanced, and you will
                    find that our toil will some time have an

                    They returned to their work day after day, and, in a short time, found a
                    fissure in the rock, which enabled them to
                    pass far with very little obstruction. This
                    Rasselas confidered as a good omen.
                    "Do not disturb your mind, said Imlac,
                    with other hopes or fears than reason
                    may suggest: if you are pleased with
                    prognosticks of good, you will be terrified likewise with tokens of evil, and
                    your whole life will be a prey to superstition. Whatever facilitates our work
                    is more than an omen, it is a cause of
                    success. This is one of those pleasing
                    surprises which often happen to active
                    resolution. Many things difficult to design prove easy to performance."

            <p>THEY had now wrought their way
                to the middle, and solaced their
                    toil with the approach of liberty, when
                    the prince, coming down to refresh himself with air, found his sister Nekayah
                    standing before the mouth of the cavity.
                    He started and stood confused, afraid to
                    tell his design, and yet hopeless to conceal it. A few moments determined him
                    to repose on her fidelity, and secure her
                    secrecy by a declaration without reserve.</p>
                
                <p>
                    "Do not imagine, said the princess,
                    that I came hither as a spy: I had long
                    observed from my window, that you and

                    Imlac directed your walk every day towards the same point, but I did not sup-
                    pose you had any better reason for the
                    preference than a cooler shade, or more
                    fragrant bank; nor followed you with
                    any other design than to partake of your
                    conversation. Since then not suspicion
                    but fondness has detected you, let me
                    not lose the advantage of my discovery.
                    I am equally weary of confinement with
                    yourself, and not less desirous of knowing what is done or suffered in the world,
                    Permit me to fly with you from this
                    tasteless tranquility, which will yet grow
                    more loathsome when you have left me.
                    You may deny me to accompany you,
                    but cannot hinder me from following."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The prince, who loved Nekayah above
                    his other sisters, had no inclination to
                </p>
               
           
            <pb n="106"/>
                <p>
                    refuse her request, and grieved that he
                    had lost an opportunity of shewing his
                    confidence by a voluntary communication. It was therefore agreed that she
                    should leave the valley with them; and
                    that, in the mean time, she should watch,
                    lest any other straggler should, by chance
                    or curiosity, follow them to the mountain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At length their labour was at an end;
                    they saw light beyond the prominence,
                    and, issuing to the top of the mountain,
                    beheld the Nile, yet a narrow current,
                    wandering beneath them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The prince looked round with rapture,
                    anticipated all the pleasures of travel,
                    and in thought was already transported
                    beyond his father's dominions. Imlac,

                <p>
                    though very joyful at his escape, had
                    less expectation of pleasure in the world,
                    which he had before tried, and of which
                    he had been weary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rasselas was so much delighted with
                    a wider horizon, that he could not soon
                    be persuaded to return into the valley.
                    He informed his sister that the way was
                    open, and that nothing now remained
                    but to prepare for their departure.

                    <p>THE prince and princess had jewels sufficient to make them rich whenever they came into a place of commerce,
                    which, by Imlac's direction, they hid in
                    their cloaths, and, on the night of the
                    next full moon, all left the valley. The
                    princess was followed only by a single favourite, who did not know whither she
                    was going.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They clambered through the cavity,
                    and began to go down on the other side.
                    The princess and her maid turned their

                    eyes towards every part, and, seeing nothing to bound their prospect, considered
                    themselves as in danger of being lost in
                    a dreary vacuity. They stopped and
                    trembled. "I am almost afraid, said the
                    princess, to begin a journey of which I
                    cannot perceive an end, and to venture
                    into this immense plain where I may be
                    approached on every side by men whom
                    I never saw." The prince felt nearly the
                    same emotions, though he thought it
                    more manly to conceal them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Imlac smiled at their terrours, and
                    encouraged them to proceed; but the
                    princess continued irresolute till she had
                    been imperceptibly drawn forward too
                    far to return.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the morning they found some shepherds in the field, who set milk and fruits
                    before them. The princess wondered
                    that she did not see a palace ready for her
                    reception, and a table spread with delicacies; but, being faint and hungry,
                    she drank the milk and eat the fruits,
                    and thought them of a higher flavour
                    than the products of the valley.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They travelled forward by easy journeys, being all unaccustomed to toil or
                    difficulty, and knowing, that though
                    they might be missed, they could not
                    be persued. In a few days they came into a more populous region, where Imlac
                    was diverted with the admiration which
                    his companions expressed at the diversity
                    of manners, stations and employments.

                    Their dress was such as might not bring
                    upon them the suspicion of having any
                    thing to conceal, yet the prince, where.
                    ever he came, expected to be obeyed,
                    and the princess was frighted, because
                    those that came into her presence did not
                    prostrate themselves before her. Imlac
                    was forced to observe them with great
                    vigilance, lest they should betray their
                    rank by their unusual behaviour, and
                    detained them several weeks in the first
                    village to accustom them to the sight of
                    common mortals.

                <p>
                    By degrees the royal wanderers were
                    taught to understand that they had for a
                    time laid aside their dignity, and were to
                    expect only such regard as liberality and
                    courtesy could procure. And Imlac, having, by many admonitions, prepared them
                </p>
              
          
            <pb n="112"/>

                    to endure the tumults of a port, and the
                    ruggedness of the commercial race,
                    brought them down to the sea-coast.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The prince and his sister, to whom
                    every thing was new, were gratified
                    equally at all places, and therefore remained for some months at the port
                    without any inclination to pass further.
                    Imlac was content with their stay, because he did not think it safe to ex-
                    pose them, unpracticed in the world, to
                    the hazards of a foreign country.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At last he began to fear lest they
                    should be discovered, and proposed to fix.
                    a day for their departure. They had no
                    pretensions to judge for themselves, and.
                    referred the whole scheme to his direction,
                    He therefore took passage in a ship to

                    Suez; and, when the time came, with
                    great difficulty prevailed on the princess
                    to enter the vessel. They had a quick
                    and prosperous voyage, and from Suez
                    travelled by land to Cairo.

                    that we are rich; our reputation will
                    procure us access to all whom we shall
                    desire to know; you will see all the
                    conditions of humanity, and enable
                    yourself at leisure to make your choice of
                    life."

                <p>
                    They now entered the town, stunned
                    by the noise, and offended by the crowds.
                    Instruction had not yet so prevailed over
                    habit, but that they wondered to see
                    themselves pass undistinguished along the
                    street, and met by the lowest of the
                    people without reverence or notice. The
                    princess could not at first bear the
                    thought of being levelled with the vulgar, and, for some days, continued in

                    her chamber, where she was served by
                    her favourite Pekuah as in the palace of

                    Imlac, who understood traffick, sold
                    part of the jewels the next day, and hired
                    a house, which he adorned with such magnificence, that he was immediately considered as a merchant of great wealth.
                    His politeness attracted many acquaintance, and his generosity made him
                    courted by many dependants. His table was crowded by men of every nation, who all admired his knowledge,
                    and solicited his favour. His companions, not being able to mix in the con-
                    versation, could make no discovery of
                    their ignorance or surprise, and were gradually initiated in the world as they gained knowledge of the language.

                    The prince had, by frequent lectures,
                    been taught the use and nature of money;
                    but the ladies could not, for a long time,
                    comprehend what the merchants did with
                    small pieces of gold and silver, or why
                    things of so little use should be received
                    as equivalent to the necessaries of life.

                    They studied the language two years,

                    them the various ranks and conditions
                    of mankind. He grew acquainted with all
                    who had any thing uncommon in their
                    fortune or conduct. He frequented the
                    voluptuous and the frugal, the idle and,
                    the busy, the merchants and the men
                    of learning.

                    The prince, being now able to con-
                    verse with fluency, and having learned

                    the caution necessary to be observed in
                    his intercourse with strangers, began to
                    accompany Imlac to places of resort, and
                    to enter into all assemblies, that he might
                    make his choice of life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For some time he thought choice need-
                    less, because all appeared to him equally
                    happy. Wherever he went he met gayety and kindness, and heard the song of
                    joy, or the laugh of carelesness. He
                    began to believe that the world over-
                    flowed with universal plenty, and that
                    nothing was withheld either from want
                    or merit; that every hand showered liberality, and every heart melted with benevolence: "and who then, says he, will
                    be suffered to be wretched ?"

                    Imlac permitted the pleasing delusion,
                    and was unwilling to crush the hope of
                    inexperience; till one day, having sat a
                    while silent, "I know not, said the
                    prince, what can be the reason that I
                    am more unhappy than any of our friends
                    I see them perpetually and unalterably
                    chearful, but feel my own mind restless
                    and uneasy. I am unsatisfied with those
                    pleasures which I seem most to court;
                    I live in the crowds of jollity, not so
                    much to enjoy company as to shun
                    myself, and am only loud and merry to
                    conceal my sadness."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every man, said Imlac, may, by
                    examining his own mind, guess what
                    passes in the minds of others: when you
                    feel that your own gaiety is counterfeit, it
                    may justly lead you to suspect that of your
                </p>

                <p>
                    companions not to be sincere. Envy is commonly reciprocal. We are long before we
                    are convinced that happiness is never to be
                    found, and each believes it possessed by others, to keep alive the hope of obtaining
                    it for himself. In the assembly, where you
                    passed the last night, there appeared such
                    spriteliness of air, and volatility of fancy,
                    as might have suited beings of an higher
                    order, formed to inhabit serener regions
                    inaccessible to care or sorrow: yet, believe me, prince, there was not one who
                    did not dread the moment when solitude
                    should deliver him to the tyranny of
                    reflection."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "This, said the prince, may be true
                    of others, since it is true of me; yet,
                    whatever be the general infelicity of man,
                    one condition is more happy than ano-

                    ther, and wisdom surely directs us to take
                    the least evil in the choice of life."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "The causes of good and evil, answered Imlac, are so various and uncertain, so often entangled with each
                    other, so diversified by various relations, and so much subject to accidents,
                    which cannot be foreseen, that he who
                    would fix his condition upon incontestable reasons of preference, must live
                    and die inquiring and deliberating."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "But surely, said Rasselas, the wise
                    men, to whom we listen with reverence
                    and wonder, chose that mode of life for
                    themselves which they thought most likely to make them happy."

                    "Very few, said the poet, live by
                    choice. Every man is placed in his present condition by causes which acted without his foresight, and with which he did
                    not always willingly co-operate; and
                    therefore you will rarely meet one who
                    does not think the lot of his neighbour
                    better than his own."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I am pleased to think, said the prince,
                    that my birth has given me at least one
                    advantage over others, by enabling me
                    to determine for myself. I have here the
                    world before me; I will review it at leisure: surely happiness is somewhere to be
                    found."

                    <p>RASSELAS rose next day, and resolved to begin his experiments upon
                    life. "Youth, cried he, is the time of
                    gladness: I will join myself to the young
                    men, whose only business is to gratify
                    their desires, and whose time is all spent
                    in a succession of enjoyments."
                </p>
                <p>
                    To such societies he was readily admitted, but a few days brought him
                    back weary and disgusted. Their mirth
                    was without images, their laughter with-
                </p>
              
          
            <pb n="123"/>
                <p>
                    out motive; their pleasures were gross
                    and sensual, in which the mind had no
                    part; their conduct was at once wild and
                    mean; they laughed at order and at law,
                    but the frown of power dejected, and the
                    eye of wisdom abashed them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The prince soon concluded, that he
                    should never be happy in a course of life
                    of which he was ashamed. He thought
                    it unsuitable to a reasonable being to act
                    without a plan, and to be sad or chearful only by chance. "Happiness, said
                    he, must be something solid and permanent, without fear and without uncertainty."
                </p>
                <p>
                    But his young companions had gained
                    so much of his regard by their frankness
                    and courtesy, that he could not leave them

            <pb n="124"/>
                <p>
                    without warning and remonstrance. "My
                    friends, said he, I have seriously considered our manners and our prospects,
                    and find that we have mistaken our own
                    interest. The first years of man must
                    make provision for the last. He that
                    never thinks never can be wise. Perpetual levity must end in ignorance; and
                    intemperance, though it may fire the spirits for an hour, will make life short or
                    miserable. Let us consider that youth is
                    of no long duration, and that in maturer
                    age, when the enchantments of fancy
                    shall cease, and phantoms of delight
                    dance no more about us, we shall have no
                    comforts but the esteem of wise men,
                    and the means of doing good. Let us,
                    therefore, stop, while to stop is in our
                    power: let us live as men who are sometime to grow old, and to whom it will

                    be the most dreadful of all evils not
                    to count their past years but by follies,
                    and to be reminded of their former luxuriance of health only by the maladies which riot has produced."

                    They stared a while in silence one upon
                    another, and, at last, drove him away by
                    a general chorus of continued laughter.

                    The consciousness that his sentiments
                    were just, and his intentions kind, was
                    scarcely sufficient to support him against
                    the horrour of derision. But he recovered his tranquility, and persued his
                    search.

                    <p>As he was one day walking in the street, he saw a spacious building
                    which all were, by the open doors, invited to enter: he followed the stream
                    of people, and found it a hall or school
                    of declamation, in which professors read
                    lectures to their auditory. He fixed his eye
                    upon a sage raised above the rest, who discoursed with great energy on the government of the passions. His look was venerable, his action graceful, his pronunciation clear, and his diction elegant. He showed, with great strength of sentiment,
            
            
            <pb n="127"/>
               
                    and variety of illustration, that human
                    nature is degraded and debased, when
                    the lower faculties predominate over the
                    higher; that when fancy, the parent of
                    passion, usurps the dominion of the mind,
                    nothing ensues but the natural effect of
                    unlawful government, perturbation and
                    confusion; that she betrays the fortresses of
                    the intellect to rebels, and excites her
                    children to sedition against reason their
                    lawful sovereign. He compared reason
                    to the sun, of which the light is constant, uniform, and lasting; and fancy
                    to a meteor, of bright but transitory
                    lutsre, irregular in its motion, and delusive in it direction.

                    important victory, after which man is
                    no longer the slave of fear, nor the fool
                    of hope; is no more emaciated by envy, inflamed by anger, emasculated by
                    tenderness, or depressed by grief; but.
                    walks on calmly through the tumults or
                    the privacies of life, as the sun persues
                    alike his course through the calm or
                    the stormy sky.
                    He enumerated many examples of heroes immovable by pain or pleasure, who
                    looked with indifference on those modes
                    or accidents to which the vulgar give
                    the names of good and evil. He exhorted his hearers to lay aside their prejudices, and arm themselves against the
                    shafts of malice or misfortune, by invulnerable patience; concluding, that

                    this state only was happiness, and that

                    Rasselas listened to him with the veneration due to the instructions of a superiour being, and, waiting for him at the
                    door, humbly implored the liberty of
                    visiting so great a master of true wisdom.
                    The lecturer hesitated a moment, when
                    Rasselas put a purse of gold into his hand,
                    which he received with a mixture of joy

                    all that is necessary to be known, who,
                    from the unshaken throne of rational fortitude, looks down on the scenes of life

                    trust, or to admire, the teachers of mo-
                    rality: they discourse like angels, but

                    man could reason so forcibly without feeling the cogency of his own arguments,
                    paid his visit in a few days, and was
                    denied admission. He had now learned
                    the power of money, and made his way
                    by a piece of gold to the inner apartment
                    where he found the philosopher in a room
                    half darkened, with his eyes misty, and

                    ship is useless; what I suffer cannot be
                    remedied, what I have lost cannot be supplied. My daughter, my only daughter, from whose tenderness I expected all
                    the comforts of my age, died last night
                    of a fever. My views, my purposes, my
                    hopes are at an end: I am now a lonely
                    being disunited from society."

                    "Sir, said the prince, mortality is an
                    event by which a wife man can never be
                    surprised: we know that death is always
                    near, and it should therefore always be
                    expected." Young man, answered
                    the philosopher, you speak like one that
                    has never felt the pangs of separation."
                    "Have you the forgot the precepts, said
                    Rasselas, which you so powerfully enforced? Has wisdom no strength to arm
                    the heart against calamity? Consider,

                    that external things are naturally variable, but truth and reason are always the
                    fame." "What comfort, said the mourner, can truth and reason afford me? of
                    what effect are they now, but to tell me,
                    that my daughter will not be restored?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    The prince, whose humanity would
                    not suffer him to insult misery with reproof, went away convinced of the emptiness of rhetorical sound, and the inefficacy of polished periods and studied sentences.

            <p>He was still eager upon the fame enquiry; and, having heard of a
                    hermit, that lived near the lowest cataract of the Nile, and filled the whole
                    country with the fame of his sanctity,
                    resolved to visit his retreat, and enquire
                    whether that felicity, which publick life
                    could not afford, was to be found in solitude; and whether a man, whose age
                    and virtue made him venerable, could
                    teach any peculiar art of shunning evils,
                    or enduring them.

                    Imlac and the princess agreed to ac-
                    company him, and, after the necessary
                    preparations, they began their journey.
                    Their way lay through fields, where
                    shepherds tended their flocks, and the
                    lambs were playing upon the pasture.
                    "This, said the poet, is the life which
                    has been often celebrated for its innocence
                    and quiet: let us pass the heat of the
                    day among the shepherds tents, and know
                    whether all our searches are not to terminate in pastoral simplicity."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The proposal pleased them, and they
                    induced the shepherds, by small presents
                    and familiar questions, to tell their opinion of their own state: they were so
                    rude and ignorant, so little able to compare the good with the evil of the
                    occupation, and so indistinct in their nar-

                <p>
                    ratives and descriptions, that very little
                    could be learned from them. But it was
                    evident that their hearts were cankered
                    with discontent; that they considered
                    themselves as condemned to labour for
                    the luxury of the rich, and looked up
                    with stupid malevolence toward those
                    that were placed above them.

                    The princess pronounced with vehemence, that she would never suffer these
                    envious savages to be her companions,
                    and that she should not soon be desirous of
                    seeing any more specimens of rustick
                    happiness; but could not believe that all
                    the accounts of primeval pleasures were
                    fabulous, and was yet in doubt whether
                    life had any thing that could be justly
                    preferred to the placid gratifications of
                    fidds and woods. She hoped that the

                    time would come, when with a few vir-
                    tuous and elegant companions, she should
                    gather flowers planted by her own hand,
                    fondle the lambs of her own ewe, and
                    listen, without care, among brooks and
                    breezes, to one of her maidens reading
                    in the shade.

            <p>On the next day they continued their
                journey, till the heat compelled
                    them to look round for shelter. At a
                    small distance they saw a thick wood,
                    which they no sooner entered than they
                    perceived that they were approaching the
                    habitations of men. The shrubs were
                
              
          
            <pb n="137"/>
             
                    diligently cut away to open walks where
                    theshades were darkest; the boughs of
                    opposite trees were artificially interwoven; seats of flowery turf were raised in
                    vacant spaces, and a rivulet, that wantoned along the side of a winding path,
                    had its banks sometimes opened into
                    small basins, and its stream sometimes
                    obstructed by little mounds of stone
                    heaped together to increase its murmurs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They passed slowly through the wood,
                    delighted with such unexpected accommodations, and entertained each other
                    with conjecturing what, or who, he
                    could be, that in those rude and unfrequented regions, had leisure and art for
                    such harmless luxury.

                    As they advanced, they heard the
                    sound of musick, and saw youths and
                    virgins dancing in the grove; and, going still further, beheld a stately palace
                    built upon a hill surrounded with woods.
                    The laws of eastern hospitality allowed
                    them to enter, and the master welcomed
                    them like a man liberal and wealthy.

                    He was skilful enough in appearances
                    soon to discern that they were no common guests, and spread his table with
                    magnificence. The eloquence of Imlac
                    caught his attention, and the lofty courtesy of the princess excited his respect.
                    When they offered to depart he entreated their stay, and was the next day still
                    more unwilling to dismiss them than before. They were easily persuaded to

                    stop, and civility grew up in time to
                    freedom and confidence.

                    The prince now saw all the domesticks
                    chearful, and all the face of nature smiling round the place, and could not forbear to hope that he should find here
                    what he was seeking; but when he was
                    congratulating the master upon his possessions, he answered with a sigh, "My
                    condition has indeed the appearance of
                    happiness, but appearances are delusive.
                    My prosperity puts my life in danger;
                    the Bassa of Egypt is my enemy, incensed only by my wealth and popularity.
                    I have been hitherto protected against
                    him by the princes of the country; but,
                    as the favour of the great is uncertain, I
                    know not how soon my defenders may
                    be persuaded to share the plunder with
                </p>
                
          
            <pb n="140"/>
                <p>
                    the Bassa. I have sent my treasures into
                    a distant country, and, upon the first alarm, am prepared to follow them.
                    then will my enemies riot in my mansion, and enjoy the gardens which I have
                    planted."

                <p>
                    They all joined in lamenting his danger, and deprecating his exile; and the
                    princess was so much disturbed with the
                    tumult of grief and indignation, that
                    she retired to her apartment. They
                    continued with their kind inviter a few
                    days longer, and then went forward to
                    find the hermit.

                    <p>THEY came on the third day, by
                    the direction of the peasants, to
                    the hermit's cell: it was a cavern in
                    the side of a mountain, over-shadowed
                    with palm-trees; at such a distance from
                    the <ref target="cataract_" corresp="cataract">cataract</ref><note xml:id="cataract" target="cataract_">waterfall</note>, that nothing more was
                    heard than a gentle uniform murmur,
                    such as composed the mind to pensive
                    meditation, especially when it was assisted by the wind whistling among the
                    branches. The first rude essay of nature
                    had been so much improved by human
                    labour, that the cave contained several
                </p>
                
          
            <pb n="142"/>

                    apartments, appropriated to different
                    uses, and often afforded lodging to travellers, whom darkness or tempests happened to overtake.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The hermit sat on a bench at the door,
                    to enjoy the coolness of the evening. On
                    one side lay a book with pens and papers,
                    on the other mechanical instruments of
                    various kinds. As they approached him
                    unregarded, the princess observed that
                    he had not the countenance of a man that
                    had found, or could teach, the way to
                    happiness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They saluted him with great respect,
                    which he repaid like a man not unaccustomed to the forms of courts. "My
                    children, said he, if you have lost, your
                    way, you shall be willingly supplied with
                </p>

                <p>
                    such conveniencies for the night as this
                    cavern will afford. I have all that nature requires, and you will not expect
                    delicacies in a hermit's cell."
                </p>
                <p>
                    They thanked him, and, entering,
                    were pleased with the neatness and regularity of the place. The hermit set flesh
                    and wine before them, though he fed
                    only upon fruits and water. His discourse was chearful without levity, and
                    pious without enthusiasm. He soon
                    gained the esteem of his guests, and
                    the princess repented of her hasty censure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At last Imlac began thus: "I do not
                    now wonder that your reputation is so
                    far extended; we have heard at Cairo
                    of your wisdom, and came hither to im-

                <p>
                    plore your direction for this young man
                    and maiden in the choice of life".
                </p>
                <p>
                    "To him that lives well, answered
                    the hermit, every form of life is good;
                    nor can I give any other rule for choice,
                    than to remove from all apparent evil."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "He will remove most certainly from
                    evil, said the prince, who shall devote
                    himself to that solitude which you have
                    recommended by your example."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I have indeed lived fifteen years in
                    solitude, said the hermit, but have no
                    desire that my example should gain any
                    imitators. In my youth I professed arms,
                    and was raised by degrees to the highest
                    military rank. I have traversed wide
                    countries at the head of my troops, and

                    seen many battles and sieges. At last,
                    being disgusted by the <ref target="preferments_" corresp="preferements">preferments</ref><note xml:id="preferments" target="preferments_">That is, the preferential treatement extended towards the younger officer by their superiors.</note> of a
                    younger officer, and feeling that my
                    vigour was beginning to decay, I resolved
                    to close my life in peace, having found the
                    world full of snares, discord and misery. I
                    had once escaped from the persuit of the
                    enemy by the shelter of this cavern, and
                    therefore chose it for my final residence.
                    I employed <ref target="artificers_" corresp="artificiers">artificers</ref><note xml:id="artificiers" target="artificiers_">craftsmen</note> to form it into
                    chambers, and stored it with all that I

                    rejoiced like a tempest-beaten sailor at
                    his entrance into the harbour, being delighted with the sudden change of the
                    noise and hurry of war, to stillness and
                    repose. When the pleasure of novelty
                    went away, I employed my hours in ex-

                    amining the plants which grow in the
                    valley, and the minerals which I collected from the rocks. But that enquiry is now grown tasteless and irksome.
                    I have been for some time unsettled and
                    distracted: my mind is disturbed with a
                    thousand perplexities of doubt, and vanities of imagination, which hourly prevail upon me, because I have no opportunities of relaxation or diversion. I am
                    sometimes ashamed to think that I could
                    not secure myself from vice, but by retiring from the exercise of virtue, and
                    begin to suspect that I was rather impelled by resentment, than led by devo-
                    tion, into solitude. My fancy riots
                    in scenes of folly, and I lament that
                    I have lost so much, and have gained so
                    little. In solitude, if I escape the example of bad men, I want likewise the

                    I have been long comparing the evils
                    with the advantages of society, and resolve to return into the world tomorrow,

                    They heard his resolution with surprise, but, after a short pause, offered
                    to conduct him to Cairo. He dug up a
                    considerable treasure which he had hid among the rocks, and accompanied them
                    to the city, on which, as he approached
                    it, he gazed with rapture.

                    <p>RASSELAS went often to an
                    assembly of learned men, who
                    met at stated times to unbend their
                    minds, and compare their opinions.
                    Their manners were somewhat coarse,
                    but their conversation was instructive,
                    and their disputations acute, though
                    sometimes too violent, and often continued till neither controvertist remembered upon what question they began.
                    Some faults were almost general among
                    them: every one was desirous to dictate
                    to the rest, and every one was pleased to

                    In this assembly Rasselas was relating his interview with the hermit, and
                    the wonder with which he heard him
                    censure a course of life which he had so
                    deliberately chosen, and so laudably followed. The sentiments of the hearers
                    were various. Some were of opinion, that
                    the folly of his choice had been justly
                    punished by condemnation to perpetual
                    perseverance. One of the youngest among them, with great vehemence, pronounced him an hypocrite. Some
                    talked of the right of society to the labour of individuals, and considered re-
                    tirement as a desertion of duty. Others
                    readily allowed, that there was a time
                    when the claims of the publick were sa-

                    sequester himself, to review his life, and

                    One, who appeared more affected
                    with the narrative than the rest,
                    thought it likely, that the hermit would,
                    in a few years, go back to his retreat,
                    and, perhaps, if shame did not restrain,
                    or death intercept him, return once
                    more from his retreat into the world:
                    "'For the hope of happiness, said he, is
                    so strongly impressed, that the longest

                    the present state, whatever it be, we feel,
                    and are forced to confess, the misery,
                    yet, when the same state is again at a distance, imagination paints it as desirable.

                    "This, said a philosopher, who had
                    heard him with tokens of great impatience, is the present condition of a
                    wise man. The time is already come,
                    when none are wretched but by their own
                    fault. Nothing is more idle, than to
                    enquire after happiness, which nature has
                    kindly placed within our reach. The
                    way to be happy is to live according to
                    nature, in obedience to that universal and
                    unalterable law with which every heart is
                    originally impressed; which is not written
                    on it by precept, but engraven by destiny,
                    not instilled by education, but infused at
                    our nativity. He that lives according to
                    nature will suffer nothing from the delusions of hope, or importunities of de-

                    sire: he will receive and reject with equability of temper; and at or suffer as the
                    reason of things shall alternately prescribe. Other men may amuse themselves with subtle definitions, or intricate
                    ratiocination. Let them learn to be wise
                    by easier means: let them observe the
                    hind of the forest, and the linnet of the
                    grove: let them consider the life of animals, whose motions are regulated by
                    instinct; they obey their guide and are
                    happy. Let us therefore, at length,
                    cease to dispute, and learn to live; throw
                    away the incumbrance of precepts, which
                    thev who utter them with so much pride
                    and pomp do not understand, and carry
                    with us this simple and intelligible maxim, That deviation from nature is deviation from happiness."

                    When he had spoken, he looked
                    round him with a placid air, and enjoyed
                    the consciousness of his own beneficence.
                    "Sir, said the prince, with great modesty, as I, like all the rest of mankind,
                    am desirous of felicity, my closest attention has been fixed upon your discourse:
                    I doubt not the truth of a position which
                    a man so learned has so confidently advanced. Let me only know what it is
                    to live according to nature."

                    "When I find young men so humble
                    and so docile, said the philosopher, I can
                    deny them no information which my studies have enabled me to afford. To live
                    according to nature, is to act always
                    with due regard to the fitness arising from
                    the relations and qualities of causes and
                    effects; to concur with the great and un-

                    changeable scheme of universal felicity,
                    to co-operate with the general disposition and tendency of the present system
                    of things."

                    The prince soon found that this was
                    one of the sages whom he should understand less as he heard him longer. He
                    therefore bowed and was silent, and the
                    philosopher, supposing him satisfied, and
                    the rest vanquished, rose up and departed
                    with the air of a man that had co-operated with the present system.

            <p>RASSELAS returned home full
                    of reflexions, doubtful how to direct his future steps. Of the way to
                    happiness he found the learned and simple equally ignorant; but, as he was
                    yet young, he flattered himself that he
                    had time remaining for more experiments, and further enquiries. He communicated to Imlac his observations and
                    his doubts, but was answered by him
                    with new doubts, and remarks that gave
                
               
         
            <pb n="156"/>
                
                    him no comfort. He therefore discoursed more frequently and freely with his
                    sister, who had yet the same hope with
                    himself, and always assisted him to give
                    some reason why, though he had been
                    hitherto frustrated, he might succeed at
                    last.

            <p> RASSELAS applauded the design,
                    and appeared next day with a
                    splendid retinue at the court of the Bassa.
                    He was soon distinguished for his magnificence, and admired, as a prince whose
                    curiosity had brought him from distant
                
                
          
            <pb n="158"/>
             
                    countries, to an intimacy with the great
                    officers, and frequent conversation with
                    the Bassa himself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He was at first inclined to believe,
                    that the man must be pleased with his
                    own condition, whom all approached with
                    reverence, and heard with obedience,
                    and who had the power to extend his
                    edicts to a whole kingdom." There
                    can be no pleasure, said he, equal to that
                    of feeling at once the joy of thousands
                    all made happy by wise administration.
                    Yet, since, by the law of subordination,
                    this sublime delight can be in one nation
                    but the lot of one, it is surely reasonable
                    to think that there is some satisfaction
                    more popular and accessible, and that
                    millions can hardly be subjected to the will

                    These thoughts were often in his
                    mind, and he found no solution of the
                    difficulty. But as presents and civilities
                    gained him more familiarity, he found
                    that almost every man who stood high in
                    employment hated all the reft, and was
                    hated by them, and that their lives were
                    a continual succession of plots and detestions, stratagems and escapes, faction and treachery. Many of those,
                    who surrounded the Bassa, were sent only to watch and report his conduct; every
                    tongue was muttering censure, and every eye was searching for a fault.

                    "What are we now to think of the
                    prerogatives of power, said Rasselas to
                    his sister; is it without any efficacy to
                    good? or, is the subordinate degree
                    only dangerous, and the supreme safe
                    and glorious? Is the Sultan the only
                    happy man in his dominions? or, is the
                    Sultan himself subject to the torments of
                    suspicion, and the dread of enemies?"

            <p>THE princess, in the mean time, insinuated herself into many families; for there are few doors, through which liberality, joined with good humour, cannot find its way. The daughters of many houses were airy and chearful, but Nekayah had been too long accustomed to the conversation of Imlac and her brother to be much pleased with childish levity and prattle which had no meaning. She found their thoughts narrow, their wishes low, and their merri-

                    ment often artificial. Their pleasures,
                    poor as they were, could not be preserved pure, but were embittered by petty competitions and worthless emulation.
                    They were always jealous of the beauty
                    of each other; of a quality to which solicitude can add nothing, and from which detraction can take nothing away. Many were
                    in love with triflers like themselves, and
                    many fancied that they were in love when
                    in truth they were only idle. Their affection was seldom fixed on sense or virtue, and therefore seldom ended but in
                    vexation. Their grief, however, like
                    their joy, was transient; every thing
                    floated in their mind unconnected with
                    the past or future, so that one desire easily gave way to another, as a second stone cast into the water effaces and
                    confounds the circles of the first,

                    With these girls she played as with
                    inoffensive animals, and found them
                    proud of her countenance, and weary
                    of her company.

                    But her purpose was to examine more
                    deeply, and her affability easily persuaded the hearts that were swelling with sorrow to discharge their secrets in her ear:
                    and those whom hope flattered, or prosperity delighted, often courted her to
                    partake their pleasures.

                <p>
                    The princess and her brother commonly met in the evening in a private summerhouse on the bank of the Nile, and related to each other the occurrences of the
                    day. As they were sitting together, the
                    princess cast her eyes upon the river that
                    flowed before her. "Answer, said she,

                    great father of waters, thou that rollest
                    thy floods through eighty nations, to the
                    invocations of the daughter of thy native king, Tell me if thou waterest,
                    through all thy course, a single habitation from which thou dost not hear the
                    murmurs of complaint?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "You are then, said Rasselas, not
                    more successful in private houses than I
                    have been in courts." "I have, since
                    the last partition of our provinces, said
                    the princess, enabled myself to enter familiarly into many families, where there
                    was the fairest show of prosperity and
                    peace, and know not one house that is
                    not haunted by some fury that destroys
                    its quiet.

                <p>
                    "I did not seek ease among the poor,
                    because I concluded that there it could not
                    be found. But I saw many poor whom I
                    had supposed to live in affluence. Poverty
                    has, in large cities, very different appearances: it is often concealed in splendour, and often in extravagance. It is
                    the care of a very great part of makind to conceal their indigence from the
                    rest: they support themselves by temporary expedients, and every day is lost
                    in contriving for the morrow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "This, however, was an evil, which,
                    though frequent, I saw with less pain,
                    because I could relieve it. Yet some
                    have refused my bounties; more offended
                    with my quickness to detect their wants,
                    than pleased with my readiness to succour
                    them: and others, whose exigencies com-

                    never been able to forgive their benefaitress. Many however, have been
                    sincerely grateful without the ostentation
                    of gratitude, or the hope of other favours."

            <p>Nekayah perceiving her brother's attention fixed, proceeded
                    in her narrative.
                
                    "In families, where there is or is
                    not poverty, there is commonly discord: if a kingdom be, as Imlac tells

                <p>
                    us, a great family, a family likewise is
                    a little kingdom, torn with factions and
                    exposed to revolutions. An unpracticed
                    observer expects the love of parents and
                    children to be constant and equal; but
                    this kindness seldom continues beyond
                    the years of infancy: in a short time the
                    children become rivals to their parents.
                    Benefits are allayed by reproaches, and
                    gratitude debased by envy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Parents and children seldom act in
                    concert: each child endeavours to appropriate the esteem or fondness of the
                    parents, and the parents, with yet less
                    temptation, betray each other to their
                    children; thus some place their confidence
                    in the father, and some in the mother,
                    and, by degrees, the house is filled with
                    artifices and feuds.

                    "The opinions of children and parents, of the young and the old, are naturally opposite, by the contrary effects
                    of hope and despondence, of expectation and experience, without crime or
                    folly on either side. The colours of life
                    in youth and age appear different, as the
                    face of nature in spring and winter. And
                    how can children credit the assertions of
                    parents, which their own eyes show them
                    to be false?

                    "Few parents act in such a manner
                    as much to enforce their maxims by the
                    credit of their lives. The old man trusts

                    progression: the youth expects to force
                    his way by genius, vigour, and precipitance. The old man pays regard to
                    riches, and the youth reverences virtue.

                    The old man deifies prudence: the youth
                    commits himself to magnanimity and
                    chance. The young man, who intends
                    no ill, believes that none is intended,
                    and therefore acts with openness and

                    parents and children, for the greatest part,
                    live on to love less and less: and, if

                    the good and evil cannot well agree; and
                    the evil can yet less agree with one another: even the virtuous fall sometimes
                    to variance, when their virtues are of
                    different kinds, and tending to extremes.

                    their business and their pleasure to disturb that society which debars them from
                    its privileges. To live without feeling
                    or exciting sympathy, to be fortunate
                    without adding to the felicity of others,
                    or afflicted without tasting the balm of
                    pity, is a state more gloomy than solitude: it is not retreat but exclusion from

                    that her presence is not to be bought by
                    wealth, nor enforced by conquest. It is
                    evident, that as any man acts in a wider
                    compass, he must be more exposed to opposition from enmity or miscarriage from
                    chance; whoever has many to please or to
                    govern, must use the ministry of many
                    agents, some of whom will be wicked,
                    and some ignorant; by some he will be
                    misled, and by others betrayed. If he
                    gratifies one he will offend another:
                    those that are not favoured will think
                    themselves injured; and, since favours
                    can be conferred but upon few, the
                    greater number will be always discontented."

                    may be maintained, that we do not always find visible happiness in proportion
                    to visible virtue. All natural and almost all political evils, are incident alike
                    to the bad and good: they are confounded in the misery of a famine, and not much
                    distinguished in the fury of a faction;
                    they sink together in a tempest, and are
                    driven together from their country by invaders. All that virtue can afford is
                    quietness of conscience, a steady prospect
                    of a happier state; this may enable us
                    to endure calamity with patience; but

                    only part of the question, as in the multifarious relations of politics and morality: but when we perceive the whole at

                    "The good of the whole," says Rasselas, "Is the same with the
                    good of all its parts. If marriage be
                    best for mankind it must be evidently
                    best for individuals, or a permanent and
                    necessary duty must be the cause of
                    evil, and some must be inevitably sacrificed to the convenience of others. In
                    the estimate which you have made of the
                    two states, it appears that the incommodities of a single life are, in a great

                    "I cannot forbear to flatter myself
                    that prudence and benevolence will make
                    marriage happy. The general folly of
                    mankind is the cause of general complaint.
                    What can be expeted but disappointment and repentance from a choice made
                    in the immaturity of youth, in the ardour of desire, without judgment, without foresight, without enquiry after
                    conformity of opinions, similarity of
                    manners, rectitude of judgment, or purity of sentiment.

                    "Such is the common process of marriage. A youth and maiden meeting

                    Having little to divert attention, or diversify thought, they find themselves uneasy when they are apart, and therefore
                    conclude that they shall be happy together. They marry, and discover what
                    nothing but voluntary blindness had before concealed; they wear out life in altercations, and charge nature with cruelty.

                    "From those early marriages proceeds likewise the rivalry of parents and
                    children: the son is eager to enjoy the
                    world before the father is willing to forsake it, and there is hardly room at once
                    for two generations. The daughter begins to bloom before the mother can be
                    content to fade, and neither can forbear
                    to wish for the absence of the other.

                    In the variety and jollity of youthful
                    pleasures life may be well enough supported without the help of a partner.
                    Longer time will increase experience, and
                    wider views will allow better opportunities of enquiry and selection: one advantage, at least, will be certain; the

                    when opinions are fixed, and habits are
                    established; when friendships have been
                    contrasted on both sides, when life has
                    been planned into method, and the mind
                    has long enjoyed the contemplation of

                    as it molifies unchangeably the external

                    of the passions, and gives an inflexible

                    can return, and heroes, whose form of

                    nothing can be known. The truth is,
                    that no mind is much employed upon
                    the present: recollection and anticipation
                    fill up almost all our moments. Our
                    passions are joy and grief, love and hatred, hope and fear. Of joy and grief
                    the past is the object, and the future of
                    hope and fear; even love and hatred respect the past, for the cause must have

                    When they came to the great pyramid they were astonished at the extent
                    of the base, and the height of the top.
                    Imlac explained to them the principles
                    upon which the pyramidal form was
                    chosen for a fabric intended to co-extend its duration with that of the world:
                    he showed that its gradual diminution
                    gave it such liability, as defeated all
                    the common attacks of the elements, and
                    could scarcely be overthrown by earthquakes themselves, the least resistible of

                    They measured all its dimensions, and
                    pitched their tents at its foot. Next day
                    they prepared to enter its interior apartments, and having hired the common
                    guides climbed up to the first passage,
                    when the favorite of the princess, looking into the cavity, stepped back and
                    trembled. "Pekuah," said the princess,
                    "Of what art thou afraid?" "Of the
                    narrow entrance," answered the lady, "And
                    of the dreadful gloom. I dare not enter
                    a place which must surely be inhabited

                    before us, and, perhaps, shut us in for

                    more than other places, or why they

                    dreadful a purpose as that of entering the

                    and the rest entered the pyramid:
                    they passed through the galleries, surveyed the vaults of marble, and examined
                    the chest in which the body of the

                    compelled to solace, by the erection of
                    a pyramid, the satiety of dominion and

                    labyrinths, and costly rooms, and of the
                    different impressions which the varieties
                    of the way had made upon her. But,
                    when they came to their <ref target="train_" corresp="train">train</ref><note xml:id="train" target="train_">"A retinue; a number of followers or attendants." Johnson's <hi rend="italic">Dictionary.</hi></note>, they found
                    every one silent and dejected: the men
                    discovered shame and fear in their countenances, and the women were weeping
                    in the tents.

                    What had happened they did not try
                    to conjecture, but immediately enquired.
                    "You had scarcely entered into the pyramid, said one of the attendants, when
                    a troop of Arabs rushed upon us: we
                    were too few to resist them, and too slow
                    to escape. They were about to search
                    the tents, set us on our camels, and drive
                    us along before them, when the approach
                    of some Turkish horsemen put them to

                <p>
                    flight; but they seized the lady Pekuah
                    with her two maids, and carried them
                    away: the Turks are now persuing them
                    by our instigation, but I fear they will
                    not be able to overtake them."

                    The princess was overpowered with
                    surprise and grief. Rasselas, in the first
                    heat of his resentment, ordered his
                    servants to follow him, and prepared to
                    persue the robbers with his sabre in his
                    hand. "Sir, said Imlac, what can you
                    hope from violence or valour? the Arabs
                    are mounted on horses trained to battle
                    and retreat; we have only beasts of burden. By leaving our present station we
                    may lose the princess, but cannot hope
                    to regain Pekuah."

                    In a short time the Turks returned,
                    having not been able to reach the enemy. The princess burst out into new
                    lamentations, and Rasselas could scarcely
                    forbear to reproach them with cowardice;
                    but Imlac was of opinion, that the escape
                    of the Arabs was no addition to their
                    misfortune, for, perhaps, they would
                    have killed their captives rather than
                    have resigned them.

                    censuring the negligence of the government, lamenting their own rashness which
                    had neglected to procure a guard, imagining many expedients by which the loss
                    of Pekuah might have been prevented,
                    and resolving to do something for her recovery, though none could find any

                    Nekayah retired to her chamber,
                    where her women attempted to comfort
                    her, by telling her that all had their
                    troubles, and that lady Pekuah had enjoyed much happiness in the world for a
                    long time, and might reasonably expect
                    a change of fortune. They hoped that
                    some good would befal her wheresoever
                    she was, and that their mistress would find
                    another friend who might supply her
                    place.

                    The princess made them no answer,
                    and they continued the form of condolence, not much grieved in their hearts
                    that the favourite was lost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next day the prince presented to the
                    Bassa a memorial of the wrong which
                    he had suffered, and a petition for redress. The Bassa threatened to punish
                    the robbers, but did not attempt to catch
                    them, nor, indeed, could any account or
                    description be given by which he might
                    direct the persuit.

                    It soon appeared that nothing would
                    be done by authority. Governors, being accustomed to hear of more crimes
                    than they can punish, and more wrongs
                    than they can redress, set themselves at
                    ease by indiscriminate negligence, and

                    presently forget the request when they
                    lose sight of the petitioner.

                <p>
                    Imlac then endeavoured to gain some
                    intelligence by private agents. He
                    found many who pretended to an exact
                    knowledge of all the haunts of the Arabs, and to regular correspondence with
                    their chiefs, and who readily undertook
                    the recovery of Pekuah. Of these, some
                    were furnished with money for their journey, and came back no more; some
                    were liberally paid for accounts which a
                    few days discovered to be false. But the
                    princess would not suffer any means,
                    however improbable, to be left untried.
                    While she was doing something she kept
                    her hope alive. As one expedient failed,
                    another was suggested; when one mes-

                <p>
                    senger returned unsuccessful, another was
                    despatched to a different quarter.
                    Two months had now passed, and of
                    Pekuah nothing had been heard; the
                    hopes which they had endeavoured to
                    raise in each other grew more languid,
                    and the princess, when she saw nothing
                    more to be tried, sunk down inconsolable in hopeless dejection. A thousand
                    times she reproached herself with the
                    easy compliance by which she permitted
                    her favourite to stay behind her. "Had
                    not my fondness, said she, lessened my
                    authority, Pekuah had not dared to talk
                    of her terrours. She ought to have
                    feared me more than spectres. A severe
                    look would have overpowered her; a
                    peremptory command would have compelled obedience. Why did foolish in-

                <p>
                    dulgence prevail upon me? Why did I
                    not speak and refuse to hear?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Great princess, said Imlac, do not
                    reproach yourself for your virtue, or consider that as blameable by which evil has accidentally been caused. Your tenderness for the timidity of Pekuah was generous and kind. When we act according to our duty, we commit the event
                    to him by whose laws our actions are governed, and who will suffer none to be
                    finally punished for obedience. When,
                    in prospect of some good, whether natural or moral, we break the rules prescribed us, we withdraw from the direction of superiour wisdom, and take
                    all consequences upon ourselves. Man
                    cannot so far know the connexion
                    of causes and events, as that he may

                <p>
                    venture to do wrong in order to do right.
                    When we persue our end by lawful
                    means, we may always console our miscarriage by the hope of future recompense. When we consult only our own
                    policy, and attempt to find a nearer
                    way to good, by overleaping the settled
                    boundaries of right and wrong, we cannot be happy even by success, because
                    we cannot escape the consciousness of our
                    fault; but, if we miscarry, the disappointment is irremediably embittered. How
                    comfortless is the sorrow of him, who
                    feels at once the pangs of guilt, and the
                    vexation of calamity which guilt has
                    brought upon him?

                    been your condition, if the lady Pekuah
                    had entreated to accompany you,

                    would you have born the thought, if you
                    had forced her into the pyramid, and
                    she had died before you in agonies of

                    I should have been tortured to madness

                    to repent it."

                    or careless conversation. The sentiments
                    of her, whom she now expected to see no
                    more, were treasured in her memory as
                    rules of life, and she deliberated to no
                    other end than to conjecture on any occasion what would have been the opinion and counsel of Pekuah.

                    The women, by whom she was attended, knew nothing of her real condition, and therefore she could not talk to
                    them but with caution and reserve. She

                    had no convenience of uttering. Rasselas endeavoured first to comfort and afterwards to divert her; he hired musicians, to whom she seemed to listen, but
                    did not hear them, and procured masters
                    to instruct her in various arts, whose

                    lectures, when they visited her again,
                    were again to be repeated. She had
                    lost her taste of pleasure and her ambition of excellence. And her mind,
                    though forced into short excursions, always recurred to the image of her friend.

                    Imlac was every morning earnestly enjoined to renew his enquiries, and was
                    asked every night whether he had yet heard
                    of Pekuah, till not being able to return

                    are never pleasing, and that all naturally

                    be disturbed any longer by the sighs of
                    Nekayah: my search after happiness is
                    now at an end. I am resolved to retire
                    from the world with all its flatteries and
                    deceits, and will hide myself in solitude,
                    without any other care than to compose
                    my thoughts, and regulate my hours by
                    a constant succession of innocent occu-

                    all earthly desires, I shall enter into that
                    state, to which all are hastening, and in
                    which I hope again to enjoy the friendship of Pekuah."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Do not entangle your mind, said
                    Imlac, by irrevocable determinations,
                    nor increase the burthen of life by a voluntary accumulation of misery: the
                    weariness of retirement will continue or
                    increase when the loss of Pekuah is forgotten. That you have been deprived
                    of one pleasure is no very good reason for
                    rejection of the rest."
                    "Since Pekuah was taken from me,
                    said the princess, I have no pleasure to
                    reject or to retain. She that has no one
                    to love or trust has little to hope. She

                    wants the radical principle of happiness.
                    We may, perhaps, allow that what satisfaction this world can afford, must
                    arise from the conjunction of wealth,
                    knowledge and goodness: wealth is nothing but as it is bestowed, and knowledge nothing but as it is communicated:
                    they must therefore be imparted to others,
                    and to whom could I now delight to impart them? Goodness affords the only
                    comfort which can be enjoyed without a
                    partner, and goodness may be praised
                    in retirement."

                <p>
                    "How far solitude may admit goodness, or advance it, I shall not, replied
                    Imlac, dispute at present. Remember
                    the confession of the pious hermit. You
                    will wish to return into the world, when
                    the image of your companion has left
                    your thoughts." "That time, said Ne-

                    kayah, will never come. The generous
                    frankness, the modest obsequiousness,
                    and the faithful secrecy of my dear Pekuah, will always be more missed, as I
                    shall live longer to see vice and folly."
                    "The state of a mind oppressed with
                    a sudden calamity, said Imlac, is like
                    that of the fabulous inhabitants of the
                    new created earth, who, when the first
                    night came upon them, supposed that
                    day never would return. When the
                    clouds of sorrow gather over us, we see
                    nothing beyond them, nor can imagine
                    how they will be dispelled: yet a new
                    day succeeded to the night, and sorrow
                    is never long without a dawn of ease.
                    But they who restrain themselves from
                    receiving comfort, do as the savages
                    would have done, had they put out
                    their eyes when it was dark. Our minds,
                </p>
               
            <pb n="72"/>
                <p>
                    like our bodies, are in continual flux;
                    something is hourly lost, and something
                    acquired. To lose much at once is inconvenient to either, but while the vital
                    powers remain uninjured, nature will
                    find the means of reparation. Distance
                    has the same effect on the mind as on
                    the eye, and while we glide along the
                    stream of time, whatever we leave behind
                    us is always lessening, and that which
                    we approach increasing in magnitude.
                    Do not suffer life to stagnate; it will grow
                    muddy for want of motion: commit
                    yourself again to the current of the world;
                    Pekuah will vanish by degrees; you will
                    meet in your way some other favourite,
                    or learn to diffuse yourself in general
                    conversation."

                    "At least, said the prince, do not despair before all remedies have been tried:
                    the enquiry after the unfortunate lady is
                    still continued, and shall be carried on

                    Nekayah thought this a reasonable demand, and made the promise to her brother, who had been advised by Imlac to
                    require it. Imlac had, indeed, no great
                    hope of regaining Pekuah, but he supposed, that if he could secure the interval
                    of a year, the princess would be then in
                    no danger of a cloister.

            <p>NEKAYAH, seeing that nothing
                    was omitted for the recovery of
                    her favourite, and having, by her promise, set her intention of retirement at
                    a distance, began imperceptibly to return
                    to common cares and common pleasures.
                    She rejoiced without her own consent at
                    the suspension of her sorrows, and sometimes caught herself with indignation in
                    the act of turning away her mind from
                    the remembrance of her, whom yet she
                    resolved never to forget.</p>
                
                
            <pb n="75"/>
                <p>
                    She then appointed a certain hour of
                    the day for meditation on the merits and
                    fondness of Pekuah, and for some weeks
                    retired constantly at the time fixed, and
                    returned with her eyes swollen and her
                    countenance clouded. By degrees she
                    grew less scrupulous, and suffered any
                    important and pressing avocation to de-
                    lay the tribute of daily tears. She then
                    yielded to less occasions; sometimes forgot what she was indeed afraid to remember, and, at last, wholly released herself
                    from the duty of periodical affliction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Her real love of Pekuah was yet not
                    diminished. A thousand occurrences
                    brought her lack to memory, and a
                    thousand wants, which nothing but the
                    confidence of friendship can supply,
                    made her frequently regretted. She,

                <p>
                    therefore, solicited Imlac never to desist
                    from enquiry, and to leave no art of intelligence untried, that, at least, she might
                    have the comfort of knowing that she
                    did not suffer by negligence or sluggishness. "Yet what, said she, is to be expected from our persuit of happiness,
                    when we find the state of life to be such,
                    that happiness itself is the cause of mi-
                    sery? Why should we endeavour to attain that, of which the possession cannot
                    be secured? I shall henceforward fear
                    to yield my heart to excellence, however
                    bright, or to fondness, however tender,
                    left I should lose again what I have lost

            <head type="sub">The princess hears news of Pekuah.</head> <p>
                    In seven months, one of the messengers, who had been sent away upon
                    the day when the promise was drawn
                    from the princess, returned, after many
                    unsuccessful rambles, from the borders
                    of Nubia, with an account that Pekuah
                    was in the hands of an Arab chief, who
                    possessed a castle or fortress on the extremity of Egypt. The Arab, whose revenue was plunder, was willing to restore her, with her two attendants, for
                    two hundred ounces of gold.</p>
                
               
            <pb n="78"/>
                <p>
                    The price was no subject of debate.
                    The princess was in extasies when she
                    heard that her favourite was alive, and
                    might so cheaply be ransomed. She
                    could not think of delaying for a moment Pekuah's happiness or her own,
                    but entreated her brother to send back
                    the messenger with, the sum required.
                    Imlac, being consulted, was not very
                    confident of the veracity of the relator,
                    and was still more doubtful of the Arab's
                    faith, who might, if he were too liberally trusted, detain at once the money
                    and the captives. He thought it dangerous to put themselves in the power of
                    the Arab, by going into his district, and
                    could not expect that the Rover would so
                    much expose himself as to come into the
                    lower country, where he might be seized
                    by the forces of the Bassa.

                    It is difficult to negotiate where neither will trust. But Imlac, after some
                    deliberation, directed the messenger to
                    propose that Pekuah should be conducted
                    by ten horsemen to the <ref target="monastery_" corresp="monastery">monastery of St.

                    That no time might be lost, as they
                    expeced that the proposal would not be
                    refused, they immediately began their
                    journey to the monastary; and, when they
                    arrived, Imlac went forward with the
                    former messenger to the Arab's fortress.
                    Rasselas was desirous to go with them,
                    but neither his sister nor Imlac would
                    consent. The Arab, according to the
                    custom of his nation, observed the laws

                    of hospitality with great exactness to those
                    who put themselves into his power, and,
                    in a few days, brought Pekuah with her
                    maids, by easy journeys, to their place
                    appointed, where receiving the stipulated
                    price, he restored her with great respect
                    to liberty and her friends, and undertook to conduct them back towards
                    Cairo beyond all danger of robbery or
                    violence.

                    The princess and her favourite embraced each other with transport too violent to be expressed, and went out
                    together to pour the tears of tenderness
                    in secret, and exchange professions of
                    kindness and gratitude. After a few
                    hours they returned into the refectory of

                    suddenness of the event struck me with
                    surprise, and I was at first rather stupified than agitated with any passion of either fear or sorrow. My confusion was
                    encreased by the speed and tumult of our
                    flight while we were followed by the
                    Turks, who, as it seemed, soon despaired to overtake us, or were afraid of those
                    whom they made a shew of menacing.

                    "When the Arabs saw themselves out
                    of danger they slackened their course,
                    and as I was less harassed by external
                    violence, I began to feel more uneasiness
                    in my mind. After some time we stopped near a spring shaded with trees in a
                    pleasant meadow, where we were set upon
                    the ground, and offered such refreshments as our masters were partaking. I
                    was suffered to sit with my maids apart
                    from the rest, and none attempted to
                    comfort or insult us. Here I first began
                    to feel the full weight of my misery.
                    The girls sat weeping in silence, and
                    from time to time looked on me for
                    succour. I knew not to what condition
                    we were doomed, nor could conjecture
                    where would be the place of our captivity, or whence to draw any hope of deliverance. I was in the hands, of rob-

                    bers and savages, and had no reason to
                    suppose that their pity was more than
                    their justice, or that they would forbear
                    the gratification of any ardour of desire,
                    or caprice of cruelty. I, however, kissed my maids, and endeavoured to pacify them by remarking, that we were yet
                    treated with decency, and that, since we
                    were now carried beyond persuit, there
                    was no danger of violence to our lives.

                    "When we were to be set again on
                    horseback, my maids clung round me,
                    and refused to be parted, but I commanded them not to irritate those who
                    had us in their power. We travelled
                    the remaining part of the day through
                    an unfrequented and pathless country,
                    and came by moonlight to the side of a
                    hill, where the rest of the troop was sta-

                    tioned. Their tents were pitched, and
                    their fires kindled, and our chief was
                    welcomed as a man much beloved by his
                    dependants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "We were received into a large tent,
                    where we found women who had attended their husbands in the expedition.
                    They set before us the supper which
                    they had provided, and I eat it rather
                    to encourage my maids than to comply
                    with any appetite of my own. When
                    the meat was taken away they spread
                    the carpets for repose. I was weary, and
                    hoped to find in sleep that remission of
                    distress which nature seldom denies.
                    Ordering myself therefore to be undrest,
                    I observed that the women looked very
                    earnestly upon me, not expecting, I suppose, to see me so submissively attended.

                    When my upper vest was taken off,
                    they were apparently struck with the
                    splendour of my cloaths, and one of
                    them timorously laid her hand upon
                    the embroidery. She then went out,
                    and, in a short time, came back with
                    another woman, who seemed to be of
                    higher rank, and greater authority. She
                    did, at her entrance, the usual act of
                    reverence, and, taking me by the hand,
                    placed me in a smaller tent, spread with
                    finer carpets, where I spent the night
                    quietly with my maids.

                    "In the morning, as I was sitting on
                    the grass, the chief of the troop came towards me. I rose up to receive him, and
                    he bowed with great respect. "Illustrious lady, said he, my fortune is better than I had presumed to hope; I am
                    told by my women, that I have a prin-

                    cess in my camp."Sir, answered I,
                    your women have deceived themselves
                    and you; I am not a princess, but an
                    unhappy stranger who intended soon to
                    have left this country, in which I am
                    now to be imprisoned for ever. "Whoever, or whencesoever, you are, returned the Arab, your dress, and that of
                    your servants, show your rank to be high,
                    and your wealth to be great. Why
                    should you, who can so easily procure
                    your ransome, think yourself in danger
                    of perpetual captivity? The purpose
                    of my incursions is to encrease my riches, or more properly to gather tribute.
                    The sons of Ishmael are the natural and
                    hereditary lords of this part of the continent, which is usurped by late invaders,
                    and low-born tyrants, from whom we
                    are compelled to take by the sword what

                    is denied to justice. The violence of war
                    admits no distinction; the lance that is
                    lifted at guilt and power will sometimes
                    fall on innocence and gentleness."
                    "How little, said I, did I expect that
                    yesterday it should have fallen upon me."

                <p>
                    "Misfortunes, answered the Arab,
                    should always be expected. If the eye
                    of hostility could learn reverence or pity,
                    excellence like yours had been exempt
                    from injury. But the angels of affliction spread their toils alike for the virtuous and the wicked, for the mighty and
                    the mean."Do not be disconsolate; I am
                    not one of the lawless and cruel rovers
                    of the desart; I know the rules of civil
                    life: I will fix your ransome, give a pas-

                    "You will easily believe that I was
                    pleased with his courtesy; and finding
                    that his predominant passion was desire
                    of money, I began now to think my
                    danger less, for I knew that no sum
                    would be thought too great for, the release of Pekuah. I told him that he
                    should have no reason to charge me with
                    ingratitude, if I was used with kindness,
                    and that any ransome, which could be
                    expected for a maid of common rank,
                    would be paid, but that he must not persist to rate me as a princess. He said,
                    he would consider what he should demand, and then, smiling, bowed and re-

                    me, each contending to be more officious
                    than the other, and my maids themselves
                    were served with reverence. We travelled, onward by short journeys. On the
                    fourth day the chief told me, that my
                    ransome must be two hundred ounces
                    of gold, which I not only promised him,
                    but told him, that I would add fifty
                    more, if I and my maids were honoura-

                    was longer or shorter as I commanded,
                    and the tents were pitched where I chose
                    to rest. We now had camels and other
                    conveniencies for travel, my own women

                    remains of ancient edifices with which
                    these deserted countries appear to have
                    been, in some distant age, lavishly embellished.

                    "The chief of the band was a man
                    far from illiterate: he was able to travel by the stars or the compass, and
                    had marked in his erratick expeditions
                    such places as are most worthy the notice of a passenger. He observed to me,
                    that buildings are always best preserved in
                    places little frequented, and difficult of
                    access: for, when once a country declines from its primitive splendour, the
                    more inhabitants are left, the quicker
                    ruin will be made. Walls supply stones

                    some convenience of his own. I endeavoured to appear contented where
                    sullenness and resentment would have
                    been of no use, and that endeavour conduced much to the calmness of my mind;

                    and the troubles of the night much
                    overbalanced the amusements of the day.
                    My women, who threw all their cares
                    upon their mistress, set their minds at ease
                    from the time when they saw me treated
                    with respect, and gave themselves up to
                    the incidental alleviations of our fatigue
                    without solicitude or sorrow. I was
                    pleased with their pleasure, and animated
                    with their confidence. My condition had
                    lost much of its terrour, since I found
                    that the Arab ranged the country merely
                    to get riches. Avarice is an uniform
                    and tractable vice: other intellectual distempers are different in different constitutions of mind; that which sooths the
                    pride of one will offend the pride of
                    another; but to the favour of the covetous there is a ready way, bring money
                    and nothing is denied.

                    "At last we came to the dwelling of
                    our chief, a strong and spacious house
                    built with stone in an island of the Nile,
                    which lies, as I was told under the tropick. "Lady, said the Arab, you shall
                    rest after your journey a few weeks in
                    this place, where you are to consider
                    yourself as sovereign. My occupation
                    is war: I have therefore chosen this obscure residence, from which I can issue
                    unexpected, and to which I can retire
                    unpersued. You may now repose in security: here are few pleasures, but here
                    is no danger." He then led me into
                    the inner apartments, and seating me on
                    the richest couch, bowed to the ground.
                    His women, who considered me as a
                    rival, looked on me with malignity;
                    but being soon informed that I was a
                    great lady detained only for my ransome,

                    they began to vie with each other in obsequiousness and reverence.

                    Being again comforted with new assurances of speedy liberty, I was for
                    some days diverted from impatience by
                    the novelty of the place. The turrets
                    overlooked the country to a great distance, and afforded a view; of many
                    windings of the stream. In the day I
                    wandered from one place to another as
                    the course of the sun varied the splendour
                    of the prospect, and saw many things
                    which I had never seen before. The
                    crocodiles and river-horses are common
                    in this unpeopled region, and I often looked upon them with terrour, though I
                    knew that they could not hurt me.
                    For some time I expected to see mermaids
                    and tritons, which, as Imlac has told

                    ever appeared, and the Arab, when I
                    enquired after them, laughed at my credulity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "At night the Arab always attended
                    me to a tower set apart for celestial observations where he endeavoured to teach
                    me the names and courses of the stars.
                    I had no great inclination to this study,
                    but an appearance of attention was necessary to please my instructor, who valued himself for his skill, and, in a little
                    while, I found some employment requisite
                    to beguile the tediousness of time, which
                    was to be passed always amidst the same
                    objects. I was weary of looking in the
                    morning on things from which I had
                    turned away weary in the evening: I

                    therefore was at last willing to observe the
                    stars rather than do nothing, but could
                    not always compose my thoughts, and
                    was very often thinking on Nekayah
                    when others imagined me contemplating
                    the sky. Soon after the Arab went upon
                    another expedition, and then my only
                    pleasure was to talk with my maids about the accident by which we were carried away, and the happiness that we
                    should all enjoy at the end of our captivity."

                    fortress, said the princess, why did you
                    not make them your companions, enjoy
                    their conversation, and partake their diversions? In a place where they found

                    or why could not you bear for a few
                    months that condition to which they
                    were condemned for life?"
                    "The diversions of the women, answered Pekuah, were only childish play,
                    by which the mind accustomed to stronger operations could not be kept busy. I
                    could do all which they delighted in
                    doing by powers merely sensitive, while
                    my intellectual faculties were flown to Cairo. They ran from room to room as a bird
                    hops from wire to wire in his cage.
                    They danced for the sake of motion, as
                    lambs frisk in a meadow. One sometimes pretended to be hurt that the rest
                    might be alarmed, or hid herself that another might seek her. Part of their time
                    passed in watching the progress of light
                    bodies that floated on the river, and part

                    the mind will easily straggle from the
                    fingers, nor will you suspect that captivity and absence from Nekayah could
                    receive solace from silken flowers.

                    what could they be expected to talk?
                    They had seen nothing; for they had
                    lived from early youth in that narrow
                    spot: of what they had not seen they
                    could have no knowledge, for they could
                    not read. They had no ideas but of the

                    their cloaths and their food. As I bore
                    a superior character, I was often called
                    to terminate their quarrels, which I decided as equitably as I could. If it could
                    have amused
                    me to hear the complaints
                    of each against the rest, I might have
                    been often detained by long stories, but
                    the motives of their animosity were so
                    small that I could not listen without intercepting the tale."

                    than common accomplishments, take
                    any pleasure in his seraglio when it is
                    filled only with women like these. Are
                    they exquisitely beautiful?"

                    "They do not, said Pekuah, want
                    that unaffecting and ignoble beauty which
                    may subsist without spriteliness or sublimity, without energy of thought or
                    dignity of virtue. But to a man like
                    the Arab such beauty was only a flower
                    casually plucked and carelessly thrown
                    away. Whatever pleasures he might find
                    among them, they were not those of
                    friendship or society. When they were
                    playing about him he looked on them
                    with inattentive superiority: when they
                    vied for his regard he sometimes turned
                    away disgusted. As they had no knowledge, their talk could take nothing from
                    the tediousness of life: as they had no
                    choice, their fondness, or appearance of
                    fondness, excited in him neither pride
                    nor gratitude; he was not exalted in his
                    own esteem by the smiles of a woman

                    obliged by that regard, of which he
                    could never know the sincerity, and
                    which he might often perceive to be exerted not so much to delight him as to
                    pain a rival. That which he gave, and
                    they received, as love, was only a careless distribution of superfluous time, such
                    love as man can bestow upon that which
                    he despises, such as has neither hope nor
                    fear, neither joy nor sorrow."

                    yourself happy, said Imlac, that you
                    have been thus easily dismissed. How
                    could a mind, hungry for knowledge,
                    be willing, in an intellectual famine, to
                    lose such a banquet as Pekuah's conver-

                    Pekuah, that he was for some time in
                    suspense; for, notwithstanding his promise, whenever I proposed to dispatch a
                    messenger to Cairo, he found some excuse for delay. While I was detained in
                    his house he made many incursions into
                    the neighbouring countries, and, perhaps,
                    he would have refused to discharge me,
                    had his plunder been equal to his wishes.
                    He returned always courteous, related
                    his adventures, delighted to hear my observations, and endeavoured to advance
                    my acquaintance with the stars. When I
                    importuned him to send away my letters,
                    he toothed me with professions of honour
                    and sincerity; and, when I could be no
                    longer decently denied, put his troop
                    again in motion, and left me to govern
                    in his absence. I was much afflicted by

                    and cared so little to entertain him, that
                    he for a while more frequently talked
                    with my maids. That he should fall
                    in love with them, or with me, might
                    have been equally fatal, and I was not
                    much pleased with the growing friendship. My anxiety was not long; for,
                    as I recovered some degree of chearfulness, he returned to me, and I could not

                    prepare for our journey hither, like a

                    spent forty years in unwearied attention
                    to the motions and appearances of the
                    celestial bodies, and has drawn out his
                    foul in endless calculations. He ad mits a few friends once a month to hear
                    his deductions and enjoy his discoveries.
                    I was introduced as a man of knowledge
                    worthy of his notice. Men of various
                    ideas and fluent conversation are commonly welcome to those whose thoughts
                    have been long fixed upon a single point,
                    and who find the images of other things
                    stealing away. I delighted him with
                    my remarks, he smiled at the narrative
                    of my travels, and was glad to forget
                    the constellations, and descend for a moment into the lower world.

                    to please him again. He relaxed from
                    that time the severity of his rule, and
                    permitted me to enter at my own choice.
                    I found him always busy, and always
                    glad to be relieved. As each knew
                    much which the other was desirous of
                    learning, we exchanged our notions with
                    great delight. I perceived that I had
                    every day more of his confidence, and
                    always found new cause of admiration
                    in the profundity of his mind. His

                    willingly interrupted for any opportunity of doing good by his counsel or his
                    riches. To his closest retreat, at his
                    most busy moments, all are admitted
                    that want his assistance: "For though
                    I exclude idleness and pleasure, I will
                    never, says he, bar my doors against

                    I visited him, said Imlac, with
                    more and more frequency, and was every

                    thought him the happiest of mankind,
                    and often congratulated him on the blessing that he enjoyed. He seemed to
                    hear nothing with indifference but the
                    praises of his condition, to which he always returned a general answer, and
                    diverted the conversation to some other

                    quickly reason to imagine that some painful sentiment pressed upon his mind.
                    He often looked up earnertly towards
                    the fun, and let his voice fall in the
                    midst of his discourse. He would sometimes, when we were alone, gaze upon
                    me in silence with the air of a man who

                    of haste, though, when I came to him,
                    he had nothing extraordinary to say.
                    And sometimes, when I was leaving

                    a satellite of Jupiter. A sudden tempest clouded the sky, and disappointed
                    our observation. We sat a while silent
                    in the dark, and then he addressed himself to me in these words: "Imlac, I
                    have long considered thy friendship as
                    the greatest blessing of my life. Integrity without knowledge is weak and:

                    is dangerous and dreadful. I have found
                    in thee all the qualities requisite for trust,
                    benevolence, experience, and fortitude.
                    I have long discharged an office which I
                    must soon quit at the call of nature, and
                    shall rejoice in the hour of imbecility
                    and pain to devolve it upon thee.

                    "I thought myself honoured by this
                    testimony, and protested that whatever

                    crab. The winds alone, of all the elemental powers, have hitherto refused
                    my authority, and multitudes have perished by equinoctial tempests which I
                    found myself unable to prohibit or re-
                    strain. I have administered this great
                    office with exact justice, and made to
                    the different nations of the earth an impartial dividend of rain and sunshine.

                    the globe, if I had limited the clouds to

                    confer greater plenty upon the inhabitants of the earth. This contemplation

                    pouring upon this country and that the
                    showers of fertility, and seconding every

                    fields withering with heat, I felt in my
                    mind a sudden with that I could send
                    rain on the southern mountains, and raise
                    the Nile to an inundation. In the hurry
                    of my imagination I commanded rain to
                    fall, and, by comparing the time of, my
                    command, with that of the inundation, I

                    with the utmost obstinacy. I sometimes
                    suspected myself of madness, and should
                    not have dared to impart this secret but

                    think that my conviction ought to influence another, who cannot, like me, be

                    exerted it. But the life of man is short, the

                    the time will soon come when the regulator of the year must mingle with the

                    of all the characters which have come

                    rigorous exactness, no human mind is
                    in its right state. There is no man whose

                    is not visible to others, nor considered as

                    it is not pronounced madness but when it

                    "This, Sir, is one of the dangers of
                    solitude, which the hermit has confessed
                    not always to promote goodness, and the
                    astronomer's misery has proved to be
                    not always propitious to wisdom."

                    I will no more, said the favourite,
                    imagine myself the queen of Abissinia.
                    I have often spent the hours, which the
                    princess gave to my own disposal, in
                    adjusting ceremonies and regulating the
                    court; I have repressed the pride of the

                    powerful, and granted the petitions of
                    the poor; I have built new palaces in
                    more happy situations, planted groves
                    upon the tops of mountains, and have
                    exulted in the beneficence of royalty, till,
                    when the princess entered, I had almost
                    forgotten to bow down before her."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "And I, said the princess, will not
                    allow myself any more to play the shepherdess in my waking dreams. I have
                    often soothed my thoughts with the quiet
                    and innocence of pastoral employments,
                    till I have in my chamber heard the winds
                    whistle, and the sheep bleat; Sometimes
                    freed the lamb entangled in the thicket,
                    and sometimes with my crook encountered the wolf. I have a dress like that
                    of the village maids, which I put on to
                    help my imagination, and a pipe on

                    which I play softly, and suppose myself followed by my flocks."
                    "I will confess, said the prince, an
                    indulgence of fantastick delight more
                    dangerous than yours. I have frequently endeavoured to image the possibility of
                    a perfect government, by which all
                    wrong should be restrained, all vice reformed, and all the subects preserved in
                    tranquility and innocence. This thought
                    produced innumerable schemes of reformation, and dictated many useful regulations and salutary edicts. This has
                    been the sport and sometimes the labour
                    of my solitude; and I start, when I
                    think with how little anguish I once supposed the death of my father and my
                    brothers."

                    "Such, says Imlac, are the effects
                    of visionary schemes: when we first
                    form them we know them to be absurd,
                    but familiarise them by degrees, and in
                    time lose sight of their folly."

                <p>
                    THE evening was now far past, and they rose to return home.
                    As they walked along the bank of the
                    Nile, delighted with the beams of the
                    moon quivering on the water, they saw
                    at a small distance an old man, whom
                    the prince had often heard in the assembly of the sages. "Yonder, said he, is
                    one whose years have calmed his passions,

                <p>
                    but not clouded his reason: let us close
                    the disquisitions of the night, by enquiring what are his sentiments of his own
                    state, that we may know whether youth
                    alone is to struggle with vexation, and
                    whether any better hope remains for the
                    latter part of life."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here the sage approached and saluted
                    them. They invited him to join their
                    walk, and prattled a while as acquaintance
                    that had unexpectedly met one another.
                    The old man was chearful and talkative, and the way seemed short in his
                    company. He was pleased to find himself not disregarded, accompanied them
                    to their house, and, at the prince's request, entered with them. They placed
                    him in the seat of honour, and set wine
                    and conserves before him.

                    "Sir, said the princess, an evening
                    walk must give to a man of learning,
                    like you, pleasures which ignorance and
                    youth can hardly conceive You know
                    the qualities and the causes of all that
                    you behold, the laws by which the river
                    flows, the periods in which the planets
                    perform their revolutions. Every thing
                    must supply you with contemplation,

                    "Lady, answered he, let the gay and

                    the annual overflow of the Nile with a
                    friend who is now silent in the grave. I
                    cast my eyes upwards, fix them on the
                    changing moon, and think with pain on
                    the vicissitudes of life. I have ceased to
                    take much delight in physical truth; for
                    what have I to do with those things
                    which I am soon to leave?"

                    "You may at least recreate yourself, said Imlac, with the recollection of
                    an honourable and useful life, and enjoy
                    the praise which all agree to give you."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Praise, said the sage, with a sigh,
                    is to an old man an empty sound.
                    I have neither mother to be delighted
                    with the reputation of her son, nor wife
                    to partake the honours of her husband.
                    I have outlived my friends and my rivals.

                <p>
                    Nothing is now of much importance;
                    for I cannot extend my interest beyond myself. Youth is delighted with applause,
                    because it is considered as the earnest of
                    some future good, and because the prospect of life is far extended: but to me,
                    who am now declining to decrepitude,
                    there is little to be feared from the malevolence of men, and yet less to be hoped
                    from their affection or esteem. Something they may yet take away, but they
                    can give me nothing. Riches would
                    now be useless, and high employment
                    would be pain. My retrospect of life
                    recalls to my view many opportunities
                    of good neglected, much time squandered upon trifles, and more lost in idleness and vacancy. I leave many great
                    designs unattempted, and many great
                    attempts unfinished. My mind is bur-

                    thened with no heavy crime, and therefore I compose myself to tranquility; endeavour to abstract my thoughts from
                    hopes and cares, which, though reason
                    knows them to be vain, still try to keep
                    their old possession of the heart; expect,
                    with serene humility, that hour which nature cannot long delay; and hope to possess
                    in a better state that happiness which here
                    I could not find, and that virtue which
                    here I have not attained."
                </p>
                <p>
                    He rose and went away, leaving his
                    audience not much elated with the hope
                    of long life. The prince consoled himself with remarking, that it was not reasonable to be disappointed by this account; for age had never been considered as the season of felicity, and, if it was possible to be easy in decline and weak-

                    ness, it was likely that the days of vigour and alacrity might be happy: that
                    the noon of life might be bright, if the
                    evening could be calm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The princess suspected that age was querulous and malignant, and delighted to repress the expectations of those who had
                    newly entered the world. She had seen the
                    possessors of estates look with envy on
                    their heirs, and known many who enjoy pleasure no longer than they can confine it to themselves.

                    Pekuah conjectured, that the man
                    was older than he appeared, and was
                    willing to impute his complaints to
                    delirious dejection; or else supposed that
                    he had been unfortunate, and was therefore discontented: "For nothing, said

                    she, is more common than to call our
                    own condition, the condition of life."

                    Imlac, who had no desire to see them
                    depressed, smiled at the comforts which
                    they could so readily procure to themselves, and remembered, that at the same
                    age, he was equally confident of unmingled prosperity, and equally fertile of
                    consolatory expedients. He forbore to
                    force upon them unwelcome knowledge,
                    which time itself would too soon impress.
                    The princess and her lady retired; the
                    madness of the astronomer hung upon
                    their minds, and they desired Imlac to
                    enter upon his office, and delay next
                    morning the rising of the sun.

                <p>THE princess and Pekuah having talked in private of Imlac's astronomer, thought his character at once so
                    amiable and so strange, that they could
                    not be satisfied without a nearer knowledge, and Imlac was requested to find
                    the means of bringing them together.

                    This was somewhat difficult; the philosopher had never received any visits
                    from women, though he lived in a city
                    that had in it many Europeans who followed the manners of their own coun-

                    tries, and many from other parts of the
                    world that lived there with European liberty. The ladies would not be refused,
                    and several schemes were proposed for the
                    accomplishment of their design. It was
                    proposed to introduce them as strangers
                    in distress, to whom the sage was always accessible; but, after some deliberation, it appeared, that by this artifice,
                    no acquaintance could be formed, for
                    their conversation would be short, and
                    they could not decently importune him
                    often. "This, said Rasselas, is true;
                    but I have yet a stronger objection against the misrepresentation of your state.
                    I have always considered it as treason against the great republick of human nature, to make any man's virtues the
                    means of deceiving him, whether on
                    great or little occasions. All imposture

                <p>
                    weakens confidence and chills benevolence. When the sage finds that you
                    are not what you seemed, he will feel the
                    resentment natural to a man who, conscious of great abilities, discovers that he
                    has been tricked by understandings meaner than his own, and, perhaps, the distrust, which he can never afterwards
                    wholly lay aside, may stop the voice of
                    counsel, and close the hand of charity;
                    and where will you find the power of restoring his benefactions to mankind, or
                    his peace to himself?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    To this no reply was attempted, and
                    Imlac began to hope that their curiosity
                    would subside; but, next day, Pekuah
                    told him, she had now found an honest pretence for a visit to the astronomer,
                    for she would solicite permission to conti-

                    nue under him the studies in which she
                    had been initiated by the Arab, and the
                    princes might go with her either as a fellow-student, or because a woman could
                    not decently come alone. "I am afraid,
                    said Imlac, that he will be soon weary of
                    your company: men advanced far in
                    knowledge do not love to repeat the
                    elements of their art, and I am not certain that even of the elements, as he
                    will deliver them connected with inferences, and mingled with reflections, you
                    are a very capable auditress." "That,
                    said Pekuah, must be my care: I ask of
                    you only to take me thither. My knowledge is, perhaps, more than you imagine it, and by concurring always with
                    his opinions I shall make him think it
                    greater than it is."

                    The astronomer, in pursuance of this
                    resolution, was told, that a foreign lady,
                    travelling in search of knowledge, had
                    heard of his reputation, and was desirous to become his scholar. The uncommonness of the proposal raised at once
                    his surprize and curiosity, and when, after a short deliberation, he consented to
                    admit her, he could not stay without impatience till the next day.

                    The ladies dressed themselves magnificently, and were attended by Imlac to
                    the astronomer, who was pleased to see
                    himself approached with respect by persons of so splendid an appearance. In
                    the exchange of the first civilities he was
                    timorous and bashful; but when the
                    talk became regular, he recollected his
                    powers, and justified the character which

                    Imlac had given. Enquiring of Pekuah
                    what could have turned her inclination
                    towards astronomy, he received from her
                    a history of her adventure at the pyramid, and of the time passed in the Arab's island. She told her tale with ease
                    and elegance, and her conversation took
                    possession of his heart. The discourse
                    was then turned to astronomy: Pekuah
                    displayed what she knew: he looked
                    upon her as a prodigy of genius, and intreated her not to desist from a study
                    which she had so happily begun.

                    They came again and again, and were
                    every time more welcome than before.
                    The sage endeavoured to amuse them,
                    that they might prolong their visits, for
                    he found his thoughts grow brighter in
                    their company; the clouds of solicitude

                    vanished by degrees, as he forced himself
                    to entertain them; and he grieved when
                    he was left at their departure to his old
                    employment of regulating the seasons.

                    to delight in sublunary pleasures. He
                    came early and departed late; laboured to recommend himself by assiduity

                    shall prefer, said the sage, I am not able
                    to instruct you. I can only tell that I
                    have chosen wrong. I have passed my
                    time in study without experience; in the
                    attainment of sciences which can, for the
                    most part, be but remotely useful to
                    mankind. I have purchased knowledge
                    at the expence of all the common comforts of life: I have missed the endearing elegance of female friendship, and
                    the happy commerce of the domestick tenderness. If I have obtained any prerogatives above other students, they have

                    that my enquiries have ended in errour,
                    and that I have suffered much, and susfered it in vain."

                    Imlac was delighted to find that the
                    sage's understanding was breaking
                    through its mists, and resolved to detain
                    him from the planets till he should forget his talk of ruling them, and reason
                    should recover its original influence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From this time the astronomer was received into familiar friendship, and partook of all their projects and pleasures:
                    his respect kept him attentive, and the
                    activity of Rasselas did not leave much
                    time unengaged. Something was al-

                <p>
                    ways to be done; the day was spent in
                    making observations which furnished
                    talk for the evening, and the evening
                    was closed with a scheme for the morrow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The sage confessed to Imlac, that since
                    he had mingled in the gay tumults of
                    life, and divided his hours by a succession of amusements, he found the conviction of his authority over the skies
                    fade gradually from his mind, and began to trust less to an opinion which he
                    never could prove to others, and which
                    he now found subject to variation from
                    causes in which reason had no part. "If
                    I am accidentally left alone for a few
                    hours, said he, my inveterate persuasion
                    rushes upon my foul, and my thoughts
                    are chained down by some irresistible

                    violence, but they are soon disentangled
                    by the prince's conversation, and instantaneously released at the entrance of Pekuah. I am like a man habitually afraid
                    of spectres, who is set at ease by a lamp,
                    and wonders at the dread which harrassed
                    him in the dark, yet, if his lamp be extinguished, feels again the terrours which
                    he knows that when it is light he shall
                    feel no more. But I am sometimes
                    afraid left I indulge my quiet by criminal
                    negligence, and voluntarily forget the
                    great charge with which I am intrusted.
                    If I favour myself in a known errour,
                    or am determined by my own ease in a
                    doubtful question of this importance,
                    how dreadful is my crime!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    No disease of the imagination, answered Imlac, is so difficult of cure, as
                </p>
                
            <pb n="149"/>
                <p>
                    that which is complicated with the dread
                    of guilt: fancy and conscience then act
                    interchangeably upon us, and so often
                    shift their places, that the illusions of
                    one are not distinguished from the dictates of the other. If fancy presents
                    images not moral or religious, the mind
                    drives them away when they give it pain,
                    but when melancholick notions take the
                    form of duty, they lay hold on the faculties without opposition, because we
                    are afraid to exclude or banish them.
                    For this reason the superstitious are often
                    melancholy, and the melancholy almost
                    always superstitious.

                    had contrived any new diversion for the
                    next day. "Such, said Nekayah, is

                    but by the anticipation of change: the
                    change itself is nothing; when we have
                    made it, the next wish is to change
                    again. The world is not yet exhausted;

                <p>
                    "Variety, said Rasselas, is so necessary to content, that even the happy valley disgusted me by the recurrence of its
                    luxuries; yet I could not forbear to
                    reproach myself with impatience, when I
                    saw the monks of St. Anthony support
                    without complaint, a life, not of uniform delight, but uniform hardship."

                <p>
                    "Those men, answered Imlac, are

                    the Abissinian princes in their prison of
                    pleasure. Whatever is done by the
                    monks is incited by an adequate and reasonable motive. Their labour supplies
                    them with necessaries; it therefore cannot be omitted, and is certainly rewarded.

                    Their devotion prepares them for another state, and reminds them of its approach, while it fits them for it. Their
                    time is regularly distributed; one duty
                    succeeds another, so that they are not left
                    open to the distraction of unguided choice,
                    nor lost in the shades of listless inactivity. There is a certain talk to be performed at an appropriated hour; and
                    their toils are cheerful, because they

                    which are practised in the cloister, and allow himself such harmless delights as his

                <p>
                    "This, said Imlac, is a question which
                    has long divided the wise, and perplexed
                    the good. I am afraid to decide on either part. He that lives well in the
                    world is better than he that lives well
                    in a monastery. But, perhaps, every one
                    is not able to stem the temptations of
                    publick life; and, if he cannot conquer,
                    he may properly retreat. Some have little
                    power to do good, and have likewise little
                    strength to resist evil. Many are weary
                    of their conflicts with adversity, and are

                    willing to eject those passions which
                    have long buried them in vain. And
                    many are dismissed by age and diseases
                    from the more laborious duties of society.
                    In monasteries the weak and timorous
                    may be happily sheltered, the weary
                    may repose, and the penitent may meditate. Those retreats of prayer and
                    contemplation have something so congenial to the mind of man, that, perhaps,
                    there is scarcely one that does not purpose to close his life in pious abstraction with a few associates serious as himself."

                    "Such, said Pekuah, has often been
                    my wish, and I have heard the princess
                    declare, that she should not willingly die

                    "The liberty of using harmless pleasures, proceeded Imlac, will not be disputed; but it is still to be examined what
                    pleasures are harmless. The evil of any
                    pleasure that Nekayah can image is not
                    in the act itself, but in its consequences.
                    Pleasure, in itself harmless, may become
                    mischievous, by endearing to us a state
                    which we know to be transient and probatory, and withdrawing our thoughts
                    from that, of which every hour brings
                    us nearer to the beginning, and of which
                    no length of time will bring us to the end.
                    Mortification is not virtuous in itself, nor
                    has any other use, but that it disengages
                    us from the allurements of sense. In
                    the state of future perfection to which
                    we all aspire, there will be pleasure without danger, and security without restraint."

                    The princess was silent, and Rasselas,
                    turning to the astronomer, asked him,
                    whether he could not delay her retreat, by
                    shewing her something which she had not

                    been so general, and your pursuit of
                    knowledge so vigorous, that novelties
                    are not now very easily to be found: but
                    what you can no longer procure from
                    the living may be given by the dead.
                    Among the wonders of this country are
                    the catacombs, or the ancient repositories, in which the bodies of the earliest
                    generations were lodged, and where, by
                    the virtue of the gums which embalmed
                    them, they yet remain without corruption."

                    pleasure the sight of the catacombs can
                    afford; but, since nothing else is offered,
                    I am resolved to view them, and shall
                    place this with many other things which
                    I have done, because I would do some thing."

                    They hired a guard of horsemen, and
                    the next day visited the catacombs. When
                    they were about to descend into the sepulchral caves, "Pekuah, said the princess, we are now again invading the habitations of the dead; I know that you
                    will stay behind; let me find you safe
                    when I return." "No, I will not be left,
                    answered Pekuah; I will go down between you and the prince."

                    with wonder through the labyrinth of
                    subterraneous passages, where the bodies
                    were laid in rows on either side.

                    the earth, and all agree to remove from
                    their sight, as soon as decent rites can be

                    "The original of ancient customs,
                    said Imlac, is commonly unknown; for
                    the practice often continues when the
                    cause has ceased; and concerning superstitious ceremonies it is vain to conjecture; for what reason did not dictate
                    reason cannot explain. I have long believed that the practice of embalming
                    arose only from tenderness to the remains
                    of relations or friends, and to this opinion
                    I am more inclined, because it seems
                    impossible that this care should have
                    been general: had all the dead been embalmed, their repositories must in time
                    have been more spacious than the dwellings of the living. I suppose only the
                    rich or honourable were secured from
                    corruption, and the rest left to the course
                    of nature.

                    "But it is commonly supposed that the
                    Egyptians believed the soul to live as long
                    as the body continued undissolved, and
                    therefore tried this method of eluding
                    death."

                <p>
                    "Could the wise Egyptians, said Nekayah, think so grosly of the soul? If
                    the soul could once survive its separation,
                    what could it afterwards receive or suffer
                    from the body?
                </p>
                <p>
                    "The Egyptians would doubtless
                    think erroneously, said the astronomer,
                    in the darkness of heathenism, and the first
                    dawn of philosophy. The nature of the
                    soul is still disputed amidst all our opportunities of clearer knowledge: some
                    yet say, that it may be material, who, nevertheless, believe it to be immortal."

                    "Some, answered Imlac, have indeed
                    said that the soul is material, but I can
                    scarcely believe that any man has thought
                    it, who knew how to think; for all the
                    conclusions of reason enforce the immateriality of mind, and all the notices of
                    sense and investigations of science concur to prove the unconsciousness of matter.

                    "It was never supposed that cogitation is inherent in matter, or that every
                    particle is a thinking being. Yet, if
                    any part of matter be devoid of thought,
                    what part can we suppose to think? Matter can differ from matter only in form,
                    density, bulk, motion, and direction of
                    motion: to which of these, however
                    varied or combined, can consciousness be
                    annexed? To be round or square, to

                    be moved slowly or swiftly one way or
                    another, are modes of material existence,
                    all equally alien from the nature of cogitation. If matter be once without
                    thought, it can only be made to think
                    by some new modification, but all the
                    modifications which it can admit are
                    equally unconnected with cogitative
                    powers."

                    there may be something which he knows
                    not; he that can set hypothetical possibility against acknowledged certainty, is not

                    All that we know of matter is, that matter is inert, senseless and lifeless; and if this conviction cannot be opposed but by
                    referring us to something that we know
                    not, we have all the evidence that human intellect can admit. If that which
                    is known may be over ruled by that which
                    is unknown, no being, not omniscient,

                    sufficiently proved, necessarily include

                    ideas are negative, and therefore obscure.
                    Immateriality seems, to imply a natural
                    power of perpetual duration as a consequence of exemption from all causes of
                    decay: whatever perishes is destroyed by
                    the solution of its contexture, and separation of its parts; nor can we conceive
                    how that which has no parts, and therefore admits no solution, can be naturally corrupted or impaired."

                    "I know not, said Rasselas, how to
                    conceive any thing without extension:
                    what is extended must have parts, and
                    you allow, that whatever has parts may

                    less. You will find subtance without
                    extension. An ideal form is no less real
                    than material bulk: yet an ideal form
                    has no extension. It is no less certain,
                    when you think on a pyramid, that your
                    mind posseses the idea of a pyramid, than
                    that the pyramid itself is standing. What
                    space does the idea of a pyramid occupy
                    more than the idea of a grain of corn?
                    or how can either idea suffer laceration?

                    it receives from a superiour nature its
                    power of duration. That it will not perish
                    by any inherent cause of decay, or principle of corruption, may be shown by philosophy; but philosophy can tell no more.
                    That it wll not be annihilated by him

                    "To me, said the princess, the choice
                    of life is become less important; I hope
                    hereafter to think only on the choice of
                    eternity."

                    They then hastened out of the caverns,
                    and, under the protection of their guard,
                    returned to Cairo.

                <p>IT was now the time of the inundation of the Nile: a few days after
                    their visit to the catacombs, the river
                    began to rise.

                    They were confined to their house.
                    The whole region being under water gave
                    them no invitation to any excursions,
                    and, being well supplied with materials
                    for talk, they diverted themselves with
                    comparisons of the different forms of
                    life which they had observed, and with
                    various schemes of happiness which each
                    of them had formed.

                    Pekuah was never so much charmed
                    with any place as the convent of St Anthony, where the Arab restored her to
                    the princess, and wished only to fill it
                    with pious maidens, and to be made
                    prioress of the order: she was weary
                    of expectation and disgust, and would
                    gladly be fixed in some unvariable state.

                    The princess thought, that of all sublunary things, knowledge was the best:
                    She desired first to learn all sciences, and
                    then purposed to found a college of
                    learned women, in which she would preside, that, by converting with the old,

                <p>
                    and educating the young, she might divide her time between the acquisition
                    and communication of wisdom, and raise
                    up for the next age models of prudence, and patterns of piety.

                    The prince desired a little kingdom,
                    in which he might administer justice in
                    his own person, and see all the parts of
                    government with his own eyes; but he
                    could never fix the limits of his dominion, and was always adding to the number of his subjects.

                    Imlac and the astronomer were contented to be driven along the stream of
                    life without direcing their course to any
                    particular port.

                    Of these wishes that they had formed
                    they well knew that none could be obtained. They deliberated a while what
                    was to be done, and resolved, when the
                    inundation should cease, to return to
                    Abissinia.
