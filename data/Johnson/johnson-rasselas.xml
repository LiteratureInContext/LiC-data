                                resources in the field of eighteenth-century studies. It is supported by the
                                University of Virginia, NINES.org, the Initiative for Digital Humanities, Media,
                                and Culture (IDHMC) at Texas A&amp;M University (http://idhmc.tamu.edu), and by
                                the Advanced Research Constortium (ARC) (http://ar-c.org). These documents have been generated from 18thConnect's TypeWright tool and are
                                based on the OCR output created by Gale/Cengage Learning for the Eighteenth
                                Century Collections Online (ECCO) proprietary database product. The XSLT that
                                converts the documents from Gale's OCR output XML format to TEI-A was written by
                                Matthew Christy at the IDHMC, Texas A&amp;M University. The code is open source.</note>
