                        John Morphew, and there seem to be three different 1713 printings of this
                        text--each 1713 printing includes slight variations of the authorship
                        statement on the title page--from the anonymous "written by a Lady" to a
                        full statement of authorship by "Anne Finch, Countess of Winchelsea." This
                        digital edition uses the 1714 printing by Barber, housed in the Library of
                        Congress. This 1714 printing is a reissue of the 1713 editions with a new
                        title page. All page images are sourced from the Library of Congress.</note>

                  style="float:right" width="300"/> Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea,
                  was born in April 1661 to Anne Haselwood and Sir William Kingsmill. At age
                  twenty-one she was appointed maid of honor to <ref
                     target="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mary-of-Modena">Mary Modena</ref>,
                  the wife of the Duke of York, in the Court of Charles II. During her time in the
                  Court, <ref target="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/anne-finch">Anne
                     Kingsmill</ref> was courted by and eventually married to Colonel Heneage Finch.
                  In 1689, after a shift in political power, the Finches faced monetary problems and
                  moved several times, eventually settling in <placeName type="tgn" key="7027563"
                     >Eastwell</placeName> with their nephew.</p>
               <p>As a woman writer in the <ref

                     target="https://books.google.com/books?id=-JldIaiQvkEC">Barbara McGovern's 2002
                     critical biography of Finch</ref> explores these displacements both in her life
                  and her poetry. Finch struggled, as McGovern notes, to define her poetic identity
                  in an era when women were excluded from the conditions that would allow them to
                  cultivate their minds or their voices. The poet was seen as male, and publishing
                  poetry, a masculine, public activity; for a woman to do so was, in the Augustan
                  period, risque and licentious (See Katherine Rogers' essay, "Anne Finch, Countess
                  of Winchelsea: An Augustan Woman Writer," in <ref
                     target="https://books.google.com/books?id=pE-gBAAAQBAJ">Pacheco 227</ref>);
                  Finch had to negotiate these competing cultural rules in her poetry. </p>
               <p>Finch's
                  poetry from 1701-1714 was wide ranging. She wrote on subjects typically allowed to
                  be feminine, like her love for her husband, but she also wrote about public and
                  political issues, like the succession of power in London. In 1701, Finch
                  anonymously published <hi rend="italic">"Upon the Death of King James the
                     Second"</hi>. Poems such as <ref
                        target="http://www.eighteenthcenturypoetry.org/works/o4784-w0160.shtml">"The
                        Spleen"</ref>and <ref
                           target="http://www.eighteenthcenturypoetry.org/works/o4784-w0020.shtml">"All is
                           Vanity"</ref> exemplify the idea of faith despite tribulation, a subject she
                  explored often. Prior to the 1713 publication of <hi rend="italic">Miscellany
                     Poems on Several Occasions</hi>, Finch circulated private manuscripts of her
                  poems and gained a favorable literary reputation. For more information on women
                  writers and manuscript circulation, see George Justice's introduction to <ref

               <p><ref target="https://books.google.com/books?id=pE-gBAAAQBAJ">Rogers
                  emphasizes Finch's Augustan roots, highlighting her use of form</ref> as well
                  as her love poetry, satirical prose, and ideas on the relationship between man and
                  nature (225). According to Rogers, Finch became one of the few female authors in
                  the Augustan era to successfully master the masculine rules of the literary
                  tradition. During the early modern period, women "frequently found themselves
                  denied opportunities for publication and serious public reception, or had their
                  writings denigrated and trivialized by a patriarchal literary world" (<ref

                  regarded as one of the most important English women writers of the 18th century.

                  significant attempt on Finch's part "to master a recurrent problem for
                  the...female poet: how to participate in a discourse in which the poet is defined
                  as a masculine subject" (503). <ref target="https://youtu.be/teP1pE6S7tQ">This

               Poetry is associated with music because of the metrical quality of both. Finch's
               use of the word "set" in this line emphasizes musicality, specifically the setting
               of words to music (see OED "set" v1, 73.a). </p></note>
