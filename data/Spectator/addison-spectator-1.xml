                    <ref target="spectator_" corresp="spectator">THE SPECTATOR #1 </ref><note xml:id="spectator" target="spectator_"><p> Joseph Addison (1672-1719) and Richard Steele (1672-1729) lived rich lives on their
                        own, but here we will briefly talk about them together as a way of introducing the
                        collaborative journalism for which they are now best remembered, the essay
                        series <hi rend="italic">The Tatler</hi> (1709-1711) and <hi rend="italic">The Spectator</hi> (1711-1712). Born just a few weeks
                        apart, Addison and Steele knew each other from the age of thirteen, and they also
                        overlapped at Oxford (though they attended different colleges, Addison going to
                        Queen's and Magdelen and Steele to Christ Church and Merton). They crossed paths
                        again in London in the early part of the eighteenth century; both of them had
                        political and literary ambitions. By all accounts, Addison and Steele had very
                        different personalities. Addison had many friends and seems to have been brilliant
                        at getting influential people to support and help him. But his personal demeanor was
                        serious and he wrote ambitious poems and the century's most significant verse
                        tragedy, <hi rend="italic">Cato</hi> (1713), a play that is rarely staged now but was a staple of the
                        repertory for decades. Steele was more a journalist at heart, and his plays are all
                        comedies (to be sure, Addison wrote a comedy, too, but it was not very successful,
                        whereas Steele had several hits). And a lot of people seemed to be unable to take
                        Steele very seriously; he was notorious for running up big debts, and was often
                        mocked in the public press of the period. </p>

                        <quote><hi rend="italic">Joseph Addison, by Sir Godfey Kneller, painted sometime around 1703-1712. National Portrait Gallery, London</hi></quote>
                        <p> Surely part of the difference between the two men and the way that they were
                            received by others  had to do with issues of class and ethnicity. Steele was Irish,
                            and although he was from a respectable family in Dublin (his father was an attorney)
                            he did not have much of a family network in England to help him make his way in the
                            world. He almost certainly faced his share of the prejudice against Irish people
                            that many English people harbored for centuries. After his time at Oxford (which he
                            left without completing a degree), Steele went into the army, and did well, rising
                            to become a captain. He started writing poetry and drama as a side project while he
                            was still in the military. At some point, though, his military career stalled, and
                            he came to London to work in the government; he got a position at court, and took on
                            the job of editing the official newspaper, the <hi rend="italic">London Gazette</hi>. Addison was not from
                            a particularly wealthy or noble family, either, but the Addisons were well-placed in
                            the power structure of the Church of England, the official state church. Addison's
                            father Lancelot was the chaplain of the English garrison at Tangier, in Morocco, and
                            would later become the Dean of the cathedral at Lichfield. One of Addison's brothers
                            became the English governor of Madras, in India. Joseph Addison seems to have been
                            identified early on as someone who would have a significant public career. After
                            finishing his degree at Oxford, he was sent on a grand tour of the continent at
                            government expense, and would go on to be a member of Parliament (he was essentially
                            given a seat there; he did not have to campaign) and a cabinet minister. </p>
                        <p> Steele left the <hi rend="italic">London Gazette</hi> and started <hi rend="italic">The Tatler</hi> in 1709. This journal, which was
                            published three times a week, was something new and innovative. Rather than focusing
                            on the news, it offered essays on a variety of topics: theater reviews, essays on
                            clothing and manners, and so on. It was fast-paced, entertaining, and in an age when
                            much print publication was bitterly political, was non-partisan. <hi rend="italic">The Tatler</hi> was
                            immediately popular. Steele asked Addison and other friends to join him (it was
                            surely hard to come up with enough material on his own), and Addison contributed
                            several dozen essays. The <hi rend="italic">Tatler</hi> folded at the start of 1711, but was almost
                                immediately followed by <hi rend="italic">The Spectator</hi>. Here Addison took the lead, contributing a
                            larger number of essays than Steele and, most scholars agree, setting the tone for
                            the new journal. <hi rend="italic">The Spectator</hi>, which was published every day except Sunday, ran 555
                            issues, until finally running out of steam. </p>
                        <p> Both journals were widely read in their first publication, and perhaps even more so
                            over the course of the next two centuries when they were collected together and
                            bound up as book-length volumes. A handsome bound set of the full run of the <hi rend="italic">Tatlers</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Spectators</hi> was
                            something that every middle-class household with aspirations to looking like its
                            members took literature seriously would want to have. These essays were published in
                            that kind of format scores of times in the English-speaking world, their essays
                            often being offered to students as examples of clear, vigorous English prose; they
                            were also translated into most of the European languages. In our time, these essays
                            have become newly relevant as having inaugurated what the sociologist Jürgen
                            Habermas dubbed "the bourgeois public sphere," a domain of society separate from the
                            state or the royal courts where middle class people came together to debate social
                            issues. Even more recently, these short, comparatively informal essays, published
                            frequently, have been compared to blogging. Well, maybe. Whatever the case, the
                            early eighteenth-century journalism of Joseph Addison and Richard Steele remains an
                            entertaining look into the attitudes, tastes, and styles of their period. </p></note><lb/><lb/>

                    <note xml:id="horace" target="horace_">"He intends not smoke from the flame, but fire from the smoke, so as to reveal wonderful things. Horace." Addison is quoting here from "The Art of Poetry," a verse treatise by the Roman poet Horace that was widely read in the eighteenth century. Addison could count on most of his educated readers knowing the allusion, since the poem was so widely taught in secondary schools. The joke here is that Addison is imagining this essay as being read aloud in smoke-filled coffeehouses.</note>

                <p>I HAVE observed, that a Reader seldom peruses a Book with Pleasure 'till he knows whether the Writer of it be a <ref target="black_" corresp="black">black or a fair Man</ref><note xml:id="black" target="black_">Dark or light skinned.</note>, of a <ref target="cholerick_" corresp="cholerick">mild or cholerick Disposition</ref><note xml:id="cholerick" target="cholerick_">A relaxed or angry disposition.</note>, Married or a Batchelor, with other Particulars of the like nature, that <ref target="conduce_" corresp="conduce">conduce</ref><note xml:id="conduce" target="conduce_">Contribute to.</note> very much to the right Understanding of an Author. To gratify this Curiosity, which is so natural to a Reader, I design this Paper, and my next, as <ref target="prefatory_" corresp="prefatory">Prefatory</ref><note xml:id="prefatory" target="prefatory_">introductory.</note> Discourses to my following Writings, and shall give some Account in them of the several persons that are engaged in this Work. As the chief trouble of Compiling, Digesting, and Correcting will fall to my Share, I must do myself the Justice to open the Work with my own History.</p> <lb/> <lb/>
                <p>I was born to a small Hereditary Estate, which according to the tradition of the village where it lies, was bounded by the same Hedges and Ditches in <ref target="william_" corresp="william"><hi rend="italic">William</hi> the Conqueror's</ref><note xml:id="william" target="william_">The Norman warlord who defeated the English king Harold at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 and became William I. </note> Time that it is at present, and has been delivered down from Father to Son whole and entire, without the Loss or Acquisition of a single Field or Meadow, during the Space of six hundred Years. There runs a Story in the Family, that when my Mother was gone with Child of me about three Months, she dreamt that she was brought to Bed of a Judge. Whether this might proceed from a Law-suit which was then depending in the Family, or my Fathers being a Justice of the Peace, I cannot determine; for I am not so vain as to think it <ref target="presaged_" corresp="presaged">presaged</ref><note xml:id="presaged" target="presaged_">Predict or foretell.</note> any Dignity that I should arrive at in my future Life, though that was the Interpretation the Neighbourhood put upon it. The Gravity of my Behaviour at my very first Appearance in the World, and all the Time that I <ref target="sucked_" corresp="sucked">sucked</ref><note xml:id="sucked" target="sucked_">breastfed</note>, seemed to favour my Mothers Dream: For, as she has often told me, I threw away my Rattle before I was two Months old, and would that was the Interpretation which the Neighbourhood put upon not make use of my <ref target="coral_" corresp="coral">Coral</ref><note xml:id="coral" target="coral_">That is, his teething ring; these were often made of coral in this period.</note> till they had taken away the Bells from it.</p> <lb/><lb/>
                <p>As for the rest of my Infancy, there being nothing in it remarkable, I shall pass it over in Silence. I find that, during my <ref target="nonage_" corresp="nonage">Nonage</ref><note xml:id="nonage" target="nonage_">Youth or childhood. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, I had the reputation of a very sullen Youth, but was always a Favourite of my School-master, who used to say, that my <ref target="parts_" corresp="parts">parts</ref><note xml:id="parts" target="parts_">Characteristics or elements of a person. </note> were solid and would wear well. I had not been long at the University, before I distinguished myself by a most profound Silence: For, during the Space of eight Years, excepting in the publick Exercises of the College, I scarce uttered the Quantity of an hundred Words; and indeed do not remember that I ever spoke three Sentences together in my whole Life. Whilst I was in this Learned Body, I applied myself with so much Diligence to my Studies, that there are very few celebrated Books, either in the Learned or the Modern Tongues, which I am not acquainted with.</p> <lb/><lb/>
                <p>Upon the Death of my Father I was resolved to travel into Foreign Countries, and therefore left the University, with the Character of an odd unaccountable Fellow, that had a great deal of Learning, if I would but show it. An insatiable Thirst after Knowledge carried me into all the Countries of Europe, in which there was any thing new or strange to be seen; nay, to such a Degree was my curiosity raised, that having read the controversies of some great Men concerning the Antiquities of <hi rend="italic">Egypt</hi>, I made a Voyage to <hi rend="italic">Grand Cairo</hi>, on purpose to take the Measure of a Pyramid; and, as soon as I had set my self right in that Particular, returned to my Native Country with great Satisfaction.</p><lb/><lb/>
                <p>I have passed my latter Years in this City, where I am frequently seen in most publick Places, tho there are not above half a dozen of my select Friends that know me; of whom my next Paper shall give a more particular Account. There is no place of general Resort wherein I do not often make my appearance; sometimes I am seen thrusting my Head into a Round of Politicians at <ref target="wills_" corresp="wills"><hi rend="italic">Wills</hi></ref><note xml:id="wills" target="wills_">Wills was a popular coffee shop. Coffee-drinking was comparatively new to England, havinug arrived as a practice, probably from Turkey, a few decades before. But coffee shops were everywhere in London in the early eighteenth century, becoming popular places for men (and they were almost-always male dominated domains) to socialize while they satisfied their cravings for caffeine and (since smoking pipes was also popular) nicotine. Over the next few lines, Mr. Spectator names several of the most popular coffee shops in central London at the time.</note>,  and listening with great Attention to the Narratives that are made in those little Circular Audiences. Sometimes I smoak a Pipe at <hi rend="italic">Childs</hi>; and, while I seem attentive to nothing but the <ref target="post-man_" corresp="post-man"><hi rend="italic">Post-man</hi></ref><note xml:id="post-man" target="post-man_">one of the daily newspapers in London at that time</note>, over-hear the Conversation of every Table in the Room. I appear on <hi rend="italic">Sunday</hi> nights at <hi rend="italic">St. James's Coffee</hi> House,  and sometimes join the little Committee of Politicks in the Inner-Room, as one who comes there to hear and improve. My Face is likewise very well known at the <hi rend="italic">Grecian</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Cocoa-Tree</hi>, and in the <ref target="theatres_" corresp="theatres">Theaters both of <hi rend="italic">Drury Lane and the Hay-Market</hi></ref><note xml:id="theatres" target="theatres_">The theaters on Drury Lane and the Hay-Market were the two state-licensed playhouses in central London. As Mr. Spectator implies here, theaters were as much places to be seen by others as to see a play; they were intensely social spaces, where theatergoers enjoyed the spectacle of other audience members almost as much--and sometimes more--than they enjoyed the performances on the stage.</note>. I have been taken for a Merchant upon the <hi rend="italic">Exchange</hi> for above these ten Years, and sometimes pass for a <hi rend="italic">Jew</hi> in the Assembly of <ref target="stock-jobbers_" corresp="stock-jobbers">Stock-Jobbers</ref><note xml:id="stock-jobbers" target="stock-jobbers_">stockbrokers, but the sense here is more pejorative than the word is today; selling stock in private companies was comparatively new, and looked at with suspicion by some</note> at <hi rend="italic">Jonathans</hi>. In short, where-ever I see a Cluster of People, I always mix with them, tho I never open my Lips but in my own Club.</p><lb/><lb/>
                <p>Thus I live in the World, rather as a Spectator of Mankind, than as one of the Species; by which means I have made my self a Speculative Statesman, Soldier, Merchant, and Artizan, without ever medling with any Practical Part in Life. I am very well versed in the Theory of an Husband, or a Father, and can discern the Errors in the Oeconomy, Business, and Diversion of others, better than those who are engaged in them; as Standers-by discover <ref target="blots_" corresp="blots">Blots</ref><note xml:id="blots" target="blots_">Exposed pieces in a game like backgammon, checkers, or chess. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, which are apt to escape those who are in the Game. I never espoused any Party with Violence, and am resolved to observe an exact Neutrality between the <ref target="politics_" corresp="politics">Whigs and Tories</ref><note xml:id="politics" target="politics_">The Whigs and the Tories were the two main political factions of the day. The <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> positioned itself as a neutral journal, and part of the reason why Addison and Steele tried to stay anonymous was to keep up that pretense, since they were both well known to be Whigs.</note>, unless I shall be forcd to declare myself by the Hostilities of either side. In short, I have acted in all the parts of my Life as a Looker-on, which is the <ref target="character_" corresp="character">Character</ref><note xml:id="character" target="character_">Addison is punning here on the sense of character as personal identity and character as a printed mark on a page.</note> I intend to preserve in this Paper.</p><lb/><lb/>
                <p>I have given the Reader just so much of my History and Character, as to let him see I am not altogether unqualified for the Business I have undertaken. As for other Particulars in my Life and Adventures, I shall insert them in following Papers, as I shall see occasion. In the mean time, when I consider how much I have seen, read, and heard, I begin to blame my own <ref target="taciturnity_" corresp="taciturnity">Taciturnity</ref><note xml:id="taciturnity" target="taciturnity_">silence</note>; and since I have neither Time nor Inclination to communicate the Fulness of my Heart in Speech, I am resolved to do it in Writing; and to Print my self out, if possible, before I Die. I have been often told by my Friends that it is Pity so many useful Discoveries which I have made, should be in the possession of a Silent Man. For this Reason therefore, I shall publish a Sheet full of Thoughts every Morning, for the Benefit of my Contemporaries; and if I can any way contribute to the Diversion or Improvement of the Country in which I live, I shall leave it, when I am summoned out of it, with the secret Satisfaction of thinking that I have not Lived in vain.</p><lb/><lb/>
                <p>There are three very material Points which I have not spoken to in this Paper, and which, for several important Reasons, I must keep to my self; at least for some Time: I mean, an Account of my Name, my Age, and my Lodgings. I must confess I would gratify my Reader in any thing that is reasonable; but as for these three Particulars, though I am sensible they might tend very much to the Embellishment of my Paper, I cannot yet come to a Resolution of communicating them to the Publick. They would indeed draw me out of that Obscurity which I have enjoyed for many Years, and expose me in Publick Places to several Salutes and Civilities, which have been always very disagreeable to me; for the greatest pain I can suffer, is the being talked to, and being stared at. It is for this Reason likewise, that I keep my Complexion and Dress, as very great Secrets; tho it is not impossible, but I may make Discoveries of both in the Progress of the Work I have undertaken.</p><lb/><lb/>
                <p>After having been thus particular upon my self; I shall in tomorrows Paper give an Account of those Gentlemen who are concerned with me in this Work. For, as I have before <ref target="intimated_" corresp="intimated">intimated</ref><note xml:id="intimated" target="intimated_">shared confidentially</note>, a Plan of it is laid and <ref target="concerted_" corresp="concerted">concerted</ref><note xml:id="concerted" target="concerted_">arranged or contrived by two or more people working "in consert"</note> (as all other Matters of Importance are) in a Club. However, as my Friends have engaged me to stand in the Front, those who have a mind to correspond with me, may direct their Letters <hi rend="italic">To the Spectator</hi>, at Mr. <hi rend="italic">Buckleys</hi>, in <hi rend="italic">Little Britain</hi>. For I must further acquaint the Reader, that tho our Club meets only on <hi rend="italic">Tuesdays</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Thursdays</hi>, we have appointed a Committee to sit every Night, for the Inspection of all such Papers as may contribute to the Advancement of the Public <ref target="weal_" corresp="weal">Weal</ref><note xml:id="weal" target="weal_">welfare and happiness </note>.</p><lb/><lb/> <lb/>
