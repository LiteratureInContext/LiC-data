Source: Oxford English Dictioanry</note> inquiring Day by Day after these my Papers, and receiving my Morning Lectures with a becoming Seriousness and Attention.

Since I have raised to myself so great an Audience, I shall spare no Pains to make their Instruction agreeable, and their Diversion useful. For which Reasons I shall endeavour to enliven Morality with Wit, and to temper Wit with Morality, that my Readers may, if possible, both Ways find their account in the Speculation of the Day. And to the End that their Virtue and Discretion may not be short transient intermitting Starts of Thought, I have resolved to refresh their Memories from Day to Day, till I have recovered them out of that desperate State of Vice and Folly, into which the Age is fallen. The Mind that lies <ref target="a004" corresp="n004">fallow</ref><note xml:id="n004" target="a004">Barren or uncultivated.

                <p>I would therefore in a very particular Manner recommend these my Speculations to all well-regulated Families, that set apart an Hour in every Morning for Tea and Bread and Butter; and would earnestly advise them for their Good to order this Paper to be punctually served up, and to be looked upon as a Part of the <ref target="a006" corresp="n006">Tea Equipage</ref><note xml:id="n006" target="a006">China and glass serving utensils for tea serving.

                <p>In the next Place, I would recommend this Paper to the daily Perusal of those Gentlemen whom I cannot but consider as my good Brothers and Allies, I mean the Fraternity of Spectators who live in the World without having any thing to do in it; and either by the Affluence of their Fortunes, or Laziness of their Dispositions, have no other Business with the rest of Mankind but to look upon them. Under this Class of Men are comprehended all contemplative Tradesmen, titular Physicians, Fellows of the <ref target="a010" corresp="n010">Royal Society</ref><note xml:id="n010" target="a010">A British learned society that is the oldest national scientific institution in the world. The society is still around today continually funding and recognizing scientific pursuits as well as bringing in new members. Notable members of the Royal Society over its years are Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, Alan Turing, Stephen Hawking, and even more recently Elon Musk.

In short, every one that considers the World as a Theatre, and desires to form a right Judgment of those who are the Actors on it.</p><lb/><lb/>
                <p>There is another Set of Men that I must likewise lay a Claim to, whom I have lately called the Blanks of Society, as being altogether unfurnish'd with Ideas, till the Business and Conversation of the Day has supplied them. I have often considered these poor Souls with an Eye of great <ref target="a012" corresp="n012">Commiseration</ref><note xml:id="n012" target="a012">Pity or sympathy.

As they lie at the Mercy of the first Man they meet, and are grave or <ref target="a014" corresp="n014">impertinent</ref><note xml:id="n014" target="a014">Irrelevant or disconnected.

Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> them not to stir out of their Chambers till they have read this Paper, and do promise them that I will daily instil into them such sound and wholesome Sentiments, as shall have a good Effect on their Conversation for the ensuing twelve Hours.</p><lb/><lb/>
                <p>But there are none to whom this Paper will be more useful than to the female World. I have often thought there has not been sufficient Pains taken in finding out proper Employments and Diversions for the Fair ones. Their Amusements seem contrived for them rather as they are Women, than as they are reasonable Creatures; and are more adapted to the Sex, than to the Species. The Toilet is their great Scene of Business, and the right adjusting of their Hair the principal Employment of their Lives. The sorting of a Suit of Ribbons is reckoned a very good Morning's Work; and if they make an Excursion to a <ref target="a017" corresp="n017">Mercer's</ref><note xml:id="n017" target="a017">A person who deals in fabrics and textiles. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> or a Toy-shop, so great a Fatigue makes them unfit for any thing else all the Day after. Their more serious Occupations are <ref target="a018" corresp="n018">Sowing</ref><note xml:id="n018" target="a018">(Draft-Do you think this means sewing as in fabric or sowing the land such as with flowers?)</note> and Embroidery, and their greatest <ref target="a019" corresp="n019">Drudgery</ref><note xml:id="n019" target="a019">Toil or wearisome labor.

Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>. This, I say, is the State of ordinary Women; tho' I know there are Multitudes of those of a more elevated Life and Conversation, that move in an <ref target="a021" corresp="n021">exalted</ref><note xml:id="n021" target="a021">(Draft-I didn't know whether I should define this or not so I did to be safe)Raised or elevated. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> Sphere of Knowledge and Virtue, that join all the Beauties of the Mind to the Ornaments of Dress, and inspire a kind of Awe and Respect, as well as Love, into their Male-Beholders. I hope to encrease the Number of these by publishing this daily Paper, which I shall always endeavour to make an innocent if not an improving Entertainment, and by that Means at least divert the Minds of my female Readers from greater Trifles. At the same Time, as I would fain give some finishing Touches to those which are already the most beautiful Pieces in humane Nature, I shall endeavour to point out all those Imperfections that are the Blemishes, as well as those Virtues which are the Embellishments, of the Sex. In the mean while I hope these my gentle Readers, who have so much Time on their Hands, will not grudge throwing away a Quarter of an Hour in a Day on this Paper, since they may do it without any Hindrance to Business.</p><lb/><lb/>
                <p>I know several of my Friends and Well-wishers are in great Pain for me, lest I should not be able to keep up the Spirit of a Paper which I oblige myself to furnish every Day: But to make them easy in this Particular, I will promise them faithfully to give it over as soon as I grow dull. This I know will be Matter of great <ref target="a022" corresp="n022">Raillery</ref><note xml:id="n022" target="a022">Good-humoured banter; jest. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> to the small Wits; who will frequently put me in mind of my Promise, desire me to keep my Word, assure me that it is high Time to give over, with many other little Pleasantries of the like Nature, which men of a little smart Genius cannot forbear throwing out against their best Friends, when they have such a Handle given them of being witty. But let them remember, that I do hereby enter my Caveat against this Piece of Raillery.</p><lb/><lb/>
