                    inquiring Day by Day after these my Papers, and receiving my Morning Lectures
                    with a becoming Seriousness and Attention. Mv Publisher tells me, that there are
                    already Three Thousand of them distributed every Day: So that if I allow Twenty
                    Readers to every Paper, which I look upon as a modest Computation, I may reckon
                    about <ref target="threescore_" corresp="threescore">Threescore

                        would be sold to coffeehouses, where, Addison is claiming, an average of
                        twenty readers would read each copy in the course of a day. Addison is
                        probably being accurate in the number of copies being printed, and 3000 was
                        a large print run at the time, especially for a new journal. The figure of
                        twenty readers for each issue is probably a best guess, perhaps a very
                        optimistic one.</note> Disciples in <hi rend="italic">London</hi> and <hi

                    Since I have raised to myself so great an Audience, I shall spare no Pains to
                    make their Instruction agreeable, and their Diversion useful. For which Reasons
                    I shall endeavour to enliven Morality with Wit, and to temper Wit with Morality,
                    that my Readers may, if possible, both Ways find their account in the
                    Speculation of the Day. And to the End that their Virtue and Discretion may not
                    be short transient intermitting Starts of Thought, I have resolved to refresh
                    their Memories from Day to Day, till I have recovered them out of that desperate
                    State of Vice and Folly, into which the Age is fallen. The Mind that lies <ref

                    in Clubs and Assemblies, at Tea-tables, and in Coffee houses.</p>
                <p>I would therefore in a very particular Manner recommend these my Speculations to

                    Bread and Butter; and would earnestly advise them for their Good to order this

                <p>There is another Set of Men that I must likewise lay a Claim to, whom I have
                    lately called the Blanks of Society, as being altogether unfurnish'd with Ideas,
                    till the Business and Conversation of the Day has supplied them. I have often

                    what to talk of; till about twelve a Clock in the Morning; for by that Time they

                <p>But there are none to whom this Paper will be more useful than to the female
                    World. I have often thought there has not been sufficient Pains taken in finding
                    out proper Employments and Diversions for the Fair ones. Their Amusements seem
                    contrived for them rather as they are Women, than as they are reasonable
                    Creatures; and are more adapted to the Sex, than to the Species. The <ref

                    there are Multitudes of those of a more elevated Life and Conversation, that
                    move in an exalted Sphere of Knowledge and Virtue, that join all the Beauties of
                    the Mind to the Ornaments of Dress, and inspire a kind of Awe and Respect, as
                    well as Love, into their Male-Beholders. I hope to encrease the Number of these
                    by publishing this daily Paper, which I shall always endeavour to make an
                    innocent if not an improving Entertainment, and by that Means at least divert
                    the Minds of my female Readers from greater Trifles. At the same Time, as I
                    would fain give some finishing Touches to those which are already the most
                    beautiful Pieces in humane Nature, I shall endeavour to point out all those
                    Imperfections that are the Blemishes, as well as those Virtues which are the
                    Embellishments, of the Sex. In the mean while I hope these my gentle Readers,
                    who have so much Time on their Hands, will not grudge throwing away a Quarter of
                    an Hour in a Day on this Paper, since they may do it without any Hindrance to
                    Business.</p>
                <p>I know several of my Friends and Well-wishers are in great Pain for me, lest I
                    should not be able to keep up the Spirit of a Paper which I oblige myself to
                    furnish every Day: But to make them easy in this Particular, I will promise them
                    faithfully to give it over as soon as I grow dull. This I know will be Matter of

                    Friends, when they have such a Handle given them of being witty. But let them
