                  “presid[e] over the different kinds of poetry, and over the arts and sciences."
                  The “invocation of the muse” to aid the poet's work is often used by
                  neoclassical authors like those whom Wheatley has clearly read and was
                  influenced by, including <ref target="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/685428">Milton</ref> and <ref target="https://books.google.com/books?id=ZCBgqF1yFXYC">Pope</ref>. However, Hilene Flanzbaum suggests
                  that Wheatley’s notably frequent invocation of the muse is more significant
                  than formulaic or imitative--it is “the very means by which she usurps power
                  for herself and claims a berth for her own thoughts, emotions and desires. And
                  while some may claim that these functions accompany any appearance of the muse,
                  when the muses bestow their power on a black female slave, they transport
                  Wheatley to a domain surprisingly free of restriction and previously forbidden”
