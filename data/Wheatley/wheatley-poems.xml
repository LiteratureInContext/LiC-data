             <head type="title">PREFACE.</head>
<p>          THE following POEMS were written originally for the Amusement of the Author, as they were the Products of her leisure Moments. She had no Intention ever to have published them; nor would they now have made their Appearance, but at the Importunity of many of her best, and most generous Friends; to whom she considers herself, as under the greatest Obligations.
</p>          
<p>          As her Attempts in Poetry are now sent into the World, it is hoped the Critic will not severely censure their Defects; and we presume they have too much Merit
        <pb n="v" facs="pageImages/v.jpg"/>
   to be cast aside with Contempt, and worthless and trifling Effusions.</p> 
          
<p>          As to the Disadvantages she has laboured under, with Regard to Learning, nothing needs to be offered, as her Master's Letter in the following Page will sufficiently shew the Difficulties in the Respect she had to encounter.
</p>          
<p>          With all their Imperfections, the Poems are now humbly submitted to the Perusal of the Public.

          <head type="title">The following is a Copy of a LETTER sent by the Author's Master to the Publisher</head>
<p>          PHILLIS was brought from Africa to America, in the Year 1761, between Seven and Eight Years of Age. Without any Assistance from School Education, and by only what she was taught in the Family, she, in sixteen Months Time from her Arrival, attained the English Language, to which she was an utter Stranger before, the such a Degree, as to read any, the most difficult Parts of the Sacred Writings, to the great Astonishment of all who heard her.
</p>          
   <p>          As to her WRITING, her own Curiosity led her to it; and this she learnt in so short a Time, that in the Year 1765, she wrote <ref target="occom_" corresp="occom">a Letter to the Rev. Mr. OCCOM</ref><note xml:id="occom"
      target="occom_" type="editorial" resp="editors.xml#MUStudStaff">In Wheatley's letter to Samson Occom, she affirms his "Vindication of their [the enslaved] natural Rights." She concludes with an ellipsis in which she implicitly criticizes the "strange Absurdity" of Christian slavers. To read the letter in its entirety, visit <ref target="https://viva.pressbooks.pub/amlit1/chapter/letter-to-rev-samson-occom-1774-phillis-wheatley/">American Literature I</ref>. <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Occom">Samson Occom</ref> (1723-1792), a Native American member of the Mohegan nation, was an author, teacher, judge, and Presbyterian minister. The image here, via Wikimedia Commons, is a mezzotint portrait of the Reverend Occom from 1768. <graphic url="notes/Samson_Occom_by_Jonathan_Spilsbury,_after_Mason_Chamberlin,_1768,_mezzotint_on_paper,_from_the_National_Portrait_Gallery_-_NPG-NPG_71_15Occom1L-000001.jpeg"/></note>, the Indian Minister, while in England.
   </p>          
<p>          She has a great Inclination to learn the Latin Tongue, and has made some Progress in it. This Relation is given by her Master who bought her, and with whom she now lives.

<p>          AS it has been repeatedly suggested to the Publisher, by Persons, who have seen the Manuscript, that Numbers would be ready to suspect they were not really the Writings of PHILLIS, he has procured the following Attestation, from the most respectable Characters in Boston, that none might have the least Ground for disputing their Original.
</p>          
             <p>          WE whose Names are under-written, do assure the World, that the POEMS specified in the following Page, <ref target="a02" corresp="n02">*</ref><note xml:id="n02"
                target="a02" type="authorial">The Words "following Page," allude to the Contents of the Manuscript Copy, which are wrote at the Back of the Above Attestation. [Publisher's note] </note> were (as we verily believe) written by PHILLIS, a young Negro Girl, who was but a few Years since, brought an uncultivated Barbarian from Africa, and has ever since been, and now is, under the Disadvantage of serving as a Slave in a Family in this Town. She has been examined by some of the best Judges, and is thought qualified to write them.

                     url="notes/008.JPG"/>Maecenas was the wealthy patron of classical Roman
                  poets Virgil and Horace, whom Wheatley draws on in complex ways. Wheatley's
                  poem "To Maecenas" opens her collection, which position gives it a powerful
                  significance as she claims the right to speak within this tradition. Like <ref
                     target="http://data.perseus.org/texts/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0893.phi001.perseus-eng1"
                     >Horace's Odes to Maecenas</ref>, Wheatley's offers praise to her patron,
                  but does so in ways that are fraught with the equivocalities of being an
                  enslaved African working within the languge and culture of the colonial master. For a deeper
                  reading of "To Maecenas," see Paula Bennett's journal article, "Phillis
                  Wheatley's Vocation and the Paradox of the 'Afric Muse.'" Following other
                  scholars, Bennett identifies Wheatley's poet-patron as Mather Byles, one of the
                  signatories verifying her authorship. The image included here shows the
                  attestation to the public, included in the 1773 edition of Wheatley's poems,

                  “presid[e] over the different kinds of poetry, and over the arts and sciences."
                  The “invocation of the muse” to aid the poet's work is often used by
                  neoclassical authors like those whom Wheatley has clearly read and was

                  that Wheatley’s notably frequent invocation of the muse is more significant
                  than formulaic or imitative--it is “the very means by which she usurps power
                  for herself and claims a berth for her own thoughts, emotions and desires. And
                  while some may claim that these functions accompany any appearance of the muse,
                  when the muses bestow their power on a black female slave, they transport

                  />The title of one Wheatley's most
                     (in)famous poems, "On being brought from AFRICA to AMERICA" alludes to the
                     experiences of many Africans who became subject to the <ref

                        >transatlantic slave trade</ref>. Wheatley uses biblical references and
                     direct address to appeal to a Christian audience, while also defending the
                     ability of her "sable race" to become "refin'd" through Christian theology.
                     Henry Louis Gates, who in <ref

                           >Figures in Black: Words, Signs, and the "Racial" Self</hi></ref> (1989)
                     situates Wheatley as an important voice in the eighteenth-century debate about
                     natural human rights, summarizes the "recurrent suggestion that Wheatley has
                     remained aloof from matters that were in any sense racial, or more correctly,
                     'positively' racial," as a "misreading" (74-75). Notable for the complexity of
                     its brief discussion of blackness in the Christian slaveholding American
                     republic, this poem in particular is frequently criticized for its apparent
                     rejection of Africa and African-ness. However, Wheatley was working within a
                     non-free context, and her critique of slavery is mediated by Christianity
                     acquired as part of her enslavement. For a fuller exploration of Wheatley’s

               <graphic url="notes/George-Whitefield.jpg" style="float:right" width="400px"/>
               George Whitefield (1714-1770; pronounced "wit-field") was one of the most famous people of the eighteenth-century Anglophone world. As a student at Oxford in the early 1730s, he got to know John and Charles Wesley, the founders of the Methodist movement in the church of England. Whitefield joined them in attempting to "methodize" the faith, returning it to the simple principles of the early church. But more than the Wesley brothers, Whitefield made this reformist movement into a public ministry. A famously charismatic public speaker, Whitefield preached to crowds numbering in the thousands in England and the American colonies, becoming a central figure in what was known as the "Great Awakening," a revival of evangelical Protestantism that was influential on both sides of the Atlantic. Benjamin Franklin and Olaudah Equiano were each impressed (though in very different ways) when they saw Whitefield preach in Philadelphia and Savannah, respectively. Whitefield made several visits to the Boston area, and it seems likely that the Wheatleys saw him preach there. Phillis might very well have joined them, but we cannot be sure. Whitefield died unexpectedly in Newburyport, Massachusetts on September 30, 1770, a few days after he left Boston on what turned out to be his last tour of the colonies.</p>
               <p>Phillis Wheatley's elegy for Whitefield changed her life, transforming her from a young enslaved woman with a small readership among friends of the Wheatley family to an author with an international readership. The poem was published as a broadside on October 11, 1770, and was an immediate success. It was reprinted several times in colonial cities, as well as London, and also appeared in several newspapers. The poem brought Wheatley to the attention of Selina, the Countess of Huntingdon, who is addressed in the poem itself. A fervent Methodist herself, the Countess was Whitefield's patron, supporting him on his evangelical missions. The Countess became Wheatley's patron as well, sponsoring the publication of her only volume of poems, published in London in 1773.</p>

Selina Hastings, the countess of Huntingdon (1707-1791), was a major figure in the Methodist movement, using her wealth to support the founding of chapels and a training school for ministers. Whitefield became her personal chaplain in the 1740s. Wheatley sought and recieved her patronage as well, and Wheatley's 1773 volume of poems was published with her support.

            <note xml:id="n0006" target="a0006" type="editorial" resp="editors.xml#JOB">Whitefield first came to the American colonies in 1738, when he travelled to Savannah, Georgia, where the colony's trustees had hired him to serve as minister. He decided to make his main project in Savannah the establishment of an orphanage, and he returned to England after only four months to raise money for the project. The Bethesda Orphan House was founded in 1740, and Whitefield continued to raise money and to return for visits to the institution throughout his lifetime.</note>
