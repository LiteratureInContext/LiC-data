                        url="notes/008.JPG"/>Maecenas was the wealthy patron of classical Roman
                     poets Virgil and Horace, whom Wheatley draws on in complex ways. Wheatley's
                     poem "To Maecenas" opens her collection, which position gives it a powerful
                     significance as she claims the right to speak within this tradition. Like <ref
                        target="http://data.perseus.org/texts/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0893.phi001.perseus-eng1"
                        >Horace's Odes to Maecenas</ref>, Wheatley's offers praise to her patron,
                     but does so in ways that are fraught with the equivocalities of being an
                     enslaved African working within the languge and culture of the colonial master. For a deeper
                     reading of "To Maecenas," see Paula Bennett's journal article, "Phillis
                     Wheatley's Vocation and the Paradox of the 'Afric Muse.'" Following other
                     scholars, Bennett identifies Wheatley's poet-patron as Mather Byles, one of the
                     signatories verifying her authorship. The image included here shows the
                     attestation to the public, included in the 1773 edition of Wheatley's poems,
                     certifying that they were indeed written by "PHILLIS, a young Negro Girl, who

                     and lead the Myrmidons against the Trojans. When Patroclus is killed by Hector,
