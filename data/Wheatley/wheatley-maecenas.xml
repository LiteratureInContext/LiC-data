                        width="300px" style="float:right"/>The title of one Wheatley's most
                        (in)famous poems, "On being brought from AFRICA to AMERICA" alludes to the
                        experiences of many Africans who became subject to the <ref
                           target="http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/slave-route/transatlantic-slave-trade/"
                           >transatlantic slave trade</ref>. Wheatley uses biblical references and
                        direct address to appeal to a Christian audience, while also defending the
                        ability of her "sable race" to become "refin'd" through Christian theology.
                        Henry Louis Gates, who in <ref
                           target="https://books.google.com/books?id=vzXnCwAAQBAJ"><hi rend="italic"
                              >Figures in Black: Words, Signs, and the "Racial" Self</hi></ref> (1989)
                        situates Wheatley as an important voice in the eighteenth-century debate about
                        natural human rights, summarizes the "recurrent suggestion that Wheatley has
                        remained aloof from matters that were in any sense racial, or more correctly,
                        'positively' racial," as a "misreading" (74-75). Notable for the complexity of
                        its brief discussion of blackness in the Christian slaveholding American
                        republic, this poem in particular is frequently criticized for its apparent
                        rejection of Africa and African-ness. However, Wheatley was working within a
                        non-free context, and her critique of slavery is mediated by Christianity
                        acquired as part of her enslavement. For a fuller exploration of Wheatley’s
                        poem, see <ref target="https://books.google.com/books?id=xjBRKDHdMmsC"><hi

Wheatley's poem "To Maecenas" opens her collection, which position gives it a powerful significance as she claims the right to speak within this tradition. Like <ref target="http://data.perseus.org/texts/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0893.phi001.perseus-eng1">Horace's Odes to Maecenas</ref>, Wheatley's offers praise to her patron, but does so in ways that are fraught with the equivocalities of being an enslaved African working in the languge of the colonial master. For a deeper reading of "To Maecenas," see Paula Bennett's journal article, "Phillis Wheatley's Vocation and the Paradox of the 'Afric Muse.'" Following other scholars, Bennett identifies Wheatley's poet-patron as Mather Byles, one of the signatories verifying her authorship. The image included here shows the attestation to the public, included in the 1773 edition of Wheatley's poems, certifying that they were indeed written by "PHILLIS, a young Negro Girl, who was but a few Years since, brought an uncultivated Barbarian from <hi rend="italic">Africa</hi>,...and now is, under the Disadvantage of serving as a Slave in a Family in [Boston]." the </note>, you, beneath the myrtle shade,</l>
