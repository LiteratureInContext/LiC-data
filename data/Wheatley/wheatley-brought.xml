                                     "view our sable race with scornful eye" (5) is a clear rejection of what <ref target="https://books.google.com/books?id=pxaTAgAAQBAJ">Lena Hill describes
                                      as "ignorant" interpretations of "visual blackness" (37-38)</ref>, as is her
                                     attribution of speech in direct discourse: "'Their color is a diabolic die'"
                                     (6). Henry Louis Gates argues that Wheatley's very presence as an author
                                     complicated assumptions of "natural" inferiority. For more about this topic,

                                    >transatlantic slave trade</ref>. Wheatley uses biblical references and
                                 direct address to appeal to a Christian audience, while also defending the
                                 ability of her "sable race" to become "refin'd" through Christian theology.
                                 Henry Louis Gates, who in <ref target="https://books.google.com/books?id=vzXnCwAAQBAJ"><hi rend="italic">Figures in Black:
                                    Words, Signs, and the "Racial" Self</hi></ref> (1989) situates Wheatley
                                 as an important voice in the eighteenth-century debate about natural human
                                 rights, summarizes the "recurrent suggestion that Wheatley has remained aloof
                                 from matters that were in any sense racial, or more correctly, 'positively'
                                 racial," as a "misreading" (74-75). Notable for the complexity of its brief
                                 discussion of blackness in the Christian slaveholding American republic, this
                                 poem in particular is frequently criticized for its apparent rejection of
                                 Africa and African-ness. However, Wheatley was working within a non-free
                                 context, and her critique of slavery is mediated by Christianity acquired as
                                 part of her enslavement. For a fuller exploration of Wheatley’s poem, see <ref
