                <p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> is a little remarkable, that—though disinclined to
                talk overmuch of myself and my affairs at the fireside,
                and to my personal friends—an autobiographical impulse <!-- im-pulse -->
                should twice in my life have taken possession of
                me, in addressing the public. The first time was three
                or four years since, when I favored the reader—inexcusably, <!-- in-excusably -->
                and for no earthly reason, that either the indulgent <!-- in-dulgent -->
                reader or the intrusive author could imagine—with
                a description of my way of life in the deep quietude <!-- qui-etude -->
                of an Old Manse. And now—because, beyond
                my deserts, I was happy enough to find a listener or
                two on the former occasion—I again seize the public
                by the button, and talk of my three years' experience
                in a Custom-House. The example of the famous “<ref target="_p-p-clerk" corresp="p-p-clerk">P.

                him, better than most of his schoolmates and life-mates. <!-- life-mates -->
                Some authors, indeed, do far more than this,

                and a view of the alms-house at the other,—such being
                the features of my native town, it would be quite as
                reasonable to form a sentimental attachment to a disarranged <!-- dis-arranged -->
                checkerboard. And yet, though invariably
                happiest elsewhere, there is within me a feeling for
                old Salem, which, in lack of a better phrase, I must be
                content to call affection. The sentiment is probably
                assignable to the deep and aged roots which my family
                has struck into the soil. It is now nearly <ref corresp="two-centuries-and-quarter" target="_two-centuries-and-quarter">two centuries
                and a quarter</ref><note target="_two-centuries-and-quarter" xml:id="two-centuries-and-quarter" resp="editors.xml#VBS" type="editorial">Aka: 225 years</note>
                since the original Briton, the earliest
                emigrant of my name, made his appearance in the wild
                and forest-bordered settlement, which has since become
                a city. And here his descendants have been born and
                died, and have mingled their earthy substance with the
                soil; until no small portion of it must necessarily be
                akin to the mortal frame wherewith, for a little while,
                I walk the streets. In part, therefore, the attachment
                which I speak of is the mere sensuous sympathy of
                dust for dust. Few of my countrymen can know what
                it is; nor, as frequent transplantation is perhaps better
                for the stock, need they consider it desirable to know.</p>
                
                <p>But the sentiment has likewise its moral quality. The

                figure of that first ancestor, invested by family tradition
                with a dim and dusky grandeur, was present to my
                boyish imagination, as far back as I can remember.
                It still haunts me, and induces a sort of home-feeling <!-- home-feeling -->
                with the past, which I scarcely claim in reference <!-- refer-ence -->
                to the present phase of the town. I seem to

                his hard severity towards a woman of their sect, which
                will last longer, it is to be feared, than any record of
                his better deeds, although these were many. His son,
                too, inherited the persecuting spirit, and made himself
                so conspicuous in the martyrdom of the witches, that
                their blood may fairly be said to have left a stain upon
                him. So deep a stain, indeed, that his old dry bones,
                in the Charter Street burial-ground, must still retain it,
                if they have not crumbled utterly to dust! I know not

                whatever faults besides he may see or imagine, are

                as powerfully as if the natal spot were an earthly
                paradise. So has it been in my case. I felt it almost
                as a destiny to make Salem my home; so that the mould
                of features and cast of character which had all along
                been familiar here—ever, as one representative of the
                race lay down in his grave, another assuming, as it
                were, his sentry-march along the Main Street—might
                still in my little day be seen and recognized in the old
                town. Nevertheless, this very sentiment is an evidence
                that the connection, which has become an unhealthy
                one, should at last be severed. Human nature will
                not flourish, any more than a potato, if it be planted
                and replanted, for too long a series of generations, in
                the same worn-out soil. My children have had other
                birthplaces, and, so far as their fortunes may be within
                my control, shall strike their roots into unaccustomed

                knew it too, but could never quite find in my heart to

                or the blast of a clarion. Looking at him merely
                as an animal,—and there was very little else to look
                at,—he was a most satisfactory object, from the
                thorough healthfulness and wholesomeness of his system, <!-- sys-tem -->
                and his capacity, at that extreme age, to enjoy all,
                or nearly all, the delights which he had ever aimed at,
                or conceived of. The careless security of his life in
                the Custom-House, on a regular income, and with but
                slight and infrequent apprehensions of removal, had no
                doubt contributed to make time pass lightly over him.
                The original and more potent causes, however, lay in
                the rare perfection of his animal nature, the moderate
                proportion of intellect, and the very trifling admixture
                of moral and spiritual ingredients; these latter qualities,
                indeed, being in barely enough measure to keep the
                old gentleman from walking on all-fours. He possessed
                no power of thought, no depth of feeling, no troublesome <!-- trouble-some -->
                sensibilities; nothing, in short, but a few commonplace <!-- common-place -->
                instincts, which, aided by the cheerful temper
                that grew inevitably out of his physical well-being, did
                duty very respectably, and to general acceptance, in
                lieu of a heart. He had been the husband of three
                wives, all long since dead; the father of twenty children, <!-- chil-dren -->
                most of whom, at every age of childhood or maturity, <!-- ma-turity -->
                had likewise returned to dust. Here, one would

                tinge. Not so with our old Inspector! One brief sigh
                sufficed to carry off the entire burden of these dismal
                reminiscences. The next moment, he was as ready
                for sport as any unbreeched infant; far readier than
                the Collector's junior clerk, who, at nineteen years,
                was much the elder and graver man of the two.</p>

                <p>I used to watch and study this patriarchal personage
                with, I think, livelier curiosity than any other form of
                humanity there presented to my notice. He was, in
                truth, a rare phenomenon; so perfect in one point of
                view; so shallow, so delusive, so impalpable, such an
                absolute nonentity, in every other. My conclusion was
                that he had no soul, no heart, no mind; nothing, as I
                have already said, but instincts; and yet, withal, so
                cunningly had the few materials of his character been
                put together, that there was no painful perception of
                deficiency, but, on my part, an entire contentment with
                what I found in him. It might be difficult—and it
                was so—to conceive how he should exist hereafter,
                so earthy and sensuous did he seem; but surely his
                existence here, admitting that it was to terminate with
                his last breath, had been not unkindly given; with no
                higher moral responsibilities than the beasts of the field,
                but with a larger scope of enjoyment than theirs, and
                with all their blessed immunity from the dreariness and
                duskiness of age.</p>
                
                <p>One point, in which he had vastly the advantage over

                his energies and ingenuities to subserve the delight and
                profit of his maw, it always pleased and satisfied me to
                hear him expatiate on fish, poultry, and butcher's meat,
                and the most eligible methods of preparing them for
                the table. His reminiscences of good cheer, however
                ancient the date of the actual banquet, seemed to bring
                the savor of pig or turkey under one's very nostrils.
                There were flavors on his palate, that had lingered
                there not less than sixty or seventy years, and were still
                apparently as fresh as that of the mutton-chop which
                he had just devoured for his breakfast. I have heard
                him smack his lips over dinners, every guest at which,
                except himself, had long been food for worms. It was
                marvellous to observe how the ghosts of bygone meals
                were continually rising up before him; not in anger or
                retribution, but as if grateful for his former appreciation, <!-- apprecia-tion -->
                and seeking to reduplicate an endless series of
                enjoyment, at once shadowy and sensual. A tenderloin <!-- tender-loin -->

                a particular chicken, or a remarkably praiseworthy
                turkey, which had perhaps adorned his board in the
                days of the elder Adams, would be remembered; while
                all the subsequent experience of our race, and all the
                events that brightened or darkened his individual career,
                had gone over him with as little permanent effect as
                the passing breeze. The chief tragic event of the old
                man's life, so far as I could judge, was his mishap
                with a certain goose, which lived and died some twenty
                <pb n="22"/>
                or forty years ago; a goose of most promising figure,
                but which, at table, proved so inveterately tough that
                the carving-knife would make no impression on its
                carcass; and it could only be divided with an axe and
                handsaw.</p>

                I should be glad to dwell at considerably more length,
                because, of all men whom I have ever known, this individual <!-- in-dividual -->
                was fittest to be a Custom-House officer. Most
                persons, owing to causes which I may not have space
                to hint at, suffer moral detriment from this peculiar
                mode of life. The old Inspector was incapable of it,
                and, were he to continue in office to the end of time,
                would be just as good as he was then, and sit down to

                across the floor, attain his customary chair beside the
                fireplace. There he used to sit, gazing with a somewhat <!-- some-what -->

                and went; amid the rustle of papers, the administering <!-- administer-ing -->

                talk of the office; all which sounds and circumstances

                to make their way into his inner sphere of contemplation. <!-- contem-plation -->
                His countenance, in this repose, was mild and
                kindly. If his notice was sought, an expression of
                courtesy and interest gleamed out upon his features;
                proving that there was light within him, and that it was
                only the outward medium of the intellectual lamp that
                obstructed the rays in their passage. The closer you
                penetrated to the substance of his mind, the sounder it
                appeared. When no longer called upon to speak, or
                listen, either of which operations cost him an evident
                effort, his face would briefly subside into its former not
                uncheerful quietude. It was not painful to behold this

                qualities which showed it to be not by a mere accident,
                but of good right, that he had won a distinguished name.

                his life, have required an impulse to set him in motion;
                but, once stirred up, with obstacles to overcome, and an
                adequate object to be attained, it was not in the man to

                his nature, and which was not yet extinct, was never of
                the kind that flashes and flickers in a blaze, but, rather,
                a deep, red glow, as of iron in a furnace. Weight,
                solidity, firmness; this was the expression of his repose,
                even in such decay as had crept untimely over him, at
                the period of which I speak. But I could imagine, even
                then, that, under some excitement which should go

                starting up once more a warrior. And, in so intense a
                moment, his demeanour would have still been calm.

                Such an exhibition, however, was but to be pictured in

                <p>It contributes greatly towards a man's moral and intellectual <!-- in-tellectual -->
                health, to be brought into habits of companionship <!-- compan-ionship -->
                with individuals unlike himself, who care little
                for his pursuits, and whose sphere and abilities he must
                go out of himself to appreciate. The accidents of my
                life have often afforded me this advantage, but never
                with more fulness and variety than during my continuance <!-- continu-ance -->
                in office. There was one man, especially, the
                observation of whose character gave me a new idea of
                talent. His gifts were emphatically those of a man of
                business; prompt, acute, clear-minded; with an eye
                that saw through all perplexities, and a faculty of arrangement <!--ar-rangement -->

                an enchanter's wand. Bred up from boyhood in the
                Custom-House, it was his proper field of activity; and

                regularity of a perfectly comprehended system. In
                my contemplation, he stood as the ideal of his class.
                He was, indeed, the Custom-House in himself; or, at
                all events, the main-spring that kept its variously revolving <!-- re-volving -->
                wheels in motion; for, in an institution like
                this, where its officers are appointed to subserve their
                own profit and convenience, and seldom with a leading
                reference to their fitness for the duty to be performed,
                they must perforce seek elsewhere the dexterity which
                is not in them. Thus, by an inevitable necessity, as a
                magnet attracts steel-filings, so did our man of business
                draw to himself the difficulties which everybody met

                of his vocation, would trouble such a man very much

                nourish myself with food for which I had hitherto had
                little appetite. Even the old Inspector was desirable,
                as a change of diet, to a man who had known <persName type="lcnaf" key="n79117152">Alcott.</persName>

                part of a thorough organization, that, with such
                associates to remember, I could mingle at once with
                men of altogether different qualities, and never murmur
                at the change.</p>
                
                <p>Literature, its exertions and objects, were now of
                <pb n="30"/>
                little moment in my regard. I cared not, at this period,
                for books; they were apart from me. Nature,—except
                it were human nature,—the nature that is developed <!-- de-veloped -->
                in earth and sky, was, in one sense, hidden
                from me; and all the imaginative delight, wherewith
                it had been spiritualized, passed away out of my mind.
                A gift, a faculty, if it had not departed, was suspended
                and inanimate within me. There would have been
                something sad, unutterably dreary, in all this, had I not
                been conscious that it lay at my own option to recall
                whatever was valuable in the past. It might be true,
                indeed, that this was a life which could not, with impunity, <!-- im-punity -->
                be lived too long; else, it might make me permanently <!-- per-manently -->
                other than I had been, without transforming
                me into any shape which it would be worth my while
                to take. But I never considered it as other than a <ref corresp="transitory" target="_transitory">transitory</ref>

                life. There was always a prophetic instinct, a
                low whisper in my ear, that, within no long period, and
                whenever a new change of custom should be essential
                to my good, a change would come.</p>
                
                <p>Meanwhile, there I was, a Surveyor of the Revenue,
                and, so far as I have been able to understand, as good
                a Surveyor as need be. A man of thought, fancy,
                and sensibility, (had he ten times the Surveyor's proportion <!-- pro-portion -->
                of those qualities,) may, at any time, be a man
                of affairs, if he will only choose to give himself the
                trouble. My fellow-officers, and the merchants and
                sea-captains with whom my official duties brought me
                into any manner of connection, viewed me in no other
                light, and probably knew me in no other character.
                None of them, I presume, had ever read a page of my

                each of whom was a Custom-House officer in his
                day, as well as I. It is a good lesson—though it may
                often be a hard one—for a man who has dreamed of
                literary fame, and of making for himself a rank among
                the world's dignitaries by such means, to step aside
                out of the narrow circle in which his claims are recognized, <!-- recog-nized -->
                and to find how utterly devoid of significance,
                beyond that circle, is all that he achieves, and all he
                aims at. I know not that I especially needed the lesson,
                either in the way of warning or rebuke; but, at any
                rate, I learned it thoroughly; nor, it gives me pleasure

                the law of literary propriety to offer the public the

                <p>In the second story of the Custom-House, there is
                a large room, in which the brick-work and naked rafters <!-- raf-ters -->
                have never been covered with panelling and plaster.
                The edifice—originally projected on a scale adapted
                to the old commercial enterprise of the port, and with
                an idea of subsequent prosperity destined never to be
                realized—contains far more space than its occupants
                know what to do with. This airy hall, therefore, over
                the Collector's apartments, remains unfinished to this
                day, and, in spite of the aged cobwebs that <ref corresp="festoon" target="_festoon">festoon</ref>

                carpenter and mason. At one end of the room, in a

                quantities of similar rubbish lay lumbering the floor.
                It was sorrowful to think how many days, and weeks,
                and months, and years of toil, had been wasted on

                Indian arrow-heads in the field near the Old Manse.</p>
                
                <p>But, one idle and rainy day, it was my fortune to
                make a discovery of some little interest. Poking and
                burrowing into the heaped-up rubbish in the corner;
                unfolding one and another document, and reading the
                names of vessels that had long ago foundered at sea
                or rotted at the wharves, and those of merchants, never
                heard of now on 'Change, nor very readily decipherable <!-- deciphera-ble -->
                on their mossy tombstones; glancing at such matters <!-- mat-ters -->
                with the saddened, weary, half-reluctant interest
                which we bestow on the corpse of dead activity,—and
                exerting my fancy, sluggish with little use, to raise up
                from these dry bones an image of the old town's
                brighter aspect, when India was a new region, and only
                Salem knew the way thither,—I chanced to lay my
                hand on a small package, carefully done up in a piece
                of ancient yellow parchment. This envelope had the
                air of an official record of some period long past, when
                clerks engrossed their stiff and formal chirography on
                more substantial materials than at present. There was
                something about it that quickened an instinctive curiosity, <!-- curi-osity -->
                and made me undo the faded red tape, that tied
                up the package, with the sense that a treasure would
                <pb n="35"/>
                here be brought to light. Unbending the rigid folds of
                the parchment cover, I found it to be a commission,
                under the hand and seal of Governor Shirley, in favor
                of one Jonathan Pue, as Surveyor of his Majesty's
                Customs for the port of Salem, in the Province of
                Massachusetts Bay. I remembered to have read ( probably <!-- prob-ably -->

                Surveyor Pue, about fourscore years ago; and likewise,
                in a newspaper of recent times, an account of the digging <!-- dig-ging -->
                up of his remains in the little grave-yard of St.
                Peter's Church, during the renewal of that edifice.
                Nothing, if I rightly call to mind, was left of my respected <!-- re=spected -->
                predecessor, save an imperfect skeleton, and
                some fragments of apparel, and a wig of majestic frizzle; <!-- friz-zle -->
                which, unlike the head that it once adorned, was
                in very satisfactory preservation. But, on examining
                the papers which the parchment commission served
                to envelop, I found more traces of Mr. Pue's mental
                part, and the internal operations of his head, than the
                frizzled wig had contained of the venerable skull
                itself.</p>
                
                <p>They were documents, in short, not official, but of a
                private nature, or, at least, written in his private capacity, <!-- ca=pacity -->
                and apparently with his own hand. I could account <!-- ac-count -->
                for their being included in the heap of Custom-House <!-- Custom-House -->
                lumber only by the fact, that Mr. Pue's death
                had happened suddenly; and that these papers, which
                he probably kept in his official desk, had never come
                to the knowledge of his heirs, or were supposed to relate <!-- re-late -->
                to the business of the revenue. On the transfer
                of the archives to Halifax, this package, proving to be

                mysterious package, was a certain affair of fine red
                cloth, much worn and faded. There were traces about
                it of gold embroidery, which, however, was greatly
                frayed and defaced; so that none, or very little, of

                little other than a rag,—on careful examination, assumed <!-- as-sumed -->
                the shape of a letter. It was the capital letter
                A. By an accurate measurement, each limb proved
                to be precisely three inches and a quarter in length.
                It had been intended, there could be no doubt, as an
                ornamental article of dress; but how it was to be worn,
                or what rank, honor, and dignity, in by-past times, were
                signified by it, was a riddle which (so evanescent are
                the fashions of the world in these particulars) I saw
                little hope of solving. And yet it strangely interested
                me. My eyes fastened themselves upon the old scarlet <!-- scar-let -->
                letter, and would not be turned aside. Certainly,
                there was some deep meaning in it, most worthy of interpetation, <!-- in-terpetation -->
                and which, as it were, streamed forth from
                the mystic symbol, subtly communicating itself to my
                sensibilities, but evading the analysis of my mind.</p>

                —it seemed to me, then, that I experienced a sensation
                not altogether physical, yet almost so, as of burning
                heat; and as if the letter were not of red cloth, but

                the life and conversation of one Hester Prynne, who
                appeared to have been rather a noteworthy personage
                in the view of our ancestors. She had flourished during
                a period between the early days of Massachusetts and
                the close of the seventeenth century. Aged persons,
                alive in the time of Mr. Surveyor Pue, and from whose
                oral testimony he had made up his narrative, remembered <!-- remem-bered -->
                her, in their youth, as a very old, but not decrepit <!-- de-crepit -->
                woman, of a stately and solemn aspect. It had
                been her habit, from an almost immemorial date, to go
                about the country as a kind of voluntary nurse, and
                doing whatever miscellaneous good she might; taking
                upon herself, likewise, to give advice in all matters,
                especially those of the heart; by which means, as a
                person of such propensities inevitably must, she gained
                from many people the reverence due to an angel, but,
                I should imagine, was looked upon by others as an intruder <!-- in-truder -->
                and a nuisance. Prying farther into the manuscript, <!-- manu-script -->
                I found the record of other doings and sufferings
                of this singular woman, for most of which the reader
                is referred to the story entitled “<hi rend="small-caps">The Scarlet Letter";</hi> <!-- Let-ter -->

                and modes of passion that influenced the characters who
                figure in it, I have invariably confined myself within
                the limits of the old Surveyor's half a dozen sheets of
                foolscap. On the contrary, I have allowed myself,
                as to such points, nearly or altogether as much license
                as if the facts had been entirely of my own invention.
                What I contend for is the authenticity of the outline.</p>
                
                <p>This incident recalled my mind, in some degree, to
                its old track. There seemed to be here the groundwork <!-- ground-work -->
                of a tale. It impressed me as if the ancient Surveyor, <!-- Sur-veyor -->

                nodding the head that looked so imposing
                within its memorable wig, “do this, and the profit shall

                would ever have been brought before the public eye.
                My imagination was a tarnished mirror. It would not

                observe the bloodthirstiness that is developed in the  
                hour of triumph, and to be conscious that he is himself  
                among its objects! There are few uglier traits of human <!-- hu-man -->
                nature than this tendency—which I now witnessed  
                in men no worse than their neighbours—to grow cruel,  
                merely because they possessed the power of inflicting  
                harm. If the guillotine, as applied to office-holders,  
                were a literal fact, instead of one of the most apt of  
                metaphors, it is my sincere belief, that the active members <!-- mem-bers -->
                of the victorious party were sufficiently excited to  
                have chopped off all our heads, and have thanked  
                Heaven for the opportunity! It appears to me—who  
                have been a calm and curious observer, as well in victory <!-- vic-tory -->
                as defeat—that this fierce and bitter spirit of 
                malice and revenge has never distinguished the many 
                triumphs of my own party as it now did that of the 
                Whigs. The Democrats take the offices, as a general 
                rule, because they need them, and because the practice 
                of many years has made it the law of political warfare,  
                which, unless a different system be proclaimed, it were  
                weakness and cowardice to murmur at. But the long  
                habit of victory has made them generous. They know  
                how to spare, when they see occasion; and when they  
                strike, the axe may be sharp, indeed, but its edge is  
                seldom poisoned with ill-will; nor is it their custom  
                ignominiously to kick the head which they have just

                <p>The moment when a man's head drops off is seldom  
                or never, I am inclined to think, precisely the most

                considerable time before it was requisite to use them.  
                In view of my previous weariness of office, and vague  
                thoughts of resignation, my fortune somewhat resembled <!-- resem-bled -->
                that of a person who should entertain an idea of  
                committing suicide, and, altogether beyond his hopes,  
                meet with the good hap to be murdered. In the Custom-House, <!-- Cus-tom-House -->
                as before in the Old Manse, I had spent  
                three years; a term long enough to rest a weary brain;  
                long enough to break off old intellectual habits, and  
                make room for new ones; long enough, and too long,  
                to have lived in an unnatural state, doing what was  
                really of no advantage nor delight to any human being,  
                and withholding myself from toil that would, at least,  
                have stilled an unquiet impulse in me. Then, moreover, <!-- more-over -->
                <pb n="51"/>
                as regarded his unceremonious ejectment, the late  
                Surveyor was not altogether ill-pleased to be recognized  
                by the Whigs as an enemy; since his inactivity in  
                political affairs,—his tendency to roam, at will, in that  
                broad and quiet field where all mankind may meet,  
                rather than confine himself to those narrow paths  
                where brethren of the same household must diverge  
                from one another,—had sometimes made it questionable <!-- question-able -->
                with his brother Democrats whether he was a

                through long idleness, some little space was requisite  
                before my intellectual machinery could be brought to  
                work upon the tale, with an effect in any degree satisfactory. <!-- satis-factory -->

                much absorbed in the task, it wears, to my eye,  
                a stern and sombre aspect; too much ungladdened by  
                genial sunshine; too little relieved by the tender and  
                familiar influences which soften almost every scene of  
                nature and real life, and, undoubtedly, should soften  
                every picture of them. This uncaptivating effect is  
                perhaps due to the period of hardly accomplished  
                revolution, and still seething turmoil, in which the story  
                shaped itself. It is no indication, however, of a lack

                <p>The life of the Custom-House lies like a dream behind  
                me. The old Inspector,—who, by the by, I regret to  
                say, was overthrown and killed by a horse, some time  
                ago; else he would certainly have lived for ever,—he,  
                and all those other venerable personages who sat with  
                him at the receipt of custom, are but shadows in my  
                view; white-headed and wrinkled images, which my  
                fancy used to sport with, and has now flung aside for  
                ever. The merchants,—Pingree, Phillips, Shepard, Upton, <!-- Up-ton -->
                Kimball, Bertram, Hunt,—these, and many other  
                names, which had such a classic familiarity for my ear  
                six months ago,—these men of traffic, who seemed to  
                occupy so important a position in the world,—how little  
                time has it required to disconnect me from them all, not  
                merely in act, but recollection! It is with an effort  
                that I recall the figures and appellations of these few.  
                Soon, likewise, my old native town will loom upon me  
                through the haze of memory, a mist brooding over and  
                around it; as if it were no portion of the real earth,  
                but an overgrown village in cloud-land, with only imaginary <!-- im-aginary -->

                and to win myself a pleasant memory in this abode

                spurn and trample upon. In our nature, however,

                therefore, Hester Prynne passed through this  
                portion of her ordeal, and came to a sort of scaffold,  
                at the western extremity of the market-place. It stood

                agent in the promotion of good citizenship, as ever was  
                the guillotine among the terrorists of France. It was,  
                in short, the platform of the pillory; and above it rose  
                the framework of that instrument of discipline, so fashioned <!-- fash-ioned -->
                as to confine the human head in its tight grasp,  
                and thus hold it up to the public gaze. The very ideal  
                of ignominy was embodied and made manifest in this  
                contrivance of wood and iron. There can be no outrage, <!-- out-rage -->
                methinks, against our common nature,—whatever

                about the height of a man's shoulders above the street.</p>

                was to redeem the world. Here, there was the  
                taint of deepest sin in the most sacred quality of human  
                life, working such effect, that the world was only the  
                darker for this woman's beauty, and the more lost for  
                the infant that she had borne.</p>
                
                <p>The scene was not without a mixture of awe, such  
                as must always invest the spectacle of guilt and shame  
                in a fellow-creature, before society shall have grown  
                corrupt enough to smile, instead of shuddering, at it.  
                The witnesses of Hester Prynne's disgrace had not  
                yet passed beyond their simplicity. They were stern  
                enough to look upon her death, had that been the sentence, <!-- sen-tence -->
                without a murmur at its severity, but had none  
                of the heartlessness of another social state, which would  
                find only a theme for jest in an exhibition like the present. <!-- pres-ent -->
                Even had there been a disposition to turn the  
                matter into ridicule, it must have been repressed and  
                overpowered by the solemn presence of men no less  
                dignified than the Governor, and several of his counsllors, <!-- counsel-lors -->
                a judge, a general, and the ministers of the town;  
                all of whom sat or stood in a balcony of the meeting-house, <!-- meeting-house -->
                looking down upon the platform. When such  
                personages could constitute a part of the spectacle,  
                without risking the majesty or reverence of rank and  
                office, it was safely to be inferred that the infliction of  
                a legal sentence would have an earnest and effectual  
                meaning. Accordingly, the crowd was sombre and  
                grave. The unhappy culprit sustained herself as best  
                a woman might, under the heavy weight of a thousand <!-- thou-sand -->
                unrelenting eyes, all fastened upon her, and  
                <pb n="68"/>
                concentred at her bosom. It was almost intolerable to  
                be borne. Of an impulsive and passionate nature, she  
                had fortified herself to encounter the stings and venomous <!-- ven-omous -->
                stabs of public contumely, wreaking itself in  
                every variety of insult; but there was a quality so  
                much more terrible in the solemn mood of the popular  
                mind, that she longed rather to behold all those rigid  
                countenances contorted with scornful merriment, and  
                herself the object. Had a roar of laughter burst from  
                the multitude,—each man, each woman, each little  
                shrill-voiced child, contributing their individual parts,— 
                Hester Prynne might have repaid them all with a bitter
                and disdainful smile. But, under the <ref target="_leaden" corresp="leaden">leaden</ref>

                which it was her doom to endure, she felt, at moments,  
                as if she must needs shriek out with the full power of  
                her lungs, and cast herself from the scaffold down upon  
                the ground, or else go mad at once.</p>
                
                <p>Yet there were intervals when the whole scene, in  
                which she was the most conspicuous object, seemed to  
                vanish from her eyes, or, at least, glimmered indistinctly <!-- indistinct-ly -->
                before them, like a mass of imperfectly shaped and  
                spectral images. Her mind, and especially her memory, <!-- memo-ry -->
                was preternaturally active, and kept bringing up  
                other scenes than this roughly hewn street of a little  
                town, on the edge of the Western wilderness; other  
                faces than were lowering upon her from beneath the  
                brims of those steeple-crowned hats. Reminiscences,  
                the most trifling and immaterial, passages of infancy  
                and school-days, sports, childish quarrels, and the little  
                domestic traits of her maiden years, came swarming

                the outskirts of the crowd, a figure which irresistibly  
                took possession of her thoughts. An Indian, in his  
                native garb, was standing there; but the red men were  
                not so infrequent visitors of the English settlements,  
                that one of them would have attracted any notice from  
                Hester Prynne, at such a time; much less would he  
                have excluded all other objects and ideas from her  
                mind. By the Indian's side, and evidently sustaining a  
                companionship with him, stood a white man, clad in a  
                strange disarray of civilized and savage costume.</p>
                
                <p>He was small in stature, with a furrowed visage,  
                which, as yet, could hardly be termed aged. There  
                was a remarkable intelligence in his features, as of a  
                person who had so cultivated his mental part that it  
                could not fail to mould the physical to itself, and become <!-- be-come -->

                <p>At his arrival in the market-place, and some time before <!-- be-fore -->
                she saw him, the stranger had bent his eyes on  
                Hester Prynne. It was carelessly, at first, like a man  
                chiefly accustomed to look inward, and to whom external <!-- ex-ternal -->
                matters are of little value and import, unless they  
                bear relation to something within his mind. Very soon,  
                however, his look became keen and penetrative. A  
                writhing horror twisted itself across his features, like a  
                snake gliding swiftly over them, and making one little  
                pause, with all its <ref target="_wreathed" corresp="wreathed">wreathed</ref>

                His face darkened with some powerful emotion, which,  
                nevertheless, he so instantaneously controlled by an  
                effort of his will, that, save at a single moment, its expression <!-- ex=pression -->
                might have passed for calmness. After a  
                brief space, the convulsion grew almost imperceptible,  
                and finally subsided into the depths of his nature.  
                When he found the eyes of Hester Prynne fastened  
                on his own, and saw that she appeared to recognize  
                him, he slowly and calmly raised his finger, made a  
                gesture with it in the air, and laid it on his lips.</p>

                some good time agone, he was minded to cross over

                <p>“It behooves him well, if he be still in life,” responded <!-- re=sponded -->
                the townsman. “Now, good Sir, our Massachusetts <!-- Massa-chusetts -->
                magistracy, bethinking themselves that this  
                woman is youthful and fair, and doubtless was strongly  
                tempted to her fall;—and that, moreover, as is most  
                likely, her husband may be at the bottom of the sea;
                —they have not been bold to put in force the extremity <!-- ex-tremity -->
                of our righteous law against her. The penalty  
                thereof is death. But, in their great mercy and tenderness <!-- tender-ness -->
                of heart, they have doomed Mistress Prynne to  
                stand only a space of three hours on the platform of the  
                pillory, and then and thereafter, for the remainder of  
                her natural life, to wear a mark of shame upon her  
                bosom.”</p>
                
                <p>“A wise sentence!” remarked the stranger, gravely  
                <pb n="75"/>
                bowing his head. “Thus she will be a living sermon  
                against sin, until the ignominious letter be engraved
                upon her tombstone. It irks me, nevertheless, that the  
                partner of her iniquity should not, at least, stand on  
                the scaffold by her side. But he will be known!—he  
                will be known!—he will be known!”</p>
                
                <p>He bowed courteously to the communicative townsman, <!-- towns-man -->
                and, whispering a few words to his Indian attendant, <!-- attend-ant -->
                they both made their way through the crowd.</p>
                
                <p>While this passed, Hester Prynne had been standing  
                on her pedestal, still with a fixed gaze towards the  
                stranger; so fixed a gaze, that, at moments of intense  
                absorption, all other objects in the visible world seemed  
                to vanish, leaving only him and her. Such an interview, <!-- inter-view -->
                perhaps, would have been more terrible than even  
                to meet him as she now did, with the hot, midday sun  
                burning down upon her face, and lighting up its shame;  
                with the scarlet token of infamy on her breast; with  
                the sin-born infant in her arms; with a whole people,  
                drawn forth as to a festival, staring at the features that  
                should have been seen only in the quiet gleam of the  
                fireside, in the happy shadow of a home, or beneath  
                a matronly veil, at church. Dreadful as it was, she  
                was conscious of a shelter in the presence of these  
                thousand witnesses. It was better to stand thus, with  
                so many betwixt him and her, than to greet him, face  
                to face, they two alone. She fled for refuge, as it were,  
                to the public exposure, and dreaded the moment when  
                its protection should be withdrawn from her. Involved  
                in these thoughts, she scarcely heard a voice behind  
                her, until it had repeated her name more than once,  
                <pb n="76"/>
                in a loud and solemn tone, audible to the whole

                <p>“Hearken unto me, Hester Prynne!” said the voice.</p>
                
                <p>It has already been noticed, that directly over the  
                platform on which Hester Prynne stood was a kind of  
                balcony, or open gallery, appended to the meeting-house. <!-- meeting-house -->
                It was the place whence proclamations were

                and obstinacy; insomuch that you should no longer  
                hide the name of him who tempted you to this grievous  
                fall. But he opposes to me, (with a young man's oversoftness, <!-- over-softness -->
                albeit wise beyond his years,) that it were  
                wronging the very nature of woman to force her to  
                lay open her heart's secrets in such broad daylight,  
                and in presence of so great a multitude. Truly, as I  
                sought to convince him, the shame lay in the commission <!-- commis-sion -->
                of the sin, and not in the showing of it forth.  
                What say you to it, once again, brother Dimmesdale?  
                Must it be thou or I that shall deal with this poor sinner's <!-- sin-ner's -->
                soul?”</p>
                
                <p>There was a murmur among the dignified and reverend <!-- rev-erend -->
                occupants of the balcony; and Governor Bellingham <!-- Bel-lingham -->
                gave expression to its purport, speaking in an  
                authoritative voice, although tempered with respect  
                towards the youthful clergyman whom he addressed.</p>
                
                <p>“Good Master Dimmesdale,” said he, “the responsibility <!-- respon-sibility -->

                forth by an inward and inevitable necessity, and compelled <!-- com-pelled -->

                <p>Hester shook her head.</p>
                
                <p>“Woman, transgress not beyond the limits of Heaven's <!-- Heav-en's -->
                mercy!” cried the Reverend Mr. Wilson, more  
                harshly than before. “That little babe hath been gifted  
                with a voice, to second and confirm the counsel which  
                thou hast heard. Speak out the name! That, and thy  
                repentance, may avail to take the scarlet letter off thy  
                breast.”</p>
                
                <p>“Never!” replied Hester Prynne, looking, not at  
                Mr. Wilson, but into the deep and troubled eyes of the  
                younger clergyman. “It is too deeply branded. Ye  
                cannot take it off. And would that I might endure his  
                agony, as well as mine!”</p>
                
                <p>“Speak, woman!” said another voice, coldly and  
                sternly, proceeding from the crowd about the scaffold.  
                “Speak; and give your child a father!”</p>
                
                <p>“I will not speak!” answered Hester, turning pale  
                as death, but responding to this voice, which she too  
                surely recognized. “And my child must seek a heavenly <!-- heav-enly -->
                Father; she shall never know an earthly one!”</p>

                <p>“She will not speak!” murmured Mr. Dimmesdale,  
                who, leaning over the balcony, with his hand upon his  
                heart, had awaited the result of his appeal. He now  
                drew back, with a long respiration. “Wondrous  
                strength and generosity of a woman's heart! She  
                will not speak!”</p>
                <pb n="82"/>
                <p>Discerning the impracticable state of the poor culprit's <!-- cul-prit's -->
                mind, the elder clergyman, who had carefully  
                prepared himself for the occasion, addressed to the  
                multitude a discourse on sin, in all its branches, but  
                with continual reference to the ignominious letter. So  
                forcibly did he dwell upon this symbol, for the hour or  
                more during which his periods were rolling over the  
                people's heads, that it assumed new terrors in their  
                imagination, and seemed to derive its scarlet hue from  
                the flames of the infernal pit. Hester Prynne, meanwhile, <!-- mean-while -->
                kept her place upon the pedestal of shame, with  
                glazed eyes, and an air of weary indifference. She  
                had borne, that morning, all that nature could endure;  
                and as her temperament was not of the order that  
                escapes from too intense suffering by a swoon, her  
                spirit could only shelter itself beneath a stony crust of  
                insensibility, while the faculties of animal life remained  
                entire. In this state, the voice of the preacher thundered <!-- thun-dered -->
                remorselessly, but unavailingly, upon her ears.  
                The infant, during the latter portion of her ordeal,  
                pierced the air with its wailings and screams; she  
                strove to hush it, mechanically, but seemed scarcely to  
                sympathize with its trouble. With the same hard demeanour, <!-- de-meanour -->
                she was led back to prison, and vanished from  
                the public gaze within its iron-clamped portal. It was  
                whispered, by those who peered after her, that the  
                scarlet letter threw a lurid gleam along the dark passage-way <!-- pas-sage-way -->

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">After</hi> her return to the prison, Hester Prynne was  
                found to be in a state of nervous excitement that demanded <!-- de-manded -->
                constant watchfulness, lest she should perpetrate <!-- perpe-trate -->
                violence on herself, or do some half-frenzied  
                mischief to the poor babe. As night approached, it  
                proving impossible to quell her insubordination by rebuke <!-- re-buke -->
                or threats of punishment, Master Brackett, the  
                jailer, thought fit to introduce a physician. He described <!-- de-scribbed -->
                him as a man of skill in all Christian modes of  
                physical science, and likewise familiar with whatever  
                the savage people could teach, in respect to medicinal  
                herbs and roots that grew in the forest. To say the  
                truth, there was much need of professional assistance,  
                not merely for Hester herself, but still more urgently  
                for the child; who, drawing its sustenance from the  
                maternal bosom, seemed to have drank in with it all  
                the turmoil, the anguish, and despair, which pervaded  
                the mother's system. It now writhed in convulsions of  
                pain, and was a forcible type, in its little frame, of the  
                moral agony which Hester Prynne had borne throughout <!-- through-out -->
                the day.</p>
                
                <p>Closely following the jailer into the dismal apartment,

                presence in the crowd had been of such deep interest  
                to the wearer of the scarlet letter. He was lodged in  
                the prison, not as suspected of any offence, but as the  
                most convenient and suitable mode of disposing of him,

                <p>“My old studies in alchemy,” observed he, “and  
                my sojourn, for above a year past, among a people well  
                versed in the kindly properties of simples, have made  
                a better physician of me than many that claim the  
                medical degree. Here, woman! The child is yours,  
                —she is none of mine,—neither will she recognize  
                my voice or aspect as a father's. Administer this  
                draught, therefore, with thine own hand.”</p>
                
                <p>Hester repelled the offered medicine, at the same

                <p>“Foolish woman!” responded the physician, half  
                coldly, half soothingly. “What should ail me to harm  
                this misbegotten and miserable babe? The medicine  
                is potent for good; and were it my child,—yea, mine

                <p>As she still hesitated, being, in fact, in no reasonable

                gaze that made her heart shrink and shudder, because  
                so familiar, and yet so strange and cold,—and, finally,

                <p>“Drink, then,” replied he, still with the same cold  
                composure. “Dost thou know me so little, Hester

                into Hester's breast, as if it had been red-hot. He noticed <!-- no-ticed -->
                her involuntary gesture, and smiled.—“Live,

                sleeping; while he drew the only chair which the room

                thou hast fallen into the pit, or say rather, thou hast  
                ascended to the pedestal of infamy, on which I found  
                thee. The reason is not far to seek. It was my folly,  
                and thy weakness. I,—a man of thought,—the bookworm <!-- book-worm -->
                of great libraries,—a man already in decay,

                how could I delude myself with the idea that intellectual <!-- intellectu-al -->
                gifts might veil physical deformity in a young girl's  
                fantasy! Men call me wise. If sages were ever wise  
                in their own behoof, I might have foreseen all this. I  
                might have known that, as I came out of the vast and  
                dismal forest, and entered this settlement of Christian  
                men, the very first object to meet my eyes would be  
                thyself, Hester Prynne, standing up, a statue of <ref target="_ignominy" corresp="ignominy">ignominy,</ref>

                before the people. Nay, from the moment when  
                we came down the old church-steps together, a married  
                pair, I might have beheld the bale-fire of that scarlet  
                letter blazing at the end of our path!”</p>
                
                <p>“Thou knowest,” said Hester,—for, depressed as  
                she was, she could not endure this last quiet stab at the  
                token of her shame,—“thou knowest that I was frank  
                with thee. I felt no love, nor feigned any.”</p>
                
                <p>“True!” replied he. “It was my folly! I have  
                said it. But, up to that epoch of my life, I had lived  
                in vain. The world had been so cheerless! My heart  
                was a habitation large enough for many guests, but  
                lonely and chill, and without a household fire. I longed  
                to kindle one! It seemed not so wild a dream,—old  
                as I was, and sombre as I was, and misshapen as I was,  
                —that the simple bliss, which is scattered far and  
                wide, for all mankind to gather up, might yet be mine.  
                And so, Hester, I drew thee into my heart, into its  
                innermost chamber, and sought to warm thee by the  
                warmth which thy presence made there!”</p>
                
                <p>“I have greatly wronged thee,” murmured Hester.</p>
                
                <p>“We have wronged each other,” answered he.

                “Mine was the first wrong, when I betrayed thy budding <!-- bud-ding -->
                youth into a false and unnatural relation with my  
                decay. Therefore, as a man who has not thought and  
                philosophized in vain, I seek no vengeance, plot no  
                evil against thee. Between thee and me, the scale

                <p>“Never, sayest thou?” rejoined he, with a smile of

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">Hester Prynne's</hi> term of confinement was now at  
                an end. Her prison-door was thrown open, and she  
                came forth into the sunshine, which, falling on all alike,  
                seemed, to her sick and morbid heart, as if meant for  
                no other purpose than to reveal the scarlet letter on her  
                breast. Perhaps there was a more real torture in her  
                first unattended footsteps from the threshold of the prison, <!-- pris-on -->
                than even in the procession and spectacle that have  
                been described, where she was made the common infamy, <!-- in-famy -->
                at which all mankind was summoned to point its  
                finger. Then, she was supported by an unnatural  
                tension of the nerves, and by all the combative energy  
                of her character, which enabled her to convert the  
                scene into a kind of lurid triumph. It was, moreover,  
                a separate and insulated event, to occur but once in her  
                lifetime, and to meet which, therefore, reckless of  
                economy, she might call up the vital strength that  
                would have sufficed for many quiet years. The very  
                law that condemned her—a giant of stern features,

                and she must either sustain and carry it forward by the  
                ordinary resources of her nature, or sink beneath it.  
                She could no longer borrow from the future, to help  
                her through the present grief. To-morrow would bring  
                its own trial with it; so would the next day, and so  
                would the next; each its own trial, and yet the very  
                same that was now so unutterably grievous to be borne.  
                The days of the far-off future would toil onward, still  
                with the same burden for her to take up, and bear  
                along with her, but never to fling down; for the accumulating <!-- ac-cumulating -->
                days, and added years, would pile up their  
                misery upon the heap of shame. Throughout them  
                all, giving up her individuality, she would become the  
                general symbol at which the preacher and moralist  
                might point, and in which they might <ref target="_vivify" corresp="vivify">vivify</ref>

                the body, the reality of sin. And over her grave, the

                still call that place her home, where, and where only,  
                she must needs be the type of shame. But there is a  
                fatality, a feeling so irresistible and inevitable that it

                wanderer, into Hester Prynne's wild and dreary, but  
                life-long home. All other scenes of earth—even that  
                village of rural England, where happy infancy and  
                stainless maidenhood seemed yet to be in her mother's  
                keeping, like garments put off long ago—were foreign  
                to her, in comparison. The chain that bound her  
                here was of iron links, and galling to her inmost soul,  
                but never could be broken.</p>
                
                <p>It might be, too,—doubtless it was so, although she  
                hid the secret from herself, and grew pale whenever it  
                struggled out of her heart, like a serpent from its hole,  
                —it might be that another feeling kept her within the  
                scene and pathway that had been so fatal. There  
                dwelt, there trode the feet of one with whom she  
                <pb n="95"/>
                deemed herself connected in a union, that, unrecognized <!-- unrecog-nized -->
                on earth, would bring them together before the  
                bar of final judgment, and make that their marriage-alter, <!-- marriage-alter -->
                for a joint futurity of endless retribution. Over  
                and over again, the tempter of souls had thrust this  
                idea upon Hester's contemplation, and laughed at the  
                passionate and desperate joy with which she seized, and  
                then strove to cast it from her. She barely looked the  
                idea in the face, and hastened to bar it in its dungeon.  
                What she compelled herself to believe,—what, finally,  
                she reasoned upon, as her motive for continuing a resident <!-- resi-dent -->
                of New England,—was half a truth, and half a  
                self-delusion. Here, she said to herself, had been the  
                scene of her guilt, and here should be the scene of her  
                earthly punishment; and so, perchance, the torture of  
                her daily shame would at length purge her soul, and  
                work out another purity than that which she had lost;  
                more saint-like, because the result of martyrdom.</p>

                <p>Hester Prynne, therefore, did not flee. On the outskirts <!-- out-skirts -->
                of the town, within the verge of the peninsula,
                but not in close vicinity to any other habitation, there  
                was a small thatched cottage. It had been built by an  
                earlier settler, and abandoned, because the soil about  
                it was too sterile for cultivation, while its comparative  
                remoteness put it out of the sphere of that social activity <!-- activ-ity -->
                which already marked the habits of the emigrants.  
                It stood on the shore, looking across a basin of the  
                sea at the forest-covered hills, towards the west. A  
                clump of scrubby trees, such as alone grew on the  
                peninsula, did not so much conceal the cottage from  
                view, as seem to denote that here was some object

                which would fain have been, or at least ought to be,  
                concealed. In this little, lonesome dwelling, with some  
                slender means that she possessed, and by the license of  
                the magistrates, who still kept an inquisitorial watch  
                over her, Hester established herself, with her infant  
                child. A mystic shadow of suspicion immediately attached <!-- at-tached -->

                or standing in the door-way, or laboring in her little

                townward; and, discerning the scarlet letter on her  
                breast, would scamper off, with a strange, contagious  
                fear.</p>
                
                <p>Lonely as was Hester's situation, and without a friend  
                on earth who dared to show himself, she, however, incurred <!-- in-curred -->
                no risk of want. She possessed an art that sufficed, <!-- suf-ficed -->
                even in a land that afforded comparatively little  
                scope for its exercise, to supply food for her thriving infant <!-- in-fant -->
                and herself. It was the art—then, as now, almost  
                the only one within a woman's grasp—of needle-work.  
                She bore on her breast, in the curiously embroidered  
                letter, a specimen of her delicate and imaginative skill,  
                of which the dames of a court might gladly have  
                availed themselves, to add the richer and more spiritual  
                adornment of human ingenuity to their fabrics of silk  
                and gold. Here, indeed, in the sable simplicity that  
                generally characterized the Puritanic modes of dress,  
                there might be an infrequent call for the finer productions <!-- produc-tions -->
                of her handiwork. Yet the taste of the age, demanding <!-- de-manding -->

                whatever was elaborate in compositions of  
                this kind, did not fail to extend its influence over our  
                stern progenitors, who had cast behind them so many  
                fashions which it might seem harder to dispense with.  
                Public ceremonies, such as ordinations, the installation  
                of magistrates, and all that could give majesty to the  
                forms in which a new government manifested itself to  
                the people, were, as a matter of policy, marked by a  
                stately and well-conducted ceremonial, and a sombre,  
                but yet a studied magnificence. Deep ruffs, painfully  
                wrought bands, and gorgeously embroidered gloves,  
                were all deemed necessary to the official state of men  
                assuming the reins of power; and were readily allowed <!-- al-lowed -->

                employment for as many hours as she saw fit to occupy
                with her needle. Vanity, it may be, chose to mortify
                itself, by putting on, for ceremonials of pomp and state,
                the garments that had been wrought by her sinful hands.
                Her needle-work was seen on the ruff of the Governor;
                military men wore it on their scarfs, and the minister
                on his band; it decked the baby's little cap; it was
                shut up, to be mildewed and moulder away, in the
                coffins of the dead. But it is not recorded that, in a
                single instance, her skill was called in aid to embroider
                the white veil which was to cover the pure blushes of
                a bride. The exception indicated the ever relentless
                vigor with which society frowned upon her sin.</p>

                for herself, and a simple abundance for her child. Her  
                own dress was of the coarsest materials and the most  
                sombre hue; with only that one ornament,—the scarlet <!-- scar-let -->
                letter,—which it was her doom to wear. The  
                child's attire, on the other hand, was distinguished by  
                a fanciful, or, we might rather say, a fantastic ingenuity,  
                which served, indeed, to heighten the airy charm that  
                early began to develop itself in the little girl, but which  
                appeared to have also a deeper meaning. We may  
                speak further of it hereafter. Except for that small

                nature a rich, voluptuous, Oriental characteristic,—a  
                taste for the gorgeously beautiful, which, save in the  
                exquisite productions of her needle, found nothing else,  
                in all the possibilities of her life, to exercise itself upon.  
                Women derive a pleasure, incomprehensible to the other  
                sex, from the delicate toil of the needle. To Hester  
                Prynne it might have been a mode of expressing, and  
                therefore soothing, the passion of her life. Like all  
                other joys, she rejected it as sin. This morbid meddling <!-- med-dling -->

                <p>In this manner, Hester Prynne came to have a part  
                to perform in the world. With her native energy of  
                character, and rare capacity, it could not entirely cast  
                her off, although it had set a mark upon her, more intolerable <!-- in-tolerable -->
                to a woman's heart than that which branded  
                the brow of Cain. In all her intercourse with society,  
                however, there was nothing that made her feel as if she  
                belonged to it. Every gesture, every word, and even  
                the silence of those with whom she came in contact,  
                implied, and often expressed, that she was banished,  
                and as much alone as if she inhabited another sphere,  
                or communicated with the common nature by other  
                <pb n="100"/>
                organs and senses than the rest of human kind. She  
                stood apart from mortal interests, yet close beside them,  
                like a ghost that revisits the familiar fireside, and can  
                no longer make itself seen or felt; no more smile with  
                the household joy, nor mourn with the kindred sorrow;  
                or, should it succeed in manifesting its forbidden sympathy, <!-- sym-pathy -->
                awakening only terror and horrible repugnance.  
                These emotions, in fact, and its bitterest scorn besides,  
                seemed to be the sole portion that she retained in the  
                universal heart. It was not an age of delicacy; and  
                her position, although she understood it well, and was  
                in little danger of forgetting it, was often brought before <!-- be-fore -->
                her vivid self-perception, like a new anguish, by  
                the rudest touch upon the tenderest spot. The poor, as  
                we have already said, whom she sought out to be the

                she never responded to these attacks, save by a flush  
                of crimson that rose irrepressibly over her pale cheek,  
                and again subsided into the depths of her bosom. She  
                was patient,—a martyr, indeed,—but she forbore
                to pray for her enemies; lest, in spite of her forgiving
                aspirations, the words of the blessing should stubbornly
                twist themselves into a curse.</p>

                a vague idea of something horrible in this dreary  
                woman, gliding silently through the town, with never  
                any companion but one only child. Therefore, first  
                allowing her to pass, they pursued her at a distance  
                with shrill cries, and the utterance of a word that had  
                no distinct purport to their own minds, but was none  
                the less terrible to her, as proceeding from lips that  
                babbled it unconsciously. It seemed to argue so wide  
                a diffusion of her shame, that all nature knew of it; it  
                could have caused her no deeper pang, had the leaves  
                of the trees whispered the dark story among themselves,-had <!-- them-selves -->
                the summer breeze murmured about it,  
                —had the wintry blast shrieked it aloud! Another  
                peculiar torture was felt in the gaze of a new eye.  
                When strangers looked curiously at the scarlet letter,  
                —and none ever failed to do so,—they branded it  
                afresh into Hester's soul; so that, oftentimes, she could  
                scarcely refrain, yet always did refrain, from covering  
                the symbol with her hand. But then, again, an accustomed <!-- accus-tomed -->
                eye had likewise its own anguish to inflict. Its  
                <pb n="102"/>
                cool stare of familiarity was intolerable. From first to  
                last, in short, Hester Prynne had always this dreadful  
                agony in feeling a human eye upon the token; the spot  
                never grew callous; it seemed, on the contrary, to  
                grow more sensitive with daily torture.</p>
                
                <p>But sometimes, once in many days, or perchance in  
                many months, she felt an eye—a human eye—upon  
                the ignominious brand, that seemed to give a momentary <!-- momen-tary -->
                relief, as if half of her agony were shared. The  
                next instant, back it all rushed again, with still a deeper  
                throb of pain; for, in that brief interval, she had sinned <!-- sin-ned -->
                anew. Had Hester sinned alone?</p>
                
                <p>Her imagination was somewhat affected, and, had  
                she been of a softer moral and intellectual fibre, would  
                have been still more so, by the strange and solitary  
                anguish of her life. Walking to and fro, with those  
                lonely footsteps, in the little world with which she was  
                outwardly connected, it now and then appeared to Hester,-if <!-- Hes-ter -->
                altogether fancy, it was nevertheless too potent  
                to be resisted,—she felt or fancied, then, that the  
                scarlet letter had endowed her with a new sense. She  
                shuddered to believe, yet could not help believing, that  
                it gave her a sympathetic knowledge of the hidden sin  
                in other hearts. She was terror-stricken by the revelations <!-- revela-tions -->
                that were thus made. What were they? Could  
                they be other than the insidious whispers of the bad  
                angel, who would fain have persuaded the struggling  
                woman, as yet only half his victim, that the outward  
                guise of purity was but a lie, and that, if truth were  
                everywhere to be shown, a scarlet letter would blaze  
                forth on many a bosom besides Hester Prynne's? Or,  
                <pb n="103"/>
                must she receive those intimations—so obscure, yet so  
                distinct—as truth? In all her miserable experience,  
                there was nothing else so awful and so loathsome as  
                this sense. It perplexed, as well as shocked her, by  
                the irreverent inopportuneness of the occasions that  
                brought it into vivid action. Sometimes, the red infamy  
                upon her breast would give a sympathetic throb, as she  
                passed near a venerable minister or magistrate, the  
                model of piety and justice, to whom that age of antique  
                reverence looked up, as to a mortal man in fellowship  
                with angels. “What evil thing is at hand?” would  
                Hester say to herself. Lifting her reluctant eyes, there  
                would be nothing human within the scope of view, save  
                the form of this earthly saint! Again, a mystic sisterhood <!-- sister-hood -->

                bosom throughout life. That unsunned snow in the  
                matron's bosom, and the burning shame on Hester  
                Prynne's,—what had the two in common? Or, once  
                more, the electric thrill would give her warning,—  
                “Behold, Hester, here is a companion!”—and, looking <!-- look-ing -->
                up, she would detect the eyes of a young maiden  
                glancing at the scarlet letter, shyly and aside, and  
                quickly averted, with a faint, chill crimosn in her  
                cheeks; as if her purity were somewhat sullied by that  
                momentary glance. O Fiend, whose talisman was  
                that fatal symbol, wouldst thou leave nothing, whether

                the calm, white, unimpassioned lustre that would be  
                indicated by the comparison. But she named the infant <!-- in-fant -->
                “Pearl,” as being of great price,—purchased  
                with all she had,—her mother's only treasure! How  
                strange, indeed! Man had marked this woman's sin  
                by a scarlet letter, which had such potent and disastrous  
                efficacy that no human sympathy could reach her, save  
                it were sinful like herself. God, as a direct consequence <!-- conse-quence -->
                of the sin which man thus punished, had given  
                her a lovely child, whose place was on that same dishonored <!-- dis-honored -->
                bosom, to connect her parent for ever with the  
                race and descent of mortals, and to be finally a blessed  
                soul in heaven! Yet these thoughts affected Hester  
                <pb n="106"/>
                Prynne less with hope than apprehension. She knew  
                that her deed had been evil; she could have no faith,  
                therefore, that its result would be for good. Day after  
                day, she looked fearfully into the child's expanding  
                nature; ever dreading to detect some dark and wild  
                peculiarity, that should correspond with the guiltiness  
                to which she owed her being.</p>
                
                <p>Certainly, there was no physical defect. By its perfect <!-- per-fect -->
                shape, its vigor, and its natural dexterity in the use  
                of all its untried limbs, the infant was worthy to  
                have been brought forth in Eden; worthy to have been  
                left there, to be the plaything of the angels, after the  
                world's first parents were driven out. The child had a  
                native grace which does not invariably coexist with  
                faultless beauty; its attire, however simple, always impressed <!-- im-pressed --> 
                the beholder as if it were the very garb that  
                precisely became it best. But little Pearl was not clad  
                in rustic weeds. Her mother, with a morbid purpose  
                that may be better understood hereafter, had bought  
                the richest tissues that could be procured, and allowed  
                her imaginative faculty its full play in the arrangement  
                and decoration of the dresses which the child wore,  
                before the public eye. So magnificent was the small  
                figure, when thus arrayed, and such was the splendor  
                of Pearl's own proper beauty, shining through the  
                gorgeous robes which might have extinguished a paler  
                loveliness, that there was an absolute circle of radiance  
                around her, on the darksome cottage-floor. And yet  
                a russet gown, torn and soiled with the child's rude  
                play, made a picture of her just as perfect. Pearl's  
                aspect was imbued with a spell of infinite variety; in  
                <pb n="107"/>
                this one child there were many children, comprehending  
                the full scope between the wild-flower prettiness of a  
                peasant-baby, and the pomp, in little, of an infant  
                princess. Throughout all, however, there was a trait  
                of passion, a certain depth of hue, which she never  
                lost; and if, in any of her changes, she had grown  
                fainter or paler, she would have ceased to be herself;  
                —it would have been no longer Pearl!</p>
                
                <p>This outward mutability indicated, and did not more  
                than fairly express, the various properties of her inner  
                life. Her nature appeared to possess depth, too, as  
                well as variety; but—or else Hester's fears deceived  
                her—it lacked reference and adaptation to the world  
                into which she was born. The child could not be  
                made <ref target="_amenable" corresp="amenable">amenable</ref>
                to rules. In giving her existence, a  
                great law had been broken; and the result was a being,  
                whose elements were perhaps beautiful and brilliant,  
                but all in disorder; or with an order peculiar to themselves, <!-- them-selves -->
                amidst which the point of variety and arrangement <!-- arrange-ment -->
                was difficult or impossible to be discovered. Hester <!-- Hes-ter -->
                could only account for the child's character—and  
                even then, most vaguely and imperfectly—by recalling <!-- recall-ing -->
                what she herself had been, during that momentous  
                period while Pearl was imbibing her soul from the spiritual <!-- spir-itual -->
                world, and her bodily frame from its material of  
                earth. The mother's impassioned state had been the  
                medium through which were transmitted to the unborn  
                infant the rays of its moral life; and, however white  
                and clear originally, they had taken the deep stains of  
                crimson and gold, the fiery lustre, the black shadow,  
                and the untempered light, of the intervening substance.  
                <pb n="108"/>
                Above all, the warfare of Hester's spirit, at that epoch,  
                was perpetuated in Pearl. She could recognize her  
                wild, desperate, defiant mood, the flightiness of her  
                temper, and even some of the very cloud-shapes of  
                gloom and despondency that had brooded in her heart.  
                They were now illuminated by the morning radiance  
                of a young child's disposition, but, later in the day of  
                earthly existence, might be prolific of the storm and  
                whirlwind.</p>
                
                <p>The discipline of the family, in those days, was of a  
                far more rigid kind than now. The frown, the harsh  
                rebuke, the frequent application of the rod, enjoined by  
                Scriptural authority, were used, not merely in the way  
                of punishment for actual offences, but as a wholesome  
                regimen for the growth and promotion of all childish  
                virtues. Hester Prynne, nevertheless, the lonely  
                mother of this one child, ran little risk of erring on the  
                side of undue severity. Mindful, however, or her own  
                errors and misfortunes, she early sought to impose a  
                tender, but strict, control over the infant immortality that  
                was committed to her charge. But the task was beyond <!-- be-yond -->
                her skill. After testing both smiles and frowns,  
                and proving that neither mode of treatment possessed  
                any calculable influence, Hester was ultimately compelled <!-- com-pelled -->
                to stand aside, and permit the child to be swayed  
                by her own impulses. Physical compulsion or restraint  
                was effectual, of course, while it lasted. As to any  
                other kind of discipline, whether addressed to her mind  
                or heart, little Pearl might or might not be within its  
                reach, in accordance with the caprice that ruled the  
                moment. Her mother, while Pearl was yet an infant,  
                <pb n="109"/>
                grew acquainted with a certain peculiar look, that warned <!-- warn-ed -->
                her when it would be labor thrown away to insist,  
                persuade, or plead. It was a look so intelligent, yet  
                inexplicable, so perverse, sometimes so malicious, but  
                generally accompanied by a wild flow of spirits, that  
                Hester could not help questioning, at such moments,  
                whether Pearl was a human child. She seemed rather  
                an airy sprite, which, after playing its fantastic sports  
                for a little while upon the cottage-floor, would flit away  
                with a mocking smile. Whenever that look appeared  
                in her wild, bright, deeply black eyes, it invested her  
                with a strange remoteness and intangibility; it was as  
                if she were hovering in the air and might vanish, like  
                a glimmering light that comes we know not whence,  
                and goes we know not whither. Beholding it, Hester  
                was constrained to rush towards the child,—to pursue  
                the little elf in the flight which she invariably began,—  
                to snatch her to her bosom, with a close pressure and  
                earnest kisses,—not so much from overflowing love,  
                as to assure herself that Pearl was flesh and blood, and  
                not utterly <ref corresp="delusive" target="_delusive">delusive.</ref>

                Deceptive. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> But Pearl's laugh, when she was  
                caught, though full of merriment and music, made her  
                mother more doubtful than before.</p>
                
                <p>Heart-smitten at this bewildering and baffling spell,  
                that so often came between herself and her sole treasure, <!-- treas-ure -->
                whom she had bought so dear, and who was all  
                her world, Hester sometimes burst into passionate tears.  
                Then, perhaps,—for there was no foreseeing how it  
                might affect her,—Pearl would frown, and clench her  
                little fist, and harden her small features into a stern,  
                unsympathizing look of discontent. Not seldom, she  
                <pb n="110"/>
                would laugh anew, and louder than before, like a thing  
                incapable and unintelligent of human sorrow. Or—  
                but this more rarely happened—she would be convulsed <!-- con-vulsed -->
                with a rage of grief, and sob out her love for  
                her mother, in broken words, and seem intent on proving <!-- prov-ing -->
                that she had a heart, by breaking it. Yet Hester

                it passed, as suddenly as it came. Brooding  
                over all these matters, the mother felt like one who has  
                evoked a spirit, but, by some irregularity in the process  
                of conjuration, has failed to win the master-word that  
                should control this new and incomprehensible intelligence. <!-- intelli-gence -->
                Her only real comfort was when the child lay  
                in the placidity of sleep. Then she was sure of her,  
                and tasted hours of quiet, sad, delicious happiness; until-perhaps <!-- un-til -->
                with that perverse expression glimmering  
                from beneath her opening lids—little Pearl awoke!</p>

                <p>How soon—with what strange rapidity, indeed!—  
                did Pearl arrive at an age that was capable of social  
                intercourse, beyond the mother's ever-ready smile and  
                nonsense-words! And then what a happiness would  
                it have been, could Hester Prynne have heard her  
                clear, bird-like voice mingling with the uproar of other  
                childish voices, and have distinguished and unravelled  
                her own darling's tones, amid all the entangled outcry  
                of a group of sportive children! But this could never  
                be. Pearl was a born outcast of the infantile world.  
                An imp of evil, emblem and product of sin, she had no  
                right among christened infants. Nothing was more  
                remarkable than the instinct, as it seemed, with which  
                the child comprehended her loneliness; the destiny that  
                <pb n="111"/>

                whole peculiarity, in short, of her position in respect to  
                other children. Never, since her release from prison,  
                had Hester met the public gaze without her. In all her  
                walks about the town, Pearl, too, was there; first as  
                the babe in arms, and afterwards as the little girl, small  
                companion of her mother, holding a forefinger with her  
                whole grasp, and tripping along at the rate of three or  
                four footsteps to one of Hester's. She saw the children  
                of the settlement, on the grassy margin of the street,  
                or at the domestic thresholds, disporting themselves in  
                such grim fashion as the Puritanic nurture would permit; <!-- per-mit -->
                playing at going to church, perchance; or at  
                scourging Quakers; or taking scalps in a sham-fight  
                with the Indians; or scaring one another with freaks of  
                imitative witchcraft. Pearl saw, and gazed intently,  
                but never sought to make acquaintance. If spoken to,  
                she would not speak again. If the children gathered  
                about her, as they sometimes did, Pearl would grow  
                positively terrible in her puny wrath, snatching up  
                stones to fling at them, with shrill, incoherent exclamations <!-- exclama-tions -->
                that made her mother tremble, because they had  
                so much the sound of a witch's anathemas in some unknown <!-- un-known -->
                tongue.</p>
                
                <p>The truth was, that the little Puritans, being of the  
                most intolerant brood that ever lived, had got a vague  
                idea of something outlandish, unearthly, or at variance  
                with ordinary fashions, in the mother and child; and  
                therefore scorned them in their hearts, and not unfrequently <!-- unfre-quently -->
                reviled them with their tongues. Pearl felt the

                can be supposed to rankle in a childish bosom. These  
                outbreaks of a fierce temper had a kind of value, and  
                even comfort, for her mother; because there was at  
                least an intelligible earnestness in the mood, instead of

                child's manifestations. It appalled her, nevertheless,  
                to discern here, again, a shadowy reflection of the evil  
                that had existed in herself. All this enmity and passion  
                had Pearl inherited, by inalienable right, out of Hester's <!-- Hes-ter's -->
                heart. Mother and daughter stood together in the  
                same circle of seclusion from human society; and in  
                the nature of the child seemed to be perpetuated those  
                unquiet elements that had distracted Hester Prynne  
                before Pearl's birth, but had since begun to be soothed  
                away by the softening influences of maternity.</p>

                <p>At home, within and around her mother's cottage,  
                Pearl wanted not a wide and various circle of acquaintance. <!-- acquaint-ance -->
                The spell of life went forth from her ever creative <!-- cre-ative -->
                spirit, and communicated itself to a thousand  
                objects, as a torch kindles a flame wherever it may be  
                applied. The unlikeliest materials, a stick, a bunch of  
                rags, a flower, were the puppets of Pearl's witchcraft,  
                and, without undergoing any outward change, became  
                spiritually adapted to whatever drama occupied the  
                stage of her inner world. Her one baby-voice served  
                a multitude of imaginary personages, old and young, to  
                talk withal. The pine-trees, aged, black, and solemn,  
                and flinging groans and other melancholy utterances on  
                the breeze, needed little transformation to figure as Puritan <!-- Pu-ritan -->
                elders; the ugliest weeds of the garden were  
                their children, whom Pearl smote down and uprooted,  
                <pb n="113"/>
                most unmercifully. It was wonderful, the vast variety  
                of forms into which she threw her intellect, with no  
                continuity, indeed, but darting up and dancing, always  
                in a state of preternatural activity,—soon sinking down,  
                as if exhausted by so rapid and feverish a tide of life,  
                —and succeeded by other shapes of a similar wild

                —what is this being which I have brought into the

                aware, through some more subtile channel, of those  
                throbs of anguish, would turn her vivid and beautiful  
                little face upon her mother, smile with sprite-like intelligence, <!-- in-telligence -->
                and resume her play.</p>
                
                <p>One peculiarity of the child's deportment remains  
                yet to be told. The very first thing which she had  
                noticed, in her life, was—what?—not the mother's <!-- moth-er's -->
                smile, responding to it, as other babies do, by  
                that faint, embryo smile of the little mouth, remembered <!-- remem-bered -->
                so doubtfully afterwards, and with such fond  
                discussion whether it were indeed a smile. By no  
                means! But that first object of which Pearl seemed to  
                become aware was—shall we say it?—the scarlet  
                letter on Hester's bosom! One day, as her mother  
                stooped over the cradle, the infant's eyes had been  
                caught by the glimmering of the gold embroidery about  
                the letter; and, putting up her little hand, she grasped  
                at it, smiling, not doubtfully, but with a decided gleam  
                that gave her face the look of a much older child.  
                Then, gasping for breath, did Hester Prynne clutch  
                the fatal token, instinctively endeavouring to tear it  
                away; so infinite was the torture inflicted by the intelligent <!-- in-telligent -->
                touch of Pearl's baby-hand. Again, as if her  
                mother's agonized gesture were meant only to make  
                sport for her, did little Pearl look into her eyes, and  
                smile! From that epoch, except when the child was  
                asleep, Hester had never felt a moment's safety; not a  
                moment's calm enjoyment of her. Weeks, it is true,  
                would sometimes elapse, during which Pearl's gaze  
                might never once be fixed upon the scarlet letter; but  
                then, again, it would come at unawares, like the stroke  
                <pb n="115"/>
                of sudden death, and always with that peculiar smile,  
                and odd expression of the eyes.</p>
                
                <p>Once, this freakish, elvish cast came into the child's  
                eyes, while Hester was looking at her own image in  
                them, as mothers are fond of doing; and, suddenly,—  
                for women in solitude, and with troubled hearts, are  
                pestered with unaccountable delusions,—she fancied  
                that she beheld, not her own miniature portrait, but  
                another face in the small black mirror of Pearl's eye.  
                It was a face, fiend-like, full of smiling malice, yet  
                bearing the semblance of features that she had known  
                full well, though seldom with a smile, and never with  
                malice, in them. It was as if an evil spirit possessed  
                the child, and had just then peeped forth in mockery.  
                Many a time afterwards had Hester been tortured,  
                though less vividly, by the same illusion.</p>
                
                <p>In the afternoon of a certain summer's day, after  
                Pearl grew big enough to run about, she amused herself <!-- her-self -->
                with gathering handfuls of wild-flowers, and flinging <!-- fling-ing -->
                them, one by one, at her mother's bosom; dancing  
                up and down, like a little elf, whenever she hit the  
                scarlet letter. Hester's first motion had been to cover  
                her bosom with her clasped hands. But, whether from  
                pride or resignation, or a feeling that her penance might  
                best be wrought out by this unutterable pain, she resisted <!-- resist-ed -->
                the impulse, and sat erect, pale as death, looking  
                sadly into little Pearl's wild eyes. Still came the battery <!-- bat-tery -->
                of flowers, almost invariably hitting the mark,  
                and covering the mother's breast with hurts for which  
                she could find no balm in this world, nor knew how to  
                seek it in another. At last, her shot being all expended, <!-- expend-ed -->
                <pb n="116"/>
                the child stood still and gazed at Hester, with that  
                little, laughing image of a fiend peeping out—or,  
                whether it peeped or no, her mother so imagined it  
                —from the unsearchable abyss of her black eyes.</p>
                
                <p>“Child, what art thou?” cried the mother.</p>
                
                <p>“O, I am your little Pearl!” answered the child.</p>
                
                <p>But, while she said it, Pearl laughed and began to

                <p>“Art thou my child, in very truth?” asked Hester.</p>
                
                <p>Nor did she put the question altogether idly, but, for  
                the moment, with a portion of genuine earnestness; for,  
                such was Pearl's wonderful intelligence, that her mother <!-- moth-er -->
                half doubted whether she were not acquainted with  
                the secret spell of her existence, and might not now reveal <!-- re-veal -->
                herself.</p>
                
                <p>“Yes; I am little Pearl!” repeated the child, continuing <!-- con-tinuing -->
                her antics.</p>
                
                <p>“Thou art not my child! Thou art no Pearl of  
                mine!” said the mother, half playfully; for it was  
                often the case that a sportive impulse came over her,  
                in the midst of her deepest suffering. “Tell me, then,  
                what thou art, and who sent thee hither?”</p>
                
                <p>“Tell me, mother!” said the child, seriously, coming <!-- com-ing -->
                up to Hester, and pressing herself close to her  
                knees. “Do thou tell me!”</p>
                
                <p>“Thy Heavenly Father sent thee!” answered Hester <!-- Hes-ter -->
                Prynne.</p>
                
                <p>But she said it with a hesitation that did not escape  
                the acuteness of the child. Whether moved only by

                prompted her, she put up her small forefinger, and  
                touched the scarlet letter.</p>
                
                <p>“He did not send me!” cried she, positively. “I  
                have no Heavenly Father!”</p>
                
                <p>“Hush, Pearl, hush! Thou must not talk so!”  
                answered the mother, suppressing a groan. “He sent  
                us all into this world. He sent even me, thy mother.  
                Then, much more, thee! Or, if not, thou strange and  
                elfish child, whence didst thou come?”</p>
                
                <p>“Tell me! Tell me!” repeated Pearl, no longer  
                seriously, but laughing, and <ref target="_capering" corresp="capering">capering</ref>

                <p>But Hester could not resolve the query, being herself  
                in a dismal labyrinth of doubt. She remembered—  
                betwixt a smile and a shudder—the talk of the neighbouring <!-- neigh-bouring -->
                townspeople; who, seeking vainly elsewhere  
                for the child's paternity, and observing some of her  
                odd attributes, had given out that poor little Pearl was  
                a demon offspring; such as, ever since old Catholic  
                times, had occasionally been seen on earth, through the  
                agency of their mothers' sin, and to promote some foul  
                and wicked purpose. Luther, according to the scandal <!-- scan-dal -->
                of his monkish enemies, was a brat of that hellish  
                breed; nor was Pearl the only child to whom this <ref corresp="inauspicious" target="_inauspicious">inauspicious</ref><!-- in-auspicious -->

                THE GOVERNOR'S HALL.</head>
                <p><hi rend="small-caps">Hester Prynne</hi> went, one day, to the mansion of  
                Governor Bellingham, with a pair of gloves, which she  
                had fringed and embroidered to his order, and which  
                were to be worn on some great occasion of state; for,  
                though the chances of a popular election had caused  
                this former ruler to descend a step or two from the  
                highest rank, he still held an honorable and influential  
                place among the colonial magistracy.</p>
                
                <p>Another and far more important reason than the
                delivery of a pair of embroidered gloves impelled  
                Hester, at this time, to seek an interview with a personage <!-- person-age -->
                of so much power and activity in the affairs of the  
                settlement. It had reached her ears, that there was a  
                design on the part of some of the leading inhabitants,  
                cherishing the more rigid order of principles in religion  
                and government, to deprive her of her child. On the  
                supposition that Pearl, as already hinted, was of demon  
                origin, these good people not unreasonably argued that  
                a Christian interest in the mother's soul required them  
                to remove such a stumbling-block from her path. If  
                the child, on the other hand, were really capable of  
                moral and religious growth, and possessed the elements  
                of ultimate salvation, then, surely, it would enjoy all

                the fairer prospect of these advantages by being transferred <!-- trans-ferred -->
                to wiser and better guardianship than Hester  
                Prynne's. Among those who promoted the design,  
                Governor Bellingham was said to be one of the most  
                busy. It may appear singular, and, indeed, not a little  
                ludicrous, that an affair of this kind, which, in later  
                days, would have been referred to no higher jurisdiction  
                than that of the <ref target="_selectmen" corresp="selectmen">selectmen</ref>

                been a question publicly discussed, and on which statesmen <!-- states-men -->

                simplicity, however, matters of even slighter public <!-- pub-lic -->
                interest, and of far less intrinsic weight than the  
                welfare of Hester and her child, were strangely mixed  
                up with the deliberations of legislators and acts of state.  
                The period was hardly, if at all, earlier than that of  
                our story, when a dispute concerning the right of property <!-- prop-erty -->
                in a pig, not only caused a fierce and bitter contest <!-- con-test -->
                in the legislative body of the colony, but resulted  
                in an important modification of the framework itself  
                of the legislature.</p>
                
                <p>Full of concern, therefore,—but so conscious of her  
                own right, that it seemed scarcely an unequal match between <!-- be-tween -->
                the public, on the one side, and a lonely woman,  
                backed by the sympathies of nature, on the other,—  
                Hester Prynne set forth from her solitary cottage. Little <!-- Lit-tle -->
                Pearl, of course, was her companion. She was  
                now of an age to run lightly along by her mother's

                could have accomplished a much longer journey than  
                that before her. Often, nevertheless, more from caprice <!-- ca-price -->

                eyes possessing intensity both of depth and glow,  
                and hair already of a deep, glossy brown, and which,  
                in after years, would be nearly akin to black. There  
                was fire in her and throughout her; she seemed the  
                unpremeditated offshoot of a passionate moment. Her  
                mother, in contriving the child's garb, had allowed the  
                gorgeous tendencies of her imagination their full play;  
                arraying her in a crimson velvet tunic, of a peculiar  
                cut, abundantly embroidered with fantasies and flourishes <!-- flour-ishes -->
                of gold thread. So much strength of coloring,  
                which must have given a wan and pallid aspect to  
                cheeks of a fainter bloom, was admirably adapted to  
                Pearl's beauty, and made her the very brightest little  
                jet of flame that ever danced upon the earth.</p>
                
                <p>But it was a remarkable attribute of this garb, and,  
                indeed, of the child's whole appearance, that it irresistibly <!-- irresist-ibly -->
                and inevitably reminded the beholder of the token  
                which Hester Prynne was doomed to wear upon her  
                bosom. It was the scarlet letter in another form;  
                the scarlet letter endowed with life! The mother

                letter; and, of a truth, moreover, there is the likeness  
                of the scarlet letter running along by her side! Come,  
                therefore, and let us fling mud at them!”</p>
                
                <p>But Pearl, who was a dauntless child, after frowning,  
                stamping her foot, and shaking her little hand with a  
                variety of threatening gestures, suddenly made a rush  
                at the knot of her enemies, and put them all to flight.  
                She resembled, in her fierce pursuit of them, an infant

                angel of judgment,—whose mission was to  
                punish the sins of the rising generation. She screamed

                doubtless caused the hearts of the fugitives to quake

                with wide-open eyes at the scarlet letter, which, being  
                a new-comer in the country, he had never before seen.  
                “Yea, his honorable worship is within. But he hath  
                a godly minister or two with him, and likewise a leech.  
                Ye may not see his worship now.”</p>
                
                <p>“Nevertheless, I will enter,” answered Hester  
                Prynne; and the bond-servant, perhaps judging from  
                the decision of her air and the glittering symbol in her  
                bosom, that she was a great lady in the land, offered no

                hall of entrance. With many variations, suggested by  
                the nature of his building-materials, diversity of climate, <!-- cli-mate -->
                and a different mode of social life, Governor  
                Bellingham had planned his new habitation after the  
                residences of gentlemen of fair estate in his native  
                land. Here, then, was a wide and reasonably lofty  
                hall, extending through the whole depth of the house,  
                and forming a medium of general communication,  
                more or less directly, with all the other apartments.  
                At one extremity, this spacious room was lighted by  
                <pb n="124"/>
                the windows of the two towers, which formed a small  
                recess on either side of the portal. At the other end,  
                though partly muffled by a curtain, it was more powerfully <!-- power-fully -->
                illuminated by one of those embowed hall-windows <!-- hall-win-dows -->
                which we read of in old books, and which was  
                provided with a deep and cushioned seat. Here, on  
                the cushion, lay a folio

                on the centre-table, to be turned over by the casual  
                guest. The furniture of the hall consisted of some  
                ponderous chairs, the backs of which were elaborately  
                carved with wreaths of oaken flowers; and likewise a  
                table in the same taste; the whole being of the Elizabethan <!-- Eliza-bethan -->
                age, or perhaps earlier, and heirlooms, transferred <!-- trans-ferred -->
                hither from the Governor's paternal home. On  
                the table—in token that the sentiment of old English  
                hospitality had not been left behind—stood a large  
                pewter tankard, at the bottom of which, had Hester or  
                Pearl peeped into it, they might have seen the frothy

                the forefathers of the Bellingham lineage, some with  
                armour on their breasts, and others with stately ruffs and  
                robes of peace. All were characterized by the sterness <!-- stern-ness -->
                and severity which old portraits so invariably put

                of departed worthies, and were gazing with harsh and

                living men.</p>

                the hall, was suspended a suit of mail, not, like the

                was likewise reflected in the mirror, with so much  
                breadth and intensity of effect, that it made Hester  
                Prynne feel as if it could not be the image of her own  
                child, but of an imp who was seeking to mould itself  
                into Pearl's shape.</p>
                
                <p>“Come along, Pearl!” said she, drawing her away.  
                “Come and look into this fair garden. It may be, we  
                shall see flowers there; more beautiful ones than we

                <p>Pearl, accordingly, ran to the bow-window, at the

                bordered with some rude and immature attempt at  
                shrubbery. But the proprietor appeared already to  
                have relinquished, as hopeless, the effort to perpetuate  
                on this side of the Atlantic, in a hard soil and amid the  
                close struggle for subsistence, the native English taste  
                for ornamental gardening. Cabbages grew in plain  
                sight; and a pumpkin vine, rooted at some distance,  
                had run across the intervening space, and deposited  
                one of its gigantic products directly beneath the hall-window; <!-- hall-window -->

                as a state merely of trial and warfare, and  
                though unfeignedly prepared to sacrifice goods and life  
                at the behest of duty—made it a matter of conscience  
                to reject such means of comfort, or even luxury, as lay  
                fairly within their grasp. This creed was never taught,  
                for instance, by the venerable pastor, John Wilson,  
                whose beard, white as a snow-drift, was seen over Governor <!-- Gov-ernor -->
                Bellingham's shoulder; while its wearer suggested <!-- sug-gested -->

                that pears and peaches might yet be naturalized  
                in the New England climate, and that purple grapes  
                might possibly be compelled to flourish, against the  
                sunny garden-wall. The old clergyman, nurtured at  
                the rich bosom of the English Church, had a long  
                established and legitimate taste for all good and comfortable <!-- com-fortable -->
                things; and however stern he might show  
                himself in the pulpit, or in his public reproof of such  
                transgressions as that of Hester Prynne, still, the genial  
                benevolence of his private life had won him warmer  
                affection than was accorded to any of his professional

                guests; one, the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, whom  
                the reader may remember, as having taken a brief and  
                reluctant part in the scene of Hester Prynne's disgrace;  
                and, in close companionship with him, old Roger Chillingworth, <!-- Chil-lingworth -->
                a person of great skill in physic, who, for  
                two or three years past, had been settled in the town.  
                It was understood that this learned man was the physician <!-- phy-sician -->
                as well as friend of the young minister, whose  
                health had severely suffered, of late, by his too unreserved <!-- unre-served -->
                self-sacrifice to the labors and duties of the pastoral <!-- pas-toral -->

                <p>The Governor, in advance of his visitors, ascended  
                one or two steps, and, throwing open the leaves of the  
                great hall window, found himself close to little Pearl.  
                The shadow of the curtain fell on Hester Prynne, and  
                partially concealed her.</p>
                
                <p>“What have we here?” said Governor Bellingham,

                wont to esteem it a high favor to be admitted to a court

                <p>Governor Bellingham stepped through the window

                <p>“Hester Prynne,” said he, fixing his naturally stern  
                regard on the wearer of the scarlet letter, “there hath  
                been much question concerning thee, of late. The  
                point hath been weightily discussed, whether we, that  
                are of authority and influence, do well discharge our  
                consciences by trusting an immortal soul, such as there  
                is in yonder child, to the guidance of one who hath  
                stumbled and fallen, amid the pitfalls of this world.  
                Speak thou, the child's own mother! Were it not,  
                thinkest thou, for thy little one's temporal and eternal  
                welfare, that she be taken out of thy charge, and clad  
                soberly, and disciplined strictly, and instructed in the  
                truths of heaven and earth? What canst thou do for  
                the child, in this kind?”</p>
                
                <p>“I can teach my little Pearl what I have learned  
                from this!” answered Hester Prynne, laying her finger  
                on the red token.</p>
                
                <p>“Woman, it is thy badge of shame!” replied the  
                stern magistrate. “It is because of the stain which  
                that letter indicates, that we would transfer thy child  
                to other hands.”</p>
                
                <p>“Nevertheless,” said the mother calmly, though  
                growing more pale, “this badge hath taught me,—it  
                daily teaches me,—it is teaching me at this moment,  
                —lessons whereof my child may be the wiser and  
                better, albeit they can profit nothing to myself.”</p>
                <pb n="132"/>
                <p>“We will judge warily,” said Bellingham, “and

                <p>The old minister seated himself in an arm-chair,  
                and made an effort to draw Pearl betwixt his knees.  
                But the child, unaccustomed to the touch or familiarity  
                of any but her mother, escaped through the open window <!-- window -->
                and stood on the upper step, looking like a wild,  
                tropical bird, of rich plumage, ready to take flight into

                imbibes with such eager interest. Pearl, therefore, so

                many ungracious refusals to answer good Mr. Wilson's  
                question, the child finally announced that she had not

                off the bush of wild roses, that grew by the prison-door.</p> <!-- prision-door -->
                
                <p>This fantasy was probably suggested by the near  
                proximity of the Governor's red roses, as Pearl stood  
                outside of the window; together with her recollection  
                of the prison rose-bush, which she had passed in coming <!-- com-ing -->

                <p>Old Roger Chillingworth, with a smile on his face,  
                whispered something in the young clergyman's ear.  
                Hester Prynne looked at the man of skill, and even  
                then, with her fate hanging in the balance, was startled  
                to perceive what a change had come over his features,  
                —how much uglier they were,—how his dark complexion <!-- com-plexion -->
                seemed to have grown duskier, and his figure  
                more misshapen,—since the days when she had familiarly <!-- famil-iarly -->
                known him. She met his eyes for an instant,  
                but was immediately constrained to give all her attention <!-- atten-tion -->
                to the scene now going forward.</p>
                
            <p>“This is awful!” cried the Governor, slowly recovering <!-- recov-ering -->
                from the astonishment into which Pearl's response  
                had thrown him. “Here is a child of three years old,  
                and she cannot tell who made her! Without question,  
                she is equally in the dark as to her soul, its present depravity, <!-- de-pravity -->
                and future destiny! Methinks, gentlemen, we  
                need inquire no further.”</p>
                <pb n="134"/>
                <p>Hester caught hold of Pearl, and drew her forcibly  
                into her arms, confronting the old Puritan magistrate  
                with almost a fierce expression. Alone in the world,  
                cast off by it, and with this sole treasure to keep her  
                heart alive, she felt that she possessed <ref target="_indefeasible" corresp="indefeasible">indefeasible</ref>

                rights against the world, and was ready to defend them  
                to the death.</p>
                
                <p>“God gave me the child!” cried she. “He gave  
                her, in <ref corresp="requital" target="_requital">requital</ref>
                of all things else, which ye had taken  
                from me. She is my happiness!—she is my torture,  
                none the less! Pearl keeps me here in life! Pearl  
                punishes me too! See ye not, she is the scarlet letter,  
                only capable of being loved, and so endowed with a  
                million-fold the power of retribution for my sin? Ye  
                shall not take her! I will die first!”</p>
                
                <p>“My poor woman,” said the not unkind old minister,  
                “the child shall be well cared for!—far better than  
                thou canst do it.”</p>
                
                <p>“God gave her into my keeping,” repeated Hester  
                Prynne, raising her voice almost to a shriek. “I will  
                not give her up!”—And here, by a sudden impulse,  
                she turned to the young clergyman, Mr. Dimmesdale, at  
                whom, up to this moment, she had seemed hardly so  
                much as once to direct her eyes.—“Speak thou for  
                me!” cried she. “Thou wast my pastor, and hadst  
                charge of my soul, and knowest me better than these  
                men can. I will not lose the child! Speak for me!  
                Thou knowest,—for thou hast sympathies which these  
                men lack!—thou knowest what is in my heart, and  
                what are a mother's rights, and how much the stronger  
                they are, when that mother has but her child and the

                <p>At this wild and singular appeal, which indicated that  
                Hester Prynne's situation had provoked her to little less  
                than madness, the young minister at once came forward, <!-- for-ward -->

                rang with it,—“truth in what Hester says, and in the

                <p>“It must be even so,” resumed the minister. “For,

                the Heavenly Father, the Creator of all flesh, hath  
                lightly recognized a deed of sin, and made of no account <!-- ac-count -->

                shame hath come from the hand of God, to work in  
                many ways upon her heart, who pleads so earnestly,  
                and with such bitterness of spirit, the right to keep her.  
                It was meant for a blessing; for the one blessing of her  
                life! It was meant, doubtless, as the mother herself  
                hath told us, for a retribution too; a torture, to be felt  
                at many an unthought of moment; a pang, a sting, an  
                ever-recurring agony, in the midst of a troubled joy!  
                Hath she not expressed this thought in the garb of the  
                poor child, so forcibly reminding us of that red symbol

                In their researches into the human frame, it may be that  
                the higher and more subtile faculties of such men were

                body Roger Chillingworth was a brilliant acquisition.

                Providence should see fit to remove him, it would be  
                because of his own unworthiness to perform its humblest <!-- hum-blest -->

                to Mr. Dimmesdale by the elder ministers of Boston  
                and the deacons of his church, who, to use their own  
                phrase, “dealt with him” on the sin of rejecting the  
                aid which Providence so manifestly held out. He  
                listened in silence, and finally promised to confer with  
                the physician.</p>
                
                <p>“Were it God's will,” said the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, <!-- Dim-mesdale -->
                when, in fulfilment of this pledge, he requested <!-- re-quested -->
                old Roger Chillingworth's professional advice,  
                “I could be well content, that my labors, and my sorrows, <!-- sor-rows -->
                and my sins, and my pains, should shortly end  
                with me, and what is earthly of them be buried in my  
                grave, and the spiritual go with me to my eternal state,  
                rather than that you should put your skill to the proof  
                in my behalf.”</p>
                
                <p>“Ah,” replied Roger Chillingworth, with that quietness <!-- quiet-ness -->
                which, whether imposed or natural, marked all his  
                deportment, “it is thus that a young clergyman is apt  
                to speak. Youthful men, not having taken a deep root,  
                give up their hold of life so easily! And saintly men,  
                who walk with God on earth, would fain be away, to  
                walk with him on the golden pavements of the New  
                Jerusalem.”</p>
                
                <p>“Nay,” rejoined the young minister, putting his  
                <pb n="146"/>
                hand to his heart, with a flush of pain flitting over his  
                brow, “were I worthier to walk there, I could be better  
                content to toil here.”</p>
                
                <p>“Good men ever interpret themselves too meanly,”  
                said the physician.</p>
                
                <p>In this manner, the mysterious old Roger Chillingworth <!-- Chilling-worth -->
                became the medical adviser of the Reverend  
                Mr. Dimmesdale. As not only the disease interested  
                the physician, but he was strongly moved to look into  
                the character and qualities of the patient, these two  
                men, so different in age, came gradually to spend  
                much time together. For the sake of the minister's  
                health, and to enable the leech to gather plants with  
                healing balm in them, they took long walks on the seashore, <!-- sea-shore -->
                or in the forest; mingling various talk with the  
                plash and murmur of the waves, and the solemn wind-anthem <!-- wind-anthem -->
                among the tree-tops. Often, likewise, one was  
                the guest of the other, in his place of study and retirement. <!-- re-tirement -->
                There was a fascination for the minister  
                in the company of the man of science, in whom he  
                recognized an intellectual cultivation of no moderate  
                depth or scope; together with a range and freedom of  
                ideas, that he would have vainly looked for among the  
                members of his own profession. In truth, he was startled, <!-- star-tled -->
                if not shocked, to find this attribute in the physician.  
                Mr. Dimmesdale was a true priest, a true religionist,  
                with the <ref corresp="reverential" target="_reverential">reverential</ref>

                an order of mind that impelled itself powerfully along  
                the track of a creed, and wore its passage continually  
                deeper with the lapse of time. In no state of society  
                would he have been what is called a man of liberal  
                <pb n="147"/>
                views; it would always be essential to his peace to feel  
                the pressure of a faith about him, supporting, while it  
                confined him within its iron framework. Not the less,  
                however, though with a tremulous enjoyment, did he  
                feel the occasional relief of looking at the universe  
                through the medium of another kind of intellect than  
                those with which he habitually held converse. It was  
                as if a window were thrown open, admitting a freer  
                atmosphere into the close and stifled study, where his  
                life was wasting itself away, amid lamp-light, or obstructed <!-- ob-structed -->
                day-beams, and the musty fragrance, be it  
                sensual or moral, that exhales from books. But the air  
                was too fresh and chill to be long breathed, with comfort. <!-- com-fort -->
                So the minister, and the physician with him, withdrew <!-- with-drew -->
                again within the limits of what their church  
                defined as orthodox.</p>

                which might call out something new to the surface of  
                his character. He deemed it essential, it would seem,  
                to know the man, before attempting to do him good.  
                Whenever there is a heart and an intellect, the diseases  
                of the physical frame are tinged with the peculiarities  
                of these. In Arthur Dimmesdale, thought and imagination <!-- imagi-nation -->
                were so active, and sensibility so intense, that  
                the bodily infirmity would be likely to have its groundwork <!-- ground-work -->
                there. So Roger Chillingworth—the man of  
                skill, the kind and friendly physician—strove to go  
                <pb n="148"/>
                deep into his patient's bosom, delving among his principles, <!-- prin-ciples -->
                prying into his recollections, and probing every  
                thing with a cautious touch, like a treasure-seeker in

                who has opportunity and license to undertake such a  
                quest, and skill to follow it up. A man burdened with  
                a secret should especially avoid the intimacy of his  
                physician. If the latter possess native <ref target="_sagacity" corresp="sagacity">sagacity,</ref>

                nameless something more,—let us call it intuition; if he  
                show no intrusive egotism, nor disagreeably prominent  
                characteristics of his own; if he have the power, which  
                must be born with him, to bring his mind into such  
                affinity with his patient's, that this last shall unawares  
                have spoken what he imagines himself only to have  
                thought; if such revelations be received without tumult,  
                and acknowledged not so often by an uttered sympathy,  
                as by silence, an inarticulate breath, and here and  
                there a word, to indicate that all is understood; if, to  
                these qualifications of a confidant be joined the advantages <!-- ad-vantages -->
                afforded by his recognized character as a  
                physician;—then, at some inevitable moment, will the  
                soul of the sufferer be dissolved, and flow forth in a  
                dark, but transparent stream, bringing all its mysteries  
                into the daylight.</p>
                
                <p>Roger Chillingworth possessed all, or most, of the  
                attributes above enumerated. Nevertheless, time went  
                on; a kind of intimacy, as we have said, grew up between <!-- be-tween -->
                these two cultivated minds, which had as wide a  
                field as the whole sphere of human thought and study,  
                to meet upon; they discussed every topic of ethics and  
                religion, of public affairs, and private character; they  
                <pb n="149"/>
                talked much, on both sides, of matters that seemed  
                personal to themselves; and yet no secret, such as the  
                physician fancied must exist there, ever stole out of the  
                minister's consciousness into his companion's ear. The  
                latter had his suspicions, indeed, that even the nature  
                of Mr. Dimmesdale's bodily disease had never fairly  
                been revealed to him. It was a strange reserve!</p>
                
                <p>After a time, at a hint from Roger Chillingworth, the  
                friends of Mr. Dimmesdale effected an arrangement by  
                which the two were lodged in the same house; so that  
                every ebb and flow of the minister's life-tide might  
                pass under the eye of his anxious and attached physician. <!-- physi-cian -->
                There was much joy throughout the town, when  
                this greatly desirable object was attained. It was held  
                to be the best possible measure for the young clergyman's <!-- clergy-man's -->
                welfare; unless, indeed, as often urged by such  
                as felt authorized to do so, he had selected some one  
                of the many blooming damsels, spiritually devoted to  
                him, to become his devoted wife. This latter step,  
                however, there was no present prospect that Arthur  
                Dimmesdale would be prevailed upon to take; he  
                rejected all suggestions of the kind, as if priestly  
                celibacy were one of his articles of church-discipline.  
                Doomed by his own choice, therefore, as Mr. Dimmesdale <!-- Dimmes-dale -->
                so evidently was, to eat his unsavory morsel  
                always at another's board, and endure the life-long chill  
                which must be his lot who seeks to warm himself only  
                at another's fireside, it truly seemed that this <ref corresp="sagacious" target="_sagacious">sagacious,</ref>
                experienced, benevolent, old physician, with his concord <!-- con-chord -->
                of paternal and reverential love for the young  
                pastor, was the very man, of all mankind, to be constantly <!-- con-stantly -->

                <pb n="150"/>
                <p>The new abode of the two friends was with a pious  
                widow, of good social rank, who dwelt in a house covering <!-- cov-ering -->
                pretty nearly the site on which the venerable  
                structure of King's Chapel has since been built. It had  
                the grave-yard, originally Isaac Johnson's home-field,  
                on one side, and so was well adapted to call up serious  
                reflections, suited to their respective employments, in  
                both minister and man of physic. The motherly care  
                of the good widow assigned to Mr. Dimmesdale a front  
                apartment, with a sunny exposure, and heavy window-curtains <!-- window-curtains -->
                to create a noontide shadow, when desirable.

                implicated in the affair of Overbury. Two or three  
                individuals hinted, that the man of skill, during his  
                Indian captivity, had enlarged his medical attainments  
                by joining in the incantations of the savage priests;  
                <pb n="152"/>
                who were universally acknowledged to be powerful enchanters, <!-- en-chanters -->
                often performing seemingly miraculous cures  
                by their skill in the black art. A large number—and  
                many of these were persons of such sober sense and  
                practical observation, that their opinions would have  
                been valuable, in other matters—affirmed that Roger  
                Chillingworth's aspect had undergone a remarkable  
                change while he had dwelt in town, and especially  
                since his abode with Mr. Dimmesdale. At first, his  
                expression had been calm, meditative, scholar-like.  
                Now, there was something ugly and evil in his face,  
                which they had not previously noticed, and which grew  
                still the more obvious to sight, the oftener they looked  
                upon him. According to the vulgar idea, the fire in  
                his laboratory had been brought from the lower regions, <!-- re-gions -->
                and was fed with infernal fuel; and so, as might  
                be expected, his visage was getting sooty with the  
                smoke.</p>
                
                <p>To sum up the matter, it grew to be a widely diffused <!-- dif-fused -->
                opinion, that the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale,  
                like many other personages of especial sanctity, in all  
                ages of the Christian world, was haunted either by  
                Satan himself, or Satan's emissary, in the guise of old  
                Roger Chillingworth. This diabolical agent had the  
                Divine permission, for a season, to burrow into the  
                clergyman's intimacy, and plot against his soul. No  
                sensible man, it was confessed, could doubt on which  
                side the victory would turn. The people looked, with  
                an unshaken hope, to see the minister come forth out  
                of the conflict, transfigured with the glory which he  
                would unquestionably win. Meanwhile, nevertheless,  
                <pb n="153"/>
                it was sad to think of the perchance mortal agony  
                through which he must struggle towards his triumph.</p>
                
                <p>Alas, to judge from the gloom and terror in the  
                depths of the poor minister's eyes, the battle was a sore  
                one, and the victory any thing but secure!</p>

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">Old</hi> Roger Chillingworth, throughout life, had been  
                calm in temperament, kindly, though not of warm  
                affections, but ever, and in all his relations with the  
                world, a pure and upright man. He had begun an investigation, <!-- in-vestigation -->
                as he imagined, with the severe and equal  
                integrity of a judge, desirous only of truth, even as if  
                the question involved no more than the air-drawn lines  
                and figures of a geometrical problem, instead of human  
                passions, and wrongs inflicted on himself. But, as he  
                proceeded, a terrible fascination, a kind of fierce,  
                though still calm, necessity seized the old man within  
                its gripe, and never set him free again, until he had  
                done all its bidding. He now dug into the poor clergyman's <!-- clergy-man's -->
                heart, like a miner searching for gold; or, rather,

                shown indications that encouraged him.</p>
                
                <p>“This man,” said he, at one such moment, to himself, <!-- him-self -->
                “pure as they deem him,—all spiritual as he  
                seems,—hath inherited a strong animal nature from

                the direction of this vein!”</p>
                
                <p>Then, after long search into the minister's dim interior, <!-- in-terior -->
                and turning over many precious materials, in the  
                shape of high aspirations for the welfare of his race,  
                warm love of souls, pure sentiments, natural piety,  
                strengthened by thought and study, and illuminated by  
                revelation,—all of which invaluable gold was perhaps  
                no better than rubbish to the seeker,—he would turn  
                back, discouraged, and begin his quest towards another  
                point. He groped along as stealthily, with as cautious  
                a tread, and as wary an outlook, as a thief entering a  
                chamber where a man lies only half asleep,—or, it  
                may be, broad awake,—with purpose to steal the very  
                treasure which this man guards as the apple of his eye.  
                In spite of his premeditated carefulness, the floor would  
                now and then creak; his garments would rustle; the  
                shadow of his presence, in a forbidden proximity,  
                would be thrown across his victim. In other words,  
                Mr. Dimmesdale, whose sensibility of nerve often produced <!-- pro-duced -->
                the effect of spiritual intuition, would become  
                vaguely aware that something <ref target="_inimical" corresp="inimical">inimical</ref>

                had thrust itself into relation with him. But old Roger  
                Chillingworth, too, had perceptions that were almost  
                intuitive; and when the minister threw his startled eyes  
                towards him, there the physician sat; his kind, watchful, <!-- watch-ful -->
                sympathizing, but never intrusive friend.</p>
                <pb n="156"/>
                <p>Yet Mr. Dimmesdale would perhaps have seen this  
                individual's character more perfectly, if a certain  
                morbidness, to which sick hearts are liable, had not  
                rendered him suspicious of all mankind. Trusting no  
                man as his friend, he could not recognize his enemy  
                when the latter actually appeared. He therefore still  
                kept up a familiar intercourse with him, daily receiving  
                the old physician in his study; or visiting the laboratory, <!-- labora-tory -->
                and, for recreation's sake, watching the processes  
                by which weeds were converted into drugs of potency.</p>
                
                <p>One day, leaning his forehead on his hand, and  
                his elbow on the sill of the open window, that looked  
                towards the grave-yard, he talked with Roger Chillingworth, <!-- Chilling-worth -->
                while the old man was examining a bundle of  
                unsightly plants.</p>

                for it was the clergyman's peculiarity that he seldom,  
                now-a-days, looked straightforth at any object, whether  
                human or inanimate,—“where, my kind doctor, did  
                you gather those herbs, with such a dark, flabby leaf?”</p>
                
                <p>“Even in the grave-yard, here at hand,” answered  
                the physician, continuing his employment. “They are  
                new to me. I found them growing on a grave, which  
                bore no tombstone, nor other memorial of the dead  
                man, save these ugly weeds that have taken upon themselves <!-- them-selves -->

                to confess during his lifetime.”</p>
                
                <p>“Perchance,” said Mr. Dimmesdale, “he earnestly  
                desired it, but could not.”</p>
                <pb n="157"/>
                <p>“And wherefore?” rejoined the physician. “Wherefore <!-- Where-fore -->
                not; since all the powers of nature call so earnestly <!-- earnest-ly -->
                for the confession of sin, that these black weeds  
                have sprung up out of a buried heart, to make manifest  
                an unspoken crime?”</p>
                
                <p>“That, good Sir, is but a fantasy of yours,” replied  
                the minister. “There can be, if I forebode aright, no  
                power, short of the Divine mercy, to disclose, whether  
                by uttered words, or by type or emblem, the secrets  
                that may be buried with a human heart. The heart,  
                making itself guilty of such secrets, must perforce  
                hold them, until the day when all hidden things shall  
                be revealed. Nor have I so read or interpreted

                </note> as to understand that the disclosure of human
                thoughts and deeds, then to be made, is intended as a  
                part of the retribution. That, surely, were a shallow  
                view of it. No; these revelations, unless I greatly  
                err, are meant merely to promote the intellectual satisfaction <!-- satis-faction -->
                of all intelligent beings, who will stand waiting,  
                on that day, to see the dark problem of this life made  
                plain. A knowledge of men's hearts will be needful  
                to the completest solution of that problem. And I conceive, <!-- con-ceive -->
                moreover, that the hearts holding such miserable  
                secrets as you speak of will yield them up, at that last  
                day, not with reluctance, but with a joy unutterable.”</p>
                
                <p>“Then why not reveal them here?” asked Roger  
                Chillingworth, glancing quietly aside at the minister.  
                “Why should not the guilty ones sooner avail themselves <!-- them-selves -->
                of this unutterable solace?”</p>
                
                <p>“They mostly do,” said the clergyman, griping  
                hard at his breast, as if afflicted with an importunate  
                <pb n="158"/>
                throb of pain. “Many, many a poor soul hath given  
                its confidence to me, not only on the death-bed, but  
                while strong in life, and fair in reputation. And ever,  
                after such an outpouring, O, what a relief have I witnessed <!-- wit-nessed -->
                in those sinful brethren! even as in one who at  
                last draws free air, after long stifling with his own  
                polluted breath. How can it be otherwise? Why  
                should a wretched man, guilty, we will say, of murder,  
                prefer to keep the dead corpse buried in his own heart,  
                rather than fling it forth at once, and let the universe  
                take care of it!”</p>
                
                <p>“Yet some men bury their secrets thus,” observed  
                the calm physician.</p>
                
                <p>“True; there are such men,” answered Mr. Dimmesdale. <!-- Dim-mesdale -->
                “But, not to suggest more obvious reasons,  
                it may be that they are kept silent by the very constitution <!-- consti-tution -->
                of their nature. Or,—can we not suppose it?—  
                guilty as they may be, retaining, nevertheless, a zeal  
                for God's glory and man's welfare, they shrink from  
                displaying themselves black and filthy in the view of  
                men; because, thenceforward, no good can be achieved  
                by them; no evil of the past be redeemed by better  
                service. So, to their own unutterable torment, they go  
                about among their fellow-creatures, looking pure as

                and spotted with iniquity of which they cannot rid themselves."</p> <!-- them-selves -->
                
                <p>“These men deceive themselves,” said Roger Chillingworth, <!-- Chil-lingworth -->
                with somewhat more emphasis than usual,  
                and making a slight gesture with his forefinger. “They

                and nervous temperament.—“But, now, I would  
                ask of my well-skilled physician, whether, in good  
                sooth, he deems me to have profited by his kindly care  
                of this weak frame of mine?”</p>
                
                <p>Before Roger Chillingworth could answer, they heard  
                the clear, wild laughter of a young child's voice, proceeding <!-- pro-ceeding -->
                from the adjacent burial-ground. Looking  
                instinctively from the open window,—for it was summertime,-the <!-- sum-mer-time -->
                minister beheld Hester Prynne and  
                little Pearl passing along the footpath that traversed the  
                inclosure. Pearl looked as beautiful as the day, but  
                was in one of those moods of perverse merriment  
                which, whenever they occurred, seemed to remove her

                <p>Roger Chillingworth had by this time approached  
                the window, and smiled grimly down.</p>
                
                <p>“There is no law, nor reverence for authority, no  
                regard for human ordinances or opinions, right or  
                wrong, mixed up with that child's composition,” remarked <!-- re-marked -->
                he, as much to himself as to his companion.  
                “I saw her, the other day, bespatter the Governor  
                himself with water, at the cattle-trough in Spring Lane.  
                What, in Heaven's name, is she? Is the imp altogether <!-- alto-gether -->

                principle of being?”</p>
                
                <p>“None,—save the freedom of a broken law,” answered <!-- an-swered -->
                Mr. Dimmesdale, in a quiet way, as if he had  
                been discussing the point within himself. “Whether  
                capable of good, I know not.”</p>
                
                <p>The child probably overheard their voices; for, looking <!-- look-ing -->
                up to the window, with a bright, but naughty smile  
                of mirth and intelligence, she threw one of the prickly  
                <pb n="161"/>
                burrs at the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale. The sensitive  
                clergyman shrunk, with nervous dread, from the light  
                missile. Detecting his emotion, Pearl clapped her little  
                hands in the most extravagant ecstasy. Hester Prynne,  
                likewise, had involuntarily looked up; and all these  
                four persons, old and young, regarded one another in  
                silence, till the child laughed aloud, and shouted,—  
                “Come away, mother! Come away, or <ref corresp="yonder" target="_yonder">yonder</ref>

                Black Man will catch you! He hath got hold of the  
                minister already. Come away, mother, or he will catch  
                you! But he cannot catch little Pearl!”</p>
                
                <p>So she drew her mother away, skipping, dancing,  
                and frisking fantastically among the hillocks of the  
                dead people, like a creature that had nothing in common <!-- com-mon -->
                with a bygone and buried generation, nor owned  
                herself akin to it. It was as if she had been made  
                afresh, out of new elements, and must perforce be permitted <!-- per-mitted -->
                to live her own life, and be a law unto herself,  
                without her eccentricities being reckoned to her for a  
                crime.</p>
                
                <p>“There goes a woman,” resumed Roger Chillingworth, <!-- Chilling-worth -->
                after a pause, “who, be her demerits what they  
                may, hath none of that mystery of hidden sinfulness  
                which you deem so grievous to be borne. Is Hester  
                Prynne the less miserable, think you, for that scarlet  
                letter on her breast?”</p>
                
                <p>“I do verily believe it,” answered the clergyman.  
                “Nevertheless, I cannot answer for her. There was  
                a look of pain in her face, which I would gladly have  
                been spared the sight of. But still, methinks, it must  
                needs be better for the sufferer to be free to show his  
                <pb n="162"/>
                pain, as this poor woman Hester is, than to cover it all  
                up in his heart.”</p>
                
                <p>There was another pause; and the physician began  
                anew to examine and arrange the plants which he had  
                gathered.</p>
                
                <p>“You inquired of me, a little time agone,” said he,  
                at length, “my judgment as touching your health.”</p>
                
                <p>“I did,” answered the clergyman, “and would gladly <!-- glad-ly -->
                learn it. Speak frankly, I pray you, be it for life or  
                death.”</p>
                
                <p>“Freely, then, and plainly,” said the physician, still  
                busy with his plants, but keeping a wary eye on Mr.  
                Dimmesdale, “the disorder is a strange one; not so  
                much in itself, nor as outwardly manifested,—in so  
                far, at least, as the symptoms have been laid open to  
                my observation. Looking daily at you, my good Sir,  
                and watching the tokens of your aspect, now for months  
                gone by, I should deem you a man sore sick, it may be,  
                yet not so sick but that an instructed and watchful physician <!-- phy-sician -->
                might well hope to cure you. But—I know not  
                what to say—the disease is what I seem to know, yet  
                know it not.”</p>
                
                <p>“You speak in riddles, learned Sir,” said the pale  
                minister, glancing aside out of the window.</p>
                
                <p>“Then, to speak more plainly,” continued the physician, <!-- phy-sician -->
                “and I crave pardon, Sir,—should it seem to  
                require pardon,—for this needful plainness of my  
                speech. Let me ask,—as your friend,—as one having <!-- hav-ing -->
                charge, under Providence, of your life and physical  
                well-being,—hath all the operation of this disorder been  
                fairly laid open and recounted to me?”</p>
                <pb n="163"/>
                <p>“How can you question it?” asked the minister.  
                “Surely, it were child's play to call in a physician,  
                and then hide the sore!”</p>
                
                <p>“You would tell me, then, that I know all?” said  
                Roger Chillingworth, deliberately, and fixing an eye,  
                bright with intense and concentrated intelligence, on  
                the minister's face. “Be it so! But, again! He  
                to whom only the outward and physical evil is laid  
                open knoweth, oftentimes, but half the evil which he  
                is called upon to cure. A bodily disease, which we  
                look upon as whole and entire within itself, may, after  
                all, be but a symptom of some ailment in the spiritual  
                part. Your pardon, once again, good Sir, if my speech  
                give the shadow of offence. You, Sir, of all men  
                whom I have known, are he whose body is the closest  
                conjoined, and imbued, and identified, so to speak,  
                with the spirit whereof it is the instrument.”</p>
                
                <p>“Then I need ask no further,” said the clergyman,  
                somewhat hastily rising from his chair. “You deal not,  
                I take it, in medicine for the soul!”</p>
                
                <p>“Thus, a sickness,” continued Roger Chillingworth,  
                going on, in an unaltered tone, without heeding the  
                interruption,—but standing up, and confronting the  
                emaciated and white-cheeked minister with his low,  
                dark, and misshapen figure,—“a sickness, a sore  
                place, if we may so call it, in your spirit, hath immediately <!-- imme-diately -->
                its appropriate manifestation in your bodily  
                frame. Would you, therefore, that your physician heal  
                the bodily evil? How may this be, unless you first  
                lay open to him the wound or trouble in your soul?”</p>
                
                <p>“No!—not to thee!—not to an earthly physician!" <!-- physi-cian -->
                <pb n="164"/>
                cried Mr. Dimmesdale, passionately, and turning <!-- turn-ing -->
                his eyes, full and bright, and with a kind of fierceness, <!-- fierce-ness -->
                on old Roger Chillingworth. “Not to thee!  
                But, if it be the soul's disease, then do I commit myself <!-- my-self -->
                to the one Physician of the soul! He, if it stand  
                with his good pleasure, can cure; or he can kill! Let  
                him do with me as, in his justice and wisdom, he shall  
                see good. But who art thou, that meddlest in this matter?-that <!-- mat-ter -->
                dares thrust himself between the sufferer  
                and his God?”</p>
                
                <p>With a frantic gesture, he rushed out of the room.</p>
                
                <p>“It is as well to have made this step,” said Roger  
                Chillingworth to himself, looking after the minister with  
                a grave smile. “There is nothing lost. We shall be  
                friends again <ref corresp="anon" target="_anon">anon.</ref>

                <p>It proved not difficult to reestablish the intimacy of  
                the two companions, on the same footing and in the  
                same degree as heretofore. The young clergyman,  
                after a few hours of privacy, was sensible that the  
                disorder of his nerves had hurried him into an unseemly <!-- un-seemly -->

                the advice which it was his duty to bestow, and  
                which the minister himself had expressly sought. With  
                these remorseful feelings, he lost no time in making  
                <pb n="165"/>
                the amplest apologies, and besought his friend still to  
                continue the care, which, if not successful in restoring  
                him to health, had, in all probability, been the means  
                of prolonging his feeble existence to that hour. Roger  
                Chillingworth readily assented, and went on with his  
                medical supervision of the minister; doing his best for  
                him, in all good faith, but always quitting the patient's  
                apartment, at the close of a professional interview, with  
                a mysterious and puzzled smile upon his lips. This expression <!-- ex-pression -->
                was invisible in Mr. Dimmesdale's presence,  
                but grew strongly evident as the physician crossed the  
                threshold.</p>
                
                <p>“A rare case!” he muttered. “I must needs look

                The profound depth of the minister's repose  
                was the more remarkable; inasmuch as he was one of  
                those persons whose sleep, ordinarily, is as light, as  
                fitful, and as easily scared away, as a small bird hopping <!-- hop-ping -->

                <p>But with what a wild look of wonder, joy, and  
                horror! With what a ghastly rapture, as it were, too

                and therefore bursting forth through the whole ugliness

                THE INTERIOR OF A HEART.</head>
                <p><hi rend="small-caps">After</hi> the incident last described, the intercourse  
                between the clergyman and the physician, though externally <!-- ex-ternally -->
                the same, was really of another character than  
                it had previously been. The intellect of Roger Chillingworth <!-- Chil-lingworth -->
                had now a sufficiently plain path before it.  
                It was not, indeed, precisely that which he had laid out  
                for himself to tread. Calm, gentle, passionless, as he  
                appeared, there was yet, we fear, a quiet depth of  
                malice, hitherto latent, but active now, in this unfortunate <!-- unfortu-nate -->
                old man, which led him to imagine a more intimate <!-- inti-mate -->
                revenge than any mortal had ever wreaked upon  
                an enemy. To make himself the one trusted friend,  
                to whom should be confided all the fear, the remorse,  
                the agony, the ineffectual repentance, the backward  
                rush of sinful thoughts, expelled in vain! All that  
                guilty sorrow, hidden from the world, whose great heart  
                would have pitied and forgiven, to be revealed to him,  
                the Pitiless, to him, the Unforgiving! All that dark  
                treasure to be lavished on the very man, to whom  
                nothing else could so adequately pay the debt of vengeance!</p> <!-- ven-geance -->
                
                <p>The clergyman's shy and sensitive reserve had  
                balked this scheme. Roger Chillingworth, however,  
                <pb n="168"/>
                was inclined to be hardly, if at all, less satisfied with  
                the aspect of affairs, which Providence—using the  
                avenger and his victim for its own purposes, and, perchance, <!-- per-chance -->
                pardoning, where it seemed most to punish—  
                had substituted for his black devices. A revelation, he  
                could almost say, had been granted to him. It mattered  
                little, for his object, whether celestial, or from what  
                other region. By its aid, in all the subsequent relations  
                betwixt him and Mr. Dimmesdale, not merely the external <!-- exter-nal -->
                presence, but the very inmost soul of the latter  
                seemed to be brought out before his eyes, so that he  
                could see and comprehend its every movement. He  
                became, thenceforth, not a spectator only, but a chief  
                actor, in the poor minister's interior world. He could  
                play upon him as he chose. Would he arouse him  
                with a throb of agony? The victim was for ever on  
                the rack; it needed only to know the spring that controlled <!-- con-trolled -->
                the engine;—and the physician knew it well!  
                Would he startle him with sudden fear? As at the  
                waving of a magician's wand, uprose a grisly phantom,  
                —uprose a thousand phantoms,—in many shapes, of  
                death, or more awful shame, all flocking round about  
                the clergyman, and pointing with their fingers at his  
                breast!</p>
                
                <p>All this was accomplished with a subtlety so perfect,  
                that the minister, though he had constantly a dim perception <!-- per-ception -->
                of some evil influence watching over him, could  
                never gain a knowledge of its actual nature. True,  
                he looked doubtfully, fearfully,—even, at times, with  
                horror and the bitterness of hatred,—at the deformed  
                figure of the old physician. His gestures, his gait, his

                he was willing to acknowledge to himself. For, as it  
                was impossible to assign a reason for such distrust and  
                abhorrence, so Mr. Dimmesdale, conscious that the poison <!-- poi-son -->
                of one morbid spot was infecting his heart's entire  
                substance, attributed all his presentiments to no other  
                cause. He took himself to task for his bad sympathies  
                in reference to Roger Chillingworth, disregarded the  
                lesson that he should have drawn from them, and did  
                his best to root them out. Unable to accomplish this,  
                he nevertheless, as a matter of principle, continued his  
                habits of social familiarity with the old man, and thus  
                gave him constant opportunities for perfecting the purpose <!-- pur-pose -->

                sympathies so intimate with the sinful brotherhood of  
                mankind; so that his heart vibrated in unison with  
                theirs, and received their pain into itself, and sent its  
                own throb of pain through a thousand other hearts, in  
                gushes of sad, persuasive eloquence. Oftenest persuasive, <!-- persua-sive -->
                but sometimes terrible! The people knew not  
                the power that moved them thus. They deemed the  
                young clergyman a miracle of holiness. They fancied  
                him the mouth-piece of Heaven's messages of wisdom,  
                and rebuke, and love. In their eyes, the very ground  
                on which he trod was sanctified. The virgins of his  
                church grew pale around him, victims of a passion so  
                imbued with religious sentiment that they imagined it  
                to be all religion, and brought it openly, in their white  
                bosoms, as their most acceptable sacrifice before the  
                altar. The aged members of his flock, beholding Mr.

                so rugged in their infirmity, believed that he

                upon their children, that their old bones should be buried <!-- bur-ied -->
                close to their young pastor's holy grave. And, all  
                this time, perchance, when poor Mr. Dimmesdale was  
                <pb n="172"/>
                thinking of his grave, he questioned with himself

                <p>It is inconceivable, the agony with which this public  
                veneration tortured him! It was his genuine impulse  
                to adore the truth, and to reckon all things shadow-like,  
                and utterly devoid of weight or value, that had not its  
                divine essence as the life within their life. Then, what  
                was he?—a substance?—or the dimmest of all shadows? <!-- shad-ows -->
                He longed to speak out, from his own pulpit, at  
                the full height of his voice, and tell the people what he  
                was. “I, whom you behold in these black garments of

                But how? He had told his hearers that he was altogether <!-- alto-gether -->
                vile, a viler companion of the vilest, the worst  
                of sinners, an abomination, a thing of unimaginable  
                iniquity; and that the only wonder was, that they did  
                not see his wretched body shrivelled up before their  
                eyes, by the burning wrath of the Almighty! Could  
                there be plainer speech than this? Would not the  
                people start up in their seats, by a simultaneous impulse, <!-- im-pulse -->
                and tear him down out of the pulpit which he  
                defiled? Not so, indeed! They heard it all, and did  
                but reverence him the more. They little guessed what  
                deadly purport lurked in those self-condemning words.  
                “The godly youth!” said they among themselves.  
                “The saint on earth! Alas, if he discern such sinfulness <!-- sin-fulness -->
                in his own white soul, what horrid spectacle  
                would he behold in thine or mine!” The minister  
                well knew—subtle, but remorseful hypocrite that he  
                was!—the light in which his vague confession would  
                be viewed. He had striven to put a cheat upon himself <!-- him-self -->

                He had spoken the very truth, and transformed <!-- trans-formed -->
                it into the veriest falsehood. And yet, by the  
                constitution of his nature, he loved the truth, and  
                loathed the lie, as few men ever did. Therefore,  
                above all things else, he loathed his miserable self!</p>

                with the better light of the church in which he had  
                been born and bred. In Mr. Dimmesdale's secret  
                closet, under lock and key, there was a bloody scourge.  
                Oftentimes, this Protestant and Puritan divine had plied  
                it on his own shoulders; laughing bitterly at himself  
                the while, and smiting so much the more pitilessly, because <!-- be-cause -->
                of that bitter laugh. It was his custom, too, as  
                it has been that of many other pious Puritans, to fast,  
                —not, however, like them, in order to purify the body  
                and render it the fitter medium of celestial illumination,  
                —but rigorously, and until his knees trembled beneath  
                him, as an act of penance. He kept <ref corresp="vigils" target="_vigils">vigils,</ref>

                his own face in a looking-glass, by the most powerful <!-- power-ful -->
                light which he could throw upon it. He thus  
                typified the constant introspection wherewith he tortured, <!-- tor-tured -->
                but could not purify, himself. In these lengthened  
                vigils, his brain often reeled, and visions seemed to <ref target="_flit" corresp="flit">flit</ref>

                light of their own, in the remote dimness of the chamber, <!-- cham-ber -->
                or more vividly, and close beside him, within the  
                looking-glass. Now it was a herd of diabolic shapes,  
                that grinned and mocked at the pale minister, and  
                beckoned him away with them; now a group of shining  
                angels, who flew upward heavily, as sorrow-laden, but  
                grew more ethereal as they rose. Now came the dead  
                friends of his youth, and his white-bearded father, with  
                a saint-like frown, and his mother, turning her face  
                away as she passed by. Ghost of a mother,—thinnest <!-- thin-nest -->

                <pb n="175"/>
                have thrown a pitying glance towards her son! And  
                now, through the chamber which these spectral thoughts  
                had made so ghastly, glided Hester Prynne, leading  
                along little Pearl, in her scarlet garb, and pointing her  
                forefinger, first, at the scarlet letter on her bosom, and  
                then at the clergyman's own breast.</p>
                
                <p>None of these visions ever quite deluded him. At  
                any moment, by an effort of his will, he could discern  
                substances through their misty lack of substance, and  
                convince himself that they were not solid in their  
                nature, like yonder table of carved oak, or that big,  
                square, leathern-bound and brazen-clasped volume of  
                divinity. But, for all that, they were, in one sense,  
                the truest and most substantial things which the poor  
                minister now dealt with. It is the unspeakable misery  
                of a life so false as his, that it steals the pith and substance <!-- sub-stance -->
                out of whatever realities there are around us,  
                and which were meant by Heaven to be the spirit's joy  
                and nutriment. To the untrue man, the whole universe  
                is false,—it is <ref corresp="impalpable" target="_impalpable">impalpable,</ref>

                where, now so long since, Hester Prynne had lived  
                through her first hour of public ignominy. The same  
                platform or scaffold, black and weather-stained with  
                the storm or sunshine of seven long years, and foot-worn, <!-- foot-worn -->
                too, with the tread of many culprits who had  
                since ascended it, remained standing beneath the balcony <!-- bal-cony -->
                of the meeting-house. The minister went up the  
                steps.</p>
                
                <p>It was an obscure night of early May. An unvaried  
                pall of cloud muffled the whole expanse of sky from  
                zenith to horizon. If the same multitude which had  
                stood as eyewitnesses while Hester Prynne sustained  
                her punishment could now have been summoned forth,  
                they would have discerned no face above the platform,  
                nor hardly the outline of a human shape, in the dark  
                gray of the midnight. But the town was all asleep.  
                There was no peril of discovery. The minister might  
                stand there, if it so pleased him, until morning should  
                redden in the east, without other risk than that the dank  
                and chill night-air would creep into his frame, and

                Why, then, had he come hither? Was it but the mockery <!-- mock-ery -->

                a great horror of mind, as if the universe were gazing  
                at a scarlet token on his naked breast, right over his  
                heart. On that spot, in very truth, there was, and  
                there had long been, the gnawing and poisonous tooth  
                of bodily pain. Without any effort of his will, or  
                <pb n="179"/>
                power to restrain himself, he shrieked aloud; an outcry  
                that went pealing through the night, and was beaten  
                back from one house to another, and reverberated from  
                the hills in the background; as if a company of devils,  
                detecting so much misery and terror in it, had made a

                <p>“It is done!” muttered the minister, covering his  
                face with his hands. “The whole town will awake,  
                and hurry forth, and find me here!”</p>
                
                <p>But it was not so. The shriek had perhaps sounded  
                with a far greater power, to his own startled ears, than  
                it actually possessed. The town did not awake; or, if  
                it did, the drowsy slumberers mistook the cry either for  
                something frightful in a dream, or for the noise of  
                witches; whose voices, at that period, were often heard  
                to pass over the settlements or lonely cottages, as they  
                rode with Satan through the air. The clergyman,  
                therefore, hearing no symptoms of disturbance, uncovered <!-- un-covered -->
                his eyes and looked about him. At one of the  
                chamber-windows of Governor Bellingham's mansion,  
                which stood at some distance, on the line of another  
                street, he beheld the appearance of the old magistrate  
                himself, with a lamp in his hand, a white night-cap on  
                his head, and a long white gown enveloping his figure.  
                He looked like a ghost, evoked unseasonably from the  
                grave. The cry had evidently startled him. At another  
                window of the same house, moreover, appeared old  
                Mistress Hibbins, the Governor's sister, also with a  
                lamp, which, even thus far off, revealed the expression  
                of her sour and discontented face. She thrust forth  
                <pb n="180"/>
                her head from the lattice, and looked anxiously upward.  
                Beyond the shadow of a doubt, this venerable witch-lady <!-- witch-lady -->

                Possibly, she went up among the clouds. The

                <p>The minister grew comparatively calm. His eyes,  
                however, were soon greeted by a little, glimmering light,  
                which, at first a long way off, was approaching up the  
                street. It threw a gleam of recognition on here a post,  
                and there a garden-fence, and here a latticed windowpane, <!-- window-pane -->
                and there a pump, with its full trough of water,  
                and here, again, an arched door of oak, with an iron  
                knocker, and a rough log for the door-step. The Reverend <!-- Rev-erend -->
                Mr. Dimmesdale noted all these minute particulars, <!-- particu-lars -->

                existence was stealing onward, in the footsteps which  
                he now heard; and that the gleam of the lantern would  
                fall upon him, in a few moments more, and reveal his  
                long-hidden secret. As the light drew nearer, he beheld, <!-- be-held -->

                had been praying at the bedside of some dying  
                man. And so he had. The good old minister came  
                freshly from the death-chamber of Governor Winthrop,  
                who had passed from earth to heaven within that very  
                hour. And now, surrounded, like the saint-like personages <!-- person-ages -->
                of olden times, with a radiant halo, that glorified  
                him amid this gloomy night of sin,—as if the departed  
                Governor had left him an inheritance of his glory, or  
                as if he had caught upon himself the distant shine of  
                the celestial city, while looking thitherward to see the  
                triumphant pilgrim pass within its gates,—now, in  
                short, good Father Wilson was moving homeward, aiding <!-- aid-ing -->
                his footsteps with a lighted lantern! The glimmer  
                of this luminary suggested the above <ref corresp="conceits" target="_conceits">conceits</ref>

                <p>“A good evening to you, venerable Father Wilson!  
                Come up hither, I pray you, and pass a pleasant hour

                <p>Good heavens! Had Mr. Dimmesdale actually  
                spoken? For one instant, he believed that these words  
                had passed his lips. But they were uttered only within  
                his imagination. The venerable Father Wilson continued <!-- con-tinued -->
                to step slowly onward, looking carefully at the  
                <pb n="182"/>
                muddy pathway before his feet, and never once turning  
                his head towards the guilty platform. When the light  
                of the glimmering lantern had faded quite away, the  
                minister discovered, by the faintness which came over  
                him, that the last few moments had been a crisis of terrible <!-- ter-rible -->
                anxiety; although his mind had made an involuntary <!-- invol-untary -->
                effort to relieve itself by a kind of lurid playfulness.</p> <!-- play-fulness -->

                again stole in among the solemn phantoms of  
                his thought. He felt his limbs growing stiff with the  
                unaccustomed chilliness of the night, and doubted  
                whether he should be able to descend the steps of the  
                scaffold. Morning would break, and find him there.  
                The neighbourhood would begin to rouse itself. The  
                earliest riser, coming forth in the dim twilight, would  
                perceive a vaguely defined figure aloft on the place of  
                shame; and, half crazed betwixt alarm and curiosity,  
                would go, knocking from door to door, summoning all  
                the people to behold the ghost—as he needs must

                Hibbins, with some twigs of the forest clinging to her

                death-bed, and liking ill to be disturbed, thus early,

                likewise, would come the elders and deacons of Mr.  
                Dimmesdale's church, and the young virgins who so

                responded to by a light, airy, childish laugh, in which,  
                with a thrill of the heart,—but he knew not whether

                <p>“Yes; it is Hester Prynne!” she replied, in a tone  
                of surprise; and the minister heard her footsteps approaching <!-- ap-proaching -->

                from the sidewalk, along which she had been  
                passing.—“It is I, and my little Pearl.”</p>
                
                <p>“Whence come you, Hester?” asked the minister.  
                “What sent you hither?”</p>
                
                <p>“I have been watching at a death-bed,” answered  
                Hester Prynne;—“at Governor Winthrop's death-bed,  
                and have taken his measure for a robe, and am now  
                going homeward to my dwelling.”</p>
                
                <p>“Come up hither, Hester, thou and little Pearl,”  
                said the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale. “Ye have both  
                been here before, but I was not with you. Come up  
                hither once again, and we will stand all three together!"</p> <!-- to-gether -->
                
                <p>She silently ascended the steps, and stood on the  
                platform, holding little Pearl by the hand. The minister <!-- minis-ter -->

                rush of new life, other life than his own,  
                pouring like a torrent into his heart, and hurrying

                <p>“Nay; not so, my little Pearl!” answered the minister; <!-- min-ister -->
                for, with the new energy of the moment, all the  
                dread of public exposure, that had so long been the  
                anguish of his life, had returned upon him; and he was  
                <pb n="185"/>
                already trembling at the conjunction in which—with  
                a strange joy, nevertheless—he now found himself.  
                “Not so, my child. I shall, indeed, stand with thy  
                mother and thee one other day, but not to-morrow!”</p>
                
                <p>Pearl laughed, and attempted to pull away her hand.  
                But the minister held it fast.</p>
                
                <p>“A moment longer, my child!” said he.</p>
                
                <p>“But wilt thou promise,” asked Pearl, “to take my  
                hand, and mother's hand, to-morrow noontide?”</p>
                
                <p>“Not then, Pearl,” said the minister, “but another  
                time!”</p>
                
                <p>“And what other time?” persisted the child.</p>
                
                <p>“At the great judgment day!” whispered the minister,-and, <!-- min-ister -->
                strangely enough, the sense that he was a  
                professional teacher of the truth impelled him to answer <!-- an-swer -->
                the child so. “Then, and there, before the  
                judgment-seat, thy mother, and thou, and I, must stand  
                together! But the daylight of this world shall not see  
                our meeting!”</p>
                
                <p>Pearl laughed again.</p>
                
                <p>But, before Mr. Dimmesdale had done speaking, a  
                light gleamed far and wide over all the muffled sky.  
                It was doubtless caused by one of those meteors, which  
                the night-watcher may so often observe burning out to  
                waste, in the vacant regions of the atmosphere. So  
                powerful was its radiance, that it thoroughly illuminated  
                the dense medium of cloud betwixt the sky and earth.  
                The great vault brightened, like the dome of an immense <!-- im-mense -->
                lamp. It showed the familiar scene of the  
                street, with the distinctness of mid-day, but also with  
                the awfulness that is always imparted to familiar objects  
                <pb n="186"/>
                by an unaccustomed light. The wooden houses, with  
                their jutting stories and quaint gable-peaks; the door-steps <!-- door-steps -->
                and thresholds, with the early grass springing up  
                about them; the garden-plots, black with freshly turned  
                earth; the wheel-track, little worn, and, even in the  
                market-place, margined with green on either side;—  
                all were visible, but with a singularity of aspect that  
                seemed to give another moral interpretation to the  
                things of this world than they had ever borne before.  
                And there stood the minister, with his hand over his  
                heart; and Hester Prynne, with the embroidered letter  
                glimmering on her bosom; and little Pearl, herself a  
                symbol, and the connecting link between those two.  
                They stood in the noon of that strange and solemn  
                splendor, as if it were the light that is to reveal all  
                secrets, and the daybreak that shall unite all who belong <!-- be-long -->
                to one another.</p>
                
                <p>There was witchcraft in little Pearl's eyes; and her  
                face, as she glanced upward at the minister, wore that  
                naughty smile which made its expression frequently so  
                elvish. She withdrew her hand from Mr. Dimmesdale's, <!-- Dimmes-dale's -->
                and pointed across the street. But he clasped  
                both his hands over his breast, and cast his eyes towards  
                the zenith.</p>
                
                <p>Nothing was more common, in those days, than to  
                interpret all meteoric appearances, and other natural  
                phenomena, that occurred with less regularity than the  
                rise and set of sun and moon, as so many revelations  
                from a supernatural source. Thus, a blazing spear, a  
                sword of flame, a bow, or a sheaf of arrows, seen in  
                the midnight sky, prefigured Indian warfare. Pestilence

                was known to have been foreboded by a shower of  
                crimson light. We doubt whether any marked event,  
                for good or evil, ever befell New England, from its settlement <!-- set-tlement -->
                down to Revolutionary times, of which the inhabitants <!-- in-habitants -->
                had not been previously warned by some  
                spectacle of this nature. Not seldom, it had been seen  
                by multitudes. Oftener, however, its credibility rested  
                on the faith of some lonely eyewitness, who beheld  
                the wonder through the colored, magnifying, and distorting <!-- dis-torting -->
                medium of his imagination, and shaped it more  
                distinctly in his after-thought. It was, indeed, a majestic  
                idea, that the destiny of nations should be revealed, in  
                these awful hieroglyphics, on the cope of heaven. A  
                scroll so wide might not be deemed too expansive for  
                Providence to write a people's doom upon. The belief

                addressed to himself alone, on the same vast  
                sheet of record! In such a case, it could only be the  
                symptom of a highly disordered mental state, when a

                intense, and secret pain, had extended his egotism over  
                the whole expanse of nature, until the firmament itself  
                should appear no more than a fitting page for his soul's  
                history and fate.</p>
                
                <p>We impute it, therefore, solely to the disease in his  
                own eye and heart, that the minister, looking upward  
                to the zenith, beheld there the appearance of an immense <!-- im-mense -->
                letter,—the letter A,—marked out in lines of  
                <pb n="188"/>
                dull red light. Not but the meteor may have shown  
                itself at that point, burning duskily through a veil of  
                cloud; but with no such shape as his guilty imagination  
                gave it; or, at least, with so little definiteness, that  
                another's guilt might have seen another symbol in it.</p>
                
                <p>There was a singular circumstance that characterized <!-- character-ized -->
                Mr. Dimmesdale's psychological state, at this  
                moment. All the time that he gazed upward to

                </note> he was, nevertheless, perfectly aware that  
                little Pearl was pointing her finger towards old Roger  
                Chillingworth, who stood at no great distance from the  
                scaffold. The minister appeared to see him, with the  
                same glance that discerned the miraculous letter. To  
                his features, as to all other objects, the meteoric light  
                imparted a new expression; or it might well be that  
                the physician was not careful then, as at all other  
                times, to hide the <ref corresp="malevolence" target="_malevolence">malevolence</ref>

                upon his victim. Certainly, if the meteor kindled up  
                the sky, and disclosed the earth, with an awfulness that  
                admonished Hester Prynne and the clergyman of the  
                day of judgment, then might Roger Chillingworth  
                have passed with them for the arch-fiend, standing  
                there, with a smile and scowl, to claim his own. So  
                vivid was the expression, or so intense the minister's  
                perception of it, that it seemed still to remain painted  
                on the darkness, after the meteor had vanished, with  
                an effect as if the street and all things else were at  
                once annihilated.</p>
                
                <p>“Who is that man, Hester?” gasped Mr. Dimmesdale, <!-- Dimmes-dale -->
                overcome with terror. “I shiver at him! Dost  
                thou know the man? I hate him, Hester!”</p>
                <pb n="189"/>
                <p>She remembered her oath, and was silent.</p>
                
                <p>“I tell thee, my soul shivers at him,” muttered the  
                minister again. “Who is he? Who is he? Canst  
                thou do nothing for me? I have a nameless horror of  
                the man.”</p>
                
                <p>“Minister,” said little Pearl, “I can tell thee who he  
                is!”</p>
                
                <p>“Quickly, then, child!” said the minister, bending  
                his ear close to her lips. “Quickly!—and as low as  
                thou canst whisper.”</p>
                
                <p>Pearl mumbled something into his ear, that sounded,  
                indeed, like human language, but was only such gibberish <!-- gibber-ish -->

                <p>“Dost thou mock me now?” said the minister.</p>
                
                <p>“Thou wast not bold!—thou wast not true!” answered <!-- an-swered -->

                <p>“Worthy Sir,” said the physician, who had now  
                advanced to the foot of the platform. “Pious Master  
                Dimmesdale! can this be you? Well, well, indeed!

                ANOTHER VIEW OF HESTER.</head>
                <p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> her late singular interview with Mr. Dimmesdale,  
                Hester Prynne was shocked at the condition to which  
                she found the clergyman reduced. His nerve seemed  
                absolutely destroyed. His moral force was abased into  
                more than childish weakness. It grovelled helpless on  
                the ground, even while his intellectual faculties retained <!-- re-tained -->
                their pristine strength, or had perhaps acquired  
                a morbid energy, which disease only could have given  
                them. With her knowledge of a train of circumstances <!-- circumstan-ces -->
                hidden from all others, she could readily infer,  
                that, besides the legitimate action of his own conscience, <!-- con-science -->
                a terrible machinery had been brought to bear,  
                and was still operating, on Mr. Dimmesdale's well-being  
                and repose. Knowing what this poor, fallen man had  
                once been, her whole soul was moved by the shuddering <!-- shudder-ing -->
                terror with which he had appealed to her,—the  
                outcast woman,—for support against his instinctively  
                discovered enemy. She decided, moreover, that he  
                had a right to her utmost aid. Little accustomed, in  
                her long seclusion from society, to measure her ideas  
                of right and wrong by any standard external to herself, <!-- her-self -->
                Hester saw—or seemed to see—that there lay  
                a responsibility upon her, in reference to the clergyman, <!-- clergy-man -->
                <pb n="193"/>
                which she owed to no other, nor to the whole  
                world besides. The links that united her to the rest of  
                human kind—links of flowers, or silk, or gold, or  
                whatever the material—had all been broken. Here  
                was the iron link of mutual crime, which neither he  
                nor she could break. Like all other ties, it brought  
                along with it its obligations.</p>
                
                <p>Hester Prynne did not now occupy precisely the  
                same position in which we beheld her during the earlier  
                periods of her ignominy. Years had come, and gone.  
                Pearl was now seven years old. Her mother, with the  
                scarlet letter on her breast, glittering in its fantastic  
                embroidery, had long been a familiar object to the  
                townspeople. As is <ref target="_apt" corresp="apt">apt</ref>

                </note> to be the case when a person  
                stands out in any prominence before the community,  
                and, at the same time, interferes neither with public nor  
                individual interests and convenience, a species of general <!-- gen-eral -->
                regard had ultimately grown up in reference to  
                Hester Prynne. It is to the credit of human nature,  
                that, except where its selfishness is brought into play,  
                it loves more readily than it hates. Hatred, by a gradual <!-- grad-ual -->
                and quiet process, will even be transformed to love,  
                unless the change be impeded by a continually new  
                irritation of the original feeling of hostility. In this  
                matter of Hester Prynne, there was neither irritation  
                nor irksomeness. She never battled with the public,  
                but submitted uncomplainingly to its worst usage; she  
                made no claim upon it, in requital for what she suffered; <!-- suf-fered -->
                she did not weigh upon its sympathies. Then,  
                also, the blameless purity of her life, during all these  
                years in which she had been set apart to infamy, was  
                <pb n="194"/>
                reckoned largely in her favor. With nothing now to  
                lose, in the sight of mankind, and with no hope, and  
                seemingly no wish, of gaining any thing, it could only  
                be a genuine regard for virtue that had brought back  
                the poor wanderer to its paths.</p>
                
                <p>It was perceived, too, that, while Hester never put  
                forward even the humblest title to share in the world's  
                privileges,—farther than to breathe the common air,  
                and earn daily bread for little Pearl and herself by the  
                faithful labor of her hands,—she was quick to acknowledge <!-- acknowl-edge -->
                her sisterhood with the race of man, whenever  
                benefits were to be conferred. None so ready as she  
                to give of her little substance to every demand of  
                poverty; even though the bitter-hearted pauper threw  
                back a gibe in requital of the food brought regularly  
                to his door, or the garments wrought for him by the  
                fingers that could have embroidered a monarch's robe.  
                None so self-devoted as Hester, when pestilence stalked  
                through the town. In all seasons of calamity, indeed,  
                whether general or of individuals, the outcast of society <!-- so-ciety -->
                at once found her place. She came, not as a  
                guest, but as a rightful inmate, into the household that  
                was darkened by trouble; as if its gloomy twilight  
                were a medium in which she was entitled to hold intercourse <!-- in-tercourse -->
                with her fellow-creatures. There glimmered  
                the embroidered letter, with comfort in its unearthly  
                ray. Elsewhere the token of sin, it was the taper of  
                the sick-chamber. It had even thrown its gleam, in  
                the sufferer's hard extremity, across the verge of time.  
                It had shown him where to set his foot, while the light  
                of earth was fast becoming dim, and ere the light of  
                <pb n="195"/>
                futurity could reach him. In such emergencies, Hester's <!-- Hes-ter's -->
                nature showed itself warm and rich; a well-spring  
                of human tenderness, unfailing to every real demand,  
                and inexhaustible by the largest. Her breast, with its  
                badge of shame, was but the softer pillow for the head  
                that needed one. She was self-ordained a Sister of  
                Mercy; or, we may rather say, the world's heavy  
                hand had so ordained her, when neither the world nor  
                she looked forward to this result. The letter was the  
                symbol of her calling. Such helpfulness was found in  
                her,—so much power to do, and power to sympathize,  
                —that many people refused to interpret the scarlet A  
                by its original signification. They said that it meant  
                Able; so strong was Hester Prynne, with a woman's  
                strength.</p>
                
                <p>It was only the darkened house that could contain  
                her. When sunshine came again, she was not there.  
                Her shadow had faded across the threshold. The helpful <!-- help-ful -->
                inmate had departed, without one backward glance  
                to gather up the meed of gratitude, if any were in the  
                hearts of those whom she had served so zealously.  
                Meeting them in the street, she never raised her head to  
                receive their greeting. If they were resolute to <ref corresp="accost" target="_accost">accost</ref>

                her, she laid her finger on the scarlet letter, and  
                passed on. This might be pride, but was so like humility, <!-- hu-mility -->
                that it produced all the softening influence of  
                the latter quality on the public mind. The public is

                Hester Prynne's deportment as an appeal of this nature, <!-- na-ture -->
                society was inclined to show its former victim a  
                more benign countenance than she cared to be favored  
                with, or, perchance, than she deserved.</p>
                
                <p>The rulers, and the wise and learned men of the  
                community, were longer in acknowledging the influence <!-- influ-ence -->
                of Hester's good qualities than the people. The  
                prejudices which they shared in common with the latter <!-- lat-ter -->
                were fortified in themselves by an iron framework <!-- frame-work -->
                of reasoning, that made it a far tougher labor to  
                expel them. Day by day, nevertheless, their sour and  
                rigid wrinkles were relaxing into something which, in  
                the due course of years, might grow to be an expression  
                of almost benevolence. Thus it was with the men of  
                rank, on whom their eminent position imposed the  
                guardianship of the public morals. Individuals in private <!-- pri-vate -->
                life, meanwhile, had quite forgiven Hester Prynne  
                for her frailty; nay, more, they had begun to look upon  
                the scarlet letter as the token, not of that one sin, for  
                which she had borne so long and dreary a penance,  
                but of her many good deeds since. “Do you see that  
                woman with the embroidered badge?” they would say  
                to strangers. “It is our Hester,—the town's own  
                Hester,—who is so kind to the poor, so helpful to the  
                sick, so comfortable to the afflicted!” Then, it is true,

                bygone years. It was none the less a fact, however,

                scarlet letter had the effect of the cross on a nun's  
                bosom. It imparted to the wearer a kind of sacredness, <!-- sacred-ness -->
                which enabled her to walk securely amid all  
                peril. Had she fallen among thieves, it would have  
                kept her safe. It was reported, and believed by many,  
                that an Indian had drawn his arrow against the badge,  
                and that the missile struck it, but fell harmless to the

                <p>The effect of the symbol—or rather, of the position  
                in respect to society that was indicated by it—on the  
                mind of Hester Prynne herself, was powerful and peculiar. <!-- pe-cular -->
                All the light and graceful foliage of her character <!-- char-acter -->
                had been withered up by this red-hot brand, and  
                had long ago fallen away, leaving a bare and harsh outline, <!-- out-line -->

                of demonstration in her manners. It was a sad transformation, <!-- trans-formation -->
                too, that her rich and luxuriant hair had  
                either been cut off, or was so completely hidden by a  
                cap, that not a shining lock of it ever once gushed into  
                the sunshine. It was due in part to all these causes,  
                but still more to something else, that there seemed to  
                be no longer any thing in Hester's face for Love to  
                dwell upon; nothing in Hester's form, though majestic  
                and statue-like, that Passion would ever dream of clasping <!-- clasp-ing -->
                in its embrace; nothing in Hester's bosom, to make  
                it ever again the pillow of Affection. Some attribute  
                had departed from her, the permanence of which had  
                <pb n="198"/>
                been essential to keep her a woman. Such is frequently  
                the fate, and such the stern development, of the feminine <!-- femi-nine -->
                character and person, when the woman has encountered, <!-- en-countered -->
                and lived through, an experience of peculiar  
                severity. If she be all tenderness, she will die. If  
                she survive, the tenderness will either be crushed out  
                of her, or—and the outward semblance is the same  
                —crushed so deeply into her heart that it can never  
                show itself more. The latter is perhaps the truest theory. <!-- the-ory -->
                She who has once been woman, and ceased to  
                be so, might at any moment become a woman again,  
                if there were only the magic touch to effect the transfiguration. <!-- trans-figuration -->
                We shall see whether Hester Prynne were  
                ever afterwards so touched, and so transfigured.</p>
                
                <p>Much of the marble coldness of Hester's impression  
                was to be attributed to the circumstance that her life  
                had turned, in a great measure, from passion and feeling, <!-- feel-ing -->
                to thought. Standing alone in the world,—alone,  
                as to any dependence on society, and with little Pearl  
                to be guided and protected,—alone, and hopeless of  
                retrieving her position, even had she not scorned to  
                consider it desirable,—she cast away the fragments  
                of a broken chain. The world's law was no law for  
                her mind. It was an age in which the human intellect,

                </note> had taken a more active and a  
                wider range than for many centuries before. Men of  
                the sword had overthrown nobles and kings. Men  
                bolder than these had overthrown and rearranged—  
                not actually, but within the sphere of theory, which  
                was their most real abode—the whole system of ancient <!-- an-cient -->

                <pb n="199"/>
                principle. Hester Prynne imbibed this spirit. She  
                assumed a freedom of speculation, then common  
                enough on the other side of the Atlantic, but which  
                our forefathers, had they known of it, would have held  
                to be a deadlier crime than that stigmatized by the  
                scarlet letter. In her lonesome cottage, by the sea-shore, <!-- sea-shore -->
                thoughts visited her, such as dared to enter no  
                other dwelling in New England; shadowy guests, that  
                would have been as perilous as demons to their entertainer, <!-- enter-tainer -->
                could they have been seen so much as knocking  
                at her door.</p>
                
                <p>It is remarkable, that persons who speculate the  
                most boldly often conform with the most perfect quietude <!-- qui-etude -->
                to the external regulations of society. The  
                thought suffices them, without investing itself in the  
                flesh and blood of action. So it seemed to be with  
                Hester. Yet, had little Pearl never come to her from  
                the spiritual world, it might have been far otherwise.  
                Then, she might have come down to us in history, hand

                developed amid a host of difficulties. Every thing

                mind, with reference to the whole race of womanhood.  
                Was existence worth accepting, even to the happiest  
                among them? As concerned her own individual existence, <!-- ex-istence -->

                dismissed the point as settled. A tendency to speculation, <!-- specula-tion -->
                though it may keep woman quiet, as it does man,  
                yet makes her sad. She discerns, it may be, such a  
                hopeless task before her. As a first step, the whole  
                system of society is to be torn down, and built up anew.  
                Then, the very nature of the opposite sex, or its long  
                hereditary habit, which has become like nature, is to be  
                essentially modified, before woman can be allowed to  
                assume what seems a fair and suitable position. Finally, <!-- Final-ly -->

                might yet be possible. Strengthened by years of hard  
                and solemn trial, she felt herself no longer so inadequate <!-- inade-quate -->
                to cope with Roger Chillingworth as on that  
                night, abased by sin, and half maddened by the <ref target="_ignominy" corresp="ignominy">ignominy</ref> <!-- igno-miny -->
                that was still new, when they had talked together  
                in the prison-chamber. She had climbed her way,  
                since then, to a higher point. The old man, on the  
                other hand, had brought himself nearer to her level, or  
                perhaps below it, by the revenge which he had stooped  
                for.</p>
                
                <p>In fine, Hester Prynne resolved to meet her former  
                husband, and do what might be in her power for the  
                rescue of the victim on whom he had so evidently set  
                his gripe. The occasion was not long to seek. One  
                afternoon, walking with Pearl in a retired part of the  
                peninsula, she beheld the old physician, with a basket  
                on one arm, and a staff in the other hand, stooping  
                along the ground, in quest of roots and herbs to <ref corresp="concoct" target="_concoct">concoct</ref>

                HESTER AND THE PHYSICIAN.</head>
                <p><hi rend="small-caps">Hester</hi> bade little Pearl run down to the margin of  
                the water, and play with the shells and tangled sea-weed, <!-- sea-weed -->
                until she should have talked awhile with yonder  
                gatherer of herbs. So the child flew away like a bird,  
                and, making bare her small white feet, went pattering  
                along the moist margin of the sea. Here and there,  
                she came to a full stop, and peeped curiously into a  
                pool, left by the retiring tide as a mirror for Pearl to  
                see her face in. Forth peeped at her, out of the pool,  
                with dark, glistening curls around her head, and an elf-smile <!-- elf-smile -->
                in her eyes, the image of a little maid, whom  
                Pearl, having no other playmate, invited to take her  
                hand and run a race with her. But the visionary little  
                maid, on her part, beckoned likewise, as if to say,—  
                “This is a better place! Come thou into the pool!”  
                And Pearl, stepping in, mid-leg deep, beheld her own  
                white feet at the bottom; while, out of a still lower  
                depth, came the gleam of a kind of fragmentary smile,  
                floating to and fro in the agitated water.</p>
                
                <p>Meanwhile, her mother had accosted the physician.</p>
                
                <p>“I would speak a word with you,” said she,—“a  
                word that concerns us much.”</p>
                
                <p>“Aha! And is it Mistress Hester that has a word  
                <pb n="204"/>
                for old Roger Chillingworth?” answered he, raising  
                himself from his stooping posture. “With all my  
                heart! Why, Mistress, I hear good tidings of you on  
                all hands! No longer ago than yester-eve, a magistrate, <!-- magis-trate -->
                a wise and godly man, was discoursing of your  
                affairs, Mistress Hester, and whispered me that there  
                had been question concerning you in the council. It  
                was debated whether or no, with safety to the common  
                weal, yonder scarlet letter might be taken off your  
                bosom. On my life, Hester, I made my entreaty to the  
                worshipful magistrate that it might be done forthwith!"</p> <!-- forth-with -->
                
                <p>“It lies not in the pleasure of the magistrates to take  
                off this badge,” calmly replied Hester. “Were I  
                worthy to be quit of it, it would fall away of its own  
                nature, or be transformed into something that should  
                speak a different purport.”</p>
                
                <p>“Nay, then, wear it, if it suit you better,” rejoined  
                he. “A woman must needs follow her own fancy,  
                touching the adornment of her person. The letter is  
                gayly embroidered, and shows right bravely on your  
                bosom!”</p>
                
                <p>All this while, Hester had been looking steadily at  
                the old man, and was shocked, as well as wonder-smitten, <!-- wonder-smit-ten -->
                to discern what a change had been wrought upon  
                him within the past seven years. It was not so much  
                that he had grown older; for though the traces of advancing <!-- ad-vancing -->
                life were visible, he bore his age well, and  
                seemed to retain a wiry vigor and alertness. But the  
                former aspect of an intellectual and studious man, calm  
                and quiet, which was what she best remembered in him,  
                <pb n="205"/>
                had altogether vanished, and been succeeded by an  
                eager, searching, almost fierce, yet carefully guarded  
                look. It seemed to be his wish and purpose to mask  
                this expression with a smile; but the latter played him  
                false, and flickered over his visage so derisively, that  
                the spectator could see his blackness all the better for  
                it. Ever and <ref corresp="anon" target="_anon">anon,</ref>
                too, there came a glare of red light  
                out of his eyes; as if the old man's soul were on fire,  
                and kept on smouldering duskily within his breast, until, <!-- un-til -->
                by some casual puff of passion, it was blown into  
                a momentary flame. This he repressed as speedily as  
                possible, and strove to look as if nothing of the kind  
                had happened.</p>
                
                <p>In a word, old Roger Chillingworth was a striking  
                evidence of man's faculty of transforming himself into  
                a devil, if he will only, for a reasonable space of time,  
                undertake a devil's office. This unhappy person had  
                effected such a transformation by devoting himself, for  
                seven years, to the constant analysis of a heart full of  
                torture, and deriving his enjoyment thence, and adding  
                fuel to those fiery tortures which he analyzed and gloated <!-- gloat-ed -->
                over.</p>
                
                <p>The scarlet letter burned on Hester Prynne's bosom.  
                Here was another ruin, the responsibility of which  
                came partly home to her.</p>
                
                <p>“What see you in my face,” asked the physician,  
                “that you look at it so earnestly?”</p>
                
                <p>“Something that would make me weep, if there were  
                any tears bitter enough for it,” answered she. “But  
                let it pass! It is of yonder miserable man that I would  
                speak.”</p>
                <pb n="206"/>
                <p>“And what of him?” cried Roger Chillingworth  
                eagerly, as if he loved the topic, and were glad of an  
                opportunity to discuss it with the only person of whom  
                he could make a confidant. “Not to hide the truth,  
                Mistress Hester, my thoughts happen just now to be  
                busy with the gentleman. So speak freely; and I will  
                make answer.”</p>
                
                <p>“When we last <ref target="_spake" corresp="spake">spake</ref>

                seven years ago, it was your pleasure to extort a promise <!-- prom-ise -->
                of secrecy, as touching the former relation betwixt <!-- be-twixt -->
                yourself and me. As the life and good fame of  
                yonder man were in your hands, there seemed no  
                choice to me, save to be silent, in accordance with  
                your behest. Yet it was not without heavy misgivings  
                that I thus bound myself; for, having cast off all duty  
                towards other human beings, there remained a duty  
                towards him; and something whispered me that I was  
                betraying it, in pledging myself to keep your counsel.  
                Since that day, no man is so near to him as you. You  
                tread behind his every footstep. You are beside him,  
                sleeping and waking. You search his thoughts. You

                <p>“What choice had you?” asked Roger Chillingworth. <!-- Chilling-worth -->
                “My finger, pointed at this man, would have

                For, Hester, his spirit lacked the strength that could

                <p>“Better he had died at once!” said Hester Prynne.</p>
                
                <p>“Yea, woman, thou sayest truly!” cried old Roger  
                Chillingworth, letting the lurid fire of his heart blaze  
                out before her eyes. “Better had he died at once!  
                Never did mortal suffer what this man has suffered.  
                And all, all, in the sight of his worst enemy! He has  
                been conscious of me. He has felt an influence dwelling <!-- dwell-ing -->

                aspect is faithfully revealed to his mind's eye. Not

                <p>“Hast thou not tortured him enough?” said Hester,  
                noticing the old man's look. “Has he not paid thee

                <p>“No!—no!—He has but increased the debt!”  
                answered the physician; and, as he proceeded, his  
                manner lost its fiercer characteristics, and subsided  
                into gloom. “Dost thou remember me, Hester, as I

                <p>“It has avenged thee!” answered Hester Prynne.</p>
                
                <p>“I judged no less,” said the physician. “And now,  
                what wouldst thou with me touching this man?”</p>
                
                <p>“I must reveal the secret,” answered Hester, firmly. <!-- firm-ly -->
                “He must discern thee in thy true character.  
                What may be the result, I know not. But this long  
                debt of confidence, due from me to him, whose bane  
                and ruin I have been, shall at length be paid. So far  
                as concerns the overthrow or preservation of his fair  
                fame and his earthly state, and perchance his life, he  
                is in thy hands. Nor do I,—whom the scarlet letter  
                has disciplined to truth, though it be the truth of red-hot <!-- red-hot -->
                iron, entering into the soul,—nor do I perceive  
                such advantage in his living any longer a life of ghastly  
                <pb n="210"/>
                emptiness, that I shall stoop to implore thy mercy.  
                Do with him as thou wilt! There is no good for him,  
                —no good for me,—no good for thee! There is no  
                good for little Pearl! There is no path to guide us  
                out of this dismal maze!”</p>
                
               <p>“Woman, I could <ref target="_wellnigh" corresp="wellnigh">wellnigh</ref> pity thee!” said Roger  
                Chillingworth, unable to restrain a thrill of admiration  
                too; for there was a quality almost majestic in the despair <!-- de-spair -->
                which she expressed. “Thou hadst great elements. <!-- ele-ments -->
                Peradventure, hadst thou met earlier with a  
                better love than mine, this evil had not been. I pity  
                thee, for the good that has been wasted in thy nature!”</p>
                
                <p>“And I thee,” answered Hester Prynne, “for the  
                hatred that has transformed a wise and just man to a  
                fiend! Wilt thou yet purge it out of thee, and be once  
                more human? If not for his sake, then doubly for  
                thine own! Forgive, and leave his further retribution  
                to the Power that claims it! I said, but now, that  
                there could be no good event for him, or thee, or me,  
                who are here wandering together in this gloomy maze  
                of evil, and stumbling, at every step, over the guilt  
                wherewith we have strewn our path. It is not so!  
                There might be good for thee, and thee alone, since  
                thou hast been deeply wronged, and hast it at thy will  
                to pardon. Wilt thou give up that only privilege?  
                Wilt thou reject that priceless benefit?”</p>
                
                <p>“Peace, Hester, peace!” replied the old man, with  
                gloomy sternness. “It is not granted me to pardon.  
                I have no such power as thou tellest me of. My old  
                faith, long forgotten, comes back to me, and explains  
                all that we do, and all we suffer. By thy first step  
                <pb n="211"/>
                <ref corresp="awry" target="_awry">awry,</ref> thou didst plant the germ of evil; but, since that  
                moment, it has all been a dark necessity. Ye that  
                have wronged me are not sinful, save in a kind of  
                typical illusion; neither am I fiend-like, who have  
                snatched a fiend's office from his hands. It is our  
                fate. Let the black flower blossom as it may! Now  
                go thy ways, and deal as thou wilt with yonder man.”</p>
                
                <p>He waved his hand, and betook himself again to  
                his employment of gathering herbs.</p>

                HESTER AND PEARL.</head>
                <p>So Roger Chillingworth—a deformed old figure,  
                with a face that haunted men's memories longer than  
                they liked—took leave of Hester Prynne, and went  
                stooping away along the earth. He gathered here and  
                there an herb, or grubbed up a root, and put it into the  
                basket on his arm. His gray beard almost touched the  
                ground, as he crept onward. Hester gazed after him  
                a little while, looking with a half-fantastic curiosity to  
                see whether the tender grass of early spring would not  
                be blighted beneath him, and show the wavering track  
                of his footsteps, sere and brown, across its cheerful  
                verdure. She wondered what sort of herbs they were,  
                which the old man was so sedulous to gather. Would  
                not the earth, quickened to an evil purpose by the sympathy <!-- sym-pathy -->
                of his eye, greet him with poisonous shrubs, of  
                species hitherto unknown, that would start up under his  
                fingers? Or might it suffice him, that every wholesome

                himself in that smile, he said, in order that the chill of  
                so many lonely hours among his books might be taken  
                off the scholar's heart. Such scenes had once appeared  
                not otherwise than happy, but now, as viewed through  
                the dismal medium of her subsequent life, they classed  
                themselves among her ugliest remembrances. She  
                marvelled how such scenes could have been! She  
                marvelled how she could ever have been wrought upon
                to marry him! She deemed it her crime most to be  
                repented of, that she had ever endured, and reciprocated, <!-- recipro-cated -->
                the lukewarm grasp of his hand, and had suffered <!-- suf-fered -->
                the smile of her lips and eyes to mingle and  
                melt into his own. And it seemed a fouler offence  
                committed by Roger Chillingworth, than any which  
                had since been done him, that, in the time when her  
                <pb n="214"/>
                heart knew no better, he had persuaded her to fancy  
                herself happy by his side.</p>
                
                <p>“Yes, I hate him!” repeated Hester, more bitterly  
                than before. “He betrayed me! He has done me  
                worse wrong than I did him!”</p>

                they win along with it the utmost passion of her heart!  
                Else it may be their miserable fortune, as it was Roger  
                Chillingworth's, when some mightier touch than their  
                own may have awakened all her sensibilities, to be reproached <!-- re-proached -->

                of happiness, which they will have imposed upon her  
                as the warm reality. But Hester ought long ago to  
                have done with this injustice. What did it betoken?  
                Had seven long years, under the torture of the scarlet  
                letter, inflicted so much of misery, and wrought out no  
                repentance?</p>
                
                <p>The emotions of that brief space, while she stood  
                gazing after the crooked figure of old Roger Chillingworth, <!-- Chilling-worth -->
                threw a dark light on Hester's state of mind,  
                revealing much that she might not otherwise have  
                acknowledged to herself.</p>
                
                <p>He being gone, she summoned back her child.</p>
                
                <p>“Pearl! Little Pearl! Where are you?”</p>
                
                <p>Pearl, whose activity of spirit never flagged, had  
                been at no loss for amusement while her mother talked  
                with the old gatherer of herbs. At first, as already  
                told, she had flirted fancifully with her own image in  
                a pool of water, beckoning the phantom forth, and—  
                as it declined to venture—seeking a passage for herself <!-- her-self -->
                into its sphere of <ref corresp="impalpable" target="_impalpable">impalpable</ref> earth and unattainable <!-- unattain-able -->
                <pb n="215"/>
                sky. Soon finding, however, that either she or  
                the image was unreal, she turned elsewhere for better  
                pastime. She made little boats out of birch-bark, and  
                freighted them with snail-shells, and sent out more  
                ventures on the mighty deep than any merchant in  
                New England; but the larger part of them foundered <!-- foun-dered -->
                near the shore. She seized a live horseshoe by  
                the tail, and made prize of several five-fingers, and laid  
                out a jelly-fish to melt in the warm sun. Then she  
                took up the white foam, that streaked the line of the  
                advancing tide, and threw it upon the breeze, scampering <!-- scamper-ing -->
                after it with winged footsteps, to catch the great  
                snow-flakes ere they fell. Perceiving a flock of beach-birds, <!-- beach-birds -->
                that fed and fluttered along the shore, the naughty  
                child picked up her apron full of pebbles, and, creeping <!-- creep-ing -->
                from rock to rock after these small sea-fowl, displayed <!-- dis-played -->
                remarkable dexterity in pelting them. One little <!-- lit-tle -->
                gray bird, with a white breast, Pearl was almost  
                sure, had been hit by a pebble, and fluttered away with  
                a broken wing. But then the elf-child sighed, and gave  
                up her sport; because it grieved her to have done  
                harm to a little being that was as wild as the sea-breeze, <!-- sea-breeze -->
                or as wild as Pearl herself.</p>
                
                <p>Her final employment was to gather sea-weed, of  
                various kinds, and make herself a scarf, or mantle, and  
                a head-dress, and thus assume the aspect of a little  
                mermaid. She inherited her mother's gift for devising  
                drapery and costume. As the last touch to her mermaid's <!-- mer-maid's -->

                scarlet! The child bent her chin upon her breast, and  
                contemplated this device with strange interest; even as  
                if the one only thing for which she had been sent into  
                the world was to make out its hidden import.</p>
                
                <p>“I wonder if mother will ask me what it means!”  
                thought Pearl.</p>
                
                <p>Just then, she heard her mother's voice, and, flitting  
                along as lightly as one of the little sea-birds, appeared  
                before Hester Prynne, dancing, laughing, and pointing  
                her finger to the ornament upon her bosom.</p>
                
                <p>“My little Pearl,” said Hester, after a moment's silence, <!-- si-lence -->

                though there was that singular expression which she

                satisfy herself whether Pearl really attached any meaning <!-- mean-ing -->
                to the symbol. She felt a morbid desire to ascertain <!-- ascer-tain -->
                the point.</p>

                <p>“Truly do I!” answered Pearl, looking brightly into  
                her mother's face. “It is for the same reason that the  
                minister keeps his hand over his heart!”</p>
                
                <p>“And what reason is that?” asked Hester, half

                but, on second thoughts, turning pale. “What  
                has the letter to do with any heart, save mine?”</p>
                
                <p>“Nay, mother, I have told all I know,” said Pearl,  
                more seriously than she was wont to speak. “Ask  
                yonder old man whom thou hast been talking with! It  
                may be he can tell. But in good earnest now, mother

                and doing what she could, and as intelligently as she

                the child. In the little chaos of Pearl's character, there  
                might be seen emerging—and could have been, from  
                the very first—the stedfast principles of an unflinching  
                courage,—an uncontrollable will,—a sturdy pride,  
                which might be disciplined into self-respect,—and a  
                bitter scorn of many things, which, when examined,  
                might be found to have the taint of falsehood in them.  
                She possessed affections, too, though hitherto acrid and  
                disagreeable, as are the richest flavors of unripe fruit.  
                With all these sterling attributes, thought Hester, the evil  
                which she inherited from her mother must be great indeed, <!-- in-deed -->

                <p>Pearl's inevitable tendency to hover about the enigma <!-- enig-ma -->
                of the scarlet letter seemed an innate quality of  
                her being. From the earliest epoch of her conscious

                Hester had often fancied that Providence had a

                if they had actually been whispered into her ear. And  
                there was little Pearl, all this while, holding her mother's <!-- moth-er's -->
                hand in both her own, and turning her face upward, <!-- up-ward -->
                while she put these searching questions, once,  
                and again, and still a third time.</p>

                dost thou wear it?—and why does the minister keep

                <p>“What shall I say?” thought Hester to herself.—  
                “No! If this be the price of the child's sympathy, I  
                cannot pay it!”</p>

                There are many things in this world that a child must  
                not ask about. What know I of the minister's heart?

                as recognizing that, in spite of his strict watch over her  
                heart, some new evil had crept into it, or some old one  
                had never been expelled. As for little Pearl, the earnestness <!-- ear-nestness -->
                soon passed out of her face.</p>
                <pb n="220"/>
                <p>But the child did not see fit to let the matter drop.  
                Two or three times, as her mother and she went homeward, <!-- home-ward -->
                and as often at supper-time, and while Hester  
                was putting her to bed, and once after she seemed to  
                be fairly asleep, Pearl looked up, with mischief gleaming <!-- gleam-ing -->

                <p>And the next morning, the first indication the child  
                gave of being awake was by popping up her head  
                from the pillow, and making that other inquiry, which

                need the whole wide world to breathe in, while they  
                talked together,—for all these reasons, Hester never

                the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale had been summoned to

                before, to visit the Apostle Eliot, among his Indian  
                converts. He would probably return, by a certain  
                hour, in the afternoon of the morrow. Betimes, therefore, <!-- there-fore -->
                the next day, Hester took little Pearl,—who was  
                necessarily the companion of all her mother's expeditions, <!-- expe-ditions -->
                however inconvenient her presence,—and set  
                forth.</p>
                
                <p>The road, after the two wayfarers had crossed from  
                the peninsula to the mainland, was no other than a  
                footpath. It straggled onward into the mystery of the  
                primeval forest. This hemmed it in so narrowly, and  
                stood so black and dense on either side, and disclosed  
                such imperfect glimpses of the sky above, that, to Hester's <!-- Hes-ter's -->
                mind, it imaged not amiss the moral wilderness in  
                which she had so long been wandering. The day was  
                chill and sombre. Overhead was a gray expanse of  
                cloud, slightly stirred, however, by a breeze; so that a

                <p>“See!” answered Hester, smiling. “Now I can  
                stretch out my hand, and grasp some of it.”</p>
                
                <p>As she attempted to do so, the sunshine vanished;  
                or, to judge from the bright expression that was dancing <!-- dan-cing -->

                that the child had absorbed it into herself, and would  
                give it forth again, with a gleam about her path, as  
                they should plunge into some gloomier shade. There

                <p>“O, a story about the Black Man!” answered Pearl,  
                taking hold of her mother's gown, and looking up, half  
                earnestly, half mischievously, into her face. “How he  
                haunts this forest, and carries a book with him,—a big,  
                heavy book, with iron clasps; and how this ugly Black  
                Man offers his book and an iron pen to every body that  
                meets him here among the trees; and they are to write  
                their names with their own blood. And then he sets  
                his mark on their bosoms! Didst thou ever meet the

                <p>“And who told you this story, Pearl?” asked her  
                mother, recognizing a common superstition of the  
                period.</p>
                
                <p>“It was the old dame in the chimney-corner, at the

                “But she fancied me asleep while she was talking of  
                it. She said that a thousand and a thousand people had  
                met him here, and had written in his book, and have  
                his mark on them. And that ugly-tempered lady, old  
                Mistress Hibbins, was one. And, mother, the old dame  
                said that this scarlet letter was the Black Man's mark  
                on thee, and that it glows like a red flame when thou  
                meetest him at midnight, here in the dark wood. Is  
                it true, mother? And dost thou go to meet him in the  
                night-time?”</p>
                
                <p>“Didst thou ever awake, and find thy mother  
                gone?” asked Hester.</p>
                
                <p>“Not that I remember,” said the child. “If thou  
                fearest to leave me in our cottage, thou mightest take  
                me along with thee. I would very gladly go! But,  
                mother, tell me now! Is there such a Black Man?  
                And didst thou ever meet him? And is this his  
                mark?”</p>

                asked her mother.</p>

                Continually, indeed, as it stole onward, the streamlet  
                kept up a babble, kind, quiet, soothing, but melancholy,  
                like the voice of a young child that was spending its  
                infancy without playfulness, and knew not how to be  
                merry among sad acquaintance and events of sombre  
                hue.</p>
                
                <p>“O brook! O foolish and tiresome little brook!”  
                cried Pearl, after listening awhile to its talk. “Why  
                art thou so sad? Pluck up a spirit, and do not be all

                experience that it could not help talking about it, and  
                seemed to have nothing else to say. Pearl resembled  
                the brook, inasmuch as the current of her life gushed  
                from a well-spring as mysterious, and had flowed  
                through scenes shadowed as heavily with gloom. But,

                “It is no Black Man! Thou canst see him now  
                through the trees. It is the minister!”</p>
                
                <p>“And so it is!” said the child. “And, mother, he  
                has his hand over his heart! Is it because, when the  
                minister wrote his name in the book, the Black Man  
                set his mark in that place? But why does he not

                <p>Gathering himself quickly up, he stood more erect,  
                like a man taken by surprise in a mood to which he  
                was reluctant to have witnesses. Throwing his eyes  
                anxiously in the direction of the voice, he indistinctly  
                beheld a form under the trees, clad in garments so  
                sombre, and so little relieved from the gray twilight  
                into which the clouded sky and the heavy foliage had  
                darkened the noontide, that he knew not whether it  
                were a woman or a shadow. It may be, that his pathway <!-- path-way -->
                through life was haunted thus, by a spectre that  
                had stolen out from among his thoughts.</p>
                
                <p>He made a step nigher, and discovered the scarlet  
                letter.</p>
                
                <p>“Hester! Hester Prynne!” said he. “Is it thou?  
                Art thou in life?”</p>
                
                <p>“Even so!” she answered. “In such life as has  
                been mine these seven years past! And thou, Arthur  
                Dimmesdale, dost thou yet live?”</p>
                <pb n="231"/>
                <p>It was no wonder that they thus questioned one  
                another's actual and bodily existence, and even doubted  
                of their own. So strangely did they meet, in the dim  
                wood, that it was like the first encounter, in the world  
                beyond the grave, of two spirits who had been intimately <!-- inti-mately -->
                connected in their former life, but now stood  
                coldly shuddering, in mutual dread; as not yet familiar  
                with their state, nor wonted to the companionship of  
                disembodied beings. Each a ghost, and awe-stricken  
                at the other ghost! They were awe-stricken likewise  
                at themselves; because the crisis flung back to them  
                their consciousness, and revealed to each heart its history <!-- his-tory -->
                and experience, as life never does, except at such  
                breathless epochs. The soul beheld its features in the

                chill as death, and touched the chill hand of Hester  
                Prynne. The grasp, cold as it was, took away what  
                was dreariest in the interview. They now felt themselves, <!-- them-selves -->
                at least, inhabitants of the same sphere.</p>
                
                <p>Without a word more spoken,—neither he nor she

                into the themes that were brooding deepest in their

                they needed something slight and casual to run before,

                <p>After a while, the minister fixed his eyes on Hester  
                Prynne's.</p>
                
                <p>“Hester,” said he, “hast thou found peace?”</p>
                
                <p>She smiled drearily, looking down upon her bosom.</p>
                
                <p>“Hast thou?” she asked.</p>
                
                <p>“None!—nothing but despair!” he answered.  
                “What else could I look for, being what I am, and  
                leading such a life as mine? Were I an atheist,—a  
                man devoid of conscience,—a wretch with coarse and  
                brutal instincts,—I might have found peace, long ere  
                now. Nay, I never should have lost it! But, as matters <!-- mat-ters -->
                stand with my soul, whatever of good capacity  
                there originally was in me, all of God's gifts that were  
                the choicest have become the ministers of spiritual  
                torment. Hester, I am most miserable!”</p>
                
                <p>“The people reverence thee,” said Hester. “And  
                surely thou workest good among them! Doth this  
                bring thee no comfort?”</p>
                
                <p>“More misery, Hester!—only the more misery!”  
                answered the clergyman, with a bitter smile. “As  
                concerns the good which I may appear to do, I have  
                no faith in it. It must needs be a delusion. What can  
                a ruined soul, like mine, effect towards the redemption  
                of other souls?—or a polluted soul, towards their purification? <!-- pu-rification -->
                And as for the people's reverence, would  
                that it were turned to scorn and hatred! Canst thou  
                <pb n="233"/>
                deem it, Hester, a consolation, that I must stand up in  
                my pulpit, and meet so many eyes turned upward to my  
                face, as if the light of heaven were beaming from it!  
                —must see my flock hungry for the truth, and listening <!-- listen-ing -->
                to my words as if a tongue of Pentecost were  
                speaking!—and then look inward, and discern the  
                black reality of what they idolize? I have laughed, in  
                bitterness and agony of heart, at the contrast between  
                what I seem and what I am! And Satan laughs at  
                it!”</p>
                
                <p>“You wrong yourself in this,” said Hester, gently.  
                “You have deeply and sorely repented. Your sin is  
                left behind you, in the days long past. Your present  
                life is not less holy, in very truth, than it seems in  
                people's eyes. Is there no reality in the penitence  
                thus sealed and witnessed by good works? And  
                wherefore should it not bring you peace?”</p>
                
                <p>“No, Hester, no!” replied the clergyman. “There  
                is no substance in it! It is cold and dead, and can do  
                nothing for me! Of penance I have had enough! Of  
                penitence there has been none! Else, I should long  
                ago have thrown off these garments of mock holiness,  
                and have shown myself to mankind as they will see  
                me at the judgment-seat. Happy are you, Hester, that  
                wear the scarlet letter openly upon your bosom! Mine  
                burns in secret! Thou little knowest what a relief it  
                is, after the torment of a seven years' cheat, to look  
                into an eye that recognizes me for what I am! Had  
                I one friend,—or were it my worst enemy!—to whom,  
                when sickened with the praises of all other men, I  
                could daily betake myself, and be known as the vilest  
                <pb n="234"/>
                of all sinners, methinks my soul might keep itself alive  
                thereby. Even thus much of truth would save me!  
                But, now, it is all falsehood!—all emptiness!—all  
                death!”</p>
                
                <p>Hester Prynne looked into his face, but hesitated to  
                speak. Yet, uttering his long-restrained emotions so  
                vehemently as he did, his words here offered her the  
                very point of circumstances in which to interpose what  
                she came to say. She conquered her fears, and spoke.</p>
                
                <p>“Such a friend as thou hast even now wished for,”  
                said she, “with whom to weep over thy sin, thou hast  
                in me, the partner of it!”—Again she hesitated, but  
                brought out the words with an effort.—“Thou hast  
                long had such an enemy, and dwellest with him under  
                the same roof!”</p>
                
                <p>The minister started to his feet, gasping for breath,  
                and clutching at his heart as if he would have torn it  
                out of his bosom.</p>
                
                <p>“Ha! What sayest thou?” cried he. “An enemy! <!-- ene-my -->

                <p>Hester Prynne was now fully sensible of the deep  
                injury for which she was responsible to this unhappy  
                man, in permitting him to lie for so many years, or,  
                indeed, for a single moment, at the mercy of one,

                his authorized interference, as a physician, with the  
                minister's physical and spiritual infirmities,—that these  
                bad opportunities had been turned to a cruel purpose.  
                By means of them, the sufferer's conscience had been  
                kept in an irritated state, the tendency of which was,  
                not to cure by wholesome pain, but to disorganize and  
                corrupt his spiritual being. Its result, on earth, could  
                hardly fail to be insanity, and hereafter, that eternal  
                alienation from the Good and True, of which madness  
                is perhaps the earthly type.</p>
                
                <p>Such was the ruin to which she had brought the  
                man, once,—nay, why should we not speak it?—  
                still so passionately loved! Hester felt that the sacrifice <!-- sacri-fice -->
                of the clergyman's good name, and death itself, as  
                she had already told Roger Chillingworth, would have  
                been infinitely preferable to the alternative which she  
                had taken upon herself to choose. And now, rather  
                than have had this grievous wrong to confess, she  
                would gladly have lain down on the forest-leaves, and  
                died there, at Arthur Dimmesdale's feet.</p>
                
                <p>“O Arthur,” cried she, “forgive me! In all things  
                else, I have striven to be true! Truth was the one  
                virtue which I might have held fast, and did hold fast  
                through all extremity; save when thy good,—thy life,  
                <pb n="236"/>
                —thy fame,—were put in question! Then I consented <!-- con-sented -->
                to a deception. But a lie is never good, even  
                though death threaten on the other side! Dost thou

                <p>The minister looked at her, for an instant, with all  
                that violence of passion, which—intermixed, in more  
                shapes than one, with his higher, purer, softer qualities

                lest he should look her sternly in the face. All the  
                world had frowned on her,—for seven long years had  
                it frowned upon this lonely woman,—and still she bore  
                it all, nor ever once turned away her firm, sad eyes.  
                Heaven, likewise, had frowned upon her, and she had  
                not died. But the frown of this pale, weak, sinful, and  
                sorrow-stricken man was what Hester could not bear,  
                and live!</p>
                
                <p>“Wilt thou yet forgive me?” she repeated, over  
                and over again. “Wilt thou not frown? Wilt thou  
                forgive?”</p>
                
                <p>“I do forgive you, Hester,” replied the minister, at  
                length, with a deep utterance out of an abyss of sadness, <!-- sad-ness -->
                but no anger. “I freely forgive you now.  
                May God forgive us both! We are not, Hester, the  
                worst sinners in the world. There is one worse than  
                even the polluted priest! That old man's revenge has  
                been blacker than my sin. He has violated, in cold  
                blood, the sanctity of a human heart. Thou and I,

                from the ground. “No; I have not forgotten!”</p>
                
                <p>They sat down again, side by side, and hand clasped  
                <pb n="238"/>
                in hand, on the mossy trunk of the fallen tree. Life  
                had never brought them a gloomier hour; it was the  
                point whither their pathway had so long been tending,  
                and darkening ever, as it stole along;—and yet it  
                inclosed a charm that made them linger upon it, and  
                claim another, and another, and, after all, another moment. <!-- mo-ment -->
                The forest was obscure around them, and  
                creaked with a blast that was passing through it. The  
                boughs were tossing heavily above their heads; while  
                one solemn old tree groaned dolefully to another, as if  
                telling the sad story of the pair that sat beneath, or  
                constrained to forebode evil to come.</p>
                
                <p>And yet they lingered. How dreary looked the  
                forest-track that led backward to the settlement, where  
                Hester Prynne must take up again the burden of her  
                ignominy, and the minister the hollow mockery of his  
                good name! So they lingered an instant longer. No  
                golden light had ever been so precious as the gloom of  
                this dark forest. Here, seen only by his eyes, the  
                scarlet letter need not burn into the bosom of the fallen  
                woman! Here, seen only by her eyes, Arthur Dimmesdale, <!-- Dim-mesdale -->

                <p>He started at a thought that suddenly occurred to  
                him.</p>
                
                <p>“Hester,” cried he, “here is a new horror! Roger  
                Chillingworth knows your purpose to reveal his true  
                character. Will he continue, then, to keep our secret?  
                What will now be the course of his revenge?”</p>
                
                <p>“There is a strange secrecy in his nature,” replied  
                Hester, thoughtfully; “and it has grown upon him by  
                <pb n="239"/>
                the hidden practices of his revenge. I deem it not  
                likely that he will betray the secret. He will doubtless  
                seek other means of satiating his dark passion.”</p>
                
                <p>“And I!—how am I to live longer, breathing the  
                same air with this deadly enemy?” exclaimed Arthur  
                Dimmesdale, shrinking within himself, and pressing his  
                hand nervously against his heart,—a gesture that had  
                grown involuntary with him. “Think for me, Hester! <!-- Hes-ter -->
                Thou art strong. Resolve for me!”</p>
                
                <p>“Thou must dwell no longer with this man,” said  
                Hester, slowly and firmly. “Thy heart must be no  
                longer under his evil eye!”</p>
                
                <p>“It were far worse than death!” replied the minister. <!-- min-ister -->
                “But how to avoid it? What choice remains  
                to me? Shall I lie down again on these withered  
                leaves, where I cast myself when thou didst tell me  
                what he was? Must I sink down there, and die at  
                once?”</p>
                
                <p>“Alas, what a ruin has befallen thee!” said Hester,  
                with the tears gushing into her eyes. “Wilt thou die  
                for very weakness? There is no other cause!”</p>
                
                <p>“The judgment of God is on me,” answered the  
                conscience-stricken priest. “It is too mighty for me  
                to struggle with!”</p>
                
                <p>“Heaven would show mercy,” rejoined Hester,  
                “hadst thou but the strength to take advantage of it.”</p>
                
                <p>“Be thou strong for me!” answered he. “Advise  
                me what to do.”</p>
                
                <p>“Is the world then so narrow?” exclaimed Hester  
                Prynne, fixing her deep eyes on the minister's, and instinctively <!-- in-stinctively -->
                exercising a magnetic power over a spirit so  
                <pb n="240"/>
                shattered and subdued, that it could hardly hold itself  
                erect. “Doth the universe lie within the compass of  
                yonder town, which only a little time ago was but a

                Is there not shade enough in all this boundless forest to  
                hide thy heart from the gaze of Roger Chillingworth?”</p>
                
                <p>“Yes, Hester; but only under the fallen leaves!”  
                replied the minister, with a sad smile.</p>
                
                <p>“Then there is the broad pathway of the sea!”  
                continued Hester. “It brought thee hither. If thou  
                so choose, it will bear thee back again. In our native  
                land, whether in some remote rural village or in vast  
                London,—or, surely, in Germany, in France, in pleasant <!-- pleas-ant -->

                <p>“It cannot be!” answered the minister, listening as  
                if he were called upon to realize a dream. “I am  
                powerless to go. Wretched and sinful as I am, I have

                eyes a fitful light, kindled by her enthusiasm, flashed  
                up and died away, “thou tellest of running a race to a

                was to decide their fate. Her intellect and heart had  
                their home, as it were, in desert places, where she  
                roamed as freely as the wild Indian in his woods. For

                view at human institutions, and whatever priests or  
                legislators had established; criticizing all with hardly

                enemy; that, finally, to this poor pilgrim, on his dreary  
                and desert path, faint, sick, miserable, there appeared  
                a glimpse of human affection and sympathy, a new  
                life, and a true one, in exchange for the heavy doom  
                which he was now expiating. And be the stern and  
                sad truth spoken, that the breach which guilt has once  
                made into the human soul is never, in this mortal state,  
                repaired. It may be watched and guarded; so that the  
                enemy shall not force his way again into the citadel,  
                and might even, in his subsequent assaults, select some  
                other avenue, in preference to that where he had formerly <!-- for-merly -->
                succeeded. But there is still the ruined wall,  
                and, near it, the stealthy tread of the foe that would

                rose, as it were, with a bound, and attained a nearer

                which had kept him grovelling on the earth. Of a  
                deeply religious temperament, there was inevitably a  
                tinge of the devotional in his mood.</p>
                
                <p>“Do I feel joy again?” cried he, wondering at himself. <!-- him-self -->
                “Methought the germ of it was dead in me!  
                O Hester, thou art my better angel! I seem to have  
                flung myself—sick, sin-stained, and sorrow-blackened  
                —down upon these forest-leaves, and to have risen up  
                all made anew, and with new powers to glorify Him  
                that hath been merciful! This is already the better  
                life! Why did we not find it sooner?”</p>
                
                <p>“Let us not look back,” answered Hester Prynne.

                a hand's breadth farther flight it would have fallen into  
                the water, and have given the little brook another woe  
                to carry onward, besides the unintelligible tale which it  
                still kept murmuring about. But there lay the embroidered <!-- em-broidered -->
                letter, glittering like a lost jewel, which some  
                ill-fated wanderer might pick up, and thenceforth be  
                haunted by strange phantoms of guilt, sinkings of the  
                heart, and unaccountable misfortune.</p>
                
                <p>The stigma gone, Hester heaved a long, deep sigh,  
                in which the burden of shame and anguish departed  
                from her spirit. O exquisite relief! She had not  
                known the weight, until she felt the freedom! By  
                another impulse, she took off the formal cap that confined <!-- con-fined -->
                her hair; and down it fell upon her shoulders,  
                dark and rich, with at once a shadow and a light in its  
                abundance, and imparting the charm of softness to her  
                features. There played around her mouth, and beamed  
                out of her eyes, a radiant and tender smile, that seemed  
                gushing from the very heart of womanhood. A crimson <!-- crim-son -->
                flush was glowing on her cheek, that had been long  
                so pale. Her sex, her youth, and the whole richness  
                of her beauty, came back from what men call the  
                irrevocable past, and clustered themselves, with her  
                maiden hope, and a happiness before unknown, within  
                the magic circle of this hour. And, as if the gloom of

                two mortal hearts, it vanished with their sorrow. All  
                at once, as with a sudden smile of heaven, forth burst  
                the sunshine, pouring a very flood into the obscure

                yellow fallen ones to gold, and gleaming adown the  
                gray trunks of the solemn trees. The objects that had  
                made a shadow hitherto, embodied the brightness now.  
                The course of the little brook might be traced by its  
                merry gleam afar into the wood's heart of mystery,  
                which had become a mystery of joy.</p>
                
                <p>Such was the sympathy of Nature—that wild,  
                heathen Nature of the forest, never subjugated by human <!-- hu-man -->
                law, nor illumined by higher truth—with the  
                bliss of these two spirits! Love, whether newly born,  
                or aroused from a deathlike slumber, must always  
                create a sunshine, filling the heart so full of radiance,  
                that it overflows upon the outward world. Had the  
                forest still kept its gloom, it would have been bright in  
                Hester's eyes, and bright in Arthur Dimmesdale's!</p>
                
                <p>Hester looked at him with the thrill of another joy.</p>
                
                <p>“Thou must know Pearl!” said she. “Our little  
                Pearl! Thou hast seen her,—yes, I know it!—but  
                thou wilt see her now with other eyes. She is a  
                strange child! I hardly comprehend her! But thou  
                wilt love her dearly, as I do, and wilt advise me how to  
                deal with her.”</p>
                
                <p>“Dost thou think the child will be glad to know  
                me?” asked the minister, somewhat uneasily. “I  
                have long shrunk from children, because they often  
                show a distrust,—a backwardness to be familiar with  
                me. I have even been afraid of little Pearl!”</p>
                
                <p>“Ah, that was sad!” answered the mother. “But  
                she will love thee dearly, and thou her. She is not far  
                off. I will call her! Pearl! Pearl!”</p>
                
                <p>“I see the child,” observed the minister. “Yonder  
                <pb n="249"/>
                she is, standing in a streak of sunshine, a good way off,  
                on the other side of the brook. So thou thinkest the  
                child will love me?”</p>
                
                <p>Hester smiled, and again called to Pearl, who was  
                visible, at some distance, as the minister had described  
                her, like a bright-apparelled vision, in a sunbeam, which

                was a last year's nut, and already gnawed by his sharp  
                tooth. A fox, startled from his sleep by her light footstep <!-- foot-step -->

                THE CHILD AT THE BROOK-SIDE.</head>
                <p>“<hi rend="small-caps">Thou</hi> wilt love her dearly,” repeated Hester  
                Prynne, as she and the minister sat watching little  
                Pearl. “Dost thou not think her beautiful? And  
                see with what natural skill she has made those simple  
                flowers adorn her! Had she gathered pearls, and diamonds, <!-- dia-monds -->
                and rubies, in the wood, they could not have  
                become her better. She is a splendid child! But I  
                know whose brow she has!”</p>
                
                <p>“Dost thou know, Hester,” said Arthur Dimmesdale,  
                with an unquiet smile, “that this dear child, tripping  
                about always at thy side, hath caused me many an  
                alarm? Methought—O Hester, what a thought is  
                that, and how terrible to dread it!—that my own features <!-- fea-tures -->
                were partly repeated in her face, and so strikingly <!-- striking-ly -->
                that the world might see them! But she is mostly  
                thine!”</p>
                
                <p>“No, no! Not mostly!” answered the mother  
                with a tender smile. “A little longer, and thou needest <!-- need-est -->
                not to be afraid to trace whose child she is. But  
                how strangely beautiful she looks, with those wild  
                flowers in her hair! It is as if one of the fairies, whom  
                we left in our dear old England, had decked her out  
                to meet us.”</p>

                <p>It was with a feeling which neither of them had  
                ever before experienced, that they sat and watched  
                Pearl's slow advance. In her was visible the tie that  
                united them. She had been offered to the world, these  
                seven years past, as the living <ref target="_hieroglyphic" corresp="hieroglyphic">hieroglyphic,</ref>

                how could they doubt that their earthly lives and future  
                destinies were conjoined, when they beheld at once the  
                material union, and the spiritual idea, in whom they  
                met, and were to dwell immortally together? Thoughts  
                like these—and perhaps other thoughts, which they  
                did not acknowledge or define—threw an awe about  
                the child, as she came onward.</p>
                
                <p>“Let her see nothing strange—no passion nor  
                eagerness—in thy way of accosting her,” whispered  
                Hester. “Our Pearl is a fitful and fantastic little elf,  
                sometimes. Especially, she is seldom tolerant of emotion, <!-- emo-tion -->
                when she does not fully comprehend the why and  
                wherefore. But the child hath strong affections! She  
                loves me, and will love thee!”</p>
                
                <p>“Thou canst not think,” said the minister, glancing  
                aside at Hester Prynne, “how my heart dreads this  
                interview, and yearns for it! But, in truth, as I already <!-- al-ready -->
                told thee, children are not readily won to be  
                familiar with me. They will not climb my knee,

                in my ear, nor answer to my smile; but  
                stand apart, and eye me strangely. Even little babes,  
                <pb n="253"/>
                when I take them in my arms, weep bitterly. Yet  
                Pearl, twice in her little lifetime, hath been kind to  
                me! The first time,—thou knowest it well! The  
                last was when thou ledst her with thee to the house of  
                yonder stern old Governor.”</p>
                
                <p>“And thou didst plead so bravely in her behalf and  
                mine!” answered the mother. “I remember it; and  
                so shall little Pearl. Fear nothing! She may be strange  
                and shy at first, but will soon learn to love thee!”</p>
                
                <p>By this time Pearl had reached the margin of the  
                brook, and stood on the farther side, gazing silently  
                at Hester and the clergyman, who still sat together on  
                the mossy tree-trunk, waiting to receive her. Just  
                where she had paused the brook chanced to form a  
                pool, so smooth and quiet that it reflected a perfect  
                image of her little figure, with all the brilliant picturesqueness <!-- pictu-resqueness -->
                of her beauty, in its adornment of flowers  
                and wreathed foliage, but more refined and spiritualized  
                than the reality. This image, so nearly identical with  
                the living Pearl, seemed to communicate somewhat of  
                its own shadowy and intangible quality to the child  
                herself. It was strange, the way in which Pearl stood,  
                looking so stedfastly at them through the dim medium  
                of the forest-gloom; herself, meanwhile, all glorified  
                with a ray of sunshine, that was attracted thitherward  
                as by a certain sympathy. In the brook beneath stood  
                another child,—another and the same,—with likewise  
                its ray of golden light. Hester felt herself, in some  
                indistinct and tantalizing manner, estranged from Pearl;  
                as if the child, in her lonely ramble through the forest,  
                had strayed out of the sphere in which she and her  
                <pb n="254"/>
                mother dwelt together, and was now vainly seeking to  
                return to it.</p>
                
                <p>There was both truth and error in the impression;  
                the child and mother were estranged, but through Hester's <!-- Hes-ter's -->
                fault, not Pearl's. Since the latter rambled from  
                her side, another inmate had been admitted within the  
                circle of the mother's feelings, and so modified the  
                aspect of them all, that Pearl, the returning wanderer,  
                could not find her <ref target="_wonted" corresp="wonted">wonted</ref>

                <p>“I have a strange fancy,” observed the sensitive  
                minister, “that this brook is the boundary between  
                two worlds, and that thou canst never meet thy Pearl  
                again. Or is she an elfish spirit, who, as the legends  
                of our childhood taught us, is forbidden to cross a running <!-- run-ning -->
                stream? Pray hasten her; for this delay has already <!-- al-ready -->
                imparted a tremor to my nerves.”</p>
                
                <p>“Come, dearest child!” said Hester encouragingly,  
                and stretching out both her arms. “How slow thou  
                art! When hast thou been so sluggish before now?  
                Here is a friend of mine, who must be thy friend also.  
                Thou wilt have twice as much love, henceforward, as  
                thy mother alone could give thee! Leap across the  
                brook and come to us. Thou canst leap like a young  
                deer!”</p>
                
                <p>Pearl, without responding in any manner to these  
                honey-sweet expressions, remained on the other side  
                of the brook. Now she fixed her bright, wild eyes  
                on her mother, now on the minister, and now included  
                them both in the same glance; as if to detect and explain <!-- ex-plain -->
                to herself the relation which they bore to one  
                <pb n="255"/>
                another. For some unaccountable reason, as Arthur  
                Dimmesdale felt the child's eyes upon himself, his  
                hand—with that gesture so habitual as to have become <!-- be-come -->
                involuntary—stole over his heart. At length,  
                assuming a singular air of authority, Pearl stretched out  
                her hand, with the small forefinger extended, and  
                pointing evidently towards her mother's breast. And  
                beneath, in the mirror of the brook, there was the  
                flower-girdled and sunny image of little Pearl, pointing  
                her small forefinger too.</p>
                
                <p>“Thou strange child, why dost thou not come to  
                me?” exclaimed Hester.</p>
                
                <p>Pearl still pointed with her forefinger; and a frown  
                gathered on her brow; the more impressive from the  
                childish, the almost baby-like aspect of the features that  
                conveyed it. As her mother still kept beckoning to  
                her, and arraying her face in a holiday suit of unaccustomed <!-- unac-customed -->
                smiles, the child stamped her foot with a yet  
                more <ref corresp="imperious" target="_imperious">imperious</ref>
                look and gesture. In the brook, again,  
                was the fantastic beauty of the image, with its reflected  
                frown, its pointed finger, and imperious gesture, giving  
                emphasis to the aspect of little Pearl.</p>
                
                <p>“Hasten, Pearl; or I shall be angry with thee!”  
                cried Hester Prynne, who, however inured to such  
                behaviour on the elf-child's part at other seasons, was  
                naturally anxious for a more seemly deportment now.  
                “Leap across the brook, naughty child, and run  
                hither! Else I must come to thee!”</p>
                
                <p>But Pearl, not a whit startled at her mother's threats,

                and throwing her small figure into the most extravagant  
                contortions. She accompanied this wild outbreak with  
                piercing shrieks, which the woods reverberated on all  
                sides; so that, alone as she was in her childish and  
                unreasonable wrath, it seemed as if a hidden multitude  
                were lending her their sympathy and encouragement.  
                Seen in the brook, once more, was the shadowy wrath  
                of Pearl's image, crowned and girdled with flowers,  
                but stamping its foot, wildly gesticulating, and, in the  
                midst of all, still pointing its small forefinger at Hester's <!-- Hes-ter's -->
                bosom!</p>
                
                <p>“I see what ails the child,” whispered Hester to the  
                clergyman, and turning pale in spite of a strong effort  
                to conceal her trouble and annoyance. “Children  
                will not abide any, the slightest, change in the accustomed <!-- accus-tomed -->
                aspect of things that are daily before their eyes.  
                Pearl misses something which she has always seen me

                <p>“I pray you,” answered the minister, “if thou hast

                <p>Hester turned again towards Pearl, with a crimson  
                blush upon her cheek, a conscious glance aside at the  
                clergyman, and then a heavy sigh; while, even before

                <p>The child turned her eyes to the point indicated;  
                and there lay the scarlet letter, so close upon the margin <!-- mar-gin -->

                <p>“Was ever such a child!” observed Hester aside  
                to the minister. “O, I have much to tell thee about  
                her. But, in very truth, she is right as regards this  
                hateful token. I must bear its torture yet a little longer,  
                —only a few days longer,—until we shall have left

                <p>With these words, she advanced to the margin of the  
                brook, took up the scarlet letter, and fastened it again  
                into her bosom. Hopefully, but a moment ago, as  
                Hester had spoken of drowning it in the deep sea, there  
                was a sense of inevitable doom upon her, as she thus  
                received back this deadly symbol from the hand of fate.  
                She had flung it into infinite space!—she had drawn  
                an hour's free breath!—and here again was the scarlet <!-- scar-let -->
                misery, glittering on the old spot! So it ever is,  
                whether thus typified or no, that an evil deed invests  
                itself with the character of doom. Hester next

                of her womanhood, departed, like fading sunshine;  
                and a gray shadow seemed to fall across her.</p>
                
                <p>When the dreary change was wrought, she extended  
                her hand to Pearl.</p>
                
                <p>“Dost thou know thy mother now, child?” asked  
                she, reproachfully, but with a subdued tone. “Wilt  
                thou come across the brook, and own thy mother, now  
                that she has her shame upon her,—now that she is  
                sad?”</p>
                
                <p>“Yes; now I will!” answered the child, bounding  
                across the brook, and clasping Hester in her arms.  
                “Now thou art my mother indeed! And I am thy  
                little Pearl!”</p>
                
                <p>In a mood of tenderness that was not usual with her,  
                she drew down her mother's head, and kissed her brow  
                and both her cheeks. But then—by a kind of necessity <!-- neces-sity -->
                that always impelled this child to alloy whatever  
                comfort she might chance to give with a throb of  
                anguish—Pearl put up her mouth, and kissed the  
                scarlet letter too!</p>
                
                <p>“That was not kind!” said Hester. “When thou  
                hast shown me a little love, thou mockest me!”</p>
                
                <p>“Why doth the minister sit yonder?” asked Pearl.</p>

                <p>“Doth he love us?” said Pearl, looking up with  
                acute intelligence into her mother's face. “Will he  
                go back with us, hand in hand, we three together, into  
                the town?”</p>

                <p>“Not now, dear child,” answered Hester. “But in  
                days to come he will walk hand in hand with us. We  
                will have a home and fireside of our own; and thou

                <p>“And will he always keep his hand over his heart?”  
                inquired Pearl.</p>

                her mother. “Come and ask his blessing!”</p>

                Pearl would show no favor to the clergyman. It was  
                only by an exertion of force that her mother brought  
                her up to him, hanging back, and manifesting her reluctance <!-- re-luctance -->
                by odd grimaces; of which, ever since her  
                babyhood, she had possessed a singular variety, and  
                could transform her mobile <ref corresp="physiognomy" target="_physiognomy">physiognomy</ref> into a series  
                of different aspects, with a new mischief in them, each  
                and all. The minister—painfully embarrassed, but  
                hoping that a kiss might prove a talisman to admit him  
                into the child's kindlier regards—bent forward, and  
                impressed one on her brow. Hereupon, Pearl broke  
                away from her mother, and, running to the brook,  
                stooped over it, and bathed her forehead, until the unwelcome <!-- un-welcome -->
                kiss was quite washed off, and diffused through  
                a long lapse of the gliding water. She then remained  
                apart, silently watching Hester and the clergyman;  
                while they talked together, and made such arrangements <!-- arrange-ments -->
                as were suggested by their new position, and the

                <p>And now this fateful interview had come to a close.  
                The dell was to be left a solitude among its dark, old  
                trees, which, with their multitudinous tongues, would  
                whisper long of what had passed there, and no mortal  
                be the wiser. And the melancholy brook would add  
                this other tale to the mystery with which its little heart  
                was already overburdened, and whereof it still kept

                THE MINISTER IN A MAZE.</head>
                <p>As the minister departed, in advance of Hester  
                Prynne and little Pearl, he threw a backward glance;  
                half expecting that he should discover only some faintly  
                traced features or outline of the mother and the child,  
                slowly fading into the twilight of the woods. So great  
                a <ref target="_vicissitude" corresp="vicissitude">vicissitude</ref>
                in his life could not at once be received  
                as real. But there was Hester, clad in her gray robe,  
                still standing beside the tree-trunk, which some blast  
                had overthrown a long antiquity ago, and which time  
                had ever since been covering with moss, so that these  
                two fated ones, with earth's heaviest burden on them,  
                might there sit down together, and find a single hour's  
                rest and solace. And there was Pearl, too, lightly  
                dancing from the margin of the brook,—now that the  
                intrusive third person was gone,—and taking her old  
                place by her mother's side. So the minister had not

                <p>The minister had inquired of Hester, with no little  
                interest, the precise time at which the vessel might be  
                expected to depart. It would probably be on the fourth  
                day from the present. “That is most fortunate!”  
                he had then said to himself. Now, why the Reverend  
                Mr. Dimmesdale considered it so very fortunate, we  
                hesitate to reveal. Nevertheless,—to hold nothing  
                back from the reader,—it was because, on the third  
                day from the present, he was to preach the Election  
                <pb n="263"/>
                Sermon; and, as such an occasion formed an honorable <!-- honora-ble -->
                epoch in the life of a New England clergyman, he  
                could not have chanced upon a more suitable mode  
                and time of terminating his professional career. “At  
                least, they shall say of me,” thought this exemplary  
                man, “that I leave no public duty unperformed, nor

                at every point where his memory suggested <!-- sug-gested -->
                one. Not the less, however, came this importunately <!-- impor-tunately -->
                obtrusive sense of change. The same was  
                true as regarded the acquaintances whom he met, and  
                all the well-known shapes of human life, about the little <!-- lit-tle -->
                town. They looked neither older nor younger,  
                now; the beards of the aged were no whiter, nor could  
                the creeping babe of yesterday walk on his feet today; <!-- to-day -->
                it was impossible to describe in what respect they  
                differed from the individuals on whom he had so recently <!-- re-cently -->
                bestowed a parting glance; and yet the minister's  
                deepest sense seemed to inform him of their <ref target="_mutability" corresp="mutability">mutability.</ref>

                A similar impression struck him most remarkably, as  
                he passed under the walls of his own church. The  
                edifice had so very strange, and yet so familiar, an  
                aspect, that Mr. Dimmesdale's mind vibrated between  
                two ideas; either that he had seen it only in a dream  
                hitherto, or that he was merely dreaming about it now.</p>
                
                <p>This phenomenon, in the various shapes which it assumed, <!-- as-sumed -->
                indicated no external change, but so sudden and  
                important a change in the spectator of the familiar  
                scene, that the intervening space of a single day had  
                operated on his consciousness like the lapse of years.  
                The minister's own will, and Hester's will, and the fate  
                that grew between them, had <ref corresp="wrought" target="_wrought">wrought</ref> this transformation. <!-- transforma-tion -->
                <pb n="265"/>
                It was the same town as heretofore; but the  
                same minister returned not from the forest. He might  
                have said to the friends who greeted him,—“I am not  
                the man for whom you take me! I left him yonder in  
                the forest, withdrawn into a secret dell, by a mossy  
                tree-trunk, and near a melancholy brook! Go, seek  
                your minister, and see if his <ref target="_emaciated" corresp="emaciated">emaciated</ref> figure, his thin  
                cheek, his white, heavy, pain-wrinkled brow, be not  
                flung down there like a cast-off garment!” His friends,  
                no doubt, would still have insisted with him,—“Thou  
                art thyself the man!”—but the error would have been  
                their own, not his.</p>
                
                <p>Before Mr. Dimmesdale reached home, his inner  
                man gave him other evidences of a revolution in the  
                sphere of thought and feeling. In truth, nothing short  
                of a total change of dynasty and moral code, in that  
                interior kingdom, was adequate to account for the impulses <!-- im-pulses -->
                now communicated to the unfortunate and startled <!-- star-tled -->
                minister. At every step he was <ref corresp="incited" target="_incited">incited</ref>

                some strange, wild, wicked thing or other, with a  
                sense that it would be at once involuntary and intentional; <!-- inten-tional -->

                For instance, he met one of his own deacons. The

                the deep, almost worshipping respect, which the minister's <!-- minis-ter's -->
                professional and private claims alike demanded.  
                Never was there a more beautiful example of how the

                He absolutely trembled and turned  
                pale as ashes, lest his tongue should wag itself, in  
                utterance of these horrible matters, and plead his own  
                consent for so doing, without his having fairly given it.  
                And, even with this terror in his heart, he could hardly <!-- hard-ly -->
                avoid laughing to imagine how the sanctified old  
                patriarchal deacon would have been petrified by his  
                minister's impiety!</p>
                
                <p>Again, another incident of the same nature. Hurrying <!-- Hurry-ing -->
                along the street, the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale encountered <!-- en-countered -->
                the eldest female member of his church; a  
                most pious and exemplary old dame; poor, widowed,  
                lonely, and with a heart as full of reminiscences about  
                her dead husband and children, and her dead friends of  
                long ago, as a burial-ground is full of storied gravestones. <!-- grave-stones -->
                Yet all this, which would else have been such  
                heavy sorrow, was made almost a solemn joy to her  
                devout old soul by religious consolations and the truths  
                of Scripture, wherewith she had fed herself continually  
                for more than thirty years. And, since Mr. Dimmesdale <!-- Dimmes-dale -->
                had taken her in charge, the good grandam's chief  
                earthly comfort—which, unless it had been likewise a  
                <pb n="267"/>
                heavenly comfort, could have been none at all—was  
                to meet her pastor, whether casually, or of set purpose,  
                and be refreshed with a word of warm, fragrant,  
                heaven-breathing Gospel truth from his beloved lips  
                into her dulled, but rapturously attentive ear. But, on  
                this occasion, up to the moment of putting his lips to  
                the old woman's ear, Mr. Dimmesdale, as the great  
                enemy of souls would have it, could recall no text of  
                Scripture, nor aught else, except a brief, pithy, and, as  
                it then appeared to him, unanswerable argument against  
                the immortality of the human soul. The instilment  
                thereof into her mind would probably have caused this  
                aged sister to drop down dead, at once, as by the effect  
                of an intensely poisonous infusion. What he really  
                did whisper, the minister could never afterwards recollect. <!-- recol-lect -->
                There was, perhaps, a fortunate disorder in his  
                utterance, which failed to impart any distinct idea to  
                the good widow's comprehension, or which Providence  
                interpreted after a method of its own. Assuredly, as  
                the minister looked back, he beheld an expression of  
                divine gratitude and ecstasy that seemed like the shine  
                of the celestial city on her face, so wrinkled and ashy  
                pale.</p>
                
                <p>Again, a third instance. After parting from the old  
                church-member, he met the youngest sister of them all.  
                It was a maiden newly won—and won by the Reverend <!-- Rever-end -->
                Mr. Dimmesdale's own sermon, on the Sabbath  
                after his vigil—to barter the transitory pleasures of the  
                world for the heavenly hope, that was to assume brighter  
                substance as life grew dark around her, and which would  
                gild the utter gloom with final glory. She was fair and  
                <pb n="268"/>
                pure as a lily that had bloomed in Paradise. The minister <!-- min-ister -->
                knew well that he was himself enshrined within  
                the stainless sanctity of her heart, which hung its  
                snowy curtains about his image, imparting to religion  
                the warmth of love, and to love a religious purity.  
                Satan, that afternoon, had surely led the poor young  
                girl away from her mother's side, and thrown her into  
                the pathway of this sorely tempted, or—shall we not  
                rather say?—this lost and desperate man. As she  
                drew nigh, the arch-fiend whispered him to condense  
                into small compass and drop into her tender bosom a  
                germ of evil that would be sure to blossom darkly soon,  
                and bear black fruit betimes. Such was his sense of  
                power over this virgin soul, trusting him as she did,  
                that the minister felt potent to blight all the field of innocence <!-- in-nocence -->
                with but one wicked look, and develop all  
                its opposite with but a word. So—with a mightier  
                struggle than he had yet sustained—he held his Geneva <!-- Ge-neva -->
                cloak before his face, and hurried onward, making <!-- mak-ing -->
                no sign of recognition, and leaving the young sister  
                to digest his rudeness as she might. She ransacked  
                her conscience,—which was full of harmless little  
                matters, like her pocket or her work-bag,—and took  
                herself to task, poor thing, for a thousand imaginary  
                faults; and went about her household duties with swollen <!-- swol-len -->
                eyelids the next morning.</p>
                
                <p>Before the minister had time to celebrate his victory  
                over this last temptation, he was conscious of another  
                impulse, more ludicrous, and almost as horrible. It  
                was,—we blush to tell it,—it was to stop short in the  
                road, and teach some very wicked words to a knot of  
                <pb n="269"/>
                little Puritan children who were playing there, and had  
                but just begun to talk. Denying himself this freak,  
                as unworthy of his cloth, he met a drunken seaman,  
                one of the ship's crew from the Spanish Main. And,  
                here, since he had so valiantly forborne all other wickedness, <!-- wick-edness -->
                poor Mr. Dimmesdale longed, at least, to shake  
                hands with the tarry blackguard, and recreate himself  
                with a few improper jests, such as dissolute sailors so  
                abound with, and a volley of good, round, solid, satisfactory, <!-- satis-factory -->
                and heaven-defying oaths! It was not so  
                much a better principle, as partly his natural good taste,  
                and still more his buckramed habit of clerical decorum,  
                that carried him safely through the latter crisis.</p>
                
                <p>“What is it that haunts and tempts me thus?” cried  
                the minister to himself, at length, pausing in the street,  
                and striking his hand against his forehead. “Am I  
                mad? or am I given over utterly to the fiend? Did I  
                make a contract with him in the forest, and sign it with  
                my blood? And does he now summon me to its fulfilment, <!-- ful-filment -->
                by suggesting the performance of every wickedness <!-- wick-edness -->
                which his most foul imagination can conceive?”</p>
                
                <p>At the moment when the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale  
                thus communed with himself, and struck his forehead  
                with his hand, old Mistress Hibbins, the reputed witch-lady, <!-- witch-lady -->
                is said to have been passing by. She made a  
                very grand appearance; having on a high head-dress,  
                a rich gown of velvet, and a ruff done up with the  
                famous yellow starch, of which Ann Turner, her  
                especial friend, had taught her the secret, before this  
                last good lady had been hanged for Sir Thomas Overbury's <!-- Over-bury's -->
                murder. Whether the witch had read the minister's <!-- min-ister's -->
                <pb n="270"/>
                thoughts, or no, she came to a full stop, looked  
                shrewdly into his face, smiled craftily, and—though  
                little given to converse with clergymen—began a conversation.</p> <!-- con-versation -->
                
                <p>“So, reverend Sir, you have made a visit into the  
                forest,” observed the witch-lady, nodding her high  
                head-dress at him. “The next time, I pray you to  
                allow me only a fair warning, and I shall be proud to  
                bear you company. Without taking overmuch upon  
                myself, my good word will go far towards gaining any  
                strange gentleman a fair reception from yonder potentate <!-- poten-tate -->
                you wot of!”</p>
                
                <p>“I profess, madam,” answered the clergyman, with  
                a grave obeisance, such as the lady's rank demanded,  
                and his own good-breeding made imperative,—“I pro-fess, <!-- pro-fess -->
                on my conscience and character, that I am utterly  
                bewildered as touching the purport of your words! I  
                went not into the forest to seek a potentate; neither do  
                I, at any future time, design a visit thither, with a view  
                to gaining the favor of such personage. My one  
                sufficient object was to greet that pious friend of mine,  
                the Apostle Eliot, and rejoice with him over the many  
                precious souls he hath won from heathendom!”</p>
                
                <p>“Ha, ha, ha!” cackled the old witch-lady, still nodding <!-- nod-ding -->
                her high head-dress at the minister. “Well, well,  
                we must needs talk thus in the daytime! You carry  
                it off like an old hand! But at midnight, and in the  
                forest, we shall have other talk together!”</p>
                
                <p>She passed on with her aged stateliness, but often  
                turning back her head and smiling at him, like one  
                willing to recognize a secret intimacy of connection.</p>
                <pb n="271"/>
                <p>“Have I then sold myself,” thought the minister,  
                “to the fiend whom, if men say true, this yellow-starched <!-- yellow-starched -->
                and velveted old hag has chosen for her prince  
                and master!”</p>
                
                <p>The wretched minister! He had made a bargain  
                very like it! Tempted by a dream of happiness, he  
                had yielded himself with deliberate choice, as he had  
                never done before, to what he knew was deadly sin.  
                And the infectious poison of that sin had been thus  
                rapidly diffused throughout his moral system. It had  
                stupefied all blessed impulses, and awakened into vivid  
                life the whole brotherhood of bad ones. Scorn, bitterness, <!-- bitter-ness -->
                unprovoked malignity, gratuitous desire of ill,  
                ridicule of whatever was good and holy, all awoke, to  
                tempt, even while they frightened him. And his encounter <!-- en-counter -->
                with old Mistress Hibbins, if it were a real  
                incident, did but show his sympathy and fellowship  
                with wicked mortals and the world of perverted spirits.</p>
                
                <p>He had by this time reached his dwelling, on the  
                edge of the burial-ground, and, hastening up the stairs,  
                took refuge in his study. The minister was glad to  
                have reached this shelter, without first betraying himself <!-- him-self -->
                to the world by any of those strange and wicked  
                eccentricities to which he had been continually impelled <!-- im-pelled -->
                while passing through the streets. He entered  
                the accustomed room, and looked around him on its  
                books, its windows, its fireplace, and the tapestried  
                comfort of the walls, with the same perception of  
                strangeness that had haunted him throughout his walk  
                from the forest-dell into the town, and thitherward.  
                Here he had studied and written; here, gone through  
                <pb n="272"/>
                fast and vigil, and come forth half alive; here, striven  
                to pray; here, borne a hundred thousand agonies!  
                There was the Bible, in its rich old Hebrew, with Moses  
                and the Prophets speaking to him, and God's voice  
                through all! There, on the table, with the inky pen  
                beside it, was an unfinished sermon, with a sentence  
                broken in the midst, where his thoughts had ceased to  
                gush out upon the page two days before. He knew  
                that it was himself, the thin and white-cheeked minister, <!-- minis-ter -->
                who had done and suffered these things, and written  
                thus far into the Election Sermon! But he seemed to  
                stand apart, and eye this former self with scornful,  
                pitying, but half-envious curiosity. That self was  
                gone! Another man had returned out of the forest;  
                a wiser one; with a knowledge of hidden mysteries  
                which the simplicity of the former never could have  
                reached. A bitter kind of knowledge that!</p>
                
                <p>While occupied with these reflections, a knock came  
                at the door of the study, and the minister said,  
                “Come in!”—not wholly devoid of an idea that he  
                might behold an evil spirit. And so he did! It was  
                old Roger Chillingworth that entered. The minister  
                stood, white and speechless, with one hand on the Hebrew <!-- He-brew -->
                Scriptures, and the other spread upon his breast.</p>
                
                <p>“Welcome home, reverend Sir!” said the physician. <!-- phy-sician -->
                “And how found you that godly man, the  
                Apostle Eliot? But methinks, dear Sir, you look  
                pale; as if the travel through the wilderness had been  
                too sore for you. Will not my aid be requisite to put  
                you in heart and strength to preach your Election Sermon?"</p> <!-- Ser-mon -->
                <pb n="273"/>
                <p>“Nay, I think not so,” rejoined the Reverend Mr.  
                Dimmesdale. “My journey, and the sight of the holy  
                Apostle yonder, and the free air which I have breathed,  
                have done me good, after so long confinement in my  
                study. I think to need no more of your drugs, my  
                kind physician, good though they be, and administered  
                by a friendly hand.”</p>
                
                <p>All this time, Roger Chillingworth was looking at the  
                minister with the grave and intent regard of a physician <!-- phy-sician -->
                towards his patient. But, in spite of this outward  
                show, the latter was almost convinced of the old man's  
                knowledge, or, at least, his confident suspicion, with  
                respect to his own interview with Hester Prynne. The  
                physician knew, then, that, in the minister's regard, he  
                was no longer a trusted friend, but his bitterest enemy. <!-- ene-my -->
                So much being known, it would appear natural  
                that a part of it should be expressed. It is singular,  
                however, how long a time often passes before words  
                embody things; and with what security two persons,  
                who choose to avoid a certain subject, may approach its  
                very verge, and retire without disturbing it. Thus, the  
                minister felt no apprehension that Roger Chillingworth  
                would touch, in express words, upon the real position  
                which they sustained towards one another. Yet did the  
                physician, in his dark way, creep frightfully near the  
                secret.</p>
                
                <p>“Were it not better,” said he, “that you use my  
                poor skill to-night? Verily, dear Sir, we must take  
                pains to make you strong and vigorous for this occasion <!-- occa-sion -->
                of the Election discourse. The people look for  
                <pb n="274"/>
                great things from you; apprehending that another year  
                may come about, and find their pastor gone.”</p>
                
                <p>“Yea, to another world,” replied the minister, with  
                pious resignation. “Heaven grant it be a better one;  
                for, in good sooth, I hardly think to tarry with my flock  
                through the flitting seasons of another year! But,  
                touching your medicine, kind Sir, in my present frame  
                of body I need it not.”</p>
                
                <p>“I joy to hear it,” answered the physician. “It  
                may be that my remedies, so long administered in  
                vain, begin now to take due effect. Happy man were  
                I, and well deserving of New England's gratitude,  
                could I achieve this cure!”</p>
                
                <p>“I thank you from my heart, most watchful friend,”  
                said the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, with a solemn  
                smile. “I thank you, and can but requite your good  
                deeds with my prayers.”</p>
                
                <p>“A good man's prayers are golden recompense!”  
                rejoined old Roger Chillingworth, as he took his leave.  
                “Yea, they are the current gold coin of the New  
                Jerusalem, with the King's own mint-mark on them!”</p>
                
                <p>Left alone, the minister summoned a servant of the  
                house, and requested food, which, being set before him,  
                he ate with ravenous appetite. Then, flinging the  
                already written pages of the Election Sermon into the  
                fire, he forthwith began another, which he wrote with  
                such an impulsive flow of thought and emotion, that  
                he fancied himself inspired; and only wondered that  
                Heaven should see fit to transmit the grand and solemn  
                music of its oracles through so foul an organ-pipe as  
                he. However, leaving that mystery to solve itself,  
                <pb n="275"/>
                or go unsolved for ever, he drove his task onward, with  
                earnest haste and ecstasy. Thus the night fled away,  
                as if it were a winged steed, and he careering on it;  
                morning came, and peeped blushing through the curtains; <!-- cur-tains -->
                and at last sunrise threw a golden beam into  
                the study, and laid it right across the minister's bedazzled <!-- bedaz-zled -->
                eyes. There he was, with the pen still between  
                his fingers, and a vast, immeasurable tract of written  
                space behind him!</p>

                THE NEW ENGLAND HOLIDAY.</head>
                <p><hi rend="small-caps">Betimes</hi> in the morning of the day on which the  
                new Governor was to receive his office at the hands of  
                the people, Hester Prynne and little Pearl came into  
                the market-place. It was already thronged with the  
                craftsmen and other plebeian inhabitants of the town, in  
                considerable numbers; among whom, likewise, were  
                many rough figures, whose attire of deer-skins marked  
                them as belonging to some of the forest settlements,  
                which surrounded the little metropolis of the colony.</p>
                
                <p>On this public holiday, as on all other occasions, for  
                seven years past, Hester was clad in a garment of  
                coarse gray cloth. Not more by its hue than by some  
                indescribable peculiarity in its fashion, it had the effect  
                of making her fade personally out of sight and outline;  
                while, again, the scarlet letter brought her back from  
                this twilight indistinctness, and revealed her under the  
                moral aspect of its own illumination. Her face, so  
                long familiar to the townspeople, showed the marble  
                quietude which they were accustomed to behold there.  
                It was like a mask; or rather, like the frozen calmness  
                of a dead woman's features; owing this dreary resemblance <!-- resem-blance -->
                to the fact that Hester was actually dead, in respect <!-- re-spect -->
                to any claim of sympathy, and had departed out  
                of the world with which she still seemed to mingle.</p>
                <pb n="277"/>
                <p>It might be, on this one day, that there was an expression <!-- ex-pression -->
                unseen before, nor, indeed, vivid enough to  
                be detected now; unless some preternaturally gifted  
                observer should have first read the heart, and have  
                afterwards sought a corresponding development in the  
                countenance and mien. Such a spiritual seer might  
                have conceived, that, after sustaining the gaze of the  
                multitude through seven miserable years as a necessity,  
                a penance, and something which it was a stern religion  
                to endure, she now, for one last time more, encountered <!-- encoun-tered -->
                it freely and voluntarily, in order to convert what  
                had so long been agony into a kind of triumph.  
                “Look your last on the scarlet letter and its wearer!”  
                —the people's victim and life-long bond-slave as they  
                fancied her, might say to them. “Yet a little while,  
                and she will be beyond your reach! A few hours  
                longer, and the deep, mysterious ocean will quench  
                and hide for ever the symbol which ye have caused to  
                burn upon her bosom!” Nor were it an inconsistency  
                too improbable to be assigned to human nature, should  
                we suppose a feeling of regret in Hester's mind, at the  
                moment when she was about to win her freedom from  
                the pain which had been thus deeply incorporated with  
                her being. Might there not be an irresistible desire to  
                quaff a last, long, breathless draught of the cup of

                apparel, was the same that had achieved a task perhaps  
                more difficult, in imparting so distinct a peculiarity to  
                Hester's simple robe. The dress, so proper was it to  
                little Pearl, seemed an <ref target="_effluence" corresp="effluence">effluence,</ref> or inevitable development <!-- develop-ment -->

                from the leaf of a bright flower. As with these, so  
                with the child; her garb was all of one idea with her  
                nature. On this eventful day, moreover, there was a

                resembling nothing so much as the shimmer of a diamond, <!-- dia-mond -->
                that sparkles and flashes with the varied throbbings <!-- throb-bings -->

                trouble or impending revolution, of whatever kind, in  
                domestic circumstances; and therefore Pearl, who was  
                the gem on her mother's unquiet bosom, betrayed, by  
                the very dance of her spirits, the emotions which none  
                could detect in the marble passiveness of Hester's  
                brow.</p>
                
                <p>This effervescence made her flit with a bird-like  
                movement, rather than walk by her mother's side. She  
                <pb n="279"/>
                broke continually into shouts of a wild, inarticulate, and  
                sometimes piercing music. When they reached the  
                market-place, she became still more restless, on perceiving <!-- per-ceiving -->
                the stir and bustle that enlivened the spot; for  
                it was usually more like the broad and lonesome green  
                before a village meeting-house, than the centre of a  
                town's business.</p>
                
                <p>“Why, what is this, mother?” cried she. “Wherefore <!-- Where-fore -->
                have all the people left their work to-day? Is it a  
                play-day for the whole world. See, there is the blacksmith! <!-- black-smith -->
                He has washed his sooty face, and put on his  
                Sabbath-day clothes, and looks, as if he would gladly  
                be merry, if any kind body would only teach him how!  
                And there is Master Brackett, the old jailer, nodding  
                and smiling at me. Why does he do so, mother?”</p>
                
                <p>“He remembers thee a little babe, my child,” answered <!-- an-swered -->
                Hester.</p>
                
                <p>“He should not nod and smile at me, for all that,—  
                the black, grim, ugly-eyed old man!” said Pearl.  
                “He may nod at thee if he will; for thou art clad in  
                gray, and wearest the scarlet letter. But, see, mother,  
                how many faces of strange people, and Indians among  
                them, and sailors! What have they all come to do  
                here in the market-place?”</p>
                
                <p>“They wait to see the procession pass,” said Hester.  
                “For the Governor and the magistrates are to go by,  
                and the ministers, and all the great people and good

                <p>“And will the minister be there?” asked Pearl.  
                “And will he hold out both his hands to me, as when  
                thou ledst me to him from the brook-side?”</p>
                <pb n="280"/>
                <p>“He will be there, child,” answered her mother.  
                “But he will not greet thee to-day; nor must thou  
                greet him.”</p>
                
                <p>“What a strange, sad man is he!” said the child, as  
                if speaking partly to herself. “In the dark night-time,  
                he calls us to him, and holds thy hand and mine, as  
                when we stood with him on the scaffold yonder! And  
                in the deep forest, where only the old trees can hear,  
                and the strip of sky see it, he talks with thee, sitting on  
                a heap of moss! And he kisses my forehead, too, so  
                that the little brook would hardly wash it off! But  
                here in the sunny day, and among all the people, he  
                knows us not; nor must we know him! A strange,  
                sad man is he, with his hand always over his heart!”</p>
                
                <p>“Be quiet, Pearl! Thou understandest not these  
                things,” said her mother. “Think not now of the  
                minister, but look about thee, and see how cheery is  
                every body's face to-day. The children have come  
                from their schools, and the grown people from their  
                workshops and their fields, on purpose to be happy.  
                For, to-day, a new man is beginning to rule over them;  
                and so—as has been the custom of mankind ever  
                since a nation was first gathered—they make merry  
                and rejoice; as if a good and golden year were at  
                length to pass over the poor old world!”</p>
                
                <p>It was as Hester said, in regard to the unwonted jollity <!-- jol-lity -->
                that brightened the faces of the people. Into this  
                festal season of the year—as it already was, and  
                continued to be during the greater part of two centuries--the <!-- cen-turies -->
                Puritans compressed whatever mirth and  
                public joy they deemed allowable to human infirmity; <!-- infirm-ity -->
                <pb n="281"/>
                thereby so far dispelling the customary cloud, that,  
                for the space of a single holiday, they appeared  
                scarcely more grave than most other communities at a  
                period of general affliction.</p>
                
                <p>But we perhaps exaggerate the gray or sable tinge,  
                which undoubtedly characterized the mood and manners <!-- man-ners -->
                of the age. The persons now in the market-place <!-- market-place -->
                of Boston had not been born to an inheritance  
                of Puritanic gloom. They were native Englishmen,  
                whose fathers had lived in the sunny richness of the  
                Elizabethan epoch; a time when the life of England,  
                viewed as one great mass, would appear to have been  
                as stately, magnificent, and joyous, as the world has  
                ever witnessed. Had they followed their hereditary  
                taste, the New England settlers would have illustrated  
                all events of public importance by bonfires, banquets,  
                pageantries, and processions. Nor would it have been  
                impracticable, in the observance of majestic ceremonies,  
                to combine mirthful recreation with solemnity, and  
                give, as it were, a grotesque and brilliant embroidery  
                to the great robe of state, which a nation, at such festivals, <!-- fes-tivals -->
                puts on. There was some shadow of an attempt  
                of this kind in the mode of celebrating the day on  
                which the political year of the colony commenced.  
                The dim reflection of a remembered splendor, a colorless <!-- color-less -->
                and manifold diluted repetition of what they had  
                beheld in proud old <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName>,—we will not say at a
                royal coronation, but at a Lord Mayor's show,—might

                —the statesman, the priest, and the soldier—deemed  
                it a duty then to assume the outward state and majesty, <!-- majes-ty -->
                which, in accordance with antique style, was looked  
                upon as the proper garb of public or social eminence.  
                All came forth, to move in procession before the people's <!-- peo-ple's -->
                eye, and thus impart a needed dignity to the simple <!-- sim-ple -->
                framework of a government so newly constructed.</p>
                
                <p>Then, too, the people were countenanced, if not

                widely too. Nor were sports wanting, such as the

                country fairs and on the village-greens of England;

                that were essential in them. Wrestling-matches, in the  
                differing fashions of Cornwall and Devonshire, were  
                seen here and there about the market-place; in one  
                corner, there was a friendly bout at quarterstaff; and  
                —what attracted most interest of all—on the platform <!-- plat-form -->
                of the pillory, already so noted in our pages, two  
                masters of defence were commencing an exhibition

                disappointment of the crowd, this latter business was  
                broken off by the interposition of the town beadle, who

                subsequent years have not sufficed to clear it up. We  
                have yet to learn again the forgotten art of gayety.</p>
                
                <p>The picture of human life in the market-place,  
                though its general tint was the sad gray, brown, or  
                black of the English emigrants, was yet enlivened by  
                some diversity of hue. A party of Indians—in their  
                savage finery of curiously embroidered deer-skin robes,  
                wampum-belts, red and yellow ochre, and feathers, and  
                armed with the bow and arrow and stone-headed spear

                —stood apart, with countenances of inflexible gravity,  
                beyond what even the Puritan aspect could attain.  
                Nor, wild as were these painted barbarians, were they  
                the wildest feature of the scene. This distinction could  
                more justly be claimed by some mariners,—a part of  
                the crew of the vessel from the Spanish Main,—who  
                had come ashore to see the humors of Election Day.  
                They were rough-looking desperadoes, with sun-blackened <!-- sun-black-ened -->
                faces, and an immensity of beard; their wide,

                often clasped with a rough plate of gold, and sustaining  
                always a long knife, and, in some instances, a sword.  
                From beneath their broad-brimmed hats of palm-leaf,  
                gleamed eyes which, even in good nature and merriment, <!-- merri-ment -->

                morality of the age, rigid as we call it, that a  
                license was allowed the seafaring class, not merely  
                for their freaks on shore, but for far more desperate  
                deeds on their proper element. The sailor of that day  
                would go near to be arraigned as a pirate in our own.  
                There could be little doubt, for instance, that this very  
                ship's crew, though no unfavorable specimens of the  
                nautical brotherhood, had been guilty, as we should

                <p>But the sea, in those old times, heaved, swelled, and  
                foamed very much at its own will, or subject only to  
                the tempestuous wind, with hardly any attempts at regulation <!-- reg-ulation -->
                by human law. The buccaneer on the wave  
                might relinquish his calling, and become at once, if he

                as a personage with whom it was disreputable to traffic,

                <p>After parting from the physician, the commander of  
                the Bristol ship strolled idly through the market-place;  
                until, happening to approach the spot where Hester  
                Prynne was standing, he appeared to recognize, and did  
                not hesitate to address her. As was usually the case  
                wherever Hester stood, a small, vacant area—a sort  
                of magic circle—had formed itself about her, into  
                which, though the people were elbowing one another  
                at a little distance, none ventured, or felt disposed to  
                intrude. It was a forcible type of the moral solitude  
                in which the scarlet letter enveloped its fated wearer;  
                partly by her own reserve, and partly by the instinctive, <!-- instinc-tive -->
                though no longer so unkindly, withdrawal of her  
                fellow-creatures. Now, if never before, it answered a  
                good purpose, by enabling Hester and the seaman to  
                speak together without risk of being overheard; and  
                so changed was Hester Prynne's repute before the  
                public, that the matron in town most eminent for rigid  
                morality could not have held such intercourse with less  
                result of scandal than herself.</p>
                
                <p>“So, mistress,” said the mariner, “I must bid the

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">Before</hi> Hester Prynne could call together her  
                thoughts, and consider what was practicable to be  
                done in this new and startling aspect of affairs, the  
                sound of military music was heard approaching along  
                a contiguous street. It denoted the advance of the  
                procession of magistrates and citizens, on its way towards <!-- to-wards -->
                the meeting-house; where, in compliance with a  
                custom thus early established, and ever since observed,  
                the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale was to deliver an Election <!-- Elec-tion -->

                <p>Soon the head of the procession showed itself, with  
                a slow and stately march, turning a corner, and making  
                its way across the market-place. First came the  
                music. It comprised a variety of instruments, perhaps  
                imperfectly adapted to one another, and played with no  
                great skill, but yet attaining the great object for which

                swells of sound. But she was brought back to her  
                former mood by the shimmer of the sunshine on the  
                weapons and bright armour of the military company,  
                which followed after the music, and formed the honorary <!-- honor-ary -->
                escort of the procession. This body of soldiery—  
                which still sustains a corporate existence, and marches  
                down from past ages with an ancient and honorable  
                fame—was composed of no mercenary materials. Its  
                ranks were filled with gentlemen, who felt the stirrings  
                of martial impulse, and sought to establish a kind of  
                College of Arms, where, as in an association of Knights  
                Templars, they might learn the science, and, so far as  
                peaceful exercise would teach them, the practices of  
                war. The high estimation then placed upon the military <!-- mili-tary -->
                character might be seen in the lofty port of each  
                individual member of the company. Some of them,  
                indeed, by their services in the Low Countries and on  
                other fields of European warfare, had fairly won their  
                title to assume the name and pomp of soldiership.

                <pb n="290"/>
                produce stability and dignity of character a great deal  
                more. The people possessed, by hereditary right, the  
                quality of reverence; which, in their descendants, if it  
                survive at all, exists in smaller proportion, and with a  
                vastly diminished force in the selection and estimate of  
                public men. The change may be for good or ill, and  
                is partly, perhaps, for both. In that old day, the English <!-- Eng-lish -->
                settler on these rude shores,—having left king,  
                nobles, and all degrees of awful rank behind, while  
                still the faculty and necessity of reverence were strong  
                in him,—bestowed it on the white hair and venerable  
                brow of age; on long-tried integrity; on solid wisdom  
                and sad-colored experience; on endowments of that  
                grave and weighty order, which gives the idea of permanence, <!-- per-manence -->
                and comes under the general definition of  
                respectability. These primitive statesmen, therefore,  
                —Bradstreet, Endicott, Dudley, Bellingham, and their  
                compeers,—who were elevated to power by the early

                </note> distinguished divine, from whose lips the  
                religious discourse of the anniversary was expected.  
                His was the profession, at that era, in which intellectual  
                ability displayed itself far more than in political life;  
                for—leaving a higher motive out of the question—it  
                offered inducements powerful enough, in the almost  
                worshipping respect of the community, to win the most  
                aspiring ambition into its service. Even political power  
                —as in the case of Increase Mather—was within the  
                grasp of a successful priest.</p>
                
                <p>It was the observation of those who beheld him now,  
                that never, since Mr. Dimmesdale first set his foot on  
                the New England shore, had he exhibited such energy  
                as was seen in the gait and air with which he kept his  
                pace in the procession. There was no feebleness of  
                step, as at other times; his frame was not bent; nor  
                did his hand rest ominously upon his heart. Yet, if the  
                clergyman were rightly viewed, his strength seemed  
                not of the body. It might be spiritual, and imparted  
                to him by angelic ministrations. It might be the exhilaration <!-- ex-hilaration -->
                of that potent cordial, which is distilled only  
                in the furnace-glow of earnest and long-continued  
                thought. Or, perchance, his sensitive temperament  
                was invigorated by the loud and piercing music, that  
                swelled heavenward, and uplifted him on its ascending  
                wave. Nevertheless, so abstracted was his look, it  
                might be questioned whether Mr. Dimmesdale even  
                heard the music. There was his body, moving onward, <!-- on-ward -->
                and with an unaccustomed force. But where  
                was his mind? Far and deep in its own region, busying <!-- busy-ing -->
                <pb n="292"/>
                itself, with <ref corresp="preternatural" target="_preternatural">preternatural</ref> activity, to marshal a procession <!-- pro-cession -->
                of stately thoughts that were soon to issue  
                thence; and so he saw nothing, heard nothing, knew  
                nothing, of what was around him; but the spiritual element <!-- ele-ment -->
                took up the feeble frame, and carried it along,  
                unconscious of the burden, and converting it to spirit  
                like itself. Men of uncommon intellect, who have  
                grown morbid, possess this occasional power of mighty  
                effort, into which they throw the life of many days,  
                and then are lifeless for as many more.</p>
                
                <p>Hester Prynne, gazing steadfastly at the clergyman,  
                felt a dreary influence come over her, but wherefore or  
                whence she knew not; unless that he seemed so remote  
                from her own sphere, and utterly beyond her reach.  
                One glance of recognition, she had imagined, must needs  
                pass between them. She thought of the dim forest,  
                with its little dell of solitude, and love, and anguish, and  
                the mossy tree-trunk, where, sitting hand in hand, they  
                had mingled their sad and passionate talk with the  
                melancholy murmur of the brook. How deeply had  
                they known each other then! And was this the man?  
                She hardly knew him now! He, moving proudly past,  
                enveloped, as it were, in the rich music, with the procession <!-- pro=cession -->
                of majestic and venerable fathers; he, so unattainable <!-- unat-tainable -->
                in his worldly position, and still more so in that  
                far <ref target="_vista" corresp="vista">vista</ref> of his unsympathizing thoughts, through which  
                she now beheld him! Her spirit sank with the idea  
                that all must have been a delusion, and that, vividly as  
                she had dreamed it, there could be no real bond <ref corresp="betwixt" target="_betwixt">betwixt</ref> <!-- be-twixt -->
                the clergyman and herself. And thus much of  
                woman was there in Hester, that she could scarcely  
                <pb n="293"/>
                forgive him,—least of all now, when the heavy footstep <!-- foot-step -->
                of their approaching Fate might be heard, nearer,  
                nearer, nearer!—for being able so completely to withdraw <!-- with-draw -->
                himself from their mutual world; while she  
                groped darkly, and stretched forth her cold hands, and  
                found him not.</p>
                
                <p>Pearl either saw and responded to her mother's feelings, <!-- feelings -->
                or herself felt the remoteness and intangibility  
                that had fallen around the minister. While the procession <!-- pro-cession -->
                passed, the child was uneasy, fluttering up and  
                down, like a bird on the point of taking flight. When  
                the whole had gone by, she looked up into Hester's  
                face.</p>
                
                <p>“Mother,” said she, “was that the same minister  
                that kissed me by the brook?”</p>
                
                <p>“Hold thy peace, dear little Pearl!” whispered her  
                mother. “We must not always talk in the marketplace <!-- market-place -->
                of what happens to us in the forest.”</p>
                
                <p>“I could not be sure it was he; so strange he  
                looked,” continued the child. “Else I would have run  
                to him, and bid him kiss me now, before all the people;  
                even as he did yonder among the dark old trees. What  
                would the minister have said, mother? Would he  
                have clapped his hand over his heart, and scowled on  
                me, and bid me begone?”</p>
                
                <p>“What should he say, Pearl,” answered Hester,  
                “save that it was no time to kiss, and that kisses are  
                not to be given in the market-place? Well for thee,  
                foolish child, that thou didst not speak to him!”</p>

                and a gold-headed cane, had come forth to see  
                the procession. As this ancient lady had the renown  
                (which subsequently cost her no less a price than her  
                life) of being a principal actor in all the works of necromancy <!-- nec-romancy -->
                that were continually going forward, the  
                crowd gave way before her, and seemed to fear the  
                touch of her garment, as if it carried the plague among  
                its gorgeous folds. Seen in conjunction with Hester  
                Prynne,—kindly as so many now felt towards the  
                latter,—the dread inspired by Mistress Hibbins was  
                doubled, and caused a general movement from that  
                part of the market-place in which the two women stood.</p>
                
                <p>“Now, what mortal imagination could conceive it!”  
                whispered the old lady confidentially to Hester. “Yonder <!-- Yon-der -->

                would think how little while it is since he went  
                forth out of his study,—chewing a Hebrew text of  
                Scripture in his mouth, I warrant,—to take an <ref corresp="airing" target="_airing">airing</ref>

                him the same man. Many a church-member saw  
                I, walking behind the music, that has danced in the  
                same measure with me, when Somebody was fiddler,

                changing hands with us! That is but a trifle, when a  
                woman knows the world. But this minister! Couldst  
                thou surely tell, Hester, whether he was the same man  
                that encountered thee on the forest-path!”</p>
                
                <p>“Madam, I know not of what you speak,” answered  
                Hester Prynne, feeling Mistress Hibbins to be of infirm  
                mind; yet strangely startled and awe-stricken by the  
                confidence with which she affirmed a personal connection <!-- connec-tion -->

                finger at Hester. “Dost thou think I have been to the

                who else has been there? Yea; though no leaf of the

                left in their hair! I know thee, Hester; for I behold  
                the token. We may all see it in the sunshine; and it  
                glows like a red flame in the dark. Thou wearest it  
                openly; so there need be no question about that. But  
                this minister! Let me tell thee in thine ear! When  
                the Black Man sees one of his own servants, signed  
                and sealed, so shy of owning to the bond as is the  
                Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, he hath a way of ordering  
                matters so that the mark shall be disclosed in open daylight <!-- day-light -->

                <p>“What is it, good Mistress Hibbins?” eagerly  
                asked little Pearl. “Hast thou seen it?”</p>

                <p>“No matter, darling!” responded Mistress Hibbins,  
                making Pearl a profound reverence. “Thou thyself

                <p>Laughing so shrilly that all the market-place could  
                hear her, the weird old gentlewoman took her departure.</p> <!-- depart-ure -->
                
                <p>By this time the preliminary prayer had been offered  
                in the meeting-house, and the accents of the Reverend  
                Mr. Dimmesdale were heard commencing his discourse. <!-- dis-course -->
                An irresistible feeling kept Hester near the  
                spot. As the sacred edifice was too much thronged to  
                admit another auditor, she took up her position close  
                beside the scaffold of the pillory. It was in sufficient  
                proximity to bring the whole sermon to her ears, in the  
                shape of an indistinct, but varied, murmur and flow of  
                the minister's very peculiar voice.</p>
                
                <p>This vocal organ was in itself a rich endowment;  
                insomuch that a listener, comprehending nothing of the  
                language in which the preacher spoke, might still have  
                been swayed to and fro by the mere tone and <ref target="_cadence" corresp="cadence">cadence.</ref>

                Like all other music, it breathed passion and <ref corresp="pathos" target="_pathos">pathos,</ref>

                and emotions high or tender, in a tongue native to the  
                human heart, wherever educated. Muffled as the  
                sound was by its passage through the church-walls,  
                Hester Prynne listened with such intentness, and sympathized <!-- sym-pathized -->
                so intimately, that the sermon had throughout  
                a meaning for her, entirely apart from its indistinguishable <!-- indistinguish-able -->
                <pb n="297"/>
                words. These, perhaps, if more distinctly heard,  
                might have been only a grosser medium, and have  
                clogged the spiritual sense. Now she caught the low  
                undertone, as of the wind sinking down to repose  
                itself; then ascended with it, as it rose through progressive <!-- progres-sive -->
                gradations of sweetness and power, until its volume  
                seemed to envelop her with an atmosphere of awe and  
                solemn grandeur. And yet, majestic as the voice  
                sometimes became, there was for ever in it an essential  
                character of <ref target="_plaintiveness" corresp="plaintiveness">plaintiveness.</ref>

                of suffering humanity, that touched a sensibility  
                in every bosom! At times this deep strain of pathos  
                was all that could be heard, and scarcely heard, sighing  
                amid a desolate silence. But even when the minister's <!-- minis-ter's -->
                voice grew high and commanding,—when it  
                gushed irrepressibly upward,—when it assumed its  
                utmost breadth and power, so overfilling the church as  
                to burst its way through the solid walls, and diffuse  
                itself in the open air,—still, if the auditor listened intently, <!-- in-tently -->
                and for the purpose, he could detect the same  
                cry of pain. What was it? The complaint of a  
                human heart, sorrow-laden, perchance guilty, telling  
                its secret, whether of guilt or sorrow, to the great heart  
                of mankind; beseeching its sympathy or forgiveness,  
                —at every moment,—in each accent,—and never in  
                vain! It was this profound and continual undertone  
                that gave the clergyman his most appropriate power.</p>
                
                <p>During all this time Hester stood, statue-like, at the  
                foot of the scaffold. If the minister's voice had not  
                kept her there, there would nevertheless have been an  
                <pb n="298"/>
                inevitable magnetism in that spot, whence she dated the  
                first hour of her life of <ref corresp="ignominy" target="_ignominy">ignominy.</ref> There was a sense  
                within her,—too ill-defined to be made a thought, but  
                weighing heavily on her mind,—that her whole orb of  
                life, both before and after, was connected with this  
                spot, as with the one point that gave it unity.</p>
                
                <p>Little Pearl, meanwhile, had quitted her mother's  
                side, and was playing at her own will about the market-place. <!-- market-place -->
                She made the sombre crowd cheerful by her  
                erratic and glistening ray; even as a bird of bright  
                plumage illuminates a whole tree of dusky foliage by  
                darting to and fro, half seen and half concealed, amid  
                the twilight of the clustering leaves. She had an <ref corresp="undulating" target="_undulating">undulating,</ref>

                shone through her little figure, and sparkled with its  
                activity. She ran and looked the wild Indian in the  
                face; and he grew conscious of a nature wilder than  
                his own. Thence, with native audacity, but still with a  
                reserve as characteristic, she flew into the midst of a

                group of mariners, the swarthy-cheeked wild men of  
                the ocean, as the Indians were of the land; and they  
                gazed wonderingly and admiringly at Pearl, as if a  
                flake of the sea-foam had taken the shape of a little

                hands upon her, with purpose to snatch a kiss. Finding <!-- Find-ing -->
                it as impossible to touch her as to catch a humming-bird <!-- hum-ming-bird -->

                faces into the ring. Even the Indians

                their snake-like black eyes on Hester's bosom;  
                conceiving, perhaps, that the wearer of this brilliantly

                embroidered badge must needs be a personage of high  
                dignity among her people. Lastly, the inhabitants

                all the rest, with their cool, well-acquainted gaze at her  
                familiar shame. Hester saw and recognized the self-same <!-- self-same -->

                made. At the final hour, when she was so soon to  
                fling aside the burning letter, it had strangely become  
                the centre of more remark and excitement, and was  
                thus made to sear her breast more painfully than at

                whose very inmost spirits had yielded to his control.

                was a momentary silence, profound as what should  
                follow the utterance of oracles. Then ensued a murmur <!-- mur-mur -->
                and half-hushed tumult; as if the auditors, released <!-- re-leased -->
                from the high spell that had transported them  
                into the region of another's mind, were returning into  
                themselves, with all their awe and wonder still heavy  
                on them. In a moment more, the crowd began to  
                gush forth from the doors of the church. Now that  
                there was an end, they needed other breath, more fit  
                to support the gross and earthly life into which they  
                relapsed, than that atmosphere which the preacher had  
                converted into words of flame, and had burdened with  
                the rich fragrance of his thought.</p>
                
                <p>In the open air their rapture broke into speech.  
                The street and the market-place absolutely babbled,  
                from side to side, with applauses of the minister. His  
                hearers could not rest until they had told one another  
                of what each knew better than he could tell or hear.  
                According to their united testimony, never had man  
                spoken in so wise, so high, and so holy a spirit, as he  
                <pb n="303"/>
                that spake this day; nor had inspiration ever breathed  
                through mortal lips more evidently than it did through  
                his. Its influence could be seen, as it were, descending <!-- descend-ing -->
                upon him, and possessing him, and continually  
                lifting him out of the written discourse that lay before  
                him, and filling him with ideas that must have been  
                as marvellous to himself as to his audience. His subject, <!-- sub-ject -->
                it appeared, had been the relation between the  
                Deity and the communities of mankind, with a special  
                reference to the New England which they were here  
                planting in the wilderness. And, as he drew towards  
                the close, a spirit as of prophecy had come upon him,  
                constraining him to its purpose as mightily as the old  
                prophets of Israel were constrained; only with this  
                difference, that, whereas the Jewish seers had denounced <!-- de-nounced -->
                judgments and ruin on their country, it was  
                his mission to foretell a high and glorious destiny for  
                the newly gathered people of the Lord. But, throughout <!-- through-out -->
                it all, and through the whole discourse, there had  
                been a certain deep, sad undertone of pathos, which  
                could not be interpreted otherwise than as the natural  
                regret of one soon to pass away. Yes; their minister  
                whom they so loved—and who so loved them all,  
                that he could not depart heavenward without a sigh— 
                had the foreboding of untimely death upon him, and  
                would soon leave them in their tears! This idea of his  
                <ref corresp="transitory" target="_transitory">transitory</ref> stay on earth gave the last emphasis to the  
                effect which the preacher had produced; it was as if  
                an angel, in his passage to the skies, had shaken his  
                bright wings over the people for an instant,—at once  
                a shadow and a splendor,—and had shed down a  
                shower of golden truths upon them.</p>

                earliest days, when the professional character  
                was of itself a lofty pedestal. Such was the position  
                which the minister occupied, as he bowed his head  
                forward on the cushions of the pulpit, at the close of  
                his Election Sermon. Meanwhile, Hester Prynne was  
                standing beside the scaffold of the pillory, with the  
                scarlet letter still burning on her breast!</p>
                
                <p>Now was heard again the <ref target="_clangor" corresp="clangor">clangor</ref>

                Loud resonant sound like from a trumpet or large bell. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> of the music, and  
                the measured tramp of the military escort, issuing from  
                the church-door. The procession was to be marshalled  
                thence to the town-hall, where a solemn banquet would  
                complete the ceremonies of the day.</p>
                
                <p>Once more, therefore, the train of venerable and  
                majestic fathers was seen moving through a broad  
                pathway of the people, who drew back reverently,  
                on either side, as the Governor and magistrates, the  
                old and wise men, the holy ministers, and all that  
                were eminent and renowned, advanced into the midst  
                of them. When they were fairly in the market-place,  
                their presence was greeted by a shout. This—though  
                doubtless it might acquire additional force and volume  
                from the childlike loyalty which the age awarded to  
                <pb n="305"/>
                its rulers—was felt to be an irrepressible outburst  
                of the enthusiasm kindled in the auditors by that  
                high strain of eloquence which was yet reverberating  
                in their ears. Each felt the impulse in himself, and,  
                in the same breath, caught it from his neighbour.  
                Within the church, it had hardly been kept down; beneath <!-- be-neath -->
                the sky, it pealed upward to the <ref corresp="zenith" target="_zenith">zenith.</ref> There  
                were human beings enough, and enough of highly  
                wrought and symphonious feeling, to produce that  
                more impressive sound than the organ-tones of the blast,  
                or the thunder, or the roar of the sea; even that  
                mighty swell of many voices, blended into one great  
                voice by the universal impulse which makes likewise  
                one vast heart out of the many. Never, from the soil  
                of New England, had gone up such a shout! Never,  
                on New England soil, had stood the man so honored

                the minister was seen to approach among them. The  
                shout died into a murmur, as one portion of the crowd  
                after another obtained a glimpse of him. How feeble  
                and pale he looked amid all his triumph! The energy  
                —or say, rather, the inspiration which had held him  
                up, until he should have delivered the sacred message  
                that brought its own strength along with it from heaven

                —was withdrawn, now that it had so faithfully performed <!-- per-formed -->
                its office. The glow, which they had just before  
                beheld burning on his cheek, was extinguished, like a  
                flame that sinks down hopelessly among the late-decaying <!-- late-decay-ing -->
                embers. It seemed hardly the face of a man  
                alive, with such a deathlike hue; it was hardly a man

                <p>One of his clerical brethren,—it was the venerable  
                John Wilson,—observing the state in which Mr. Dimmesdale <!-- Dim-mesdale -->
                was left by the retiring wave of intellect and  
                sensibility, stepped forward hastily to offer his support.  
                The minister tremulously, but decidedly, repelled the old  
                man's arm. He still walked onward, if that movement  
                could be so described, which rather resembled the wavering <!-- wa-vering -->
                effort of an infant, with its mother's arms in view,  
                outstretched to tempt him forward. And now, almost  
                imperceptible as were the latter steps of his progress, he  
                had come opposite the well-remembered and weather-darkened <!-- weather-darkened -->
                scaffold, where, long since, with all that  
                dreary lapse of time between, Hester Prynne had encountered <!-- en-countered -->
                the world's <ref target="_ignominious" corresp="ignominious">ignominious</ref> stare. There stood  
                Hester, holding little Pearl by the hand! And there  
                was the scarlet letter on her breast! The minister  
                here made a pause; although the music still played  
                the stately and rejoicing march to which the procession  
                moved. It summoned him onward,—onward to the  
                festival!—but here he made a pause.</p>
                
                <p>Bellingham, for the last few moments, had kept an  
                anxious eye upon him. He now left his own place in  
                the procession, and advanced to give assistance; judging <!-- judg-ing -->
                <pb n="307"/>
                from Mr. Dimmesdale's aspect that he must otherwise <!-- other-wise -->
                inevitably fall. But there was something in the  
                latter's expression that warned back the magistrate,  
                although a man not readily obeying the vague intimations <!-- intima-tions -->
                that pass from one spirit to another. The crowd,  
                meanwhile, looked on with awe and wonder. This  
                earthly faintness was, in their view, only another phase  
                of the minister's celestial strength; nor would it have  
                seemed a miracle too high to be wrought for one so

                <p>He turned towards the scaffold, and stretched forth  
                his arms.</p>
                
                <p>“Hester,” said he, “come hither! Come, my little

                <p>It was a ghastly look with which he regarded them;  
                but there was something at once tender and strangely  
                triumphant in it. The child, with the bird-like motion  
                which was one of her characteristics, flew to him, and  
                clasped her arms about his knees. Hester Prynne—  
                slowly, as if impelled by inevitable fate, and against  
                her strongest will—likewise drew near, but paused before <!-- be-fore -->

                the old man rushed forward and caught the minister

                <p>“Madman, hold! What is your purpose?” whispered <!-- whis-pered -->

                he. “Wave back that woman! Cast off this

                and perish in dishonor! I can yet save you! Would

                <p>“Ha, tempter! Methinks thou art too late!” answered <!-- an-swered -->
                the minister, encountering his eye, fearfully,  
                but firmly. “Thy power is not what it was! With  
                God's help, I shall escape thee now!”</p>

                <p>The crowd was in a tumult. The men of rank and  
                dignity, who stood more immediately around the clergyman, <!-- clergy-man -->
                were so taken by surprise, and so perplexed as to  
                the purport of what they saw,—unable to receive the  
                explanation which most readily presented itself, or to  
                imagine any other,—that they remained silent and inactive <!-- in-active -->
                spectators of the judgment which Providence  
                seemed about to work. They beheld the minister,  
                leaning on Hester's shoulder and supported by her arm  
                around him, approach the scaffold, and ascend its  
                <pb n="309"/>
                steps; while still the little hand of the sin-born child  
                was clasped in his. Old Roger Chillingworth followed,  
                as one intimately connected with the drama of guilt and  
                sorrow in which they had all been actors, and well  
                entitled, therefore, to be present at its closing scene.</p>
                
                <p>“Hadst thou sought the whole earth over,” said he,  
                looking darkly at the clergyman, “there was no one  
                place so secret,—no high place nor lowly place, where  
                thou couldst have escaped me,—save on this very  
                scaffold!”</p>
                
                <p>“Thanks be to Him who hath led me hither!” answered <!-- an-swered -->
                the minister.</p>
                
                <p>Yet he trembled, and turned to Hester with an expression <!-- ex=pression -->
                of doubt and anxiety in his eyes, not the less  
                evidently betrayed, that there was a feeble smile upon  
                his lips.</p>
                
                <p>“Is not this better,” murmured he, “than what we  
                dreamed of in the forest?”</p>
                
                <p>“I know not! I know not!” she hurriedly replied.  
                “Better? Yea; so we may both die, and little Pearl  
                die with us!”</p>
                
                <p>“For thee and Pearl, be it as God shall order,” said  
                the minister; “and God is merciful! Let me now do  
                the will which he hath made plain before my sight.  
                For, Hester, I am a dying man. So let me make haste  
                to take my shame upon me.”</p>
                
                <p>Partly supported by Hester Prynne, and holding one  
                hand of little Pearl's, the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale  
                turned to the dignified and venerable rulers; to the holy  
                ministers, who were his brethren; to the people, whose  
                great heart was thoroughly appalled, yet overflowing  
                <pb n="310"/>
                with tearful sympathy, as knowing that some deep life-matter--which, <!-- life-matter -->
                if full of sin, was full of anguish and  
                repentance likewise—was now to be laid open to  
                them. The sun, but little <ref target="_meridian" corresp="meridian">past its meridian,</ref> shone  
                down upon the clergyman, and gave a distinctness to  
                his figure, as he stood out from all the earth to put in  
                his plea of guilty at the bar of Eternal Justice.</p>
                
                <p>“People of New England!” cried he, with a voice  
                that rose over them, high, solemn, and majestic,—yet  
                had always a tremor through it, and sometimes a shriek,  
                struggling up out of a fathomless depth of remorse and  
                woe,—“ye, that have loved me!—ye, that have

                the world! At last!—at last!—I stand upon the  
                spot where, seven years since, I should have stood;

                wears! Ye have all shuddered at it! Wherever her

                <p>It seemed, at this point, as if the minister must leave  
                the remainder of his secret undisclosed. But he fought  
                back the bodily weakness,—and, still more, the faintness <!-- faint-ness -->

                <p>“It was on him!” he continued, with a kind of

                he stands up before you! He bids you look again at  
                Hester's scarlet letter! He tells you, that, with all its  
                mysterious horror, it is but the shadow of what he bears  
                on his own breast, and that even this, his own red

                Then, down he sank upon the scaffold! Hester partly  
                raised him, and supported his head against her bosom.  
                Old Roger Chillingworth knelt down beside him, with  
                a blank, dull countenance, out of which the life seemed  
                to have departed.</p>
                
                <p>“Thou hast escaped me!” he repeated more than  
                once. “Thou hast escaped me!”</p>
                <pb n="312"/>
                <p>“May God forgive thee!” said the minister. “Thou,

                <p>He withdrew his dying eyes from the old man, and  
                fixed them on the woman and the child.</p>
                
                <p>“My little Pearl,” said he feebly,—and there was  
                a sweet and gentle smile over his face, as of a spirit  
                sinking into deep repose; nay, now that the burden  
                was removed, it seemed almost as if he would be <ref target="_sportive" corresp="sportive">sportive</ref> <!-- sport-ive -->
                with the child,—“dear little Pearl, wilt thou kiss

                But now thou wilt?”</p>
                
                <p>Pearl kissed his lips. A spell was broken. The  
                great scene of grief, in which the wild infant bore a  
                part, had developed all her sympathies; and as her  
                tears fell upon her father's cheek, they were the pledge  
                that she would grow up amid human joy and sorrow,  
                nor for ever do battle with the world, but be a woman  
                in it. Towards her mother, too, Pearl's errand as a  
                messenger of anguish was all fulfilled.</p>
                
                <p>“Hester,” said the clergyman, “farewell!”</p>
                
                <p>“Shall we not meet again?” whispered she, bending <!-- bend-ing -->
                her face down close to his. “Shall we not spend  
                our immortal life together? Surely, surely, we have  
                ransomed one another, with all this woe! Thou

                By sending yonder dark and terrible old man, to keep

                could not as yet find utterance, save in this murmur

                have been conjectural. Some affirmed that the  
                Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, on the very day when  
                Hester Prynne first wore her ignominious badge, had

                so many futile methods, followed out,—by inflicting a

                stigma had not been produced until a long time subsequent, <!-- subse-quent -->
                when old Roger Chillingworth, being a potent  
                necromancer, had caused it to appear, through the  
                agency of magic and poisonous drugs. Others, again,  
                —and those best able to appreciate the minister's  
                peculiar sensibility, and the wonderful operation of his  
                spirit upon the body,—whispered their belief, that the

                remorse, gnawing from the inmost heart outwardly,  
                and at last manifesting Heaven's dreadful judgment by

                Mr. Dimmesdale, denied that there was any mark  
                whatever on his breast, more than on a new-born  
                infant's. Neither, by their report, had his dying words  
                acknowledged, nor even remotely implied, any, the  
                slightest connection, on his part, with the guilt for  
                which Hester Prynne had so long worn the scarlet  
                letter. According to these highly respectable witnesses,  
                the minister, conscious that he was dying,—conscious,  
                also, that the reverence of the multitude placed him  
                already among saints and angels,—had desired, by  
                yielding up his breath in the arms of that fallen woman,  
                to express to the world how utterly <ref target="_nugatory" corresp="nugatory">nugatory</ref>

                to impress on his admirers the mighty and mournful

                all alike. It was to teach them, that the holiest

                to discern more clearly the Mercy which looks down,

                and repudiate more utterly the phantom of human  
                merit, which would look aspiringly upward. Without  
                disputing a truth so momentous, we must be allowed to  
                consider this version of Mr. Dimmesdale's story as  
                only an instance of that stubborn fidelity with which a  
                man's friends—and especially a clergyman's—will  
                sometimes uphold his character; when proofs, clear as  
                the mid-day sunshine on the scarlet letter, establish  
                him a false and sin-stained creature of the dust.</p>
                
                <p>The authority which we have chiefly followed—a  
                manuscript of old date, drawn up from the verbal testimony <!-- testi-mony -->
                of individuals, some of whom had known Hester  
                Prynne, while others had heard the tale from contemporary <!-- contem-porary -->
                witnesses—fully confirms the view taken in  
                the foregoing pages. Among many morals which  
                press upon us from the poor minister's miserable experience, <!-- ex-perience -->
                we put only this into a sentence:—“Be  
                true! Be true! Be true! Show freely to the world,  
                if not your worst, yet some trait whereby the worst

                <p>Nothing was more remarkable than the change which  
                took place, almost immediately after Mr. Dimmesdale's  
                death, in the appearance and demeanour of the old man  
                known as Roger Chillingworth. All his strength and  
                energy—all his vital and intellectual force—seemed  
                at once to desert him; insomuch that he positively  
                withered up, shrivelled away, and almost vanished from  
                mortal sight, like an uprooted weed that lies wilting in  
                the sun. This unhappy man had made the very principle <!-- prin-ciple -->

                <p>Leaving this discussion apart, we have a matter of  
                business to communicate to the reader. At old Roger  
                Chillingworth's decease (which took place within the  
                year), and by his last will and testament, of which  
                Governor Bellingham and the Reverend Mr. Wilson  
                were executors, he bequeathed a very considerable  
                <pb n="318"/>
                amount of property, both here and in England, to little  
                Pearl, the daughter of Hester Prynne.</p>
                
                <p>So Pearl—the elf-child,—the demon offspring, as  
                some people, up to that <ref corresp="epoch" target="_epoch">epoch,</ref> persisted in considering  
                her—became the richest heiress of her day, in the New  
                World. Not improbably, this circumstance wrought  
                a very material change in the public estimation; and,  
                had the mother and child remained here, little Pearl, at  
                a marriageable period of life, might have mingled her  
                wild blood with the lineage of the devoutest Puritan  
                among them all. But, in no long time after the physician's <!-- physi-cian's -->
                death, the wearer of the scarlet letter disappeared, <!-- disap-peared -->
                and Pearl along with her. For many years,  
                though a vague report would now and then find its way  
                across the sea,—like a shapeless piece of driftwood <ref target="_tost" corresp="tost">tost</ref>

                ashore, with the initials of a name upon it,—yet no  
                tidings of them unquestionably authentic were received. <!-- received -->
                The story of the scarlet letter grew into a  
                legend. Its spell, however, was still potent, and kept  
                the scaffold awful where the poor minister had died,  
                and likewise the cottage by the sea-shore, where Hester  
                Prynne had dwelt. Near this latter spot, one afternoon, <!-- after-noon -->
                some children were at play, when they beheld a  
                tall woman, in a gray robe, approach the cottage-door.  
                In all those years it had never once been opened; but  
                either she unlocked it, or the decaying wood and iron  
                yielded to her hand, or she glided shadow-like through  
                these impediments,—and, at all events, went in.</p>
                
                <p>On the threshold she paused,—turned partly round,  
                —for, perchance, the idea of entering, all alone, and  
                <pb n="319"/>
                all so changed, the home of so intense a former life,  
                was more dreary and desolate than even she could  
                bear. But her hesitation was only for an instant,  
                though long enough to display a scarlet letter on her  
                breast.</p>
                
                <p>And Hester Prynne had returned, and taken up her  
                long-forsaken shame. But where was little Pearl? If  
                still alive, she must now have been in the flush and  
                bloom of early womanhood. None knew—nor ever  
                learned, with the fulness of perfect certainty—whether  
                the elf-child had gone thus untimely to a maiden grave;  
                or whether her wild, rich nature had been softened and  
                subdued, and made capable of a woman's gentle happiness. <!-- hap-piness -->
                But, through the remainder of Hester's life,  
                there were indications that the recluse of the scarlet  
                letter was the object of love and interest with some inhabitant <!-- in-habitant -->
                of another land. Letters came, with <ref corresp="armorial" target="_armorial">armorial</ref>

                Surveyor Pue, who made investigations a century later,  
                believed,—and one of his recent successors in office,  
                moreover, faithfully believes,—that Pearl was not only  
                alive, but married, and happy, and mindful of her

                <p>But there was a more real life for Hester Prynne,  
                here, in New England, than in that unknown region  
                where Pearl had found a home. Here had been her  
                sin; here, her sorrow; and here was yet to be her penitence. <!-- pen-itence -->
                She had returned, therefore, and resumed,—

                </note> thoughtful, and self-devoted  
                years that made up Hester's life, the scarlet letter  
                ceased to be a stigma which attracted the world's scorn  
                and bitterness, and became a type of something to be  
                sorrowed over, and looked upon with awe, yet with  
                reverence too. And, as Hester Prynne had no selfish

                and enjoyment, people brought all their sorrows and
                perplexities, and <ref corresp="besought" target="_besought">besought</ref> her counsel, as one who

                Hester's cottage, demanding why they were so wretched, <!-- wretch-ed -->

                and what the remedy! Hester comforted and
                counselled them, as best she might. She assured them,
                too, of her firm belief, that, at some brighter period,
                when the world should have grown ripe for it, in Heaven's <!-- Heav-en's -->
                own time, a new truth would be revealed, in order

                life, Hester had vainly imagined that she herself might
                be the destined prophetess, but had long since recognized <!-- recog-nized -->
                the impossibility that any mission of divine and
                mysterious truth should be confided to a woman stained
                with sin, bowed down with shame, or even burdened
                with a life-long sorrow. The angel and apostle of
                the coming revelation must be a woman, indeed, but
                lofty, pure, and beautiful; and wise, moreover, not
                through dusky grief, but the ethereal medium of joy;
                and showing how sacred love should make us happy,
                by the truest test of a life successful to such an end!</p>
                
                <p>So said Hester Prynne, and glanced her sad eyes
                downward at the scarlet letter. And, after many,
                many years, a new grave was delved, near an old and
                sunken one, in that burial-ground beside which King's
                Chapel has since been built. It was near that old and
                sunken grave, yet with a space between, as if the dust
                of the two sleepers had no right to mingle. Yet
                one tombstone served for both. All around, there

                gloomier than the shadow:—
                “<hi rend="small-caps">On a field, <ref target="_sable" corresp="sable">sable,</ref> the letter A, <ref corresp="gules" target="_gules">gules."</ref>

                </p>
                <p>THE END.</p>
