                                <p>Checked against the 1942 Heritage Press Edition. Charles Keller made the electronic text from "an uncopyrighted 1942 edition." This electronic text was posted to Wiretap in
                                    1993 as "pilgrim.txt." In April of 2000 Matthew Davis of the E-Text Center checked Keller's e-text against the apparent source, the
                                    1942 Heritage Press edition and converted html to sgml.  Copyrighted "special contents" of that edition have been omitted. Only
                                    Bunyan's text has been included. Source copy consulted: William &amp; Mary Library: PR3330.A2B5 1942</p>

                <l>WHEN AT THE FIRST I TOOK MY PEN IN HAND
                </l><l>Thus for to write, I did not understand
                </l><l>That I at all should make a little book
                </l><l>In such a mode; nay, I had undertook
                </l><l>To make another; which, when almost done,
                </l><l>Before I was aware, I this begun.</l>
                <l rend="indent">And thus it was: I, writing of the way
                </l><l>And race of saints, in this our gospel day,
                </l><l>Fell suddenly into an allegory
                </l><l>About their journey, and the way to glory,
                </l><l>In more than twenty things which I set down.
                </l><l>This done, I twenty more had in my crown;
                </l><l>And they again began to multiply,
                </l><l>Like sparks that from the coals of fire do fly.
                </l><l>Nay, then, thought I, if that you breed so fast,
                </l><l>I'll put you by yourselves, lest you at last
                </l><l>Should prove ad infinitum, and eat out
                </l><l>The book that I already am about.
                </l><l rend="indent">Well, so I did; but yet I did not think
                </l><l>To shew to all the world my pen and ink
                </l><l>In such a mode; I only thought to make
                </l><l>I knew not what; nor did I undertake</l>
                <l>Thereby to please my neighbour: no, not I;
                </l><l>I did it my own self to gratify.</l>
                <l rend="indent">Neither did I but vacant seasons spend
                </l><l>In this my scribble; nor did I intend
                </l><l>But to divert myself in doing this
                </l><l>From worser thoughts which make me do amiss.</l>
                <l rend="indent">Thus, I set pen to paper with delight,
                </l><l>And quickly had my thoughts in black and white.
                </l><l>For, having now my method by the end,
                </l><l>Still as I pulled, it came; and so I penned
                </l><l>It down: until it came at last to be,
                </l><l>For length and breadth, the bigness which you see.</l>
                <l rend="indent">Well, when I had thus put mine ends together,
                </l><l>I shewed them others, that I might see whether
                </l><l>They would condemn them, or them justify:
                </l><l>And some said, Let them live; some, Let them die;
                </l><l>Some said, JOHN, print it; others said, Not so;
                </l><l>Some said, It might do good; others said, No.</l>
                <l rend="indent">Now was I in a strait, and did not see
                </l><l>Which was the best thing to be done by me:
                </l><l>At last I thought, Since you are thus divided,
                </l><l>I print it will, and so the case decided.</l>
                <l rend="indent">For, thought I, some, I see, would have it done,
                </l><l>Though others in that channel do not run:
                </l><l>To prove, then, who advised for the best,
                </l><l>Thus I thought fit to put it to the test.</l>
                <l rend="indent">I further thought, if now I did deny
                </l><l>Those that would have it, thus to gratify.
                </l><l>I did not know but hinder them I might
                </l><l>Of that which would to them be great delight.</l>
                <l rend="indent">For those which were not for its coming forth,
                </l><l>I said to them, Offend you I am loath,</l>
                <l>Yet, since your brethren pleased with it be,
                </l><l>Forbear to judge till you do further see.</l>
                <l rend="indent">If that thou wilt not read, let it alone;
                </l><l>Some love the meat, some love to pick the bone.
                </l><l>Yea, that I might them better palliate,
                </l><l>I did too with them thus expostulate: -- </l>
                <l rend="indent">May I not write in such a style as this?
                </l><l>In such a method, too, and yet not miss
                </l><l>My end -- thy good? Why may it not be done?
                </l><l>Dark clouds bring waters, when the bright bring none.
                </l><l>Yea, dark or bright, if they their silver drops
                </l><l>Cause to descend, the earth, by yielding crops,
                </l><l>Gives praise to both, and carpeth not at either,
                </l><l>But treasures up the fruit they yield together;
                </l><l>Yea, so commixes both, that in her fruit
                </l><l>None can distinguish this from that: they suit
                </l><l>Her well when hungry; but, if she be full,
                </l><l>She spews out both, and makes their blessings null.</l>
                <l rend="indent">You see the ways the fisherman doth take
                </l><l>To catch the fish; what engines doth he make?
                </l><l>Behold how he engageth all his wits;
                </l><l>Also his snares, lines, angles, hooks, and nets;
                </l><l>Yet fish there be, that neither hook, nor line,
                </l><l>Nor snare, nor net, nor engine can make thine:
                </l><l>They must be groped for, and be tickled too,
                </l><l>Or they will not be catch'd, whate'er you do.</l>
                <l rend="indent">How does the fowler seek to catch his game
                </l><l>By divers means! all which one cannot name:
                </l><l>His guns, his nets, his lime-twigs, light, and bell:
                </l><l>He creeps, he goes, he stands; yea, who can tell
                </l><l>Of all his postures? Yet there's none of these

                <l>Yea, he must pipe and whistle to catch this,

                <l rend="indent">If that a pearl may in a toad's head dwell,

                </l><l>If things that promise nothing do contain
                </l><l>What better is than gold; who will disdain,
                </l><l>That have an inkling of it, there to look,
                </l><l>That they may find it? Now, my little book,
                </l><l>(Though void of all these paintings that may make
                </l><l>It with this or the other man to take,)
                </l><l>Is not without those things that do excel
                </l><l>What do in brave but empty notions dwell.</l>
                <l rend="indent">'Well, yet I am not fully satisfied,
                </l><l>That this your book will stand, when soundly tried.'</l>
                <l rend="indent">Why, what's the matter? 'It is dark.' What though?
                </l><l>'But it is feigned.' What of that? I trow
                </l><l>Some men, by feigned words, as dark as mine,
                </l><l>Make truth to spangle and its rays to shine.
                </l><l>'But they want solidness.' Speak, man, thy mind.
                </l><l>'They drown the weak; metaphors make us blind.'</l>
                <l rend="indent">Solidity, indeed, becomes the pen
                </l><l>Of him that writeth things divine to men;
                </l><l>But must I needs want solidness, because
                </l><l>By metaphors I speak? Were not God's laws,
                </l><l>His gospel laws, in olden times held forth
                </l><l>By types, shadows, and metaphors? Yet loath
                </l><l>Will any sober man be to find fault
                </l><l>With them, lest he be found for to assault
                </l><l>The highest wisdom. No, he rather stoops,
                </l><l>And seeks to find out what by pins and loops,
                </l><l>By calves and sheep, by heifers and by rams,
                </l><l>By birds and herbs, and by the blood of lambs,</l>
                <l>God speaketh to him; and happy is he
                </l><l>That finds the light and grace that in them be.</l>
                <l rend="indent">Be not too forward, therefore, to conclude
                </l><l>That I want solidness -- that I am rude;
                </l><l>All things solid in show not solid be;
                </l><l>All things in parables despise not we;
                </l><l>Lest things most hurtful lightly we receive,
                </l><l>And things that good are, of our souls bereave.
                </l><l>My dark and cloudy words, they do but hold
                </l><l>The truth, as cabinets enclose the gold.</l>
                <l rend="indent">The prophets used much by metaphors
                </l><l>To set forth truth; yea, who so considers
                </l><l>Christ, his apostles too, shall plainly see,
                </l><l>That truths to this day in such mantles be.</l>
                <l rend="indent">Am I afraid to say, that holy writ,
                </l><l>Which for its style and phrase puts down all wit,
                </l><l>Is everywhere so full of all these things --
                </l><l>Dark figures, allegories? Yet there springs
                </l><l>From that same book that lustre, and those rays
                </l><l>Of light, that turn our darkest nights to days.</l>
                <l rend="indent">Come, let my carper to his life now look,
                </l><l>And find there darker lines than in my book
                </l><l>He findeth any; yea, and let him know,
                </l><l>That in his best things there are worse lines too.</l>
                <l rend="indent">May we but stand before impartial men,
                </l><l>To his poor one I dare adventure ten,
                </l><l>That they will take my meaning in these lines
                </l><l>Far better than his lies in silver shrines.
                </l><l>Come, truth, although in swaddling clouts, I find,
                </l><l>Informs the judgment, rectifies the mind;
                </l><l>Pleases the understanding, makes the will
                </l><l>Submit; the memory too it doth fill</l>
                <l>With what doth our imaginations please;
                </l><l>Likewise it tends our troubles to appease.</l>
                <l rend="indent">Sound words, I know, Timothy is to use,
                </l><l>And old wives' fables he is to refuse;
                </l><l>But yet grave Paul him nowhere did forbid
                </l><l>The use of parables; in which lay hid
                </l><l>That gold, those pearls, and precious stones that were
                </l><l>Worth digging for, and that with greatest care.</l>
                <l rend="indent">Let me add one word more. O man of God,
                </l><l>Art thou offended? Dost thou wish I had

                </l><l>Or, that I had in things been more express?
                </l><l>Three things let me propound; then I submit
                </l><l>To those that are my betters, as is fit.</l>
                <l rend="indent">1. I find not that I am denied the use

                </l><l>In handling figure or similitude,

                </head>
                <p>
                AS I WALKED THROUGH THE WILDERNESS OF THIS world, I lighted on
                a certain place where was a Den, and I laid me down in that
                place to sleep: and, as I slept, I dreamed a dream. I dreamed,
                and behold, I saw a man clothed with rags, standing in a certain
                place, with his face from his own house, a book in his hand, and
                a great burden upon his back. I looked, and saw him open the
                book, and read therein; and, as he read, he wept, and trembled;
                and, not being able longer to contain, he brake out with a
                lamentable cry, saying, <hi rend="italic">What shall I do?</hi>
                </p><p>
                In this plight, therefore, he went home and refrained himself as
                long as he could, that his wife and children should not perceive
                his distress; but he could not be silent long, because that his
                trouble increased. Wherefore at length he brake his mind to his
                wife and children; and thus he began to talk to them: O my dear
                wife, said he, and you the children of my bowels, I, your dear
                friend, am in myself undone by reason of a burden that lieth
                hard upon me; moreover, I am for certain informed that this our
                city will be burned with fire from heaven; in which fearful
                overthrow, both myself, with thee my wife, and you my sweet
                babes, shall miserably come to ruin, except
                (the which yet I see not) some way of escape can be
                found, whereby we may be delivered. At this his relations were
                sore amazed; not for that they believed that what he had said to
                them was true, but because they thought that some frenzy
                distemper had got into his head; therefore, it drawing towards
                night, and they hoping that sleep might settle his brains, with
                all haste they got him to bed. But the night was as troublesome
                to him as the day; wherefore, instead of sleeping, he spent it
                in sighs and tears. So, when the morning was come, they would
                know how he did. He told them, Worse and worse: he also set to
                talking to them again; but they began to be hardened. They also
                thought to drive away his distemper by harsh and surly carriages
                to him; sometimes they would deride, sometimes they would chide,
                and sometimes they would quite neglect him. Wherefore he began
                to retire himself to his chamber, to pray for and pity them, and
                also to condole his own misery; he would also walk solitarily in
                the fields, sometimes reading, and sometimes praying: and thus
                for some days he spent his time.
                </p><p>
                Now, I saw, upon a time, when he was walking in the fields, that
                he was, as he was wont, reading in his book, and greatly
                distressed in his mind; and, as he read, he burst out, as he had
                done before, crying, <hi rend="italic">What shall I do to be saved?</hi>
                </p><p>
                I saw also that he looked this way and that way, as if he would
                run; yet he stood still, because, as I perceived, he could not
                tell which way to go. I looked then, and saw a man named
                <hi rend="italic">Evangelist</hi> coming to him, who asked, Wherefore dost thou cry?
                
                </p><p>
                He answered, Sir, I perceive by the book in my hand,
                that I am condemned to die, and after that to come to judgment;
                and I find that I am not willing to do the first, nor able to do
                the second.</p>
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                <l rend="indent"><hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> no sooner leaves the World but meets
                </l><l rend="indent"><hi rend="italic">Evangelist</hi>, who lovingly him greets
                </l><l rend="indent">With tidings of another: and doth shew
                </l><l rend="indent">Him how to mount to that from this below.</l>
                </lg>
                
                <p>
                Then said <hi rend="italic">Evangelist</hi>, Why not willing to die, since this life is
                attended with so many evils? The man answered, Because I fear
                that this burden that is upon my back will sink me lower than
                the grave, and I shall fall into Tophet. And, Sir, if I be not
                fit to go to prison, I am not fit, I am sure, to go to judgment,
                and from thence to execution; and the thoughts of these things
                make me cry.
                </p><p>
                Then said <hi rend="italic">Evangelist</hi>, If this be thy condition, why standest
                thou still? He answered, Because I know not whither to go. Then
                he gave him a parchment roll, and there was written within, <hi rend="italic">Flee
                from the wrath to come.</hi>
                </p><p>
                The man, therefore, read it, and looking upon <hi rend="italic">Evangelist</hi> very
                carefully, said, Whither must I fly? Then said <hi rend="italic">Evangelist</hi>,
                pointing with his finger over a very wide field, Do you see
                yonder wicket-gate? The man said, No. Then said the other, Do
                you see yonder shining light? He said, I think I do. Then said
                <hi rend="italic">Evangelist</hi>, Keep that light in your eye, and go up directly
                thereto: so shalt thou see the gate; at which, when thou
                knockest, it shall be told thee what thou shalt do. So I saw in
                my dream that the man began to run. Now, he had not run far from
                his own door, but his wife and children, perceiving it, began to
                cry after him to return; but the man put his fingers in his
                ears, and ran on, crying, Life! life! eternal life! So he looked
                not behind him, but fled towards the middle of the plain.
                </p><p>
                The neighbours also came out to see him run; and, as he ran,
                some mocked, others threatened, and some cried after him to
                return; and, among those that did so, there were two that
                resolved to fetch him back by force. The name of the one was
                <hi rend="italic">Obstinate</hi> and the name of the other <hi rend="italic">Pliable</hi>. Now, by this time,
                the man was got a good distance from them; but, however, they
                were resolved to pursue him, which they did, and in a little
                time they overtook him. Then said the man, Neighbours, wherefore
                are ye come? They said, To persuade you to go back with us. But
                he said, That can by no means be; you dwell, said he, in the
                City of <hi rend="italic">Destruction</hi>, the place also where I was born: I see it
                to be so; and, dying there, sooner or later, you will sink lower
                than the grave, into a place that burns with fire and brimstone:
                be content, good neighbours, and go along with me.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Obst.</hi>
                What! said <hi rend="italic">Obstinate</hi>, and leave our friends and our
                comforts behind us?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Yes, said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, for that was his name, because that
                ALL which you shall forsake is not worthy to be compared with a
                little of that which I am seeking to enjoy; and, if you will go
                along with me, and hold it, you shall fare as I myself; for
                there, where I go, is enough and to spare. Come away, and prove
                my words.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Obst.</hi> What are the things you seek, since you leave all the
                world to find them?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> I seek an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that
                fadeth not away, and it is laid up in heaven,
                and safe there, to be bestowed, at the time appointed, on them
                that diligently seek it. Read it so, if you will, in my book.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Obst.</hi> Tush! said <hi rend="italic">Obstinate</hi>, away with your book; will you go
                back with us or no?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> No, not I, said the other, because I have laid my hand to
                the plough.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Obst.</hi> Come, then, neighbour <hi rend="italic">Pliable</hi>, let us turn again, and go
                home without him; there is a company of these crazy-headed
                coxcombs, that, when they take a fancy by the end, are wiser in
                their own eyes than seven men that can render a reason.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Pli.</hi> Then said <hi rend="italic">Pliable</hi>, Don't revile; if what the good <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>
                says is true, the things he looks after are better than ours: my
                heart inclines to go with my neighbour.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Obst.</hi> What! more fools still! Be ruled by me, and go back; who
                knows whither such a brain-sick fellow will lead you? Go back,
                go back, and be wise.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Nay, but do thou come with thy neighbour, <hi rend="italic">Pliable</hi>; there
                are such things to be had which I spoke of, and many more
                glorious besides. If you believe not me, read here in this book;
                and for the truth of what is expressed therein, behold, all is
                confirmed by the blood of Him that made it.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Pli.</hi> Well, neighbour <hi rend="italic">Obstinate</hi>, said <hi rend="italic">Pliable</hi>, I begin to come to
                a point; I intend to go along with this good man, and to cast in
                my lot with him: but, my good companion, do you know the way to
                this desired place?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> I am directed by a man, whose name is <hi rend="italic">Evangelist</hi>, to speed
                me to a little gate that is before us, where we shall receive
                instructions about the way.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Pli.</hi> Come, then, good neighbour, let us be going. Then they went
                both together.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Obst.</hi> And I will go back to my place, said <hi rend="italic">Obstinate</hi>; I will be
                no companion of such misled, fantastical fellows.</p>
                
                <p>Now, I saw in my dream, that when <hi rend="italic">Obstinate</hi> was gone back,
                <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pliable</hi> went talking over the plain; and thus they
                began their discourse.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Come, neighbour <hi rend="italic">Pliable</hi>, how do you do? I am glad you are
                persuaded to go along with me. Had even <hi rend="italic">Obstinate</hi> himself but
                felt what I have felt of the powers and terrors of what is yet
                unseen, he would not thus lightly have given us the back.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Pli.</hi> Come, neighbour <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, since there are none but us two
                here, tell me now further what the things are, and how to be
                enjoyed, whither we are going.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> I can better conceive of them with my mind, than speak of
                them with my tongue: but yet, since you are desirous to know, I
                will read of them in my book.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Pli.</hi> And do you think that the words of your book are certainly
                true?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Yes, verily; for it was made by Him that cannot lie.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Pli.</hi> Well said; what things are they?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> There is an endless kingdom to be inhabited, and
                everlasting life to be given us, that we may inhabit that
                kingdom for ever.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Pli.</hi> Well said; and what else?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> There are crowns and glory to be given us, and garments
                that will make us shine like the sun in the firmament of heaven.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Pli.</hi> This is very pleasant; and what else?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> There shall be no more crying, nor Sorrow: for He that is
                owner of the place will wipe all tears from our eyes.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Pli.</hi> And what company shall we have there?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> There we shall be with seraphims and cherubims, creatures
                that will dazzle your eyes to look on them. There also you shall
                meet with thousands and ten thousands that have gone before us
                to that place; none of them are hurtful, but loving and holy;
                every one walking in the sight of God, and standing in his
                presence with acceptance for ever. In a word, there we shall see
                the elders with their golden crowns, there we shall see the holy
                virgins with their golden harps, there we shall see men that by
                the world were cut in pieces, burnt in flames, eaten of beasts,
                drowned in the seas, for the love that they bear to the Lord of
                the place, all well, and clothed with immortality as with a
                garment.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Pli.</hi> The hearing of this is enough to ravish one's heart. But
                are these things to be enjoyed? How shall we get to be sharers
                thereof?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> The Lord, the Governor of the country, hath recorded that
                in this book; the substance of which is, If we be truly willing
                to have it, he will bestow it upon us freely.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Pli.</hi> Well, my good companion, glad am I to hear of these things:
                come on, let us mend our pace.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> I cannot go so fast as I would, by reason of this burden
                that is on my back.</p>
                
                <p>Now I saw in my dream, that just as they had ended this talk
                they drew near to a very miry slough, that was in the midst of
                the plain; and they, being heedless, did both fall suddenly into
                the bog. The name of the slough
                was <hi rend="italic">Despond</hi>. Here, therefore, they wallowed for a being
                grievously bedaubed with the dirt; and <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, because of the
                burden that was on his back, began to sink in the mire.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Pli.</hi> Then said <hi rend="italic">Pliable</hi>; Ah! neighbour <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, where are you
                now?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Truly, said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, I do not know.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Pli.</hi> At this <hi rend="italic">Pliable</hi> began to be offended, and angrily said to
                his fellow, Is this the happiness you have told me all this
                while of? If we have such ill speed at our first setting out,
                what may we expect betwixt this and our journey's end? May I get
                out again with my life, you shall possess the brave country
                alone for me.</p>
                
                <p>And, with that, he gave a desperate struggle or
                two, and got out of the mire on that side of the slough which
                was next to his own house: so away he went, and <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> saw
                him no more.</p>
                
                <p>Wherefore <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> was left to tumble in the Slough of <hi rend="italic">Despond</hi>
                alone: but still he endeavoured to struggle to that side of the
                slough that was still further from his own house, and next to
                the wicket-gate; the which he did, but could not get out,
                because of the burden that was upon his back: but I beheld in my
                dream, that a man came to him, whose name was <hi rend="italic">Help</hi>, and asked
                him, What he did there?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Sir, said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, I was bid go this way by a man called
                <hi rend="italic">Evangelist</hi>, who directed me also to yonder gate, that I might
                escape the wrath to come; and as I was going thither I fell in
                here.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Help.</hi> But why did not you look for the steps?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Fear followed me so hard, that I fled the next way, and
                fell in.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Help.</hi> Then said he, Give me thy hand: so he gave him his hand,
                and he drew him out, and set him upon sound ground, and bid him
                go on his way.</p>
                
                <p>Then I stepped to him that plucked him out, and said, Sir,
                wherefore, since over this place is the way from the City of
                <hi rend="italic">Destruction</hi> to yonder gate, is it that this plat is not mended,
                that poor travellers might go thither with more security? And he
                said unto me, This miry slough is such a place as cannot be
                mended; it is the descent whither the scum and filth that
                attends conviction for sin doth continually run, and therefore
                it is called the Slough of <hi rend="italic">Despond</hi>; for still, as the sinner is
                awakened about his lost condition, there ariseth in his soul
                many fears, and doubts, and discouraging apprehensions, which
                all of them get together, and settle in this place. And this is
                the reason of the badness of this ground.</p>
                
                <p>It is not the pleasure of the King that this place should remain
                so bad. His labourers also have, by the direction of His
                Majesty's surveyors, been for above these sixteen hundred years
                employed about this patch of ground, if perhaps it might have
                been mended: yea, and to my knowledge, said he, here have been
                swallowed up at least twenty thousand cart-loads, yea, millions
                of wholesome instructions, that have at all seasons been brought
                from all places of the King's dominions, and they that can tell,
                say they are the best materials to make good ground of the
                place; if so be, it might have been mended, but it is the Slough
                of <hi rend="italic">Despond</hi> still, and so will be when they have done what they
                can.</p>
                
                <p>True, there are, by the direction of the Law-giver, certain good
                and substantial steps, placed even through the very midst of
                this slough; but at such time as this
                place doth much spew out its filth, as it doth against change of
                weather, these steps are hardly seen; or, if they be, men,
                through the dizziness of their heads, step beside, and then they
                are bemired to purpose, notwithstanding the steps be there; but
                the ground is good when they are once got in at the gate.</p>
                
                <p>Now, I saw in my dream, that by this time <hi rend="italic">Pliable</hi> was got home
                to his house again, so that his neighbours came to visit him;
                and some of them called him wise man for coming back, and some
                called him fool for hazarding himself with <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>: others
                again did mock at his cowardliness; saying, Surely, since you
                began to venture, I would not have been so base to have given
                out for a few difficulties. So <hi rend="italic">Pliable</hi> sat sneaking among them.
                But at last he got more confidence, and then they all turned
                their tales, and began to deride poor <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> behind his back.
                And thus much concerning <hi rend="italic">Pliable</hi>.
                
                </p><p>
                Now, as <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> was walking solitarily by himself, he espied
                one afar off, come crossing over the field to meet him; and
                their hap was to meet just as they were crossing the way of each
                other. The gentleman's name that met him was Mr. Worldly
                Wiseman, he dwelt in the town of <hi rend="italic">Carnal Policy</hi>, a very great
                town, and also hard by from whence <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> came. This man,
                then, meeting with <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, and having some inkling of him, --
                for <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>'s setting forth from the City of <hi rend="italic">Destruction</hi> was
                much noised abroad, not only in the town where he dwelt, but
                also it began to be the town talk in some other places, -- Mr.
                <hi rend="italic">Worldly Wiseman</hi>, therefore, having some guess of him, by
                beholding his laborious going, by observing his sighs and
                groans, and the like, began thus to enter into some talk with
                <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">World.</hi> How now, good fellow, whither away after this burdened
                manner?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> A burdened manner, indeed, as ever, I think, poor creature
                had! And whereas you ask me, Whither away? I tell you, Sir, I am
                going to yonder wicket-gate before me; for there, as I am
                informed, I shall be put into a way to be rid of my heavy
                burden.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">World.</hi> Hast thou a wife and children?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Yes; but I am so laden with this burden that I cannot take
                that pleasure in them as formerly; methinks I am as if I had
                none.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">World.</hi> Wilt thou hearken unto me if I give thee counsel?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> If it be good, I will; for I stand in need of good counsel.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">World.</hi> I would advise thee, then, that thou with all speed get
                thyself rid of thy burden; for thou wilt never be settled in thy
                mind till then; nor canst thou enjoy the benefits of the
                blessing which God hath bestowed upon thee till then.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> That is that which I seek for, even to be rid of this heavy
                burden; but get it off myself, I cannot; nor is there any man in
                our country that can take it off my shoulders; therefore am I
                going this way, as I told you, that I may be rid of my burden.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">World.</hi> Who bid thee go this way to be rid of thy burden?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> A man that appeared to me to be a very great and honourable
                person; his name, as I remember, is <hi rend="italic">Evangelist</hi>.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">World.</hi> I beshrew him for his counsel! there is not a more
                dangerous and troublesome way in the world than
                is that unto which he hath directed thee; and that thou shalt
                find, if thou wilt be ruled by his counsel. Thou hast met with
                something, as I perceive, already; for I see the dirt of the
                Slough of <hi rend="italic">Despond</hi> is upon thee; but that slough is the beginning
                of the sorrows that do attend those that go on in that way. Hear
                me, I am older than thou; thou art like to meet with, in the way
                which thou goest, wearisomeness, painfulness, hunger, perils,
                nakedness, sword, lions, dragons, darkness, and, in a word,
                death, and what not! These things are certainly true, having
                been confirmed by many testimonies. And why should a man so
                carelessly cast away himself, by giving heed to a stranger?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Why, Sir, this burden upon my back is more terrible to me
                than all these things which you have mentioned; nay, methinks I
                care not what I meet with in the way, if so be I can also meet
                with deliverance from my burden.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">World.</hi> How camest thou by the burden at first?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> By reading this book in my hand.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">World.</hi> I thought so; and it is happened unto thee as to other
                weak men, who, meddling with things too high for them, do
                suddenly fall into thy distractions; which distractions do not
                only unman men, as thine, I perceive, have done thee, but they
                run them upon desperate ventures to obtain they know not what.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> I know what I would obtain; it is ease for my heavy burden.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">World.</hi> But why wilt thou seek for ease this way, seeing so many
                dangers attend it? especially since, hadst thou but patience to
                hear me, I could direct thee to the obtaining of what thou
                desirest, without the dangers that
                thou in this way wilt run thyself into: yea, and the remedy is
                at hand. Besides, I will add, that instead of those dangers,
                thou shalt meet with much safety, friendship, and content.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Pray, Sir, open this secret to me.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">World.</hi> Why, in yonder village -- the village is named <hi rend="italic">Morality</hi>
                -- there dwells a gentleman whose name is <hi rend="italic">Legality</hi>, a very
                judicious man, and a man of very good name, that has skill to
                help men off with such burdens as thine are from their
                shoulders: yea, to my knowledge, he hath done a great deal of
                good this way; ay, and besides, he hath skill to cure those that
                are somewhat crazed in their wits with their burdens. To him, as
                I said, thou mayest go, and be helped presently. His house is
                not quite a mile from this place, and if he should not be at
                home himself, he hath a pretty young man to his son, whose name
                is Civility, that can do it (to speak on) as well as the old
                gentleman himself; there, I say, thou mayest be eased of thy
                burden; and if thou art not minded to go back to thy former
                habitation, as, indeed, I would not wish thee, thou mayest send
                for thy wife and children to thee to this village, where there
                are houses now stand empty, one of which thou mayest have at
                reasonable rates; provision is there also cheap and good; and
                that which will make thy life the more happy is, to be sure,
                there thou shalt live by honest neighbours, in credit and good
                fashion.</p>
                
                <p>Now was <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> somewhat at a stand; but presently he
                concluded, if this be true, which this gentleman hath said, my
                wisest course is to take his advice; and with that he thus
                further spoke.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Sir, which is my way to this honest man's house?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">World.</hi> Do you see yonder hill?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Yes, very well.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">World.</hi> By that hill you must go, and the first house you come at
                is his.</p>
                
                <p>So <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> turned out of his way to go to Mr. <hi rend="italic">Legality</hi>'s house
                for help; but, behold, when he was got now hard by the hill, it
                seemed so high, and also that side of it that was next the
                wayside did hang so much over, that <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> was afraid to
                venture further, lest the hill should fall on his head;
                wherefore there he stood still and wotted not what to do. Also
                his burden now seemed heavier to him than while he was in his
                way. There came also flashes of fire out of the hill, that made
                <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> afraid that he should be burned. Here, therefore, he
                sweat and did quake for fear.</p>
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                <l rend="indent">When <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>s unto carnal men give ear,
                </l><l rend="indent">Out of their way they go, and pay for't dear;
                </l><l rend="indent">For Master <hi rend="italic">Worldly Wiseman</hi> can but shew

                </lg>
                
                <p>And now he began to be sorry that he had taken Mr. <hi rend="italic">Worldly
                Wiseman</hi>'s counsel. And with that he saw <hi rend="italic">Evangelist</hi> coming to
                meet him; at the sight also of whom he began to blush for shame.
                So <hi rend="italic">Evangelist</hi> drew nearer and nearer; and coming up to him, he
                looked upon him with a severe and dreadful countenance, and thus
                began to reason with <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Evan.</hi> What dost thou here, <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>? said he: at which words
                <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> knew not what to answer; wherefore at present he stood
                speechless before him. Then said <hi rend="italic">Evangelist</hi> further, Art not
                thou the man that I found crying without the walls of the City
                of <hi rend="italic">Destruction</hi>?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Yes, dear Sir, I am the man.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Evan.</hi> Did not I direct thee the way to the little wicket-gate?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Yes, dear Sir, said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Evan.</hi> How is it, then, that thou art so quickly turned aside?
                for thou art now out of the way.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> I met with a gentleman so soon as I had got over the Slough
                of <hi rend="italic">Despond</hi>, who persuaded me that I might, in the village before
                me, find a man that would take off my burden.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Evan.</hi> What was he?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> He looked like a gentleman, and talked much to me, and got
                me at last to yield; so I came hither; but when I beheld this
                hill, and how it hangs over the way, I suddenly made a stand
                lest it should fall on my head.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Evan.</hi> What said that gentleman to you?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Why, he asked me whither I was going, and I told him.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Evan.</hi> And what said he then?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> He asked me if I had a family? And I told him. But, said I,
                I am so loaden with the burden that is on my back, that I cannot
                take pleasure in them as formerly.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Evan.</hi> And what said he then?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> He bid me with speed get rid of my burden; and I told him
                that it was ease that I sought. And said I, I am therefore going
                to yonder gate, to receive further direction how I may get to
                the place of deliverance. So he said that he would shew me a
                better way, and short, not so attended with difficulties as the
                way, Sir, that you set me in; which way, said he, will direct
                you to a gentleman's house that hath skill to take off these
                burdens, so I believed him, and turned out of that way into
                this,if haply I might be soon eased of my burden. But when I came to
                this place, and beheld things as they are, I stopped for fear
                (as I said) of danger: but I now know not what to do.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Evan.</hi> Then, said <hi rend="italic">Evangelist</hi>, stand still a little, that I may
                shew thee the words of God. So he stood trembling. Then said
                <hi rend="italic">Evangelist</hi>, <hi rend="italic">See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if
                they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more
                shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from
                heaven. He said, moreover, Now the just shall live by faith: but
                if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.</hi> He
                also did thus apply them: Thou art the man that art running into
                this misery; thou hast begun to reject the counsel of the Most
                High, and to draw back thy foot from the way of peace, even
                almost to the hazarding of thy perdition.</p>
                
                <p>Then <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> fell down at his feet as dead, crying, <hi rend="italic">Woe is me,
                for I am undone!</hi> At the sight of which <hi rend="italic">Evangelist</hi> caught him by
                the right hand, saying, <hi rend="italic">All manner of sin and blasphemies shall
                be forgiven unto men. Be not faithless, but believing.</hi> Then did
                <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> again a little revive, and stood up trembling, as at
                first, before <hi rend="italic">Evangelist</hi>.</p>
                
                <p>Then <hi rend="italic">Evangelist</hi> proceeded, saying, Give more earnest heed to the
                things that I shall tell thee of. I will now shew thee who it
                was that deluded thee, and who it was also to whom he sent thee.
                -- The man that met thee is one <hi rend="italic">Worldly Wiseman</hi>, and rightly is
                he so called; partly, because he savoureth only the doctrine of
                this world (therefore he always goes to the town of Morality to
                church): and partly because he loveth that doctrine best,
                for it saveth him best from the cross. And because he is of this
                carnal temper, therefore he seeketh to pervert my ways though
                right. Now there are three things in this man's counsel, that
                thou must utterly abhor.
                
                
                </p><p>1. His turning thee out of the way. 2. His labouring to render
                the cross odious to thee. And, 3. His setting thy feet in that
                way that leadeth unto the administration of death.
                
                </p><p>First, Thou must abhor his turning thee out of the way; and
                thine own consenting thereunto: because this is to reject the
                counsel of God for the sake of the counsel of a <hi rend="italic">Worldly Wiseman</hi>.
                The Lord says, <hi rend="italic">Strive to enter in at the strait gate,</hi> the gate
                to which I sent thee; <hi rend="italic">for strait is the gate that leadeth unto
                life, and few there be that find it.</hi> From this little
                wicket-gate, and from the way thereto, hath this wicked man
                turned thee, to the bringing of thee almost to destruction;
                hate, therefore, his turning thee out of the way, and abhor
                thyself for hearkening to him.
                
                </p><p>Secondly, Thou must abhor his labouring to render the cross
                odious unto thee; for thou art to prefer it <hi rend="italic">before the treasures
                of Egypt.</hi> Besides the King of glory hath told thee, that he that
                <hi rend="italic">will save his life shall lose it; and he that cometh after me,
                and hateth not his father, and mother, and wife, and children,
                and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot
                be my disciple.</hi> I say, therefore, for man to labour to persuade
                thee, that that shall be thy death, without which, THE TRUTH
                hath said, thou canst not have eternal life; this doctrine thou
                must abhor.
                
                </p><p>Thirdly, Thou must hate his setting of thy feet in the way that
                leadeth to the ministration of death. And for this thou must
                consider to whom he sent thee, and also how unable that
                person was to deliver thee from thy burden.
                
                </p><p>He to whom thou wast sent for ease, being by name <hi rend="italic">Legality</hi>, is
                the son of the bond-woman which now is, and is in bondage with
                her children; and is, in a mystery, this Mount Sinai, which thou
                hast feared will fall on thy head. Now, if she, with her
                children, are in bondage, how canst thou expect by them to be
                made free? This <hi rend="italic">Legality</hi>, therefore, is not able to set thee
                free from thy burden. No man was as yet ever rid of his burden
                by him; no, nor ever is like to be: ye cannot be justified by
                the works of the law; for by the deeds of the law no man living
                can be rid of his burden: therefore, Mr. <hi rend="italic">Worldly Wiseman</hi> is an
                alien, and Mr. <hi rend="italic">Legality</hi> is a cheat; and for his son <hi rend="italic">Civility</hi>,
                notwithstanding his simpering looks, he is but a hypocrite and
                cannot help thee. Believe me, there is nothing in all this
                noise, that thou hast heard of sottish men, but a design to
                beguile thee of thy salvation, by turning thee from the way in
                which I had set thee. After this, <hi rend="italic">Evangelist</hi> called aloud to the
                heavens for confirmation of what he had said: and with that
                there came words and fire out of the mountain under which poor
                <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> stood, that made the hair of his flesh stand up. The
                words were thus pronounced: <hi rend="italic">As many as are of the works of the
                law are under the curse; for it is written, Cursed is every one
                that continueth not in all things which are written in the book
                of the law to do them.</hi>
                
                </p><p>Now <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> looked for nothing but death, and began to cry out
                lamentably; even cursing the time in which he met with Mr.
                <hi rend="italic">Worldly Wiseman</hi>; still calling himself a thousand fools for
                hearkening to his counsel; he also was greatly ashamed to think
                that this gentleman's arguments,
                flowing only from the flesh, should have the
                prevalency with him as to cause him to forsake the right way.
                This done, he applied himself again to <hi rend="italic">Evangelist</hi> in words and
                sense as follow:
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Sir, what think you? Is there hope? May I now go back and
                go up to the wicket-gate? Shall I not be abandoned for this, and
                sent back from thence ashamed? I am sorry I have hearkened to
                this man's counsel. But may my sin be forgiven?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Evan.</hi> Then said <hi rend="italic">Evangelist</hi> to him, Thy sin is very great, for by
                it thou hast committed two evils: thou hast forsaken the way
                that is good, to tread in forbidden paths; yet will the man at
                the gate receive thee, for he has goodwill for men; only, said
                he, take heed that thou turn not aside again, lest thou perish
                from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Then did
                <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> address himself to go back; and <hi rend="italic">Evangelist</hi>, after he
                had kissed him, gave him one smile, and bid him God-speed. So he
                went on with haste, neither spake he to any man by the way; nor,
                if any asked him, would he vouchsafe them an answer. He went
                like one that was all the while treading on forbidden ground,
                and could by no means think himself safe, till again he was got
                into the way which he left, to follow Mr. <hi rend="italic">Worldly Wiseman</hi>'s
                counsel. So, in process of time, <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> got up to the gate.
                Now, over the gate there was written, Knock, and it shall be
                opened unto you.</p>
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                <l rend="indent">He that will enter in must first without

                </lg>
                
                <p>He knocked, therefore, more than once or twice, saying --</p>
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                <l rend="indent">May I now enter here? Will he within

                </lg>
                
                <p>At last there came a grave person to the gate, named Good-will,
                who asked who was there? and whence he came? and what he would
                have?</p>
                
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi>Here is a poor burdened sinner. I come from the City of
                <hi rend="italic">Destruction</hi>, but am going to Mount <hi rend="italic">Zion</hi>, that I may be delivered
                from the wrath to come. I would therefore, Sir, since I am
                informed that by this gate is the way thither, know if you are
                willing to let me in?</p>
                
                <p><hi rend="italic">Good-Will.</hi> I am willing with all my heart, said he; and with
                that he opened the gate.</p>
                
                <p>So when <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> was stepping in, the other gave him a pull.
                Then said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, What means that? The other told him. A
                little distance from this gate, there is erected a strong
                castle, of which <hi rend="italic">Beelzebub</hi> is the captain; from thence, both he
                and them that are with him shoot arrows at those that come up to
                this gate, if haply they may die before they can enter in.
                
                </p><p>Then said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, I rejoice and tremble. So when he was got
                in, the man of the gate asked him who directed him thither?</p>
                
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Evangelist bid me come hither, and knock, (as I did;) and
                he said that you, Sir, would tell me what I must do.</p>
                
                <p><hi rend="italic">Good-Will.</hi> An open door is set before thee, and no man can shut
                it.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Now I begin to reap the benefits of my hazards.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Good-Will.</hi> But how is it that you came alone?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Because none of my neighbours saw their danger, as I saw
                mine.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Good-Will.</hi> Did any of them know of your coming?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Yes; my wife and children saw me at the first, and called
                after me to turn again; also, some of my neighbours stood crying
                and calling after me to return; but I put my fingers in my ears,
                and so came on my way.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Good-Will.</hi> But did none of them follow you, to persuade you to
                go back?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Yes, both <hi rend="italic">Obstinate</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pliable</hi>; but when they saw that
                they could not prevail, <hi rend="italic">Obstinate</hi> went railing back, but <hi rend="italic">Pliable</hi>
                came with me a little way.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Good-Will.</hi> But why did he not come through?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> We, indeed, came both together, until we came at the Slough
                of <hi rend="italic">Despond</hi>, into the which we also suddenly fell. And then was
                my neighbour, <hi rend="italic">Pliable</hi>, discouraged, and would not venture
                further. Wherefore, getting out again on that side next to his
                own house, he told me I should possess the brave country alone
                for him; so he went his way, and I came mine -- he after
                <hi rend="italic">Obstinate</hi>, and I to this gate.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Good-Will.</hi> Then said <hi rend="italic">Good-will</hi>, Alas, poor man! is the celestial
                glory of so small esteem with him, that he counteth it not worth
                running the hazards of a few difficulties to obtain it?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Truly, said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, I have said the truth of <hi rend="italic">Pliable</hi>,
                and if I should also say all the truth of myself, it will appear
                there is no betterment betwixt him and myself. It is true, he
                went back to his own house, but I
                also turned aside to go in the way of death, being persuaded
                thereto by the carnal arguments of one Mr. <hi rend="italic">Worldly Wiseman</hi>.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Good-Will.</hi> Oh, did he light upon you? What! he would have had
                you a sought for ease at the hands of Mr. <hi rend="italic">Legality</hi>. They are,
                both of them, a very cheat. But did you take his counsel?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Yes, as far as I durst; I went to find out Mr. <hi rend="italic">Legality</hi>,
                until I thought that the mountain that stands by his house would
                have fallen upon my head; wherefore there I was forced to stop.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Good-Will.</hi> That mountain has been the death of many, and will be
                the death of many more; it is well you escaped being by it
                dashed in pieces.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Why, truly, I do not know what had become of me there, had
                not <hi rend="italic">Evangelist</hi> happily met me again, as I was musing in the
                midst of my dumps; but it was God's mercy that he came to me
                again, for else I had never come hither. But now I am come, such
                a one as I am, more fit, indeed, for death, by that mountain,
                than thus to stand talking with my lord; but, oh, what a favour
                is this to me, that yet I am admitted entrance here!
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Good-Will.</hi> We make no objections against any, notwithstanding
                all that they have done before they came hither. They are in no
                wise cast out; and therefore, good <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, come a little way
                with me, and I will teach thee about the way thou must go. Look
                before thee; dost thou see this narrow. way? THAT is the way
                thou must go; it was cast up by the patriarchs, prophets,
                Christ, and his apostles; and it is as straight as a rule can
                make it. This is the way thou must go.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> But, said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, are there no turnings or windings by
                which a stranger may lose his way?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Good-Will.</hi> Yes, there are many ways butt down upon this, and
                they are crooked and wide. But thus thou mayest distinguish the
                right from the wrong, the right only being straight and narrow.
                
                </p><p>Then I saw in my dream that <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> asked him further if he
                could not help him off with his burden that was upon his back;
                for as yet he had not got rid thereof, nor could he by any means
                get it off without help.
                
                </p><p>He told him, As to thy burden, be content to bear it, until thou
                comest to the place of deliverance; for there it will fall from
                thy back of itself.
                
                </p><p>Then <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> began to gird up his loins, and to address
                himself to his journey. So the other told him, That by that he
                was gone some distance from the gate, he would come at the house
                of the <hi rend="italic">Interpreter</hi>, at whose door he should knock, and he would
                shew him excellent things. Then <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> took his leave of his
                friend, and he again bid him God-speed.
                
                </p><p>Then he went on till he came to the house of the <hi rend="italic">Interpreter</hi>,
                where he knocked over and over; at last one came to the door,
                and asked who was there.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Sir, here is a traveller, who was bid by an acquaintance of
                the good-man of this house to call here for my profit; I would
                therefore speak with the master of the house. So he called for
                the master of the house, who, after a little time, came to
                <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, and asked him what he would have.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Sir, said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, I am a man that am come from the City
                of <hi rend="italic">Destruction</hi>, and am going to the Mount <hi rend="italic">Zion</hi>;
                and I was told by the man that stands at the gate, at, the
                head of this way, that if I called here, you would shew me
                excellent things, such as would be a help to me in my journey.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Inter.</hi> Then said the <hi rend="italic">Interpreter</hi>, Come in; I will shew that
                which will be profitable to thee. So he commanded his man to
                light the candle, and bid <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> follow him: so he had him
                into a private room, and bid his man open a door; the which when
                he had done, <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> saw the picture of a very grave person
                hung up against the wall; and this was the fashion of it. It had
                eyes lifted up to heaven, the best of books in his hand, the law
                of truth was written upon his lips, the world was behind his
                back. It stood as if it pleaded with men, and a crown of gold
                did hang over his head.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Then said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, What meaneth this?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Inter.</hi> The man whose picture this is, is one of a thousand; he
                can beget children, travail in birth with children, and nurse
                them himself when they are born. And whereas thou seest him with
                his eyes lift up to heaven, the best of books in his hand, and
                the law of truth writ on his lips, it is to shew thee that his
                work is to know and unfold dark things to sinners; even as also
                thou seest him stand as if he pleaded with men: and whereas thou
                seest the world as cast behind him, and that a crown hangs over
                his head, that is to shew thee that slighting and despising the
                things that are present, for the love that he hath to his
                Master's service, he is sure in the world that comes next to
                have glory for his reward. Now, said the <hi rend="italic">Interpreter</hi>, I have
                shewed thee this picture first, because the man whose picture
                this is, is the only man whom the Lord of the place whither thou
                art going, hath authorised to
                be thy guide in all difficult places thou mayest meet
                with in the way; wherefore, take good heed to what I have shewed
                thee, and bear well in thy mind what thou hast seen, lest in thy
                journey thou meet with some that pretend to lead thee right, but
                their way goes down to death.</p>
                
                <p>Then he took him by the hand, and led him into a very large
                parlour that was full of dust, because never swept; the which
                after he had reviewed a little while, the <hi rend="italic">Interpreter</hi> called for
                a man to sweep. Now, when he began to sweep, the dust began so
                abundantly to fly about, that <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> had almost therewith
                been choked. Then said the <hi rend="italic">Interpreter</hi> to a damsel that stood
                by, Bring hither the water, and sprinkle the room; the which,
                when she had done, it was swept and cleansed with pleasure.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Then said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, What means this?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Inter.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Interpreter</hi> answered, This parlour is the heart of a
                man that was never sanctified by the sweet grace of the gospel;
                the dust is his original sin and inward corruptions, that have
                defiled the whole man. He that began to sweep at first, is the
                Law; but she that brought water, and did sprinkle it, is the
                Gospel. Now, whereas thou sawest, that so soon as the first
                began to sweep, the dust did so fly about that the room by him
                could not be cleansed, but that thou wast almost choked
                therewith; this is to shew thee, that the law, instead of
                cleansing the heart (by its working) from sin, doth revive, put
                strength into, and increase it in the soul, even as it doth
                discover and forbid it, for it doth not give power to subdue.</p>
                
                <p>Again, as thou sawest the damsel sprinkle the room with water,
                upon which it was cleansed with pleasure; this is to shew thee, that when the gospel comes in the sweet
                and precious influences thereof to the heart, then, I say, even
                as thou sawest the damsel lay the dust by sprinkling the floor
                with water, so is sin vanquished and subdued, and the soul made
                clean through the faith of it, and consequently fit for the King
                of glory to inhabit.</p>
                
                <p>I saw, moreover, in my dream, that the <hi rend="italic">Interpreter</hi> took him by
                the hand, and had him into a little room, where sat two little
                children, each one in his chair. The name of the eldest was
                <hi rend="italic">Passion</hi>, and the name of the other <hi rend="italic">Patience</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Passion</hi> seemed to
                be much discontented; but <hi rend="italic">Patience</hi> was very quiet. Then
                <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> asked, What is the reason of the discontent of
                <hi rend="italic">Passion</hi>? The <hi rend="italic">Interpreter</hi> answered, The Governor of them would
                have him stay for his best things till the beginning of the next
                year; but he will have all now: but <hi rend="italic">Patience</hi> is willing to wait.
                
                </p><p>Then I saw that one came to <hi rend="italic">Passion</hi>, and brought him a bag of
                treasure, and poured it down at his feet, the which he took up
                and rejoiced therein, and withal laughed <hi rend="italic">Patience</hi> to scorn. But
                I beheld but a while, and he had lavished all away, and had
                nothing left him but rags.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Then said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">Interpreter</hi>, Expound this matter
                more fully to me.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Inter.</hi> So he said, These two lads are figures: <hi rend="italic">Passion</hi>, of the
                men of this world; and <hi rend="italic">Patience</hi>, of the men of that which is to
                come; for as here thou seest, <hi rend="italic">Passion</hi> will have all now this
                year, that is to say, in this world; so are the men of this
                world, they must have all their good things now, they cannot
                stay till next year, that is until the next world, for their
                portion of good. That proverb, 'A bird in the hand
                is worth two in the bush,' is of more
                authority with them than are all the Divine testimonies of the
                good of the world to come. But as thou sawest that he had
                quickly lavished all away, and had presently left him nothing
                but rags; so will it be with all such men at the end of this
                world.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Then said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, Now I see that <hi rend="italic">Patience</hi> has the best
                wisdom, and that upon many accounts. First, because he stays for
                the best things. Second, and also because he will have the glory
                of his, when the other has nothing but rags.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Inter.</hi> Nay, you may add another, to wit, the glory of the next
                world will never wear out; but these are suddenly gone.
                Therefore <hi rend="italic">Passion</hi> had not so much reason to laugh at <hi rend="italic">Patience</hi>,
                because he had his good things first, as <hi rend="italic">Patience</hi> will have to
                laugh at <hi rend="italic">Passion</hi>, because he had his best things last; for first
                must give place to last, because last must have his time to
                come; but last gives place to nothing; for there is not another
                to succeed. He, therefore, that hath his portion first, must
                needs have a time to spend it; but he that hath his portion
                last, must have it lastingly; therefore it is said of Dives,
                <hi rend="italic">Thou in thy life-time receivedst thy good things, and likewise
                Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted, and thou art
                tormented.</hi>
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Then I perceive it is not best to covet things that are
                now, but to wait for things to come.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Inter.</hi> You say the truth: <hi rend="italic">For the things which are seen are
                temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.</hi> But
                though this be so, yet since things present and our fleshly
                appetite are such near neighbours one to another; and again,
                because things to come, and carnal sense,
                are such strangers one to another; therefore it is, that
                the first of these so suddenly fall into amity, and that
                distance is so continued between the second.
                
                </p><p>Then I saw in my dream that the <hi rend="italic">Interpreter</hi> took <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> by
                the hand, and led him into a place where was a fire burning
                against a wall, and one standing by it, always casting much
                water upon it, to quench it; yet did the fire burn higher and
                hotter.
                
                </p><p>Then said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, What means this?
                
                </p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Interpreter</hi> answered, This fire is the work of grace that is
                wrought in the heart; he that casts water upon it, to extinguish
                and put it out, is the Devil; but in that thou seest the fire
                notwithstanding burn higher and hotter, thou shalt also see the
                reason of that. So he had him about to the backside of the wall,
                where he saw a man with a vessel of oil in his hand, of the
                which he did also continually cast, but secretly, into the fire.
                
                </p><p>Then said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, What means this?
                
                </p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Interpreter</hi> answered, This is Christ, who continually, with
                the oil of his grace, maintains the work already begun in the
                heart: by the means of which, notwithstanding what the devil can
                do, the souls of his people prove gracious still. And in that
                thou sawest that the man stood behind the wall to maintain the
                fire, that is to teach thee that it is hard for the tempted to
                see how this work of grace is maintained in the soul.
                
                </p><p>I saw also, that the <hi rend="italic">Interpreter</hi> took him again by the hand, and
                led him into a pleasant place, where was builded a stately
                palace, beautiful to behold; at the sight of which <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> was
                greatly delighted. He saw also, upon the top thereof, certain
                persons walking, who were clothed all in gold.
                
                </p><p>Then said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, May we go in thither?
                
                </p><p>Then the <hi rend="italic">Interpreter</hi> took him, and led him up towards the door
                of the palace; and behold, at the door stood a great company of
                men, as desirous to go in; but durst not. There also sat a man
                at a little distance from the door, at a table-side, with a book
                and his inkhorn before him, to take the name of him that should
                enter therein; he saw also, that in the doorway stood many men
                in armour to keep it, being resolved to do the men that would
                enter what hurt and mischief they could. Now was <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>
                somewhat in amaze. At last, when every man started back for fear
                of the armed men, <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> saw a man of a very stout
                countenance come up to the man that sat there to write, saying,
                Set down my name, Sir: the which when he had done, he saw the
                man draw his sword, and put a helmet upon his head, and rush
                toward the door upon the armed men, who laid upon him with
                deadly force; but the man, not at all discouraged, fell to
                cutting and hacking most fiercely. So after he had received and
                given many wounds to those that attempted to keep him out, he
                cut his way through them all, and pressed forward into the
                palace, at which there was a pleasant voice heard from those
                that were within, even of those that walked upon the top of the
                palace, saying --</p>
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                <l rend="indent">Come in, come in;
                </l><l rend="indent">Eternal glory thou shalt win.</l>
                </lg>
                
                <p>So he went in, and was clothed with such garments as they.
                Then <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>  smiled and said; I think verily I know the meaning of
                this.
                
                </p><p>Now, said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, let me go hence. Nay, stay, said the
                <hi rend="italic">Interpreter</hi>, till I have shewed thee a little more, and
                after that thou shalt go on thy way. So he took him by the hand
                again, and led him into a very dark room, where there sat a man
                in an iron cage.
                
                </p><p>Now the man, to look on, seemed very sad; he sat with his eyes
                looking down to the ground, his hands folded together, and he
                sighed as if he would break his heart. Then said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, What
                means this? At which the <hi rend="italic">Interpreter</hi> bid him talk with the man.
                
                </p><p>Then said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> to the man, What art thou? The man answered,
                I am what I was not once.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> What wast thou once?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Man.</hi> The man said, I was once a fair and flourishing professor,
                both in mine own eyes, and also in the eyes of others; I once
                was, as I thought, fair for the Celestial City, and had then
                even joy at the thoughts that I should get thither.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Well, but what art thou now? Man. I am now a man of
                despair, and am shut up in it, as in this iron cage. I cannot
                get out. Oh, now I cannot!
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> But how camest thou in this condition?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Man.</hi> I left off to watch and be sober. I laid the reins, upon
                the neck of my lusts; I sinned against the light of the Word and
                the goodness of God; I have grieved the Spirit, and he is gone;
                I tempted the devil, and he is come to me; I have provoked God
                to anger, and he has left me: I have so hardened my heart, that
                I cannot repent.</p>
                
                <p>Then said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">Interpreter</hi>, But is there no hope for
                such a man as this? Ask him, said the <hi rend="italic">Interpreter</hi>. Nay, said
                <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, pray, Sir, do you.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Inter.</hi> Then said the <hi rend="italic">Interpreter</hi>, Is there no hope, but you must
                be kept in the iron cage of despair?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Man.</hi> No, none at all.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Inter.</hi> Why, the Son of the Blessed is very pitiful.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Man.</hi> I have crucified him to myself afresh; I have despised his
                person; I have despised his righteousness; I have <hi rend="italic">counted his
                blood an unholy thing</hi>; I have <hi rend="italic">done despite to the Spirit of
                grace</hi>. Therefore I have shut myself out of all the promises, and
                there now remains to me nothing but threatenings, dreadful
                threatenings, fearful threatenings, of certain judgment and
                fiery indignation, which shall devour me as an adversary.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Inter.</hi> For what did you bring yourself into this condition?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Man.</hi> For the lusts, pleasures, and profits of this world; in the
                enjoyment of which I did then promise myself much delight; but
                now every one of those things also bite me, and gnaw me like a
                burning worm.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Inter.</hi> But canst thou not now repent and turn?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Man.</hi> God hath denied me repentance. His Word gives me no
                encouragement to believe; yea, himself hath shut me up in this
                iron cage; nor can all the men in the world let me out. O
                eternity, eternity! how shall I grapple with the misery that I
                must meet with in eternity!
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Inter.</hi> Then said the <hi rend="italic">Interpreter</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, Let this man's
                misery be remembered by thee, and be an everlasting caution to
                thee.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Well, said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, this is fearful! God help me to watch
                and be sober, and to pray that I may shun the cause of this
                man's misery! Sir, is it not time for me to go on my way now?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Inter.</hi> Tarry till I shall shew thee one thing more, and then
                thou shalt go on thy way.</p>
                
                <p>So he took <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> by the hand again, and led him
                into a chamber, where there was one rising out of bed; and as he
                put on his raiment he shook and trembled. Then said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>,
                Why doth this man thus tremble? The <hi rend="italic">Interpreter</hi> then bid him
                tell to <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> the reason of his so doing. So he began and
                said, This night, as I was in my sleep, I dreamed, and behold
                the heavens grew exceeding black; also it thundered and
                lightened in most fearful wise, that it put me into an agony; so
                I looked up in my dream, and saw the clouds rack at an unusual
                rate, upon which I heard a great sound of a trumpet, and saw
                also a man sit upon a cloud, attended with the thousands of
                heaven; they were all in flaming fire: also the heavens were in
                a burning flame. I heard then a voice saying, <hi rend="italic">Arise, ye dead,
                and come to judgment</hi>; and with that the rocks rent, the graves
                opened, and the dead that were therein came forth. Some of them
                were exceeding glad, and looked upward; and some sought to hide
                themselves under the mountains. Then I saw the man that sat upon
                the cloud open the book, and bid the world draw near. Yet there
                was, by reason of a fierce flame which issued out and came from
                before him, a convenient distance betwixt him and them, as
                betwixt the judge and the prisoners at the bar. I heard it also
                proclaimed to them that attended on the man that sat on the
                cloud, Gather together the tares, the chaff, and stubble, and
                cast them into the burning lake. And with that, the bottomless
                pit opened, just whereabout I stood; out of the mouth of which
                there came, in an abundant manner, smoke and coals of fire, with
                hideous noises. It was also said to the same persons, Gather my
                wheat into the garner. And with that I saw many catched up and
                carried away into the clouds, but I was left behind. I also
                sought to hide myself, but I
                could not, for the man that sat upon the cloud still kept his
                eye upon me; my sins also came into my mind; and my conscience
                did accuse me on every side. Upon this I awaked from my sleep.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> But what is it that made you so afraid of this sight?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Man.</hi> Why, I thought that the day of judgment was come, and that
                I was not ready for it: but this frighted me most, that the
                angels gathered up several, and left me behind; also the pit of
                hell opened her mouth just where I stood. My conscience, too,
                afflicted me; and, as I thought, the Judge had always his eye
                upon me, shewing indignation in his countenance.</p>
                
                <p>Then said the <hi rend="italic">Interpreter</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, Hast thou considered all
                these things?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Yes, and they put me in hope and fear.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Inter.</hi> Well, keep all things so in thy mind that they may be as
                a goad in thy sides, to prick thee forward in the way thou must
                go. Then <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> began to gird up his loins, and to address
                himself to his journey. Then said the <hi rend="italic">Interpreter</hi>, The Comforter
                be always with thee, good <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, to guide thee in the way
                that leads to the City. So <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> went on his way, saying -- </p>

                <l rend="indent">Here I have seen things rare and profitable;
                </l><l rend="indent">Things pleasant, dreadful, things to make me stable
                </l><l rend="indent">In what I have begun to take in hand;
                </l><l rend="indent">Then let me think on them and understand
                </l><l rend="indent">Wherefore they shewed me were, and let me be
                </l><l rend="indent">Thankful, O good <hi rend="italic">Interpreter</hi>, to thee.</l>
                </lg>
                
                <p>Now I saw in my dream, that the highway up which <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> was
                to go, was fenced on either side with a
                wall, and that wall was called <hi rend="italic">Salvation</hi>. Up this way,
                therefore, did burdened <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> run, but not without great
                difficulty, because of the load on his back.</p>
                
                <p>He ran thus till he came at a place somewhat ascending, and upon
                that place stood a cross, and a little below, in the bottom, a
                sepulchre. So I saw in my dream, that just as <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> came up
                with the cross, his burden loosed from off his shoulders, and
                fell from off his back, and began to tumble, and so continued to
                do, till it came to the mouth of the sepulchre, where it fell
                in, and I saw it no more.
                
                </p><p>Then was <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> glad and lightsome, and said, with a merry
                heart, 'He hath given me rest by his sorrow, and life by his
                death.' Then he stood still awhile to look and wonder; for it
                was very surprising to him, that the sight of the cross should
                thus ease him of his burden. He looked therefore, and looked
                again, even till the springs that were in his head sent the
                waters down his cheeks. Now, as he stood looking and weeping,
                behold three Shining Ones came to him and saluted him with <hi rend="italic">Peace
                be unto thee.</hi> So the first said to him, <hi rend="italic">Thy sins be forgiven
                thee</hi>; the second stripped him of his rags, and clothed him <hi rend="italic">with
                change of raiment</hi>; the third also set a mark on his forehead,
                and gave him a roll with a seal upon it, which he bade him look
                on as he ran, and that he should give it in at the Celestial
                Gate. So they went their way.</p>
                
                <lg type="stanza">

                <p>Then <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> gave three leaps for joy, and went on singing --</p>

                <p>I saw then in my dream, that he went on thus, even until he came
                at a bottom, where he saw, a little out of the way, three men
                fast asleep, with fetters upon their heels. The name of the one
                was <hi rend="italic">Simple</hi>, another <hi rend="italic">Sloth</hi>, and the third <hi rend="italic">Presumption</hi>.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>  then seeing them lie in this case went to them, if
                peradventure he might awake them, and cried, You are like them
                that sleep on the top of a mast, for the Dead Sea is under you
                -- a gulf that hath no bottom. Awake, therefore, and come away;
                be willing also, and I will help you off with your irons. He
                also told them, If he that <hi rend="italic">goeth about like a roaring lion</hi> comes
                by, you will certainly become a prey to his teeth. With that
                they looked upon him, and began to reply in this sort: <hi rend="italic">Simple</hi>
                said, 'I see no danger;' <hi rend="italic">Sloth said</hi>, 'Yet a little more sleep;'
                and Presumption said, 'Every fat must stand upon its own bottom;
                what is the answer else that I should give thee?' And so they
                lay down to sleep again, and <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> went on his way.
                
                </p><p>Yet was he troubled to think that men in that danger
                should so little esteem the kindness of him that so freely
                offered to help them, both by awakening of them, counselling of
                them, and proffering to help them off with their irons. And as
                he was troubled thereabout, he espied two men come tumbling over
                the wall on the left hand of the narrow way; and they made up
                apace to him. The name of the one was <hi rend="italic">Formalist</hi>, and the name of
                the other <hi rend="italic">Hypocrisy</hi>. So, as I said, they drew up unto him, who
                thus entered with them into discourse.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Gentlemen, whence came you, and whither go you?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Form. and Hyp.</hi>
                We were born in the land of Vain-Glory, and are
                going for praise to Mount <hi rend="italic">Zion</hi>.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Why came you not in at the gate which standeth at the
                beginning of the way? Know you not that it is written, that he
                that cometh not in by the door, but climbeth up some other way,
                the same is a thief and a robber?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Form. and Hyp.</hi>  They said, That to go to the gate for entrance
                was, by all their countrymen, counted too far about; and that,
                therefore, their usual way was to make a short cut of it, and to
                climb over the wall, as they had done.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> But will it not be counted a trespass against the Lord of
                the city whither we are bound, thus to violate his revealed
                will?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Form. and Hyp.</hi>  They told him, that, as for that, he needed not
                to trouble his head thereabout; for what they did they had
                custom for; and could produce, if need were, testimony that
                would witness it for more than a thousand years.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> But, said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, will your practice stand a trial at
                law?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Form. and Hyp.</hi> They told him, That custom, it being of so long
                a standing as above a thousand years, would, doubtless, now be
                admitted as a thing legal by any impartial judge; and besides,
                said they, if we get into the way, what's matter which way we
                get in? if we are in, we are in; thou art but in the way, who,
                as we perceive, came in at the gate; and we are also in the way,
                that came tumbling over the wall; wherein, now, is thy condition
                better than ours?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> I walk by the rule of my Master: you walk by the rude
                working of your fancies. You are counted thieves already, by the
                Lord of the way; therefore, I doubt you will not be found true
                men at the end of the way. You come in by yourselves, without
                his direction; and shall go out by yourselves, without his
                mercy.</p>
                
                <p>To this they made him but little answer; only they bid him look
                to himself. Then I saw that they went on every man in his way
                without much conference one with another, save that these two
                men told <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, that as to laws and ordinances, they doubted
                not but they should as conscientiously do them as he; therefore,
                said they, we see not wherein thou differest from us but by the
                coat that is on thy back, which was, as we trow, given thee by
                some of thy neighbours, to hide the shame of thy nakedness.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> By laws and ordinances you will not be saved, since you
                came not in by the door. And as for this coat that is on my
                back, it was given me by the Lord of the place whither I go; and
                that, as you say, to cover my
                nakedness with. And I take it as a token of his kindness to me;
                for I had nothing but rags before. And besides, thus I comfort
                myself as I go: Surely, think I, when I come to the gate of the
                city, the Lord thereof will know me for good since I have this
                coat on my back -- a coat that he gave me freely in the day that
                he stripped me of my rags. I have, moreover, a mark in my
                forehead, of which, perhaps, you have taken no notice, which one
                of my Lord's most intimate associates fixed there in the day
                that my burden fell off my shoulders. I will tell you, moreover,
                that I had then given me a roll, sealed, to comfort me by
                reading as I go on the way; I was also bid to give it in at the
                <hi rend="italic">Celestial Gate</hi>, in token of my certain going in after it; all
                which things, I doubt, you want, and want them because you came
                not in at the gate.</p>
                
                <p>To these things they gave him no answer; only they looked upon
                each other, and laughed. Then, I saw that they went on all, save
                that <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> kept before, who had no more talk but with
                himself, and that sometimes sighingly, and sometimes
                comfortably; also he would be often reading in the roll that one
                of the Shining Ones gave him, by which he was refreshed.
                
                </p><p>I beheld, then, that they all went on till they came to the foot
                of the Hill <hi rend="italic">Difficulty</hi>; at the bottom of which was a spring.
                There were also in the same place two other ways besides that
                which came straight from the gate; one turned to the left hand,
                and the other to the right, at the bottom of the hill; but the
                narrow way lay right up the hill, and the name of the going up
                the side of the hill is called <hi rend="italic">Difficulty</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> now went to
                the spring, and drank thereof, to refresh himself, and then
                began to go up the hill, saying --</p>
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                <l rend="indent">The hill, though high, I covet to ascend,
                </l><l rend="indent">The difficulty will not me offend;
                </l><l rend="indent">For I perceive the way to life lies here.
                </l><l rend="indent">Come, pluck up heart, let's neither faint nor fear;
                </l><l rend="indent">Better, though difficult, the right way to go,
                </l><l rend="indent">Than wrong, though easy, where the end is woe.</l>
                </lg>
                
                <p>The other two also came to the foot of the hill; but when they
                saw that the hill was steep and high, and that there were two
                other ways to go, and supposing also that these two ways might
                meet again, with that up which <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> went, on the other side
                of the hill, therefore they were resolved to go in those ways.
                Now the name of one of these ways was <hi rend="italic">Danger</hi>, and the name of
                the other <hi rend="italic">Destruction</hi>. So the one took the way which is called
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Danger</hi> , which led him into a great wood, and the other took
                directly up the way to <hi rend="italic">Destruction</hi>, which led him into a wide
                field, full of dark mountains, where he stumbled and fell, and
                rose no more.</p>
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                <l rend="indent">Shall they who wrong begin yet rightly end?
                </l><l rend="indent">Shall they at all have safety for their friend?
                </l><l rend="indent">No, no; in headstrong manner they set out,
                </l><l rend="indent">And headlong will they fall at last, no doubt.</l>
                </lg>
                
                <p>I looked, then, after <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, to see him go up the hill,
                where I perceived he fell from running to going, and from going
                to clambering upon his hands and his knees, because of the
                steepness of the place. Now, about the midway to the top of the
                hill was a pleasant arbour, made by the Lord of the hill for the
                refreshing of weary travellers; thither, therefore, <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>
                got, where also
                he sat down to rest him. Then he pulled his roll out of his
                bosom, and read therein to his comfort; he also now began afresh
                to take a review of the coat or garment that was given him as he
                stood by the cross. Thus pleasing himself awhile, he at last
                fell into a slumber, and thence into a fast sleep, which
                detained him in that place until it was almost night; and in his
                sleep, his roll fell out of his hand. Now, as he was sleeping,
                there came one to him, and awaked him, saying, <hi rend="italic">Go to the ant,
                thou sluggard; consider her ways and be wise.</hi> And with that
                <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> started up, and sped him on his way, and went apace,
                till he came to the top of the hill.
                
                </p><p>Now, when he was got up to the top of the hill, there came two
                men running to meet him amain; the name of the one was <hi rend="italic">Timorous</hi>,
                and of the other, <hi rend="italic">Mistrust</hi>; to whom <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> said, Sirs, what's
                the matter? You run the wrong way. <hi rend="italic">Timorous</hi> answered, that they
                were going to the City of <hi rend="italic">Zion</hi>, and had got up that difficult
                place; but, said he, the further we go, the more danger we meet
                with; wherefore we turned, and are going back again.
                
                </p><p>Yes, said <hi rend="italic">Mistrust</hi>, for just before us lie a couple of lions in
                the way, whether sleeping or waking we know not, and we could
                not think, if we came within reach, but they would presently
                pull us in pieces.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Then said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, You make me afraid, but whither shall
                I fly to be safe? If I go back to mine own country, that is
                prepared for fire and brimstone, and I shall certainly perish
                there. If I can get to the Celestial City, I am sure to be in
                safety there. I must venture. To go back is nothing but death;
                to go forward is fear of death, and life-everlasting beyond it.
                I will yet go forward.</p>
                
                <p>So <hi rend="italic">Mistrust</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Timorous</hi> ran down the hill, and <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>
                went on his way. But, thinking again of what he had heard from
                the men, he felt in his bosom for his roll, that he might read
                therein, and be comforted; but he felt, and found it not. Then
                was <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> in great distress, and knew not what to do; for he
                wanted that which used to relieve him, and that which should
                have been his pass into the Celestial City. Here, therefore, he
                begun to be much perplexed, and knew not what to do. At last he
                bethought himself that he had slept in the arbour that is on the
                side of the hill; and, falling down upon his knees, he asked
                God's forgiveness for that his foolish act, and then went back
                to look for his roll. But all the way he went back, who can
                sufficiently set forth the sorrow of <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>'s heart?
                Sometimes he sighed, sometimes he wept, and oftentimes he chid
                himself for being so foolish to fall asleep in that place, which
                was erected only for a little refreshment for his weariness.
                Thus, therefore, he went back, carefully looking on this side
                and on that, all the way as he went, if happily he might find
                his roll, that had been his comfort so many times in his
                journey. He went thus, till he came again within sight of the
                arbour where he sat and slept; but that sight renewed his sorrow
                the more, by bringing again, even afresh, his evil of sleeping
                into his mind. Thus, therefore, he now went on bewailing his
                sinful sleep, saying, <hi rend="italic">O wretched man that I am!</hi> that I should
                sleep in the day-time! that I should sleep in the midst of
                difficulty! that I should so indulge the flesh, as to use that
                rest for ease to my flesh, which the Lord of the hill hath
                erected only for the relief of the spirits of pilgrims!</p>
                
                <p>How many steps have I took in vain! Thus it happened
                to Israel, for their sin; they were sent back again by the way
                of the Red Sea; and I am made to tread those steps with sorrow,
                which I might have trod with delight, had it not been for this
                sinful sleep. How far might I have been on my way by this time!
                I am made to tread those steps thrice over, which I needed not
                to have trod but once; yea, now also I am like to be benighted,
                for the day is almost spent. O, that I had not slept!</p>
                
                <p>Now, by this time he was come to the arbour again, where for a
                while he sat down and wept; but at last, as <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> would have
                it, looking sorrowfully down under the settle, there he espied
                his roll; the which he, with trembling and haste, catched up,
                and put it into his bosom. But who can tell how joyful this man
                was when he had gotten his roll again! for this roll was the
                assurance of his life and acceptance at the desired haven.
                Therefore he laid it up in his bosom, gave thanks to God for
                directing his eye to the place where it lay, and with joy and
                tears betook himself again to his journey. But oh, how nimbly
                now did he go up the rest of the hill! Yet, before he got up,
                the sun went down upon <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>; and this made him again recall
                the vanity of his sleeping to his remembrance; and thus he again
                began to condole with himself: O thou sinful sleep; how, for thy
                sake, am I like to be benighted in my journey! I must walk
                without the sun; darkness must cover the path of my feet; and I
                must hear the noise of the doleful creatures, because of my
                sinful sleep. Now also he remembered the story that <hi rend="italic">Mistrust</hi> and
                <hi rend="italic">Timorous</hi> told him of; how they were frighted with the sight of
                the lions. Then said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> to himself again, These beasts
                range in the night for their prey; and if they should meet with
                me in the dark, how
                should I shift them? How should I escape being by them torn in
                pieces? Thus he went on his way. But while he was thus bewailing
                his unhappy miscarriage, he lift up his eyes, and behold there
                was a very stately palace before him, the name of which was
                Beautiful; and it stood just by the highway side.</p>
                
                <p>So I saw in my dream that he made haste and went forward, that
                if possible he might get lodging there. Now, before he had gone
                far, he entered into a very narrow passage, which was about a
                furlong off the porter's lodge; and looking very narrowly before
                him as he went, he espied two lions in the way. Now, thought he,
                I see the dangers that <hi rend="italic">Mistrust</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Timorous</hi> were driven back
                by. (The lions were chained, but he saw not the chains.) Then he
                was afraid, and thought also himself to go back after them, for
                he thought nothing but death was before him. But the porter at
                the lodge, whose name is <hi rend="italic">Watchful</hi>, perceiving that <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>
                made a halt as if he would go back, cried unto him, saying, Is
                thy strength so small? Fear not the lions, for they are chained,
                and are placed there for trial of faith where it is, and for
                discovery of those that had none. Keep in the midst of the path,
                and no hurt shall come unto thee.</p>
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                <l rend="indent"><hi rend="italic">Difficulty</hi> is behind, Fear is before,
                </l><l rend="indent">Though he's got on the hill, the lions roar;
                </l><l rend="indent">A <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> man is never long at ease,
                </l><l rend="indent">When one fright's gone, another doth him seize.</l>
                </lg>
                
                <p>Then I saw that he went on, trembling for fear of the lions, but
                taking good heed to the directions of the porter; he heard them
                roar, but they did him no harm. Then
                he clapped his hands, and went on till he came and stood before
                the gate where the porter was. Then said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> to the
                porter, Sir, what house is this? And may I lodge here to-night?
                The porter answered, This house was built by the Lord of the
                hill, and he built it for the relief and security of pilgrims.
                The porter also asked whence he was, and whither he was going.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi>
                I am come from the City of <hi rend="italic">Destruction</hi>, and am going to
                Mount <hi rend="italic">Zion</hi>; but because the sun is now set, I desire, if I may,
                to lodge here to-night.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Por.</hi> What is your name?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> My name is now <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, but my name at the first was
                Graceless; I came of the race of <hi rend="italic">Japheth</hi>, whom God will persuade
                to dwell in the tents of <hi rend="italic">Shem.</hi>
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Por.</hi> But how doth it happen that you come so late? The sun is
                set.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> I had been here sooner, but that, <hi rend="italic">wretched man that I am!</hi>
                I slept in the arbour that stands on the hillside; nay, I had,
                notwithstanding that, been here much sooner, but that, in my
                sleep, I lost my evidence, and came without it to the brow of
                the hill; and then feeling for it, and finding it not, I was
                forced with sorrow of heart, to go back to the place where I
                slept my sleep, where I found it, and now I am come.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Por.</hi> Well, I will call out one of the virgins of this place, who
                will, if she likes your talk, bring you into the rest of the
                family, according to the rules of the house. So <hi rend="italic">Watchful</hi>, the
                porter, rang a bell, at the sound of which came out at the door
                of the house a grave and beautiful damsel, named <hi rend="italic">Discretion</hi>, and
                asked why she was called.</p>
                
                <p>The porter answered, This man is in a journey from
                the City of <hi rend="italic">Destruction</hi> to Mount <hi rend="italic">Zion</hi>, but being weary and
                benighted, he asked me if he might lodge here tonight; so I told
                him I would call for thee, who, after discourse had with him,
                mayest do as seemeth thee good, even according to the law of the
                house.
                
                </p><p>Then she asked him whence he was, and whither he was going, and
                he told her. She asked him also how he got into the way; and he
                told her. Then she asked him what he had seen and met with in
                the way; and he told, her. And last she asked his name; so he
                said, It is <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, and I have so much the more a desire to
                lodge here to-night, because, by what I perceive, this place was
                built by the Lord of the hill for the relief and security of
                pilgrims. So she smiled, but the water stood in her eyes; and
                after a little pause, she said, I will call forth two or three
                more of the family. So she ran to the door, and called out
                <hi rend="italic">Prudence</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Piety</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Charity</hi>, who, after a little more discourse
                with him, had him into the family; and many of them, meeting him
                at the threshold of the house, said, <hi rend="italic">Come in, thou blessed of
                the Lord</hi>; this house was built by the Lord of the hill, on
                purpose to entertain such pilgrims in. Then he bowed his head,
                and followed them into the house. So when he was come in and sat
                down, they gave him something to drink, and consented together,
                that until supper was ready, some of them should have some
                particular discourse with <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, for the best improvement of
                time; and they appointed <hi rend="italic">Piety</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Prudence</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Charity</hi> to
                discourse with him; and thus they began:
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Piety.</hi> Come, good <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, since we have been so loving to
                you, to receive you in our house this night, let us, if perhaps
                we may better ourselves thereby, talk with
                you of all things that have happened to you in your pilgrimage.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> With a very good will, and I am glad that you are so well
                disposed.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Piety.</hi> What moved you at first to betake yourself to a pilgrim's
                life?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> I was driven out of my native country by a dreadful sound
                that was in mine ears: to wit, that unavoidable destruction did
                attend me, if I abode in that place where I was.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Piety.</hi> But how did it happen that you came out of your country
                this way?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> It was as God would have it; for when I was under the fears
                of destruction, I did not know whither to go; but by chance
                there came a man, even to me, as I was trembling and weeping,
                whose name is <hi rend="italic">Evangelist</hi>, and he directed me to the wicket-gate,
                which else I should never have found, and so set me into the way
                that hath led me directly to this house.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Piety.</hi> But did you not come by the house of the <hi rend="italic">Interpreter</hi>?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Yes, and did see such things there, the remembrance of
                which will stick by me as long as I live; especially three
                things -- to wit, how Christ, in despite of Satan, maintains his
                work of grace in the heart; how the man had sinned himself quite
                out of hopes of God's mercy; and also the dream of him that
                thought in his sleep the day of judgment was come.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Piety.</hi> Why, did you hear him tell his dream?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Yes, and a dreadful one it was. I thought it made my heart
                ache as he was telling of it; but yet I am glad I heard it.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Piety.</hi> Was that all that you saw at the house of the <hi rend="italic">Interpreter</hi>?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> No; he took me and had me where he shewed me a stately
                palace, and how the people were clad in gold that were in it;
                and how there came a venturous man and cut his way through the
                armed men that stood in the door to keep him out, and how he was
                bid to come in, and win eternal glory. Methought those things
                did ravish my heart! I would have stayed at that good man's
                house a twelvemonth, but that I knew I had further to go.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Piety.</hi> And what saw you else in the way?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Saw! why, I went but a little further, and I saw one, as I
                thought in my mind, hang bleeding upon the tree; and the very
                sight of him made my burden fall off my back, (for I groaned
                under a very heavy burden,) but then it fell down from off me.
                It was a strange thing to me, for I never saw such a thing
                before; yea, and while I stood looking up, for then I could not
                forbear looking, three Shining Ones came to me. One of them
                testified that my sins were forgiven me; another stripped me of
                my rags, and gave me this broidered coat which you see; and the
                third set the mark which you see in my forehead, and gave me
                this sealed roll. (And with that he plucked it out of his
                bosom.)
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Piety.</hi> But you saw more than this, did you not?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> The things that I have told you were the best; yet some
                other matters I saw, as, namely -- I saw three men, <hi rend="italic">Simple</hi>,
                <hi rend="italic">Sloth</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Presumption</hi>, lie asleep a little out of the way, as
                I came, with irons upon their heels; but do you think I could
                awake them? I also saw <hi rend="italic">Formality</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hypocrisy</hi> come tumbling
                over the wall, to go, as they pretended, to <hi rend="italic">Zion</hi>, but they were
                quickly lost, even
                as I myself did tell them; but they would not believe. But above
                all, I found it hard work to get up this hill, and as hard to
                come by the lions' mouths, and truly if it had not been for the
                good man, the porter that stands at the gate, I do not know but
                that after all I might have gone back again; but now I thank God
                I am here, and I thank you for receiving of me.</p>
                
                <p>Then <hi rend="italic">Prudence</hi> thought good to ask him a few questions, and
                desired his answer to them.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Prud.</hi> Do you not think sometimes of the country from whence you
                came?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Yes, but with much shame and detestation -- <hi rend="italic">Truly, if I had
                been mindful of that country from whence I came out, I might
                have had opportunity to have returned; but now I desire a better
                country, that is, an heavenly.</hi>
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Prud.</hi> Do you not yet bear away with you some of the things that
                then you were conversant withal?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Yes, but greatly against my will; especially my inward and
                carnal cogitations, with which all my countrymen, as well as
                myself, were delighted; but now all those things are my grief;
                and might I but choose mine own things, I would choose never to
                think of those things more; but when I would be doing of that
                which is best, that which is worst is with me.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Prud.</hi> Do you not find sometimes as if those things were
                vanquished, which at other times are your perplexity?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Yes, but that is seldom; but they are to me golden hours in
                which such things happen to me.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Prud.</hi> Can you remember by what means you find your annoyances,
                at times, as if they were vanquished?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Yes, when I think what I saw at the cross, that will do it;
                and when I look upon my broidered coat, that will do it; also
                when I look into the roll that I carry in my bosom, that will do
                it; and when my thoughts wax warm about whither I am going, that
                will do it.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Prud.</hi> And what is it that makes you so desirous to go to Mount
                <hi rend="italic">Zion</hi>?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Why, there I hope to see him alive that did hang dead on
                the cross; and there I hope to be rid of all those things that
                to this day are in me an annoyance to me; there, they say, there
                is no death; and there I shall dwell with such company as I like
                best. For, to tell you truth, I love him, because I was by him
                eased of my burden; and I am weary of my inward sickness. I
                would fain be where I shall die no more, and with the company
                that shall continually cry, <hi rend="italic">Holy, Holy, Holy.</hi></p>
                
                <p>Then said <hi rend="italic">Charity</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, Have you a family? Are you a
                married man?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> I have a wife and four small children.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Char.</hi> And why did you not bring them along with you?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Then <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> wept, and said, Oh, how willingly would I
                have done it! but they were all of them utterly averse to my
                going on pilgrimage.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Char.</hi> But you should have talked to them, and have endeavoured
                to have shewn them the danger of being behind.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> So I did; and told them also of what God had shewn to me of
                the destruction of our city; <hi rend="italic">but I seemed to them as one that
                mocked,</hi> and they believed me not.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Char.</hi> And did you pray to God that he would bless your counsel
                to them?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Yes, and that with much affection: for you must think that
                my wife and poor children were very dear unto me.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Char.</hi> But did you tell them of your own sorrow, and fear of
                destruction? for I suppose that destruction was visible enough
                to you.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Yes, over, and over, and over. They might also see my fears
                in my countenance, in my tears, and also in my trembling under
                the apprehension of the judgment that did hang over our heads;
                but all was not sufficient to prevail with them to come with me.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Char.</hi> But what could they say for themselves, why they came not?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Why, my wife was afraid of losing this world, and my
                children were given to the foolish delights of youth: so what by
                one thing, and what by another, they left me to wander in this
                manner alone.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Char.</hi> But did you not, with your vain life, damp all that you by
                words used by way of persuasion to bring them away with you?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Indeed, I cannot commend my life; for I am conscious to
                myself of many failings therein; I know also that a man by his
                conversation may soon overthrow what by argument or persuasion
                he doth labour to fasten upon others for their good. Yet this I
                can say, I was very wary of giving them occasion, by any
                unseemly action, to make them averse to going on pilgrimage.
                Yea, for this very thing they would tell me I was too precise,
                and that I denied myself of things, for their sakes, in which
                they saw no evil. Nay, I think I may say, that if what they saw
                in me did hinder them, it was my great tenderness in
                sinning against God, or of doing any wrong to my neighbour.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Char.</hi> Indeed Cain hated his brother, <hi rend="italic">because his own works were
                evil, and his brother's righteous;</hi> and if thy wife and children
                have been offended with thee for this, they thereby shew
                themselves to be implacable to good, and <hi rend="italic">thou hast delivered thy
                soul from their blood.</hi></p>
                
                <p>Now I saw in my dream, that thus they sat talking together until
                supper was ready. So when they had made ready, they sat down to
                meat. Now the table was furnished <hi rend="italic">with fat things, and with wine
                that was well refined</hi>: and all their talk at the table was about
                the Lord of the hill; as, namely, about what he had done, and
                wherefore he did what he did, and why he had builded that house.
                And by what they said, I perceived that he had been a great
                warrior, and had fought with and slain <hi rend="italic">him that had the Power of
                death,</hi> but not without great danger to himself, which made me
                love him the more.
                
                </p><p>For as they said, and as I believe (said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>), he did it
                with the loss of much blood; but that which put glory of grace
                into all he did, was, that he did it out of pure love to his
                country. And besides, there were some of them of the household
                that said they had been and spoke with him since he did die on
                the cross; and they have attested that they had it from his own
                lips, that he is such a lover of poor pilgrims, that the like is
                not to be found from the east to the west.
                
                </p><p>They, moreover, gave an instance of what they affirmed, and that
                was, he had stripped himself of his glory, that he might do this
                for the poor; and that they heard him say and affirm, 'that he
                would not dwell in the
                mountain of <hi rend="italic">Zion</hi> alone.' They said, moreover, that he had made
                many pilgrims princes, though by nature they were beggars born,
                and their original had been the dunghill.
                
                </p><p>Thus they discoursed together till late at night; and after they
                had committed themselves to their Lord for protection, they
                betook themselves to rest: the <hi rend="italic">Pilgrim</hi> they laid in a large
                upper chamber, whose window opened towards the sun-rising: the
                name of the chamber was <hi rend="italic">Peace</hi>; where he slept till break of day
                and then he awoke and sang --</p>
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                <l rend="indent">Where am I now? Is this the love and care
                </l><l rend="indent">Of Jesus for the men that pilgrims are?
                </l><l rend="indent">Thus to provide that I should be forgiven!
                </l><l rend="indent">And dwell already the next door to heaven!</l></lg>
                
                <p>So in the morning they all got up; and, after some more
                discourse, they told him that he should not depart till they had
                shewn him the rarities of that place. And first they had him
                into the study, where they shewed him records of the greatest
                antiquity; in which, as I remember my dream, they shewed him
                first the pedigree of the Lord of the hill, that he was the son
                of the Ancient of Days, and came by that eternal generation.
                Here also was more fully recorded the acts that he had done, and
                the names of many hundreds that he had taken into his service;
                and how he had placed them in such habitations that could
                neither by length of days nor decays of nature be dissolved.
                
                </p><p>Then they read to him some of the worthy acts that some of his
                servants had done: as, how they had <hi rend="italic">subdued kingdoms,
                wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped
                the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the
                edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed
                valiant in fight, and turned to flight the armies of the aliens.</hi>
                
                </p><p>They then read again, in another part of the records of the
                house, where it was shewed how willing their Lord was to receive
                into his favour any, even any, though they in time past had
                offered great affronts to his person and proceedings. Here also
                were several other histories of many other famous things, of all
                which <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> had a view; as of things both ancient and
                modern; together with prophecies and predictions of things that
                have their certain accomplishment, both to the dread and
                amazement of enemies, and the comfort and solace of pilgrims.
                
                </p><p>The next day they took him and had him into the armoury, where
                they shewed him all manner of furniture, which their Lord had
                provided for pilgrims, as sword, shield, helmet, breastplate,
                <hi rend="italic">all-prayer</hi>, and shoes that would not wear out. And there was
                here enough of this to harness out as many men for the service
                of their Lord as there be stars in the heaven for multitude.
                
                </p><p>They also shewed him some of the engines with which some of his
                servants had done wonderful things. They shewed him <hi rend="italic">Moses</hi>' rod;
                the hammer and nail with which Jael slew Sisera; the pitchers,
                trumpets, and lamps too, with which Gideon put to flight the
                armies of Midian. Then they shewed him the ox's goad wherewith
                Shamgar slew six hundred men. They shewed him also the jaw-bone
                with which Samson did such mighty feats. They shewed him,
                moreover, the sling and stone with which David slew Goliath of
                Gath; and the sword, also,
                with which their Lord will kill the Man of Sin, in the day that
                he shall rise up to the prey. They shewed him, besides, many
                excellent things, with which <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> was much delighted. This
                done, they went to their rest again.
                
                </p><p>Then I saw in my dream, that on the morrow he got up to go
                forward; but they desired him to stay till the next day also;
                and then, said they, we will, if the day be clear, shew you the
                <hi rend="italic">Delectable Mountains</hi> , which, they said, would yet further add to
                his comfort, because they were nearer the desired haven than the
                place where at present he was; so he consented and stayed. When
                the morning was up, they had him to the top of the house, and
                bid him look south; so he did: and behold, at a great distance,
                he saw a most pleasant mountainous country, beautified with
                woods, vineyards, fruits of all sorts, flowers also, with
                springs and fountains, very delectable to behold. Then he asked
                the name of the country. They said it was <hi rend="italic">Immanuel's Land</hi>; and
                it is as common, said they, as this hill is, to and for all the
                pilgrims. And when thou comest there from thence, said they,
                thou mayest see to the gate of the Celestial City, as the
                shepherds that live there will make appear.
                
                </p><p>Now he bethought himself of setting forward, and they were
                willing he should. But first, said they, let us go again into
                the armoury. So they did; and when they came there, they
                harnessed him from head to foot with what was of proof, lest,
                perhaps, he should meet with assaults in the way. He being,
                therefore, thus accoutred, walketh out with his friends to the
                gate, and there he asked the porter if he saw any pilgrims pass
                by. Then the porter answered, Yes.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Pray, did you know him? said he.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Por.</hi> I asked him his name, and he told me it was <hi rend="italic">Faithful</hi>.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Oh, said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, I know him; he is my townsman, my near
                neighbour; he comes from the place where I was born. How far do
                you think he may be before?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Por.</hi> He is got by this time below the hill.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Well, said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, good <hi rend="italic">Porter</hi>, the Lord be with thee,
                and add to all thy blessings much increase, for the kindness
                that thou hast shewed to me.</p>
                
                <p>Then he began to go forward; but <hi rend="italic">Discretion</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Piety</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Charity</hi>, and
                <hi rend="italic">Prudence</hi> would accompany him down to the foot of the hill. So
                they went on together, reiterating their former discourses, till
                they came to go down the hill. Then said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, As it was
                difficult coming up, so, so far as I can see, it is dangerous
                going down. Yes, said <hi rend="italic">Prudence</hi>, so it is, for it is a hard
                matter for a man to go down into the Valley of <hi rend="italic">Humiliation</hi>, as
                thou art now, and to catch no slip by the way; therefore, said
                they, are we come out to accompany thee down the hill. So he
                began to go down, but very warily; yet he caught a slip or two.
                
                </p><p>Then I saw in my dream that these good companions, when
                <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> was gone to the bottom of the hill, gave him a loaf of
                bread, a bottle of wine, and a cluster of raisins; and then he
                went on his way.
                
                </p><p>But now, in this Valley of <hi rend="italic">Humiliation</hi>, poor <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> was hard
                put to it; for he had gone but a little way, before he espied a
                foul fiend coming over the field to meet him; his name is
                <hi rend="italic">Apollyon</hi>. Then did <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> begin to be afraid, and to cast in
                his mind whether to go back or to stand his ground. But he
                considered again that he had no armour for his back; and
                therefore thought that to
                turn the back to him might give him the greater advantage with
                ease to pierce him with his darts. Therefore he resolved to
                venture and stand his ground; for, thought he, had I no more in
                mine eye than the saving of my life, it would be the best way to
                stand.
                
                </p><p>So he went on, and <hi rend="italic">Apollyon</hi> met him. Now the monster was hideous
                to behold; he was clothed with scales, like a fish, (and they
                are his pride,) he had wings like a dragon, feet like a bear,
                and out of his belly came fire and smoke, and his mouth was as
                the mouth of a lion. When he was come up to <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, he beheld
                him with a disdainful countenance, and thus began to question
                with him.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Apol.</hi> Whence come you? and whither are you bound?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> I am come from the City of <hi rend="italic">Destruction</hi>, which is the place
                of all evil, and am going to the City of <hi rend="italic">Zion</hi>.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Apol.</hi> By this I perceive thou art one of my subjects, for all
                that country is mine, and I am the prince and god of it. How is
                it, then, that thou hast run away from thy king? Were it not
                that I hope thou mayest do me more service, I would strike thee
                now, at one blow, to the ground.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> I was born, indeed, in your dominions, but your service was
                hard, and your wages such as a man could not live on, <hi rend="italic">for the
                wages of sin is death</hi>; therefore, when I was come to years, I
                did, as other considerate persons do, look out, if, perhaps, I
                might mend myself.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Apol.</hi> There is no prince that will thus lightly lose his
                subjects, neither will I as yet lose thee; but since thou
                complainest of thy service and wages, be content to go back:
                what our country will afford, I do here promise to give thee.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> But I have let myself to another, even to the King of

                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Apol.</hi> Thou hast done in this, according to the proverb, 'Changed
                a bad for a worse;' but it is ordinary for those that have
                professed themselves his servants, after a while to give him the
                slip, and return again to me. Do thou so too, and all shall be

                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> I have given him my faith, and sworn my allegiance to him;
                how, then, can I go back from this, and not be hanged as a

                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Apol.</hi> Thou didst the same to me, and yet I am willing to pass by
                all, if now thou wilt yet turn again and go back.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> What I promised thee was in my nonage; and, besides, I
                count the Prince under whose banner now I stand is able to
                absolve me; yea, and to pardon also what I did as to my
                compliance with thee; and besides, O thou destroying <hi rend="italic">Apollyon</hi>!
                to speak truth, I like his service, his wages, his servants, his
                government, his company, and country, better than thine; and,
                therefore, leave off to persuade me further; I am his servant,
                and I will follow him.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Apol.</hi> Consider, again, when thou art in cool blood, what thou
                art like to meet with in the way that thou goest. Thou knowest
                that, for the most part, his servants come to an ill end,
                because they are transgressors against me and my ways. How many
                of them have been put to shameful deaths! and, besides, thou
                countest his service better than mine, whereas he never came yet
                from the place where he is to deliver any that served him out of
                their hands; but as for me, how many times, as all the world
                very well knows, have I delivered, either by power,
                or fraud, those that have faithfully served me, from him and
                his, though taken by them; and so I will deliver thee.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> His forbearing at present to deliver them is on purpose to
                try their love, whether they will cleave to him to the end; and
                as for the ill end thou sayest they come to, that is most
                glorious in their account; for, for present deliverance, they do
                not much expect it, for they stay for their glory, and then they
                shall have it when their Prince comes in his and the glory of
                the angels.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Apol.</hi> Thou hast already been unfaithful in thy service to him;
                and how dost thou think to receive wages of him?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Wherein, O <hi rend="italic">Apollyon</hi>! have I been unfaithful to him?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Apol.</hi> Thou didst faint at first setting out, when thou wast
                almost choked in the Gulf of <hi rend="italic">Despond</hi>; thou didst attempt wrong
                ways to be rid of thy burden, whereas thou shouldst have stayed
                till thy Prince had taken it off; thou didst sinfully sleep and
                lose thy choice thing; thou wast, also, almost persuaded to go
                back at the sight of the lions; and when thou talkest of thy
                journey, and of what thou hast heard and seen, thou art inwardly
                desirous of vain-glory in all that thou sayest or doest.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> All this is true, and much more which thou hast left out;
                but the Prince whom I serve and honour is merciful, and ready to
                forgive; but, besides, these infirmities possessed me in thy
                country, for there I sucked them in; and I have groaned under
                them, been sorry for them, and have obtained pardon of my
                Prince.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Apol.</hi> Then <hi rend="italic">Apollyon</hi> broke out into a grievous rage, saying, I am
                an enemy to this Prince; I hate his person,
                his laws, and people; I am come out on purpose to withstand
                thee.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> <hi rend="italic">Apollyon</hi>, beware what you do; for I am in the King's
                highway, the way of holiness; therefore take heed to yourself.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Apol.</hi> Then <hi rend="italic">Apollyon</hi> straddled quite over the whole breadth of
                the way, and said, I am void of fear in this matter: prepare
                thyself to die; for I swear by my infernal den, that thou shalt
                go no further; here will I spill thy soul. And with that he
                threw a flaming dart at his breast; but <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> had a shield
                in his hand, with which he caught it, and so prevented the
                danger of that.</p>
                
                <p>Then did <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> draw, for he saw it was time to bestir him;
                and <hi rend="italic">Apollyon</hi> as fast made at him, throwing darts as thick as
                hail; by the which, notwithstanding all that <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> could do
                to avoid it, <hi rend="italic">Apollyon</hi> wounded him in his head, his hand, and
                foot. This made <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> give a little back; <hi rend="italic">Apollyon</hi>,
                therefore, followed his work amain, and <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> again took
                courage, and resisted as manfully as he could. This sore combat
                lasted for above half a day, even till <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> was almost
                quite spent; for you must know that <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, by reason of his
                wounds, must needs grow weaker and weaker.
                
                </p><p>Then <hi rend="italic">Apollyon</hi>, espying his opportunity, began to gather up close
                to <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, and wrestling with him, gave him a dreadful fall;
                and with that <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>'s sword flew out of his hand. Then said
                <hi rend="italic">Apollyon</hi>, I am sure of thee now. And with that he had almost
                pressed him to death, so that <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> began to despair of
                life; but as God would have it, while <hi rend="italic">Apollyon</hi> was fetching of
                his last blow, thereby to make a full end of this good man,
                <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> nimbly stretched out his hand for his sword, and caught it,
                saying, <hi rend="italic">Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy; when I fall I
                shall arise</hi>; and with that gave him a deadly thrust, which made
                him give back, as one that had received his mortal wound.
                <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> perceiving that, made at him again, saying, <hi rend="italic">Nay, in
                all these things we are more than conquerors through him that
                loved us</hi>. And with that <hi rend="italic">Apollyon</hi> spread forth his dragon's
                wings, and sped him away, that <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> for a season saw him no
                more.
                
                </p><p>In this combat no man can imagine, unless he had seen and heard
                as I did, what yelling and hideous roaring <hi rend="italic">Apollyon</hi> made all the
                time of the fight -- he spake like a dragon; and, on the other
                side, what sighs and groans burst from <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>'s heart. I
                never saw him all the while give so much as one pleasant look,
                till he perceived he had wounded <hi rend="italic">Apollyon</hi> with his two-edged
                sword; then, indeed, he did smile, and look upward; but it was
                the dreadfullest sight that ever I saw.</p>
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                <l rend="indent">A more unequal match can hardly be, --
                </l><l rend="indent"><hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> must fight an Angel; but you see,

                <p>So when the battle was over, <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> said, I will here give
                thanks to him that delivered me out of the mouth of the lion, to
                him that did help me against <hi rend="italic">Apollyon</hi>. And so he did, saying --</p>

                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                <l rend="indent">But blessed Michael helped me, and I,

                </lg>
                
                <p>Then there came to him a hand, with some of the leaves of the
                tree of life, the which <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> took, and applied to the
                wounds that he had received in the battle, and was healed
                immediately. He also sat down in that place to eat bread, and to
                drink of the bottle that was given him a little before; so,
                being refreshed, he addressed himself to his journey, with his
                sword drawn in his hand; for he said, I know not but some other
                enemy may be at hand. But he met with no other affront from
                <hi rend="italic">Apollyon</hi> quite through this valley.
                
                </p><p>Now, at the end of this valley was another, called the Valley of
                the <hi rend="italic">Shadow of Death</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> must needs go through it,
                because the way to the Celestial City lay through the midst of
                it. Now, this valley is a very solitary place. The prophet
                Jeremiah thus describes it: -- <hi rend="italic">'A wilderness, a land of deserts
                and of pits, a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, a
                land that no man'</hi> (but a Christian)<hi rend="italic"> 'passed through, and where
                no man dwelt.'</hi>
                
                </p><p>Now here <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> was worse put to it than in his fight with
                <hi rend="italic">Apollyon</hi>, as by the sequel you shall see. I saw then in my
                dream, that when <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> was got to the borders of the shadow
                of Death, there met him two men, children of them that brought
                up an evil report of the good land, making haste to go back; to
                whom <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> spake as follows: --
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Whither are you going?
                
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Men.</hi> They said, Back! back! and we would have you to do so too,
                if either life or peace is prized by you.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Why, what's the matter? said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Men.</hi> Matter! said they; we were going that way as you are going,
                and went as, far as we durst; and indeed we were almost past
                coming back; for had we gone a little further, we had not been
                here to bring the news to thee.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> But what have you met with? said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Men.</hi> Why, we were almost in the Valley of the Shadow of Death;
                but that, by good hap, we looked before us, and saw the danger
                before we came to it.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> But what have you seen? said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>. Men. Seen! Why, the
                Valley itself, which is as dark as pitch; we also saw there the
                hobgoblins, satyrs, and dragons of the pit; we heard also in
                that Valley a continual howling and yelling, as of a people
                under unutterable misery, who there sat bound in affliction and
                irons; and over that Valley hangs the discouraging clouds of
                confusion. Death also doth always spread his wings over it. In
                a word, it is every whit dreadful, being utterly without order.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Then, said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, I perceive not yet, by what you have
                said, but that this is my way to the desired haven.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Men.</hi> Be it thy way; we will not choose it for ours. So, they
                parted, and <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> went on his way, but still with his sword
                drawn in his hand, for fear lest he should be assaulted.
                
                </p><p>I saw then in my dream, so far as this valley reached, there was
                on the right hand a very deep ditch; that ditch is it into which
                the blind have led the blind in all ages,
                and have both there miserably perished. Again, behold, on the
                left hand, there was a very dangerous quag, into which, if even
                a good man falls, he can find no bottom for his foot to stand
                on. Into that quag King David once did fall, and had no doubt
                therein been smothered, had not HE that is able plucked him out.
                
                </p><p>The pathway was here also exceeding narrow, and therefore good
                <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> was the more put to it; for when he sought, in the
                dark, to shun the ditch on the one hand, he was ready to tip
                over into the mire on the other; also when he sought to escape
                the mire, without great carefulness he would be ready to fall
                into the ditch. Thus he went on, and I heard him here sigh
                bitterly; for, besides the dangers mentioned above, the pathway
                was here so dark, and ofttimes, when he lift up his foot to set
                forward, he knew not where or upon what he should set it next.</p>
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                <l rend="indent">Poor man! where art thou now? thy day is night.
                </l><l rend="indent">Good man, be not cast down, thou yet art right,

                </lg>
                
                <p>About the midst of this valley, I perceived the mouth of hell to
                be, and it stood also hard by the wayside. Now, thought
                <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, what shall I do? And ever and anon the flame and
                smoke would come out in such abundance, with sparks and hideous
                noises, (things that cared not for <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>'s sword, as did
                <hi rend="italic">Apollyon</hi>  before,) that he was forced to put up his sword, and
                betake himself to another weapon called all-prayer. So he cried,
                in my hearing, <hi rend="italic">O Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.</hi> Thus he
                went on
                a great while, yet still the flames would be reaching towards
                him. Also he heard doleful voices, and rushings to and fro, so
                that sometimes he thought he should be torn in pieces, or
                trodden down like mire in the streets. This frightful sight was
                seen, and these dreadful noises were heard by him for several
                miles together; and, coming to a place where he thought he heard
                a company of fiends coming forward to meet him, he stopped, and
                began to muse what he had best to do. Sometimes he had half a
                thought to go back; then again he thought he might be half way
                through the valley; he remembered also how he had already
                vanquished many a danger, and that the danger of going back
                might be much more than for to go forward; so he resolved to go
                on. Yet the fiends seemed to come nearer and nearer; but when
                they were come even almost at him, he cried out with a most
                vehement voice, <hi rend="italic">I will walk in the strength of the Lord God!</hi> so
                they gave back, and came no further.
                
                </p><p>One thing I would not let slip. I took notice that now, poor
                <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> was so confounded, that he did not know his own voice;
                and thus I perceived it. Just when he was come over against the
                mouth of the burning pit, one of the wicked ones got behind him,
                and stept up softly to him, and whisperingly suggested many
                grievous blasphemies to him, which he verily thought had
                proceeded from his own mind. This put <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> more to it than
                anything that he met with before, even to think that he should
                now blaspheme him that he loved so much before; yet, if he could
                have helped it, he would not have done it; but he had not the
                discretion either to stop his ears, or to know from whence these
                blasphemies came.
                
                </p><p>When <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> had travelled in this disconsolate condition
                some considerable time, he thought he heard the voice of
                a man, as going before him, saying, <hi rend="italic">Though I walk through the
                valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art
                with me.</hi>
                
                </p><p>Then he was glad, and that for these reasons: --
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">First</hi> , Because he gathered from thence, that some who feared God
                were in this valley as well as himself.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Secondly</hi> , For that he perceived God was with them, though in
                that dark and dismal state; and why not, thought he, with me?
                though, by reason of the impediment that attends this place, I
                cannot perceive it.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Thirdly</hi> , For that he hoped, could he overtake them, to have
                company by and by. So he went on, and called to him that was
                before; but he knew not what to answer; for that he also thought
                himself to be alone. And by and by the day broke; then said
                <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> , He hath turned <hi rend="italic">the shadow of death into the morning.</hi>
                
                </p><p>Now morning being come, he looked back, not out of desire to
                return, but to see, by the light of the day, what hazards he had
                gone through in the dark. So he saw more perfectly the ditch
                that was on the one hand, and the quag that was on the other;
                also how narrow the way was which led betwixt them both; also
                now he saw the hobgoblins, and satyrs, and dragons of the pit,
                but all afar off, (for after break of day, they came not nigh;)
                yet they were discovered to him, according to that which is
                written, <hi rend="italic">He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and
                bringeth out to light the shadow of death.</hi>
                
                </p><p>Now was <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> much affected with his deliverance from all
                the dangers of his solitary way; which dangers, though he feared
                them more before, yet he saw them more clearly now, because the
                light of the day made them
                conspicuous to him. And about this time the sun was rising, and
                this was another mercy to <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>; for you must note, that
                though the first part of the Valley of the <hi rend="italic">Shadow of Death</hi> was
                dangerous, yet this second part which he was yet to go, was, if
                possible, far more dangerous; for from the place where he now
                stood, even to the end of the valley, the way was all along set
                so full of snares, traps, gins, and nets here, and so full of
                pits, pitfalls, deep holes, and shelvings down there, that, had
                it now been dark, as it was when he came the first part of the
                way, had he had a thousand souls, they had in reason been cast
                away; but, as I said just now, the sun was rising. Then said he,
                <hi rend="italic">His candle shineth upon my head, and by his light I walk through
                darkness.</hi>
                
                </p><p>In this light, therefore, he came to the end of the valley. Now
                I saw in my dream, that at the end of this valley lay blood,
                bones, ashes, and mangled bodies of men, even of pilgrims that
                had gone this way formerly; and while I was musing what should
                be the reason, I espied a little before me a cave, where two
                giants, <hi rend="italic">Pope</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pagan</hi>, dwelt in old time; by whose power and
                tyranny the men whose bones, blood, and ashes, &amp;c., lay there,
                were cruelly put to death. But by this place <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> went
                without much danger, whereat I somewhat wondered; but I have
                learnt since, that <hi rend="italic">Pagan</hi> has been dead many a day; and as for
                the other, though he be yet alive, he is, by reason of age, and
                also of the many shrewd brushes that he met with in his younger
                days, grown so crazy and stiff in his joints, that he can now do
                little more than sit in his cave's mouth, grinning at pilgrims
                as they go by, and biting his nails because he cannot come at
                them.
                
                </p><p>So I saw that <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> went on his way; yet, at the sight of
                the <hi rend="italic">Old Man</hi> that sat in the mouth of the cave, he could not tell
                what to think, especially because he spake to him, though he
                could not go after him, saying, You will never mend till more of
                you be burned. But he held his peace, and set a good face on it,
                and so went by and catched no hurt. Then sang <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>: -- </p>
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                <l rend="indent">O world of wonders! (I can say no less,)
                </l><l rend="indent">That I should be preserved in that distress
                </l><l rend="indent">That I have met with here! O blessed be
                </l><l rend="indent">That hand that from it hath deliver'd me!
                </l><l rend="indent">Dangers in darkness, devils, hell, and sin
                </l><l rend="indent">Did compass me, while I this vale was in:
                </l><l rend="indent">Yea, snares, and pits, and traps, and nets, did lie
                </l><l rend="indent">My path about, that worthless, silly I
                </l><l rend="indent">Might have been catch'd, entangled, and cast down;
                </l><l rend="indent">But since I live, let JESUS wear the crown.</l>
                </lg>
                
                <p>Now, as <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> went on his way, he came to a little ascent,
                which was cast up on purpose that pilgrims might see before
                them. Up there, therefore, <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> went, and looking forward,
                he saw <hi rend="italic">Faithful</hi> before him, upon his journey. Then said
                <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> aloud, Ho! ho! So-ho! stay, and I will be your
                companion! At that, <hi rend="italic">Faithful</hi> looked behind him; to whom
                <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> cried again, Stay, stay, till I come up to you! But
                <hi rend="italic">Faithful</hi> answered, No, I am upon my life, and the avenger of
                blood is behind me.
                
                </p><p>At this, <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> was somewhat moved, and putting to all his
                strength, he quickly got up with <hi rend="italic">Faithful</hi>, and did also overrun
                him; so the last was first. Then did <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> vain-gloriously
                smile, because he had gotten
                the start of his brother; but not taking good heed to his feet,
                he suddenly stumbled and fell, and could not rise again until
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faithful</hi>  came up to help him.
                
                </p><p>Then I saw in my dream they went very lovingly on together, and
                had sweet discourse of all things that had happened to them in
                their pilgrimage; and thus <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> began: --
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> My honoured and well-beloved brother, <hi rend="italic">Faithful</hi>, I am glad
                that I have overtaken you; and that God has so tempered our
                spirits, that we can walk as companions in this so pleasant a
                path.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> I had thought, dear friend, to have had your company
                quite from our town; but you did get the start of me, wherefore
                I was forced to come thus much of the way alone.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> How long did you stay in the City of <hi rend="italic">Destruction</hi> before you
                set out after me on your pilgrimage?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> Till I could stay no longer; for there was great talk
                presently after you were gone out that our city would, in short
                time, with fire from heaven, be burned down to the ground.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> What! did your neighbours talk so?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> Yes, it was for a while in everybody's mouth.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> What! and did no more of them but you come out to escape
                the danger?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> Though there was, as I said, a great talk thereabout, yet
                I do not think they did firmly believe it. For in the heat of
                the discourse, I heard some of them deridingly speak of you and
                of your desperate journey, (for so they called this your
                pilgrimage,) but I did believe, and do still, that the end of
                our city will be with fire and
                brimstone from above; and therefore I have made my escape.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Did you hear no talk of neighbour <hi rend="italic">Pliable</hi>?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> Yes, <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, I heard that he followed you till he came
                at the Slough of <hi rend="italic">Despond</hi>, where, as some said, he fell in; but
                he would not be known to have so done; but I am sure he was
                soundly bedabbled with that kind of dirt.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> And what said the neighbours to him?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> He hath, since his going back, been had greatly in
                derision, and that among all sorts of people; some do mock and
                despise him; and scarce will any set him on work. He is now
                seven times worse than if he had never gone out of the city.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> But why should they be so set against him, since they also
                despise the way that he forsook?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> Oh, they say, hang him, he is a turncoat! he was not true
                to his profession. I think God has stirred up even his enemies
                to hiss at him, and make him a proverb, because he hath forsaken
                the way.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Had you no talk with him before you came out?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> I met him once in the streets, but he leered away on the
                other side, as one ashamed of what he had done; so I spake not
                to him.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Well, at my first setting out, I had hopes of that man; but
                now I fear he will perish in the overthrow of the city; for it
                is happened to him according to the true proverb, <hi rend="italic">The dog is
                turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed, to
                her wallowing in the mire.</hi>
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> These are my fears of him too; but who can hinder that
                which will be?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Well, neighbour <hi rend="italic">Faithful</hi>, said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, let us leave him,
                and talk of things that more immediately concern ourselves. Tell
                me now, what you have met with in the way as you came; for I
                know you have met with some things, or else it may be writ for
                a wonder.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> I escaped the Slough that I perceived you fell into, and
                got up to the gate without that danger; only I met with one
                whose name was <hi rend="italic">Wanton</hi>, who had like to have done me a mischief.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> It was well you escaped her net; Joseph was hard put to it
                by her, and he escaped her as you did; but it had like to have
                cost him his life. But what did she do to you?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> You cannot think, but that you know something, what a
                flattering tongue she had; she lay at me hard to turn aside with
                her, promising me all manner of content.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Nay, she did not promise you the content of a good
                conscience.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> You know what I mean; all carnal and fleshly content.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Thank God you have escaped her: <hi rend="italic">The abhorred of the Lord
                shall fall into her ditch.</hi>
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> Nay, I know not whether I did wholly escape her or no.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Why, I trow, you did not consent to her desires?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> No, not to defile myself; for I remembered an old writing
                that I had seen, which said, <hi rend="italic">Her steps take hold on hell.</hi> So I
                shut mine eyes, because I would not be bewitched with her looks.
                Then she railed on me, and I went my way.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Did you meet with no other assault as you came?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> When I came to the foot of the hill called <hi rend="italic">Difficulty</hi>,
                I met with a very aged man, who asked me what I was,
                and whither bound. I told him that I am a pilgrim, going to the
                Celestial City. Then said the old man, Thou lookest like an
                honest fellow; wilt thou be content to dwell with me for the
                wages that I shall give thee? Then I asked him his name, and
                where he dwelt. He said his name was <hi rend="italic">Adam the First</hi>, and that he
                dwelt in the town of <hi rend="italic">Deceit</hi>. I asked him then what was his work,
                and what the wages he would give. He told me that his work was
                many delights; and his wages that I should be his heir at last.
                I further asked him what house he kept, and what other servants
                he had. So he told me that his house was maintained with all the
                dainties in the world; and that his servants were those of his
                own begetting. Then I asked if he had any children. He said that
                he had but three daughters: <hi rend="italic">The Lust of the Flesh</hi>, <hi rend="italic">The Lust of
                the Eyes</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">The Pride of Life</hi>, and that I should marry them
                all if I would. Then I asked how long time he would have me live
                with him? And he told me, As long as he lived himself.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Well, and what conclusion came the old man and you to at
                last?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> Why, at first, I found myself somewhat inclinable to go
                with the man, for I thought he spake very fair; but looking in
                his forehead, as I talked with him, I saw there written, <hi rend="italic">Put off
                the old man with his deeds</hi>.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> And how then?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> Then it came burning hot into my mind, whatever he said,
                and however he flattered, when he got me home to his house, he
                would sell me for a slave. So I bid him forbear to talk, for I
                would not come near the door
                of his house. Then he reviled me, and told me that he would send
                such a one after me, that should make my way bitter to my soul.
                So I turned to go away from him; but just as I turned myself to
                go thence, I felt him take hold of my flesh, and give me such a
                deadly twitch back, that I thought he had pulled part of me
                after himself. This made me cry, <hi rend="italic">O wretched man!</hi> So I went on my
                way up the hill.
                
                </p><p>Now when I had got about half-way up, I looked behind, and saw
                one coming after me, swift as the wind; so he overtook me just
                about the place where the settle stands.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Just there, said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, did I sit down to rest me; but
                being overcome with sleep, I there lost this roll out of my
                bosom.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> But, good brother, hear me out. So soon as the man
                overtook me, he was but a word and a blow, for down he knocked
                me, and laid me for dead. But when I was a little come to myself
                again, I asked him wherefore he served me so. He said, because
                of my secret inclining to <hi rend="italic">Adam the First</hi>; and with that he
                struck me another deadly blow on the breast, and beat me down
                backward; so I lay at his foot as dead as before. So, when I
                came to myself again, I cried him mercy; but he said, I know not
                how to shew mercy; and with that he knocked me down again. He
                had doubtless made an end of me, but that one came by, and bid
                him forbear.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Who was that that bid him forbear?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> I did not know him at first, but as he went by, I
                perceived the holes in his hands and in his side; then I
                concluded that he was our Lord. So I went up the hill.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> That man that overtook you was <hi rend="italic">Moses</hi>. He
                spareth none, neither knoweth he how to shew mercy to those that
                transgress his law.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> I know it very well; it was not the first time that he
                has met with me. It was he that came to me when I dwelt securely
                at home, and that told me he would burn my house over my head if
                I stayed there.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> But did you not see the house that stood there on the top
                of the hill, on the side of which <hi rend="italic">Moses</hi> met you?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> Yes, and the lions too, before I came at it: but for the
                lions, I think they were asleep, for it was about noon; and
                because I had so much of the day before me, I passed by the
                porter, and came down the hill.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> He told me, indeed, that he saw you go by, but I wish you
                had called at the house, for they would have shewed you so many
                rarities, that you would scarce have forgot them to the day of
                your death. But pray tell me, Did you meet nobody in the Valley
                of <hi rend="italic">Humility</hi>?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> Yes, I met with one <hi rend="italic">Discontent</hi>, who would willingly have
                persuaded me to go back again with him; his reason was, for that
                the valley was altogether without honour. He told me, moreover,
                that there to go was the way to disobey all my friends, as
                <hi rend="italic">Pride</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Arrogancy</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Self-conceit</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Worldly-glory</hi>, with others, who
                he knew, as he said, would be very much offended, if I made such
                a fool of myself as to wade through this valley.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Well, and how did you answer him?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> I told him, that although all these that he named might
                claim kindred of me, and that rightly, for indeed they were my
                relations according to the flesh; yet since I became a pilgrim,
                they have disowned me, as I also have rejected them; and
                therefore they were to me now no more than if they had never
                been of my lineage.
                
                </p><p>I told him, moreover, that as to this valley, he had quite
                misrepresented the thing; <hi rend="italic">for before honour is humility, and a
                haughty spirit before a fall.</hi> Therefore, said I, I had rather go
                through this valley to the honour that was so accounted by the
                wisest, than choose that which he esteemed most worthy our
                affections.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Met you with nothing else in that valley?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> Yes, I met with <hi rend="italic">Shame</hi>; but of all the men that I met with
                in my pilgrimage, he, I think, bears the wrong name. The others
                would be said nay, after a little argumentation, and somewhat
                else; but this bold-faced <hi rend="italic">Shame</hi> would never have done.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Why, what did he say to you?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> What! why, he objected against religion itself; he said
                it was a pitiful, low, sneaking business for a man to mind
                religion; he said that a tender conscience was an unmanly thing;
                and that for a man to watch over his words and ways, so as to
                tie up himself from that hectoring liberty that the brave
                spirits of the times accustom themselves unto, would make him
                the ridicule of the times. He objected also, that but few of the
                mighty, rich, or wise, were ever of my opinion; nor any of them
                neither, before they were persuaded to be fools, and to be of a
                voluntary fondness, to venture the loss of all, for nobody knows
                what. He, moreover, objected the base and low estate and
                condition of those that were chiefly the pilgrims of the times
                in which they lived: also their ignorance and want of
                understanding in all natural science. Yea, he did hold me to it
                at that rate also, about a great many more things than here I
                relate; as, that it was a shame to sit whining and mourning
                under a sermon, and a shame to come sighing and groaning home:
                that it was
                a shame to ask my neighbour forgiveness for petty faults, or to
                make restitution where I have taken from any. He said, also,
                that religion made a man grow strange to the great, because of
                a few vices, which he called by finer names; and made him own
                and respect the base, because of the same religious fraternity.
                And is not this, said he, a <hi rend="italic">shame</hi>?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> And what did you say to him?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> Say! I could not tell what to say at the first. Yea, he
                put me so to it, that my blood came up in my face; even this
                <hi rend="italic">Shame</hi> fetched it up, and had almost beat me quite off. But at
                last I began to consider, that <hi rend="italic">that which is highly esteemed
                among men, is had in abomination with God.</hi> And I thought again,
                this <hi rend="italic">Shame</hi> tells me what men are; but it tells me nothing what
                God or the Word of God is. And I thought, moreover, that at the
                day of doom, we shall not be doomed to death or life according
                to the hectoring spirits of the world, but according to the
                wisdom and law of the Highest. Therefore, thought I, what God
                says is best, indeed is best, though all the men in the world
                are against it. Seeing, then, that God prefers his religion;
                seeing God prefers a tender conscience; seeing they that make
                themselves fools for the kingdom of heaven are wisest; and that
                the poor man that loveth Christ is richer than the greatest man
                in the world that hates him; <hi rend="italic">Shame</hi>, depart, thou art an enemy to
                my salvation! Shall I entertain thee against my sovereign Lord?
                How then shall I look him in the face at his coming? Should I
                now be ashamed of his ways and servants, how can I expect the
                blessing? But, indeed, this <hi rend="italic">Shame</hi> was a bold villain; I could
                scarce shake him out of my company; yea, he would be haunting of
                me, and continually
                whispering me in the ear, with some one or other of the
                infirmities that attend religion; but at last I told him it was
                but in vain to attempt further in this business; for those
                things that he disdained, in those did I see most glory; and so
                at last I got past this importunate one. And when I had shaken
                him off, then I began to sing --</p>
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                <l rend="indent">The trials that those men do meet withal,

                <p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> I am glad, my brother, that thou didst withstand this
                villain so bravely; for of all, as thou sayest, I think he has
                the wrong name; for he is so bold as to follow us in the
                streets, and to attempt to put us to shame before all men: that
                is, to make us ashamed of that which is good; but if he was not
                himself audacious, he would never attempt to do as he does. But
                let us still resist him; for notwithstanding all his bravadoes,
                he promoteth the fool and none else. <hi rend="italic">The wise shall inherit
                glory, said Solomon, but shame shall be the promotion of fools.</hi>
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> I think we must cry to Him for help against <hi rend="italic">Shame</hi>, who
                would have us to be valiant for the truth upon the earth.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> You say true; but did you meet nobody else in that valley?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> No, not I; for I had sunshine all the rest of the
                way through that, and also through the Valley of the Shadow of
                Death.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> It was well for you. I am sure it fared far otherwise with
                me; I had for a long season, as soon almost as I entered into
                that valley, a dreadful combat with that foul fiend <hi rend="italic">Apollyon</hi>;
                yea, I thought verily he would have killed me, especially when
                he got me down and crushed me under him, as if he would have
                crushed me to pieces; for as he threw me, my sword flew out of
                my hand; nay, he told me he was sure of me: but I cried to God,
                and he heard me, and delivered me out of all my troubles. Then
                I entered into the Valley of the <hi rend="italic">Shadow of Death</hi>, and had no
                light for almost half the way through it. I thought I should
                have been killed there, over and over; but at last day broke,
                and the sun rose, and I went through that which was behind with
                far more ease and quiet.</p>
                
                <p>Moreover, I saw in my dream, that as they went on, <hi rend="italic">Faithful</hi>, as
                he chanced to look on one side, saw a man whose name is
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Talkative</hi> , walking at a distance beside them; for in this place
                there was room enough for them all to walk. He was a tall man,
                and something more comely at a distance than at hand. To this
                man <hi rend="italic">Faithful</hi> addressed himself in this manner: --
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> Friend, whither away? Are you going to the heavenly
                country?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Talk.</hi> I am going to the same place.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> That is well; then I hope we may have your good company.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Talk.</hi> With a very good will will I be your companion.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> Come on, then, and let us go together, and let us spend
                our time in discoursing of things that are profitable.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Talk.</hi> To talk of things that are good, to me is very acceptable,
                with you or with any other; and I am glad that I have met with
                those that incline to so good a work; for, to speak the truth,
                there are but few that care thus to spend their time, (as they
                are in their travels,) but choose much rather to be speaking of
                things to no profit; and this hath been a trouble for me.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> That is indeed a thing to be lamented; for what things so
                worthy of the use of the tongue and mouth of men on earth as are
                the things of the God of heaven?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Talk.</hi> I like you wonderful well, for your sayings are full of
                conviction; and I will add, what thing is so pleasant, and what
                so profitable, as to talk of the things of God? What things so
                pleasant (that is, if a man hath any delight in things that are
                wonderful)? For instance, if a man doth delight to talk of the
                history or the mystery of things; or if a man doth love to talk
                of miracles, wonders, or signs, where shall he find things
                recorded so delightful, and so sweetly penned, as in the Holy
                Scripture?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> That is true; but to be profited by such things in our
                talk should be that which we design.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Talk.</hi> That is it that I said; for to talk of such things is most
                profitable; for by so doing, a man may get knowledge of many
                things; as of the vanity of earthly things, and the benefit of
                things above. Thus, in general, but more particularly by this,
                a man may learn the necessity of the new birth, the
                insufficiency of our works, the need of Christ's righteousness,
                &amp;c. Besides, by this a man may learn, by talk, what it is to
                repent, to believe, to pray, to suffer, or the like; by this
                also a man may learn what are
                the great promises and consolations of the gospel, to his own
                comfort. Further, by this a man may learn to refute false
                opinions, to vindicate the truth, and also to instruct the
                ignorant.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> All this is true, and glad am I to hear these things from
                you.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Talk.</hi> Alas! the want of this is the cause why so few understand
                the need of faith, and the necessity of a work of grace in their
                soul, in order to eternal life; but ignorantly live in the works
                of the law, by which a man can by no means obtain the kingdom of
                heaven.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> But, by your leave, heavenly knowledge of these is the
                gift of God; no man attaineth to them by human industry, or only
                by the talk of them.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Talk.</hi> All this I know very well; for a man can receive nothing,
                except it be given him from Heaven; all is of grace, not of
                works. I could give you a hundred scriptures for the
                confirmation of this.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> Well, then, said <hi rend="italic">Faithful</hi>, what is that one thing that we
                shall at this time found our discourse upon?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Talk.</hi> What you will. I will talk of things heavenly, or things
                earthly; things moral, or things evangelical; things sacred, or
                things profane; things past, or things to come; things foreign,
                or things at home; things more essential, or things
                circumstantial; provided that all be done to our profit.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> Now did <hi rend="italic">Faithful</hi> begin to wonder; and stepping to
                <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, (for he walked all this while by himself,) he said to
                him, (but softly,) What a brave companion have we got? Surely
                this man will make a very excellent pilgrim.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> At this <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> modestly smiled, and said, This man, with
                whom you are so taken, will beguile, with that tongue of his,
                twenty of them that know him not.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> Do you know him, then?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Know him! Yes, better than he knows himself.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> Pray, what is he?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> His name is <hi rend="italic">Talkative</hi>; he dwelleth in our town. I wonder
                that you should be a stranger to him, only I consider that our
                town is large.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> Whose son is he? And whereabout does he dwell?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> He is the son of one <hi rend="italic">Say-well</hi>; he dwelt in <hi rend="italic">Prating Row</hi>; and
                is known of all that are acquainted with him, by the name of
                <hi rend="italic">Talkative</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Prating Row</hi>; and notwithstanding his fine tongue,
                he is but a sorry fellow.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> Well, he seems to be a very pretty man.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> That is, to them who have not thorough acquaintance with
                him; for he is best abroad; near home, he is ugly enough. Your
                saying that he is a pretty man, brings to my mind what I have
                observed in the work of the painter, whose pictures shew best at
                a distance, but, very near, more unpleasing.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> But I am ready to think you do but jest, because you
                smiled.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> God forbid that I should jest (although I smiled) in this
                matter, or that I should accuse any falsely! I will give you a
                further discovery of him. This man is for any company, and for
                any talk; as he talketh now with you, so will he talk when he is
                on the ale-bench; and the more drink he hath in his crown, the
                more of these things he hath in his mouth; religion hath no
                place in his heart, or
                house, or conversation; all he hath lieth in his tongue, and his
                religion is, to make a noise therewith.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> Say you so! then am I in this man greatly deceived.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Deceived! you may be sure of it; remember the proverb, <hi rend="italic">They
                say and do not. But the kingdom of God is not in word, but in
                Power. </hi> He talketh of prayer, of repentance, of faith, and of the
                new birth; but he knows but only to talk of them. I have been in
                his family, and have observed him both at home and abroad; and
                I know what I say of him is the truth. His house is as empty of
                religion as the white of an egg is of savour. There is there
                neither prayer nor sign of repentance for sin; yea, the brute in
                his kind serves God far better than he. He is the very stain,
                reproach, and shame of religion, to all that know him; it can
                hardly have a good word in all that end of the town where he
                dwells, through him. Thus say the common people that know him,
                A saint abroad, and a devil at home. His poor family finds it
                so; he is such a churl, such a railer at and so unreasonable
                with his servants, that they neither know how to do for or speak
                to him. Men that have any dealings with him say it is better to
                deal with a Turk than with him; for fairer dealing they shall
                have at their hands. This <hi rend="italic">Talkative</hi> (if it be possible) will go
                beyond them, defraud, beguile, and overreach them. Besides, he
                brings up his sons to follow his steps; and if he findeth in any
                of them a foolish timorousness, (for so he calls the first
                appearance of a tender conscience,) he calls them fools and
                blockheads, and by no means will employ them in much, or speak
                to their commendations before others. For my part, I am of
                opinion, that he has, by his wicked life,
                caused many to stumble and fall; and will be, if God prevent
                not, the ruin of many more.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> Well, my brother, I am bound to believe you; not only
                because you say you know him, but also because, like a
                Christian, you make your reports of men. For I cannot think that
                you speak these things of ill-will, but because it is even so as
                you say.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Had I known him no more than you, I might perhaps have
                thought of him, as, at the first, you did; yea, had he received
                this report at their hands only that are enemies to religion, I
                should have thought it had been a slander, -- a lot that often
                falls from bad men's mouths upon good men's names and
                professions; but all these things, yea, and a great many more as
                bad, of my own knowledge, I can prove him guilty of. Besides,
                good men are ashamed of him; they can neither call him brother,
                nor friend; the very naming of him among them makes them blush,
                if they know him.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> Well, I see that saying and doing are two things, and
                hereafter I shall better observe this distinction.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> They are two things, indeed, and are as diverse as are the
                soul and the body; for as the body without the soul is but a
                dead carcass, so saying, if it be alone, is but a dead carcass
                also. The soul of religion is the practical part: <hi rend="italic">Pure religion
                and undefiled, before God and the Father, is this, To visit the
                fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself
                unspotted from the world.</hi> This <hi rend="italic">Talkative</hi> is not aware of; he
                thinks that hearing and saying will make a good <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, and
                thus he deceiveth his own soul. Hearing is but as the sowing of
                the seed; talking is not sufficient to prove that fruit is
                indeed
                in the heart and life; and let us assure ourselves, that at the
                day of doom men shall be judged according to their fruits. It
                will not be said then, Did you believe? but, Were you doers, or
                talkers only? and accordingly shall they be judged. The end of
                the world is compared to our harvest; and you know men at
                harvest regard nothing but fruit. Not that anything can be
                accepted that is not of faith, but I speak this to shew you how
                insignificant the profession of <hi rend="italic">Talkative</hi> will be at that day.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> This brings to my mind that of <hi rend="italic">Moses</hi>, by which he
                describeth the beast that is clean. He is such a one that
                parteth the hoof and cheweth the cud; not that parteth the hoof
                only, or that cheweth the cud only. The hare cheweth the cud,
                but yet is unclean, because he parteth not the hoof. And this
                truly resembleth <hi rend="italic">Talkative</hi>; he cheweth the cud, he seeketh
                knowledge, he cheweth upon the word; but he divideth not the
                hoof, he parteth not with the way of sinners; but, as the hare,
                he retaineth the foot of a dog or bear, and therefore he is
                unclean.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> You have spoken, for aught I know, the true gospel sense of
                those texts. And I will add another thing: Paul calleth some
                men, yea, and those great talkers, too, <hi rend="italic">sounding brass and
                tinkling cymbals</hi>; that is, as he expounds them in another place,
                <hi rend="italic">things without life, giving sound.</hi> Things without life, that is,
                without the true faith and grace of the gospel; and
                consequently, things that shall never be placed in the kingdom
                of heaven among those that are the children of life; though
                their sound, by their talk, be as if it were the tongue or voice
                of an angel.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> Well, I was not so fond of his company at first, but I am
                as sick of it now. What shall we do to be rid of him?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Take my advice, and do as I bid you, and you shall find
                that he will soon be sick of your company too, except God shall
                touch his heart, and turn it.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> What would you have me to do?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Why, go to him, and enter into some serious discourse about
                the power of religion; and ask him plainly (when he has approved
                of it, for that he will) whether this thing be set up in his
                heart, house, or conversation.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> Then <hi rend="italic">Faithful</hi> stepped forward again, and said to
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Talkative</hi> , Come, what cheer? How is it now?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Talk.</hi> Thank you, well. I thought we should have had a great deal
                of talk by this time.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> Well, if you will, we will fall to it now; and since you
                left it with me to state the question, let it be this, How doth
                the saving grace of God discover itself when it is in the heart
                of man?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Talk.</hi> I perceive, then, that our talk must be about the power of
                things. Well, it is a very good question, and I shall be willing
                to answer you. And take my answer in brief, thus: -- First,
                Where the grace of God is in the heart, it causeth there a great
                outcry against sin. Secondly --  --
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> Nay, hold, let us consider of one at once. I think you
                should rather say, It shews itself by inclining the soul to
                abhor its sin.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Talk.</hi> Why, what difference is there between crying out against,
                and abhorring of sin?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> Oh, a great deal. A man may cry out against sin of
                policy, but he cannot abhor it but by virtue of a
                godly antipathy against it. I have heard many cry out against
                sin in the pulpit, who yet can abide it well enough in the
                heart, house, and conversation. Joseph's mistress cried out with
                a loud voice, as if she had been very holy; but she would
                willingly, notwithstanding that, have committed uncleanness with
                him. Some cry out against sin even as the mother cries out
                against her child in her lap, when she calleth it slut and
                naughty girl, and then falls to hugging and kissing it.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Talk.</hi> You lie at the catch, I perceive.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> No, not I; I am only for setting things right. But what
                is the second thing whereby you would prove a discovery of a
                work of grace in the heart?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Talk.</hi> Great knowledge of gospel mysteries.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> This sign should have been first; but first or last, it
                is also false; for knowledge, great knowledge, may be obtained
                in the mysteries of the gospel, and yet no work of grace in the
                soul. Yea, if a man have all knowledge, he may yet be nothing,
                and so consequently be no child of God. When Christ said, <hi rend="italic">Do you
                know all these things?</hi> and the disciples had answered, <hi rend="italic">Yes</hi>; he
                addeth, <hi rend="italic">Blessed are ye if ye do them</hi>. He doth not lay the
                blessing in the knowing of them, but in the doing of them. For
                there is a knowledge that is not attended with doing: <hi rend="italic">He that
                knoweth his masters will, and doeth it not.</hi> A man may know like
                an angel, and yet be no <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, therefore your sign of it is
                not true. Indeed, to know is a thing that pleaseth talkers and
                boasters, but <hi rend="italic">to do</hi> is that which pleaseth God. Not that the
                heart can be good without knowledge; for without that, the heart
                is naught. There is, therefore, knowledge and knowledge.
                Knowledge that resteth in the bare speculation of things; and
                knowledge that is accompanied with the grace of faith and love;
                which puts a man upon doing even the will of God from the heart:
                the first of these will serve the talker; but without the other
                the true <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> is not content. <hi rend="italic">Give me understanding, and I
                shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart.</hi>
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Talk.</hi> You lie at the catch again; this is not for edification.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> Well, if you please, propound another sign how this work
                of grace discovereth itself where it is.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Talk.</hi> Not I, for I see we shall not agree.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> Well, if you will not, will you give me leave to do it?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Talk.</hi> You may use your liberty.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> A work of grace in the soul discovereth itself, either to
                him that hath it, or to standers by.
                
                </p><p>To him that hath it thus: It gives him conviction of sin,
                especially of the defilement of his nature and the sin of
                unbelief, (for the sake of which he is sure to be damned, if he
                findeth not mercy at God's hand, by faith in Jesus Christ). This
                sight and sense of things worketh in him sorrow and shame for
                sin; he findeth, moreover, revealed in him the Saviour of the
                world, and the absolute necessity of closing with him for life,
                at the which he findeth hungerings and thirstings after him; to
                which hungerings, &amp;c., the promise is made. Now, according to
                the strength or weakness of his faith in his Saviour, so is his
                joy and peace, so is his love to holiness, so are his desires to
                know him more, and also to serve him in this world. But though
                I say it discovereth itself thus unto him, yet it is but seldom
                that he is able to conclude that this is a work of grace;
                because his corruptions now, and
                his abused reason, make his mind to misjudge in this matter;
                therefore, in him that hath this work, there is required a very
                sound judgment before he can, with steadiness, conclude that
                this is a work of grace.
                
                </p><p>To others, it is thus discovered: --
                
                </p><p>1. By an experimental confession of his faith in Christ.
                
                </p><p>2. By a life answerable to that confession; to wit, a life of
                holiness, heart-holiness, family-holiness, (if he hath a
                family,) and by conversation-holiness in the world which, in the
                general, teacheth him, inwardly, to abhor his sin, and himself
                for that, in secret; to suppress it in his family and to promote
                holiness in the world; not by talk only, as a hypocrite or
                talkative person may do, but by a practical subjection, in faith
                and love, to the power of the Word. And now, Sir, as to this
                brief description of the work of grace, and also the discovery
                of it, if you have aught to object, object; if not, then give me
                leave to propound to you a second question.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Talk.</hi> Nay, my part is not now to object, but to hear; let me,
                therefore, have your second question.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> It is this: Do you experience this first part of this
                description of it? and doth your life and conversation testify
                the same? or standeth your religion in word or in tongue, and
                not in deed and truth? Pray, if you incline to answer me in
                this, say no more than you know the God above will say Amen to;
                and also nothing but what your conscience can justify you in;
                <hi rend="italic">for not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the
                Lord commendeth</hi>. Besides, to say I am thus and thus, when my
                conversation, and all my neighbours, tell me I lie, is great
                wickedness.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Talk.</hi> Then <hi rend="italic">Talkative</hi> at first began to blush; but, recovering
                himself, thus he replied: You come now to experience,
                to conscience, and God; and to appeal to him for justification
                of what is spoken. This kind of discourse I did not expect; nor
                am I disposed to give an answer to such questions, because I
                count not myself bound thereto, unless you take upon you to be
                a catechiser, and, though you should so do, yet I may refuse to
                make you my judge. But, I pray, will you tell me why you ask me
                such questions?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> Because I saw you forward to talk, and because I knew not
                that you had aught else but notion. Besides, to tell you all the
                truth, I have heard of you, that you are a man whose religion
                lies in talk, and that your conversation gives this your
                mouth-profession the lie. They say, you are a spot among
                <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>s; and that religion fareth the worse for your ungodly
                conversation; that some have already stumbled at your wicked
                ways, and that more are in danger of being destroyed thereby;
                your religion, and an alehouse, and covetousness, and
                uncleanness, and swearing, and lying, and vain-company keeping,
                &amp;c., will stand together. The proverb is true of you which is
                said of a whore, to wit, that she is a shame to all women; so
                are you a shame to all professors.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Talk.</hi> Since you are ready to take up reports and to judge so
                rashly as you do, I cannot but conclude you are some peevish or
                melancholy man, not fit to be discoursed with; and so adieu.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Then came up <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, and said to his brother, I told you
                how it would happen: your words and his lusts could not agree;
                he had rather leave your company than reform his life. But he is
                gone, as I said; let him go, the loss is no man's but his own;
                he has saved us the trouble
                of going from him; for he continuing (as I suppose he will do)
                as he is, he would have been but a blot in our company: besides,
                the apostle says, <hi rend="italic">From such withdraw thyself.</hi>
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> But I am glad we had this little discourse with him; it
                may happen that he will think of it again: however, I have dealt
                plainly with him, and so am clear of his blood, if he perisheth.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> You did well to talk so plainly to him as you did; there is
                but little of this faithful dealing with men nowa-days, and that
                makes religion to stink so in the nostrils of many, as it doth;
                for they are these talkative fools whose religion is only in
                word, and are debauched and vain in their conversation, that
                (being so much admitted into the fellowship of the godly) do
                puzzle the world, blemish <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>ity, and grieve the sincere.
                I wish that all men would deal with such as you have done: then
                should they either be made more conformable to religion, or the
                company of saints would be too hot for them. Then did <hi rend="italic">Faithful</hi>
                say,</p>
                
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                <l rend="indent">How <hi rend="italic">Talkative</hi> at first lifts up his plumes!
                </l><l rend="indent">How bravely doth he speak! How he presumes
                </l><l rend="indent">To drive down all before him! But so soon
                </l><l rend="indent">As <hi rend="italic">Faithful</hi> talks of heart-work, like the moon
                </l><l rend="indent">That's past the full, into the wane he goes.
                </l><l rend="indent">And so will all, but he that HEART-WORK knows.</l>
                </lg>
                
                <p>Thus they went on talking of what they had seen by the way, and
                so made that way easy which would otherwise, no doubt, have been
                tedious to them; for now they went through a wilderness.
                
                </p><p>Now, when they were got almost quite out of this wilderness,
                <hi rend="italic">Faithful</hi> chanced to cast his eye back, and espied one coming
                after them, and he knew him. Oh! said <hi rend="italic">Faithful</hi> to his brother,
                who comes yonder? Then <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> looked, and said, It is my good
                friend <hi rend="italic">Evangelist</hi>. Ay, and my good friend too, said <hi rend="italic">Faithful</hi>,
                for it was he that set me in the way to the gate. Now was
                <hi rend="italic">Evangelist</hi> come up to them, and thus saluted them: --
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Evan.</hi> Peace be with you, dearly beloved; and peace be to your
                helpers.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Welcome, welcome, my good <hi rend="italic">Evangelist</hi>, the sight of thy
                countenance brings to my remembrance thy ancient kindness and
                unwearied labouring for my eternal good.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> And a thousand times welcome, said good <hi rend="italic">Faithful</hi>. Thy
                company, O sweet <hi rend="italic">Evangelist</hi>, how desirable it is to us poor
                pilgrims!
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Evan.</hi> Then said <hi rend="italic">Evangelist</hi>, How hath it fared with you, my
                friends, since the time of our last parting? What have you met
                with, and how have you behaved yourselves?</p>
                
                <p>Then <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Faithful</hi> told him of all things that had
                happened to them in the way; and how, and with what difficulty,
                they had arrived at that place.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Evan.</hi> Right glad am I, said <hi rend="italic">Evangelist</hi>, not that you have met
                with trials, but that you have been victors; and for that you
                have, notwithstanding many weaknesses, continued in the way to
                this very day.</p>
                
                <p>I say, right glad am I of this thing, and that for mine own sake
                and yours. I have sowed, and you have reaped: and the day is
                coming, when both he that sowed and they that reaped shall
                rejoice together; that is, if you hold
                out: <hi rend="italic">for in due season ye shall reap, if ye faint not.</hi> The crown
                is before you, and it is an incorruptible one; <hi rend="italic">so run, that you
                may obtain it.</hi> Some there be that set out for this crown, and,
                after they have gone far for it, another comes in, and takes it
                from them: hold fast, therefore, that you have; let no man take
                your crown. You are not yet out of the gun-shot of the devil;
                you have not resisted unto blood, striving against sin; let the
                kingdom be always before you, and believe steadfastly concerning
                things that are invisible. Let nothing that is on this side the
                other world get within you; and, above all, look well to your
                own hearts, and to the lusts thereof, <hi rend="italic">for they are deceitful
                above all things, and desperately wicked</hi>; set your faces like a
                flint; you have all power in heaven and earth on your side.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Then <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> thanked him for his exhortation; but told
                him, withal, that they would have him speak further to them for
                their help the rest of the way, and the rather, for that they
                well knew that he was a prophet, and could tell them of things
                that might happen unto them, and also how they might resist and
                overcome them. To which request <hi rend="italic">Faithful</hi> also consented. So
                <hi rend="italic">Evangelist</hi> began as followeth: --
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Evan.</hi> My sons, you have heard, in the words of the truth of the
                gospel, that you must, through many tribulations, enter into the
                kingdom of heaven. And, again, that in every city bonds and
                afflictions abide in you; and therefore you cannot expect that
                you should go long on your pilgrimage without them, in some sort
                or other. You have found something of the truth of these
                testimonies upon you already, and more will immediately follow;
                for now, as you see, you are almost out of this wilderness,
                and therefore you will soon come into a town that you will by
                and by see before you; and in that town you will be hardly beset
                with enemies, who will strain hard but they will kill you; and
                be you sure that one or both of you must seal the testimony
                which you hold, with blood; but be you faithful unto death, and
                the King will give you a crown of life. He that shall die there,
                although his death will be unnatural, and his pain perhaps
                great, he will yet have the better of his fellow; not only
                because he will be arrived at the <hi rend="italic">Celestial City</hi> soonest, but
                because he will escape many miseries that the other will meet
                with in the rest of his journey. But when you are come to the
                town, and shall find fulfilled what I have here related, then
                remember your friend, and quit yourselves like men, and commit
                the keeping of your souls to your God in well-doing, as unto a
                faithful Creator.</p>
                
                <p>Then I saw in my dream, that when they were got out of the
                wilderness, they presently saw a town before them, and the name
                of that town is <hi rend="italic">Vanity</hi>; and at the town there is a fair kept,
                called <hi rend="italic">Vanity Fair</hi>: it is kept all the year long. it beareth the
                name of <hi rend="italic">Vanity Fair</hi> because the town where it is kept is lighter
                than vanity; and, also because all that is there sold, or that
                cometh thither, is vanity. As is the saying of the wise, all
                that cometh is vanity.
                
                </p><p>This fair is no new-erected business, but a thing of ancient
                standing; I will shew you the original of it.
                
                </p><p>Almost five thousand years agone, there were pilgrims walking to
                the <hi rend="italic">Celestial City</hi>, as these two honest persons are: and
                <hi rend="italic">Beelzebub</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Apollyon</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Legion</hi>, with their companions,
                perceiving by the path that the pilgrims made, that their way to
                the city lay through this town of <hi rend="italic">Vanity</hi>,
                they contrived here to set up a fair; a fair wherein,
                should be sold all sorts of vanity, and that it should last all
                the year long: therefore at this fair are all such merchandise
                sold, as houses, lands, trades, places, honours, preferments,
                titles, countries, kingdoms, lusts, pleasures, and delights of
                all sorts, as whores, bawds, wives, husbands, children, masters,
                servants, lives, blood, bodies, souls, silver, gold, pearls,
                precious stones, and what not.
                
                </p><p>And, moreover, at this fair there is at all times to be seen
                juggling cheats, games, plays, fools, apes, knaves, and rogues,
                and that of every kind.
                
                </p><p>Here are to be seen, too, and that for nothing, thefts, murders,
                adulteries, false swearers, and that of a bloodred colour.
                
                </p><p>And as in other fairs of less moment, there are the several rows
                and streets, under their proper names, where such and such wares
                are vended; so here likewise you have the proper places, rows,
                streets, (viz; countries and kingdoms,) where the wares of this
                fair are soonest to be found. Here is the <hi rend="italic">Britain Row</hi>, the
                <hi rend="italic">French Row</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Italian Row</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Spanish Row</hi>,
                the <hi rend="italic">German Row</hi>,
                where several sorts of vanities are to be sold. But, as in other
                fairs, some one commodity is as the chief of all the fair, so
                the ware of <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi> and her merchandise is greatly promoted in this
                fair; only our <hi rend="italic">English</hi> nation, with some others, have taken a
                dislike thereat.
                
                </p><p>Now, as I said, the way to the <hi rend="italic">Celestial City</hi> lies just through
                this town where this lusty fair is kept; and he that will go to
                the city, and yet not go through this town, must needs <hi rend="italic">go out of
                the world.</hi> The Prince of princes himself, when here, went
                through this town to his own country, and that upon a fair day
                too; yea, and as I think,
                it was <hi rend="italic">Beelzebub</hi>, the chief lord of this fair, that invited him
                to buy of his vanities; yea, would have made him lord of the
                fair, would he but have done him reverence as he went through
                the town. Yea, because he was such a person of honour, <hi rend="italic">Beelzebub</hi>
                had him from street to street, and shewed him all the kingdoms
                of the world in a little time, that he might, if possible,
                allure the Blessed One to cheapen and buy some of his vanities;
                but he had no mind to the merchandise, and therefore left the
                town, without laying out so much as one farthing upon these
                vanities. This fair, therefore, is an ancient thing, of long
                standing, and a very great fair. Now these pilgrims, as I said,
                must needs go through this fair. Well, so they did: but, behold,
                even as they entered into the fair, all the people in the fair
                were moved, and the town itself as it were in a hubbub about
                them; and that for several reasons: for --
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">First,</hi>  The pilgrims were clothed with such kind of raiment as
                was diverse from the raiment of any that traded in that fair.
                The people, therefore, of the fair, made a great gazing upon
                them: some said they were fools, some they were bedlams, and
                some they are outlandish men.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Secondly,</hi>  And as they wondered at their apparel, so they did
                likewise at their speech; for few could understand what they
                said; they naturally spoke the language of Canaan, but they that
                kept the fair were the men of this world; so that, from one end
                of the fair to the other, they seemed barbarians each to the
                other.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Thirdly,</hi>  But that which did not a little amuse the merchandisers
                was, that these pilgrims set very light by
                all their wares; they cared not so much as to look upon them;
                and if they called upon them to buy, they would put their
                fingers in their ears, and cry, <hi rend="italic">Turn away mine eyes from
                beholding vanity,</hi> and look upwards, signifying that their trade
                and traffic was in heaven.
                
                </p><p>One chanced mockingly, beholding the carriage of the men, to say
                unto them, What will ye buy? But they, looking gravely upon him,
                answered, <hi rend="italic">We buy the truth.</hi> At that there was an occasion taken
                to despise the men the more; some mocking, some taunting, some
                speaking reproachfully, and some calling upon others to smite
                them. At last things came to a hubbub and great stir in the
                fair, insomuch that all order was confounded. Now was word
                presently brought to the great one of the fair, who quickly came
                down, and deputed some of his most trusty friends to take these
                men into examination, about whom the fair was almost overturned.
                So the men were brought to examination; and they that sat upon
                them, asked them whence they came, whither they went, and what
                they did there, in such an unusual garb? The men told them that
                they were pilgrims and strangers in the world, and that they
                were going to their own country, which was the heavenly
                <hi rend="italic">Jerusalem</hi>, and that they had given no occasion to the men of the
                town, nor yet to the merchandisers, thus to abuse them, and to
                let them in their journey, except it was for that, when one
                asked them what they would buy, they said they would buy the
                truth. But they that were appointed to examine them did not
                believe them to be any other than bedlams and mad, or else such
                as came to put all things into a confusion in the fair.
                Therefore they took them and beat them, and
                besmeared them with dirt, and then put them into the cage, that
                they might be made a spectacle to all the men of the fair.</p>
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                <l rend="indent">Behold <hi rend="italic">Vanity Fair!</hi> the pilgrims there
                </l><l>Are chain'd and stand beside:
                </l><l rend="indent">Even so it was our Lord pass'd here,
                </l><l>And on Mount Calvary died.</l>
                </lg>
                
                <p>There, therefore, they lay for some time, and were made the
                objects of any man's sport, or malice, or revenge, the great one
                of the fair laughing still at all that befell them. But the men
                being patient, and not rendering railing for railing, but
                contrariwise, blessing, and giving good words for bad, and
                kindness for injuries done, some men in the fair that were more
                observing, and less prejudiced than the rest, began to check and
                blame the baser sort for their continual abuses done by them to
                the men; they, therefore, in angry manner, let fly at them
                again, counting them as bad as the men in the cage, and telling
                them that they seemed confederates, and should be made partakers
                of their misfortunes. The other replied that, for aught they
                could see, the men were quiet, and sober, and intended nobody
                any harm; and that there were many that traded in their fair
                that were more worthy to be put into the cage, yea, and pillory
                too, than were the men they had abused. Thus, after divers words
                had passed on both sides, the men behaving themselves all the
                while very wisely and soberly before them, they fell to some
                blows among themselves, and did harm one to another. Then were
                these two poor men brought before their examiners again, and
                there charged as being
                guilty of the late hubbub that had been in the fair. So they
                beat them pitifully, and hanged irons upon them, and led them in
                chains up and down the fair, for an example and a terror to
                others, lest any should speak in their behalf, or join
                themselves unto them. But <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Faithful</hi> behaved
                themselves yet more wisely, and received the ignominy and shame
                that was cast upon them, with so much meekness and patience,
                that it won to their side, though but few in comparison of the
                rest, several of the men in the fair. This put the other party
                yet into greater rage, insomuch that they concluded the death of
                these two men. Wherefore they threatened, that the cage nor
                irons should serve their turn, but that they should die, for the
                abuse they had done, and for deluding the men of the fair.
                
                </p><p>Then were they remanded to the cage again, until further order
                should be taken with them. So they put them in, and made their
                feet fast in the stocks.
                
                </p><p>Here, therefore, they called again to mind what they had heard
                from their faithful friend <hi rend="italic">Evangelist</hi>, and were the more
                confirmed in their way and sufferings by what he told them would
                happen to them. They also now comforted each other, that whose
                lot it was to suffer, even he should have the best of it;
                therefore each man secretly wished that he might have that
                preferment: but committing themselves to the all-wise disposal
                of Him that ruleth all things, with much content, they abode in
                the condition in which they were, until they should be otherwise
                disposed of.
                
                </p><p>Then a convenient time being appointed, they brought them forth
                to their trial, in order to their condemnation. When the time
                was come, they were brought before their
                enemies and arraigned. The judge's name was Lord <hi rend="italic">Hategood</hi>. Their
                indictment was one and the same in substance, though somewhat
                varying in form, the contents whereof were this: --
                
                </p><p>'That they were enemies to and disturbers of their trade; that
                they had made commotions and divisions in the town, and had won
                a party to their own most dangerous opinions, in contempt of the
                law of their prince.'</p>
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                <l rend="indent">Now, <hi rend="italic">Faithful</hi>, play the man, speak for thy God:
                </l><l rend="indent">Fear not the wickeds' malice; nor their rod!
                </l><l rend="indent">Speak boldly, man, the truth is on thy side:
                </l><l rend="indent">Die for it, and to life in triumph ride.</l>
                </lg>
                
                <p>Then <hi rend="italic">Faithful</hi> began to answer, that he had only set himself
                against that which hath set itself against Him that is higher
                than the highest. And, said he, as for disturbance, I make none,
                being myself a man of peace; the parties that were won to us,
                were won by beholding our truth and innocence, and they are only
                turned from the worse to the better. And as to the king you talk
                of, since he is <hi rend="italic">Beelzebub</hi>, the enemy of our Lord, I defy him and
                all his angels.
                
                </p><p>Then proclamation was made, that they that had aught to say for
                their lord the king against the prisoner at the bar, should
                forthwith appear and give in their evidence. So there came in
                three witnesses, to wit, <hi rend="italic">Envy</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Superstition</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Pickthank</hi>. They
                were then asked if they knew the prisoner at the bar; and what
                they had to say for their lord the king against him.
                
                </p><p>Then stood forth <hi rend="italic">Envy</hi>, and said to this effect: My Lord, I have
                known this man a long time, and will attest upon my oath before
                this honourable bench that he is --
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Judge.</hi> Hold! Give him his oath. (So they sware him.) Then he
                said --
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Envy.</hi> My Lord, this man, notwithstanding his plausible name, is
                one of the vilest men in our country. He neither regardeth
                prince nor people, law nor custom; but doth all that he can to
                possess all men with certain of his disloyal notions, which he
                in the general calls principles of faith and holiness. And, in
                particular, I heard him once myself affirm that <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>ity and
                the customs of our town of <hi rend="italic">Vanity</hi> were diametrically opposite,
                and could not be reconciled. By which saying, my Lord, he doth
                at once not only condemn all our laudable doings, but us in the
                doing of them.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Judge.</hi> . Then did the Judge say to him, Hast thou any more to say?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Envy.</hi> My Lord, I could say much more, only I would not be
                tedious to the court. Yet, if need be, when the other gentlemen
                have given in their evidence, rather than anything shall be
                wanting that will despatch him, I will enlarge my testimony
                against him. So he was bid to stand by.
                
                </p><p>Then they called <hi rend="italic">Superstition</hi>, and bid him look upon the
                prisoner. They also asked, what he could say for their lord the
                king against him. Then they sware him; so he began.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Super.</hi> My Lord, I have no great acquaintance with this man, nor
                do I desire to have further knowledge of him; however, this I
                know, that he is a very pestilent fellow, from some discourse
                that, the other day, I had with him in this town; for then,
                talking with him, I heard him say, that our religion was naught,
                and such by which a man could by no means please God. Which sayings
                of his, my Lord, your Lordship very well knows, what
                necessarily thence will follow, to wit, that we do still worship
                in vain, are yet in our sins, and finally shall be damned; and
                this is that which I have to say.</p>
                
                <p>Then was <hi rend="italic">Pickthank</hi> sworn, and bid say what he knew, in behalf of
                their lord the king, against the prisoner at the bar.</p>
                
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pick.</hi> My Lord, and you gentlemen all, This fellow I have known
                of a long time, and have heard him speak things that ought not
                to be spoke; for he hath railed on our noble prince <hi rend="italic">Beelzebub</hi>,
                and hath spoken contemptibly of his honourable friends, whose
                names are the Lord <hi rend="italic">Old Man</hi>, the Lord <hi rend="italic">Carnal Delight</hi>, the Lord
                <hi rend="italic">Luxurious</hi>, the Lord <hi rend="italic">Desire of Vain Glory</hi>, my old Lord
                <hi rend="italic">Lechery</hi>,
                Sir <hi rend="italic">Having Greedy</hi>, with all the rest of our nobility; and he
                hath said, moreover, That if all men were of his mind, if
                possible, there is not one of these noblemen should have any
                longer a being in this town. Besides, he hath not been afraid to
                rail on you, my Lord, who are now appointed to be his judge,
                calling you an ungodly villain, with many other such like
                vilifying terms, with which he hath bespattered most of the
                gentry of our town.</p>
                
                <p>When this <hi rend="italic">Pickthank</hi> had told his tale, the Judge directed his
                speech to the prisoner at the bar, saying, Thou runagate,
                heretic, and traitor, hast thou heard what these honest
                gentlemen have witnessed against thee?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> May I speak a few words in my own defence?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Judge.</hi> Sirrah! sirrah! thou deservest to live no longer, but to
                be slain immediately upon the place; yet, that all men may see
                our gentleness towards thee, let us hear what thou, vile
                runagate, hast to say.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Faith.</hi> 1. I say, then, in answer
                to what Mr. <hi rend="italic">Envy</hi> hath spoken,
                I never said aught but this, That what rule, or laws, or
                customs, or people, were flat against the Word of God, are
                diametrically opposite to Christianity. If I have said amiss in
                this, convince me of my error, and I am ready here before you to
                make my recantation.
                
                </p><p>2. As to the second, to wit, Mr. <hi rend="italic">Superstition</hi>, and his charge
                against me, I said only this, That in the worship of God there
                is required a Divine faith; but there can be no Divine faith
                without a Divine revelation of the will of God. Therefore,
                whatever is thrust into the worship of God that is not agreeable
                to Divine revelation, cannot be done but by a human faith, which
                faith will not be profitable to eternal life.
                
                </p><p>3. As to what Mr. <hi rend="italic">Pickthank</hi> hath said, I say (avoiding terms, as
                that I am said to rail, and the like) that the prince of this
                town, with all the rabblement, his attendants, by this gentleman
                named, are more fit for a being in hell, than in this town and
                country: and so, the Lord have mercy upon me!
                
                </p><p>Then the Judge called to the jury, (who all this while stood by,
                to hear and observe:) Gentlemen of the jury, you see this man
                about whom so great an uproar hath been made in this town. You
                have also heard what these worthy gentlemen have witnessed
                against him. Also you have heard his reply and confession. It
                lieth now in your breasts to hang him or save his life; but yet
                I think meet to instruct you into our law.
                
                </p><p>There was an Act made in the days of Pharaoh the Great, servant
                to our prince, that lest those of a contrary religion should
                multiply and grow too strong for him, their males should be
                thrown into the river. There was
                also an Act made in the days of Nebuchadnezzar the Great,
                another of his servants, that whosoever would not fall down and
                worship his golden image, should be thrown into a fiery furnace.
                There was also an Act made in the days of Darius, that whoso,
                for some time, called upon any god but him, should be cast into
                the lions' den. Now the substance of these laws this rebel has
                broken, not only in thought, (which is not to be borne,) but
                also in word and deed, which must therefore needs be
                intolerable.
                
                </p><p>For that of Pharaoh, his law was made upon a supposition, to
                prevent mischief, no crime being yet apparent; but here is a
                crime apparent. For the second and third, you see he disputeth
                against our religion; and for the treason he hath confessed, he
                deserveth to die the death.
                
                </p><p>Then went the jury out, whose names were, Mr. <hi rend="italic">Blind-man</hi>,
                Mr. <hi rend="italic">No-good</hi>, Mr. <hi rend="italic">Malice</hi>, Mr. <hi rend="italic">Love-lust</hi>,
                Mr. <hi rend="italic">Live-loose</hi>, Mr. <hi rend="italic">Heady</hi>,
                Mr. <hi rend="italic">High-mind</hi>, Mr. <hi rend="italic">Enmity</hi>, Mr. <hi rend="italic">Liar</hi>,
                Mr. <hi rend="italic">Cruelty</hi>,
                Mr. <hi rend="italic">Hate-light</hi>, and Mr. <hi rend="italic">Implacable</hi>;
                who every one gave in his
                private verdict against him among themselves, and afterwards
                unanimously concluded to bring him in guilty before the Judge.
                And first, among themselves, <hi rend="italic">Mr. Blind-man</hi>, the foreman, said,
                I see clearly that this man is a heretic. Then said Mr. <hi rend="italic">No-good</hi>,
                Away with such a fellow from the earth. Ay, said Mr. <hi rend="italic">Malice</hi>, for
                I hate the very looks of him. Then said Mr. <hi rend="italic">Love-lust</hi>, I could
                never endure him. Nor I, said Mr. <hi rend="italic">Live-loose</hi>, for he would
                always be condemning my way. Hang him, hang him, said Mr. <hi rend="italic">Heady</hi>.
                A sorry scrub, said Mr. <hi rend="italic">High-mind</hi>. My heart riseth against him,
                said Mr. <hi rend="italic">Enmity</hi>. He is a rogue, said Mr. <hi rend="italic">Liar</hi>. Hanging is too
                good for him, said Mr. <hi rend="italic">Cruelty</hi>.
                Let us despatch him out of the way, said Mr. <hi rend="italic">Hate-light</hi>. Then
                said <hi rend="italic">Mr. Implacable</hi>, Might I have all the world given me, I
                could not be reconciled to him; therefore, let us forthwith
                bring him in guilty of death. And so they did; therefore he was
                presently condemned to be had from the place where he was, to
                the place from whence he came, and there to be put to the most
                cruel death that could be invented.
                
                </p><p>They, therefore, brought him out, to do with him according to
                their law; and, first, they scourged him, then they buffeted
                him, then they lanced his flesh with knives; after that, they
                stoned him with stones, then pricked him with their swords; and,
                last of all, they burned him to ashes at the stake. Thus came
                <hi rend="italic">Faithful</hi> to his end.
                
                </p><p>Now I saw that there stood behind the multitude a chariot and a
                couple of horses, waiting for <hi rend="italic">Faithful</hi>, who (so soon as his
                adversaries had despatched him) was taken up into it, and
                straightway was carried up through the clouds, with sound of
                trumpet, the nearest way to the <hi rend="italic">Celestial Gate</hi>.</p>
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                <l rend="indent">Brave <hi rend="italic">Faithful</hi>, bravely done in word and deed;
                </l><l rend="indent">Judge, witnesses, and jury have, instead
                </l><l rend="indent">Of overcoming thee, but shewn their rage:
                </l><l rend="indent">When they are dead, thou'lt live from age to age.</l>
                </lg>
                
                <p>But as for <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, he had some respite, and was remanded back
                to prison. So he there remained for a space; but He that
                overrules all things, having the power of their rage in his own
                hand, so wrought it about, that <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> for that time escaped
                them, and went his way; and as he went, he sang, saying -- </p>
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                <l rend="indent">Well, <hi rend="italic">Faithful</hi>, thou hast faithfully profest
                </l><l rend="indent">Unto thy Lord; with whom thou shalt be blest,
                </l><l rend="indent">When faithless ones, with all their vain delights,
                </l><l rend="indent">Are crying out under their hellish plights:
                </l><l rend="indent">Sing, <hi rend="italic">Faithful</hi>, sing, and let thy name survive;
                </l><l rend="indent">For though they kill'd thee, thou art yet alive!</l>
                </lg>
                
                <p>Now I saw in my dream, that <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> went not forth alone, for
                there was one whose name was Hopeful (being made so by the
                beholding of <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Faithful</hi> in their words and
                behaviour, in their sufferings at the fair,) who joined himself
                unto him, and, entering into a brotherly covenant, told him that
                he would be his companion. Thus, one died to bear testimony to
                the truth, and another rises out of his ashes, to be a companion
                with <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> in his pilgrimage. This Hopeful also told
                <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, that there were many more of the men in the fair,
                that would take their time and follow after.
                
                </p><p>So I saw that quickly after they were got out of the fair, they
                overtook one that was going before them, whose name was <hi rend="italic">By-ends</hi>:
                so they said to him, What countryman; Sir? and how far go you
                this way? He told them that he came from the town of
                <hi rend="italic">Fair-speech</hi>, and he was going to the <hi rend="italic">Celestial City</hi>, but told
                them not his name.
                
                </p><p>From <hi rend="italic">Fair-speech</hi>! said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>. Is there any good that lives
                there?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">By-ends.</hi> Yes, said <hi rend="italic">By-ends</hi>, I hope.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Pray, Sir, what may I call you? said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">By-ends.</hi> I am a stranger to you, and you to me: if you be going
                this way, I shall be glad of your company; if not, I must be
                content.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> This town of <hi rend="italic">Fair-speech</hi>, said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, I have heard of;
                and, as I remember, they say it is a wealthy place.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">By-ends.</hi> Yes, I will assure you that it is; and I have very many
                rich kindred there.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Pray, who are your kindred there? if a man may be so bold.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">By-ends.</hi> Almost the whole town; and in particular, my Lord
                <hi rend="italic">Turn-about</hi>, my Lord <hi rend="italic">Time-server</hi>, my Lord
                <hi rend="italic">Fair-speech</hi>, (from
                whose ancestors that town first took its name,) also Mr.
                <hi rend="italic">Smooth-man</hi>, Mr. <hi rend="italic">Facing-both-ways</hi>, Mr. <hi rend="italic">Any-thing</hi>
                ; and the parson
                of our parish, Mr. <hi rend="italic">Two-tongues</hi>, was my mother's own brother by
                father's side; and to tell you the truth, I am become a
                gentleman of good quality, yet my great-grandfather was but a
                water-man, looking one way and rowing another, and I got most of
                my estate by the same occupation.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Are you a married man?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">By-ends.</hi> Yes, and my wife is a very virtuous woman, the daughter
                of a virtuous woman; she was my Lady <hi rend="italic">Feigning's</hi> daughter,
                therefore she came of a very honourable family, and is arrived
                to such a pitch of breeding, that she knows how to carry it to
                all, even to prince and peasant. It is true we somewhat differ
                in religion from those of the stricter sort, yet but in two
                small points: first, we never strive against wind and tide;
                secondly, we are always most zealous when religion goes in his
                silver slippers; we love much to walk with him in the street, if
                the sun shines, and the people applaud him.</p>
                
                <p>Then <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> stepped a little aside to his fellow, Hopeful,
                saying, It runs in my mind that this is one <hi rend="italic">By-ends</hi> of
                <hi rend="italic">Fair-speech</hi>; and if it be he, we have as very a
                knave in our company as dwelleth in all these parts. Then said
                Hopeful, Ask him; methinks he should not be ashamed of his name.
                So <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> came up with him again, and said, Sir, you talk as
                if you knew something more than all the world doth; and if I
                take not my mark amiss, I deem I have half a guess of you: Is
                not your name Mr. <hi rend="italic">By-ends</hi>, of <hi rend="italic">Fair-speech</hi>?</p>
                
                <p><hi rend="italic">By-ends.</hi> This is not my name, but indeed it is a nick-name that
                is given me by some that cannot abide me: and I must be content
                to bear it as a reproach, as other good men have borne theirs
                before me.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> But did you never give an occasion to men to call you by
                this name?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">By-ends.</hi> Never, never! The worst that ever I did to give them an
                occasion to give me this name was, that I had always the luck to
                jump in my judgment with the present way of the times, whatever
                it was, and my chance was to get thereby; but if things are thus
                cast upon me, let me count them, a blessing; but let not the
                malicious load me therefore with reproach.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> I thought, indeed, that you were the man that I heard of;
                and to tell you what I think, I fear this name belongs to you
                more properly than you are willing we should think it doth.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">By-ends.</hi> Well, if you will thus imagine, I cannot help it; you
                shall find me a fair company-keeper, if you will still admit me
                your associate.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> If you will go with us, you must go against wind and tide;
                the which, I perceive, is against your opinion; you must also
                own religion in his rags, as well as when in his silver
                slippers; and stand by him, too, when bound in irons, as well as
                when he walketh the streets with applause.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">By-ends.</hi> You must not impose, nor lord it over my faith; leave
                me to my liberty, and let me go with you.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Not a step further, unless you will do in what I propound
                as we.</p>
                
                <p>Then said <hi rend="italic">By-ends</hi>, I shall never desert my old principles, since
                they are harmless and profitable. If I may not go with you, I
                must do as I did before you overtook me, even go by myself,
                until some overtake me that will be glad of my company.
                
                </p><p>Now I saw in my dream that <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> and Hopeful forsook him,
                and kept their distance before him; but one of them looking
                back, saw three men following Mr. <hi rend="italic">By-ends</hi>, and behold, as they
                came up with him, he made them a very low <hi rend="italic">congé</hi>; and they also
                gave him a compliment. The men's names were Mr. <hi rend="italic">Hold-the-world</hi>,
                Mr. <hi rend="italic">Money-love</hi>, and Mr. <hi rend="italic">Save-all</hi>; men that
                Mr. <hi rend="italic">By-ends</hi> had
                formerly been acquainted with; for in their minority they were
                schoolfellows, and were taught by one Mr. <hi rend="italic">Gripe-man</hi>, a
                schoolmaster in <hi rend="italic">Love-gain</hi>, which is a market town in the county
                of <hi rend="italic">Coveting</hi>, in the north. This schoolmaster taught them the art
                of getting, either by violence, cozenage, flattery, lying, or by
                putting on the guise of religion; and these four gentlemen had
                attained much of the art of their master, so that they could
                each of them have kept such a school themselves.
                
                </p><p>Well, when they had, as I said, thus saluted each other, Mr.
                <hi rend="italic">Money-love</hi> said to Mr. <hi rend="italic">By-ends</hi>, Who are they upon the road
                before us? (for <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> and Hopeful were yet within view).
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">By-ends.</hi>
                They are a couple of far countrymen, that, after their
                mode, are going on pilgrimage.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Money-love.</hi> Alas! Why did they not stay, that we
                might have had their good company? for they, and we, and you,
                Sir, I hope, are all going on pilgrimage.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">By-ends.</hi> We are so, indeed; but the men before us are so rigid,
                and love so much their own notions, and do also so lightly
                esteem the opinions of others, that let a man be never so godly,
                yet if he jumps not with them in all things, they thrust him
                quite out of their company.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Save-all.</hi>
                That is bad, but we read of some that are righteous
                overmuch; and such men's rigidness prevails with them to judge
                and condemn all but themselves. But, I pray, what, and how many,
                were the things wherein you differed?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">By-ends.</hi> Why, they, after their headstrong manner, conclude that
                it is duty to rush on their journey all weathers; and I am for
                waiting for wind and tide. They are for hazarding all for God at
                a clap; and I am for taking all advantages to secure my life and
                estate. They are for holding their notions, though all other men
                are against them; but I am for religion in what, and so far as
                the times, and my safety, will bear it. They are for religion
                when in rags and contempt; but I am for him when he walks in his
                golden slippers, in the sunshine, and with applause.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Mr. Hold-the-world. </hi> Ay, and hold you there still, good Mr.
                <hi rend="italic">By-ends</hi>; for, for my part, I can count him but a fool, that,
                having the liberty to keep what he has, shall be so unwise as to
                lose it. Let us be wise as serpents; it is best to make hay when
                the sun shines; you see how the bee lieth still all winter, and
                bestirs her only when she can have profit with pleasure. God
                sends sometimes rain, and sometimes sunshine; if they be such
                fools to go through the first, yet let us be content to take
                fair weather
                along with us. For my part, I like that religion best that will
                stand with the security of God's good blessings unto us; for who
                can imagine, that is ruled by his reason, since God has bestowed
                upon us the good things of this life, but that he would have us
                keep them for his sake? Abraham and Solomon grew rich in
                religion. And Job says, that a good man shall lay up gold as
                dust. But he must not be such as the men before us, if they be
                as you have described them.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Mr. Save-all.</hi> I think that we are all agreed in this matter, and
                therefore there needs no more words about it.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Mr. Money-love.</hi> No, there needs no more words about this matter,
                indeed; for he that believes neither Scripture nor reason (and
                you see we have both on our side) neither knows his own liberty,
                nor seeks his own safety.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Mr. By-ends.</hi> My brethren, we are, as you see, going all on
                pilgrimage; and, for our better diversion from things that are
                bad, give me leave to propound unto you this question: --
                Suppose a man, a minister, or a tradesman, &amp;c., should have an
                advantage lie before him, to get the good blessings of this
                life, yet so as that he can by no means come by them except, in
                appearance at least, he becomes extraordinarily zealous in some
                points of religion that he meddled not with before, may he not
                use these means to attain his end, and yet be a right honest
                man?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Mr. Money-love.</hi> I see the bottom of your question; and, with
                these gentlemen's good leave, I will endeavour to shape you an
                answer. And first, to speak to your question as it concerns a
                minister himself: Suppose a minister, a worthy man, possessed
                but of a very small benefice, and has in his eye a greater, more
                fat, and plump by far;
                he has also now an opportunity of getting of it, yet so as by
                being more studious, by preaching more frequently and zealously,
                and, because the temper of the people requires it, by altering
                of some of his principles; for my part, I see no reason but a
                man may do this, (provided he has a call,) ay, and more a great
                deal besides, and yet be an honest man. For why -- </p>
                
                <p>1. His desire of a greater benefice is lawful, (this cannot be
                contradicted,) since it is set before him by Providence; so
                then, he may get it, if he can, making no question for
                conscience' sake.
                
                </p><p>2. Besides, his desire after that benefice makes him more
                studious, a more zealous preacher, &amp;c., and so makes him a
                better man; yea, makes him better improve his parts, which is
                according to the mind of God.
                
                </p><p>3. Now, as for his complying with the temper of his people, by
                dissenting, to serve them, some of his principles, this argueth
                -- (1.) That he is of a self-denying, temper; (2.) Of a sweet
                and winning deportment; and so (3.) More fit for the ministerial
                function.
                
                </p><p>4. I conclude, then, that a minister that changes a small for a
                great, should not, for so doing, be judged as covetous; but
                rather, since he has improved in his parts and industry thereby,
                be counted as one that pursues his call, and the opportunity put
                into his hands to do good.
                
                </p><p>And now to the second part of the question, which concerns the
                tradesman you mentioned. Suppose such a one to have but a poor
                employ in the world, but by becoming religious, he may mend his
                market, perhaps get a rich wife, or more and far better
                customers to his shop; for my part, I see no reason but that
                this may be lawfully done. For why --
                
                </p><p>1. To become religious is a virtue, by what means soever a man
                becomes so.
                
                </p><p>2. Nor is it unlawful to get a rich wife, or more custom to my
                shop.
                
                </p><p>3. Besides, the man that gets these by becoming religious, gets
                that which is good, of them that are good, by becoming good
                himself; so then here is a good wife, and good customers, and
                good gain, and all these by becoming religious, which is good;
                therefore, to become religious, to get all these, is a good and
                profitable design.
                
                </p><p>This answer, thus made by this Mr. <hi rend="italic">Money-love</hi> to Mr. <hi rend="italic">By-ends</hi>'s
                question, was highly applauded by them all; wherefore they
                concluded upon the whole, that it was most wholesome and
                advantageous. And because, as they thought, no man was able to
                contradict it, and because <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> and Hopeful were yet within
                call, they jointly agreed to assault them with the question as
                soon as they overtook them; and the rather because they had
                opposed Mr. <hi rend="italic">By-ends</hi> before. So they called after them, and they
                stopped, and stood still till they came up to them; but they
                concluded, as they went, that not Mr. <hi rend="italic">By-ends</hi>, but old Mr.
                <hi rend="italic">Hold-the-world</hi>, should propound the question to them, because,
                as they supposed, their answer to him would be without the
                remainder of that heat that was kindled betwixt Mr. <hi rend="italic">By-ends</hi> and
                them, at their parting a little before.
                
                </p><p>So they came up to each other, and after a short salutation, Mr.
                Hold-the-world propounded the question to <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> and his
                fellow, and bid them to answer it if they could.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Then said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, Even a babe in religion may answer ten
                thousand such questions. For if it be unlawful
                to follow Christ for loaves, (as it is in the sixth of
                John,) how much more abominable is it to make of him and
                religion a stalking-horse to get and enjoy the world! Nor do we
                find any other than heathens, hypocrites, devils, and witches,
                that are of this opinion.</p>
                
                <p>1. Heathens; for when Hamor and Shechem had a mind to the
                daughter and cattle of Jacob, and saw that there was no way for
                them to come at them, but by becoming circumcised, they say to
                their companions, If every male of us be circumcised, as they
                are circumcised, shall not their cattle, and their substance,
                and every beast of theirs, be ours? Their daughter and their
                cattle were that which they sought to obtain, and their religion
                the stalking-horse they made use of to come at them. Read the
                whole story, Gen. XXXIV. 20-23.
                
                </p><p>2. The hypocritical Pharisees were also of this religion; long
                prayers were their pretence, but to get widows' houses was their
                intent; and greater damnation was from God their judgment.
                
                </p><p>3. Judas the devil was also of this religion; he was religious
                for the bag, that he might be possessed of what was therein; but
                he was lost, cast away, and the very son of perdition.
                
                </p><p>4. Simon the witch was of this religion too; for he would have
                had the Holy Ghost, that he might have got money therewith; and
                his sentence from Peter's mouth was according.
                
                </p><p>5. Neither will it out of my mind, but that that man that takes
                up religion for the world, will throw away religion for the
                world; for so surely as Judas resigned the world in becoming
                religious, so surely did he also sell religion and his Master
                for the same. To answer the question,
                therefore, affirmatively, as I perceive you have done, and
                to accept of, as authentic, such answer, is both heathenish,
                hypocritical, and devilish; and your reward will be according to
                your works. Then they stood staring one upon another, but had
                not wherewith to answer <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi> also approved of the
                soundness of <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>'s answer; so there was a great silence
                among them. Mr. <hi rend="italic">By-ends</hi> and his company also staggered and kept
                behind, that <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi> might outgo them. Then said
                <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> to his fellow, If these men cannot stand before the
                sentence of men, what will they do with the sentence of God? And
                if they are mute when dealt with by vessels of clay, what will
                they do when they shall be rebuked by the flames of a devouring
                fire?
                
                </p><p>Then <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi> outwent them again, and went till
                they came to a delicate plain called <hi rend="italic">Ease</hi>, where they went with
                much content; but that plain was but narrow, so they were
                quickly got over it. Now at the further side of that plain was
                a little hill called <hi rend="italic">Lucre</hi>, and in that hill a silver mine,
                which some of them that had formerly gone that way, because of
                the rarity of it, had turned aside to see; but going too near
                the brink of the pit, the ground being deceitful under them,
                broke, and they were slain; some also had been maimed there, and
                could not, to their dying day, be their own men again.
                
                </p><p>Then I saw in my dream, that a little off the road, over against
                the silver mine, stood <hi rend="italic">Demas</hi> (gentlemanlike) to call to
                passengers to come and see; who said to <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> and his
                fellow, Ho! turn aside hither, and I will shew you a thing.</p>
                
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> What thing so deserving as to turn us out of the way to see
                it?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Demas.</hi> Here is a silver mine, and some digging in it for
                treasure. If you will come, with a little pains you may richly
                provide for yourselves.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> Then said <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi>, Let us go see.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Not I, said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, I have heard of this place before
                now; and how many have there been slain; and besides that,
                treasure is a snare to those that seek it; for it hindereth them
                in their pilgrimage. Then <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> called to <hi rend="italic">Demas</hi>, saying, Is
                not the place dangerous? Hath it not hindered many in their
                pilgrimage?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Demas.</hi> Not very dangerous, except to those that are careless,
                (but withal he blushed as he spake).
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Then said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi>, Let us not stir a step, but
                still keep on our way.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> I will warrant you, when <hi rend="italic">By-ends</hi> comes up, if he hath the
                same invitation as we, he will turn in thither to see.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> No doubt thereof, for his principles lead him that way, and
                a hundred to one but he dies there.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Demas.</hi> Then <hi rend="italic">Demas</hi> called again, saying, But will you not come
                over and see?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Then <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> roundly answered,
                saying, <hi rend="italic">Demas</hi>, thou art an
                enemy to the right ways of the Lord of this way, and hast been
                already condemned for thine own turning aside, by one of His
                Majesty's judges; and why seekest thou to bring us into the like
                condemnation? Besides, if we at all turn aside, our Lord and
                King will certainly hear thereof, and will there put us to
                shame, where we would stand with boldness before him.</p>
                
                <p><hi rend="italic">Demas</hi> cried again, that he also was one of their fraternity; and
                that if they would tarry a little, he also himself would walk
                with them.</p>
                
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Then said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, What is thy name? Is it not the same
                by the which I have called thee?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Demas.</hi> Yes, my name is <hi rend="italic">Demas</hi>; I am the son of Abraham.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> I know you; Gehazi was your great-grandfather, and Judas
                your father; and you have trod in their steps. It is but a
                devilish prank that thou usest; thy father was hanged for a
                traitor, and thou deservest no better reward. Assure thyself,
                that when we come to the King, we will do him word of this thy
                behaviour. Thus they went their way.
                
                </p><p>By this time <hi rend="italic">By-ends</hi> and his companions were come again within
                sight, and they, at the first beck, went over to <hi rend="italic">Demas</hi>. Now,
                whether they fell into the pit by looking over the brink
                thereof, or whether they went down to dig, or whether they were
                smothered in the bottom by the damps that commonly arise, of
                these things I am not certain; but this I observed, that they
                never were seen again in the way. Then sang <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> --</p>
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                <l rend="indent"><hi rend="italic">By-ends</hi> and silver <hi rend="italic">Demas</hi> both agree;
                </l><l rend="indent">One calls, the other runs, that he may be
                </l><l rend="indent">A sharer in his lucre; so these do
                </l><l rend="indent">Take up in this world, and no further go.</l>
                </lg>
                
                <p>Now I saw that, just on the other side of this plain, the
                pilgrims came to a place where stood an old monument, hard by
                the highway side, at the sight of which they were both
                concerned, because of the strangeness of the form thereof; for
                it seemed to them as if it had been a woman transformed into the
                shape of a pillar; here, therefore they stood looking, and
                looking upon it, but
                could not for a time tell what they should make thereof. At last
                <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi> espied written above the head thereof, a writing in an
                unusual hand; but he being no scholar, called to <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> (for
                he was learned) to see if he could pick out the meaning; so he
                came, and after a little laying of letters together, he found
                the same to be this, <hi rend="italic">Remember Lot's Wife</hi>. So he read it to his
                fellow; after which they both concluded that that was the pillar
                of salt into which Lot's wife was turned, for her looking back
                with a covetous heart, when she was going from Sodom for safety.
                Which sudden and amazing sight gave them occasion of this
                discourse.</p>
                
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Ah, my brother! this is a seasonable sight; it came
                opportunely to us after the invitation which <hi rend="italic">Demas</hi> gave us to
                come over to view the Hill <hi rend="italic">Lucre</hi>; and had we gone over, as he
                desired us, and as thou wast inclining to do, my brother, we
                had, for aught I know, been made ourselves like this woman, a
                spectacle for those that shall come after to behold.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> I am sorry that I was so foolish, and am made to wonder
                that I am not now as Lot's wife; for wherein was the difference
                betwixt her sin and mine? She only looked back; and I had a
                desire to go see. Let grace be adored, and let me be ashamed
                that ever such a thing should be in mine heart.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Let us take notice of what we see here, for our help for
                time to come. This woman escaped one judgment, for she fell not
                by the destruction of Sodom; yet she was destroyed by another,
                as we see she is turned into a pillar of salt.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> True; and she may be to us both caution and example;
                caution, that we should shun her sin; or a sign
                of what judgment will overtake such as shall not be prevented by
                this caution; so Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, with the two hundred
                and fifty men that perished in their sin, did also become a sign
                or example to others to beware. But above all, I muse at one
                thing, to wit, how <hi rend="italic">Demas</hi> and his fellows can stand so
                confidently yonder to look for that treasure, which this woman,
                but for looking behind her after, (for we read not that she
                stepped one foot out of the way) was turned into a pillar of
                salt; especially since the judgment which overtook her did make
                her an example, within sight of where they are; for they cannot
                choose but see her, did they but lift up their eyes.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> It is a thing to be wondered at, and it argueth that their
                hearts are grown desperate in the case; and I cannot tell who to
                compare them to so fitly, as to them that pick pockets in the
                presence of the judge, or that will cut purses under the
                gallows. It is said of the men of Sodom, that they were sinners
                exceedingly, because they were sinners before the Lord, that is,
                in his eyesight, and notwithstanding the kindnesses that he had
                shewed them; for the land of Sodom was now like the garden of
                Eden heretofore. This, therefore, provoked him the more to
                jealousy, and made their plague as hot as the fire of the Lord
                out of heaven could make it. And it is most rationally to be
                concluded, that such, even such as these are, that shall sin in
                the sight, yea, and that too in despite of such examples that
                are set continually before them, to caution them to the
                contrary, must be partakers of severest judgments.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> Doubtless thou hast said the truth; but what a mercy is it
                that neither thou, but especially I, am not made myself this
                example! This ministereth occasion to
                us to thank God, to fear before him, and always to remember

                </p><p>I saw, then, that they went on their way to a pleasant river;
                which David the king called <hi rend="italic">the river of God</hi>, but John, <hi rend="italic">the
                river of the water of life</hi>. Now their way lay just upon the bank
                of the river; here, therefore, <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> and his companion
                walked with great delight; they drank also of the water of the
                river, which was pleasant, and enlivening to their weary
                spirits; besides, on the banks of this river, on either side,
                were green trees, that bore all manner of fruit; and the leaves
                of the trees were good for medicine; with the fruit of these
                trees they were also much delighted; and the leaves they eat to
                prevent surfeits, and other diseases that are incident to those
                that heat their blood by travels. On either side of the river
                was also a meadow, curiously beautified with lilies, and it was
                green all the year long. In this meadow they lay down, and
                slept; for here they might lie down safely. When they awoke,
                they gathered again of the fruit of the trees, and drank again
                of the water of the river, and then lay down again to sleep.
                Thus they did several days and nights. Then they sang --</p>
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                <l rend="indent">Behold ye how these crystal streams do glide,
                </l><l rend="indent">To comfort pilgrims by the highway side;
                </l><l rend="indent">The meadows green, beside their fragrant smell,
                </l><l rend="indent">Yield dainties for them; and he that can tell

                </lg>
                
                <p>So when they were disposed to go on, (for they were not, as yet,
                at their journey's end,) they ate and drank, and departed.
                
                </p><p>Now, I beheld in my dream, that they had not journeyed far, but
                the river and the way for a time parted; at which they were not
                a little sorry; yet they durst not go out of the way. Now the
                way from the river was rough, and their feet tender, by reason
                of their travels; <hi rend="italic">so the souls of the pilgrims were much
                discouraged because of the way.</hi> Wherefore, still as they went
                on, they wished for better way. Now, a little before them, there
                was on the left hand of the road a meadow, and a stile to go
                over into it; and that meadow is called <hi rend="italic">By-path Meadow</hi>. Then
                said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> to his fellow, If this meadow lieth along by our
                wayside, let us go over into it. Then he went to the stile to
                see, and behold, a path lay along by the way, on the other side
                of the fence. It is according to my wish, said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>. Here
                is the easiest going; come, good <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi>, and let us go over.</p>
                
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> But how if this path should lead us out of the way?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> That is not like, said the other. Look, doth it not go
                along by the wayside? So <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi>, being persuaded by his fellow,
                went after him over the stile. When they were gone over, and
                were got into the path, they found it very easy for their feet;
                and withal, they, looking before them, espied a man walking as
                they did, (and his name was <hi rend="italic">Vain-confidence</hi>;) so they called
                after him, and asked him whither that way led. He said, To the
                <hi rend="italic">Celestial Gate</hi>. Look, said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, did not I tell you so? By
                this you may see we are right. So they followed, and he went
                before them. But, behold, the night came on, and it grew very
                dark; so that they that were behind lost the sight of him that
                went before.</p>
                
                <p>He, therefore, that went before, (<hi rend="italic">Vain-confidence</hi> by
                name,) not seeing the way before him, fell into a deep pit,
                which was on purpose there made, by the Prince of those grounds,
                to catch vain-glorious fools withal, and was dashed in pieces
                with his fall.
                
                </p><p>Now <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> and his fellow heard him fall. So they called to
                know the matter, but there was none to answer, only they heard
                a groaning. Then said <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi>, Where are we now? Then was his
                fellow silent, as mistrusting that he had led him out of the
                way; and now it began to rain, and thunder, and lighten in a
                very dreadful manner; and the water rose amain.
                
                </p><p>Then <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi> groaned in himself, saying, Oh, that I had kept on
                my way!</p>
                
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Who could have thought that this path should have led us
                out of the way?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> I was afraid on it at the very first, and therefore gave
                you that gentle caution. I would have spoken plainer, but that
                you are older than I.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Good brother, be not offended; I am sorry I have brought
                thee out of the way, and that I have put thee into such imminent
                danger; pray, my brother, forgive me; I did not do it of an evil
                intent.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> Be comforted, my brother, for I forgive thee; and believe,
                too, that this shall be for our good.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> I am glad I have with me a merciful brother; but we must
                not stand thus: let us try to go back again.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> But, good brother, let me go before.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> No, if you please, let me go first, that if there be any
                danger, I may be first therein, because by my means we are both
                gone out of the way.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> No, said <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi>, you shall not go first; for your mind
                being troubled may lead you out of the way
                again. Then, for their encouragement, they heard the voice of
                one saying, <hi rend="italic">Set thine heart toward the highway, even the way
                which thou wentest; turn again</hi>. But by this time the waters were
                greatly risen, by reason of which the way of going back was very
                dangerous. (Then I thought that it is easier going out of the
                way, when we are in, than going in when we are out.) Yet they
                adventured to go back, but it was so dark, and the flood was so
                high, that in their going back they had like to have been
                drowned nine or ten times.
                
                </p><p>Neither could they, with all the skill they had, get again to
                the stile that night. Wherefore, at last, lighting under a
                little shelter, they sat down there until the daybreak; but,
                being weary, they fell asleep. Now there was, not far from the
                place where they lay, a castle called <hi rend="italic">Doubting</hi> Castle, the owner
                whereof was Giant <hi rend="italic">Despair</hi>; and it was in his grounds they now
                were sleeping: wherefore he, getting up in the morning early,
                and walking up and down in his fields, caught <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> and
                <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi> asleep in his grounds. Then, with a grim and surly
                voice, he bid them awake; and asked them whence they were, and
                what they did in his grounds. They told him they were pilgrims,
                and that they had lost their way. Then said the Giant, You have
                this night trespassed on me, by trampling in and lying on my
                grounds, and therefore you must go along with me. So they were
                forced to go, because he was stronger than they. They also had
                but little to say, for they knew themselves in a fault. The
                Giant, therefore, drove them before him, and put them into his
                castle, into a very dark dungeon, nasty and stinking to the
                spirits of these two men. Here, then, they lay from Wednesday
                morning till Saturday night, without one bit
                of bread, or drop of drink, or light, or any to ask how they
                did; they were, therefore, here in evil case, and were far from
                friends and acquaintance. Now in this place <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> had double
                sorrow, because it was through his unadvised counsel that they
                were brought into this distress.</p>
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                <l rend="indent">The pilgrims now, to gratify the flesh,
                </l><l rend="indent">Will seek its ease; but oh! how they afresh

                <p>
                Now, Giant <hi rend="italic">Despair</hi> had a wife, and her name was <hi rend="italic">Diffidence</hi>. So
                when he was gone to bed, he told his wife what he had done; to
                wit, that he had taken a couple of prisoners and cast them into
                his dungeon, for trespassing on his grounds. Then he asked her
                also what he had best to do further to them. So she asked him
                what they were, whence they came, and whither they were bound;
                and he told her. Then she counselled him that when he arose in
                the morning he should beat them without any mercy. So, when he
                arose, he getteth him a grievous crab-tree cudgel, and goes down
                into the dungeon to them, and there first falls to rating of
                them as if they were dogs, although they never gave him a word
                of distaste. Then he falls upon them, and beats them fearfully,
                in such sort that they were not able to help themselves, or to
                turn them upon the floor. This done, he withdraws and leaves
                them there to condole their misery and to mourn under their
                distress. So all that day they spent the time in nothing but
                sighs and bitter lamentations. The next night, she, talking with
                her husband about them further, and understanding
                they were yet alive, did advise him to counsel them to
                make away themselves. So when morning was come, he goes to them
                in a surly manner as before, and perceiving them to be very sore
                with the stripes that he had given them the day before, he told
                them, that since they were never like to come out of that place,
                their only way would be forthwith to make an end of themselves,
                either with knife, halter, or poison, for why, said he, should
                you choose life, seeing it is attended with so much bitterness?
                But they desired him to let them go. With that he looked ugly
                upon them, and, rushing to them, had doubtless made an end of
                them himself, but that he fell into one of his fits, (for he
                sometimes, in sunshiny weather, fell into fits,) and lost for a
                time the use of his hand; wherefore he withdrew, and left them
                as before, to consider what to do. Then did the prisoners
                consult between themselves whether it was best to take his
                counsel or no; and thus they began to discourse: --
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Brother, said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, what shall we do? The life that we
                now live is miserable. For my part I know not whether is best,
                to live thus, or to die out of hand. <hi rend="italic">My soul chooseth strangling
                rather than life</hi>, and the grave is more easy for me than this
                dungeon. Shall we be ruled by the Giant?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> Indeed, our present condition is dreadful, and death would
                be far more welcome to me than thus for ever to abide; but yet,
                let us consider, the Lord of the country to which we are going
                hath said, Thou shalt do no murder: no, not to another man's
                person; much more, then, are we forbidden to take his counsel to
                kill ourselves. Besides, he that kills another, can but commit
                murder upon his body; but for one to kill himself is to
                kill body and soul at once. And, moreover, my brother, thou
                talkest of ease in the grave; but hast thou forgotten the hell,
                whither for certain the murderers go? For <hi rend="italic">no murderer hath
                eternal life,</hi> &amp;c. And let us consider, again, that all the law
                is not in the hand of Giant <hi rend="italic">Despair</hi>. Others, so far as I can
                understand, have been taken by him, as well as we; and yet have
                escaped out of his hand. Who knows, but the God that made the
                world may cause that Giant <hi rend="italic">Despair</hi> may die? or that, at some
                time or other, he may forget to lock us in? or that he may, in
                a short time, have another of his fits before us, and may lose
                the use of his limbs? and if ever that should come to pass
                again, for my part, I am resolved to pluck up the heart of a
                man, and to try my utmost to get from under his hand. I was a
                fool that I did not try to do it before; but, however, my
                brother, let us be patient, and endure a while. The time may
                come that may give us a happy release; but let us not be our own
                murderers. With these words <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi> at present did moderate the
                mind of his brother; so they continued together (in the dark)
                that day, in their sad and doleful condition.
                
                </p><p>Well, towards evening, the Giant goes down into the dungeon
                again, to see if his prisoners had taken his counsel; but when
                he came there he found them alive; and truly, alive was all; for
                now, what for want of bread and water, and by reason of the
                wounds they received when he beat them, they could do little but
                breathe. But, I say, he found them alive; at which he fell into
                a grievous rage, and told them that, seeing they had disobeyed
                his counsel, it should be worse with them than if they had never
                been born.
                </p><p>
                At this they trembled greatly, and I think that <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>
                fell into a swoon; but, coming a little to himself again,
                they renewed their discourse about the Giant's counsel; and
                whether yet they had best to take it or no. Now <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> again
                seemed to be for doing it, but <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi> made his second reply as
                followeth: --
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> My brother, said he, rememberest thou not how valiant thou
                hast been heretofore? <hi rend="italic">Apollyon</hi> could not crush thee, nor could
                all that thou didst hear, or see, or feel, in the Valley of the
                <hi rend="italic">Shadow of Death</hi>. What hardship, terror, and amazement hast thou
                already gone through! And art thou now nothing but fear! Thou
                seest that I am in the dungeon with thee, a far weaker man by
                nature than thou art; also, this Giant has wounded me as well as
                thee, and hath also cut off the bread and water from my mouth;
                and with thee I mourn without the light. But let us exercise a
                little more patience; remember how thou playedst the man at
                <hi rend="italic">Vanity Fair</hi>, and wast neither afraid of the chain, nor cage, nor
                yet of bloody death. Wherefore let us (at least to avoid the
                shame, that becomes not a <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> to be found in) bear up with
                patience as well as we can.
                
                </p><p>
                Now, night being come again, and the Giant and his wife being in
                bed, she asked him concerning the prisoners, and if they had
                taken his counsel. To which he replied, They are sturdy rogues,
                they choose rather to bear all hardship, than to make away
                themselves. Then said she, Take them into the castle-yard
                to-morrow, and shew them the bones and skulls of those that thou
                hast already despatched, and make them believe, ere a week comes
                to an end, thou also wilt tear them in pieces, as thou hast done
                their fellows before them.
                </p><p>
                So when the morning was come, the Giant goes to
                them again, and takes them into the castle-yard, and shews them,
                as his wife had bidden him. These, said he, were pilgrims as you
                are, once, and they trespassed in my grounds, as you have done;
                and when I thought fit, I tore them in pieces, and so, within
                ten days, I will do you. Go, get you down to your den again; and
                with that he beat them all the way thither. They lay, therefore,
                all day on Saturday in a lamentable case, as before. Now, when
                night was come, and when Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Diffidence</hi> and her husband, the
                Giant, were got to bed, they began to renew their discourse of
                their prisoners; and withal the old Giant wondered, that he
                could neither by his blows nor his counsel bring them to an end.
                And with that his wife replied, I fear, said she, that they live
                in hope that some will come to relieve them, or that they have
                picklocks about them, by the means of which they hope to escape.
                And sayest thou so, my dear? said the Giant; I will, therefore,
                search them in the morning.
                </p><p>
                Well, on Saturday, about midnight, they began to pray, and
                continued in prayer till almost break of day.
                </p><p>
                Now, a little before it was day, good <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, as one half
                amazed, brake out in this passionate speech: -- What a fool,
                quoth he, am I, thus to lie in a stinking dungeon, when I may as
                well walk at liberty! I have a key in my bosom, called Promise,
                that will, I am persuaded, open any lock in <hi rend="italic">Doubting</hi> Castle.
                Then said <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi>, That is good news, good brother; pluck it out
                of thy bosom, and try.
                </p><p>
                Then <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> pulled it out of his bosom, and began to try at
                the dungeon door, whose bolt (as he turned the key) gave back,
                and the door flew open with ease, and <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi> both
                came out. Then he went to
                the outward door that leads into the castle-yard, and, with his
                key, opened that door also. After, he went to the iron gate, for
                that must be opened too; but that lock went damnable hard, yet
                the key did open it. Then they thrust open the gate to make
                their escape with speed, but that gate, as it opened, made such
                a creaking, that it waked Giant <hi rend="italic">Despair</hi>, who, hastily rising to
                pursue his prisoners, felt his limbs to fail, for his fits took
                him again, so that he could by no means go after them. Then they
                went on, and came to the King's highway, and so were safe,
                because they were out of his jurisdiction.
                </p><p>
                Now, when they were over the stile, they began to contrive with
                themselves what they should do at that stile to prevent those
                that should come after from falling into the hands of Giant
                <hi rend="italic">Despair</hi>. So they consented to erect there a pillar, and to
                engrave upon the side thereof this sentence -- 'Over this stile
                is the way to <hi rend="italic">Doubting</hi> Castle, which is kept by Giant <hi rend="italic">Despair</hi>,
                who despiseth the King of the Celestial Country, and seeks to
                destroy his holy pilgrims.' Many, therefore, that followed after
                read what was written, and escaped the danger. This done, they
                sang as follows: -- </p>
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                <l rend="indent">Out of the way we went, and then we found
                </l><l rend="indent">What 'twas to tread upon forbidden ground;
                </l><l rend="indent">And let them that come after have a care,
                </l><l rend="indent">Lest heedlessness makes them, as we, to fare.
                </l><l rend="indent">Lest they for trespassing his prisoners are,
                </l><l rend="indent">Whose castle's <hi rend="italic">Doubting</hi>, and whose name's <hi rend="italic">Despair</hi>.</l>
                </lg>
                
                <p>They went then till they came to the <hi rend="italic">Delectable Mountains</hi>, which
                mountains belong to the Lord of that hill of
                which we have spoken before; so they went up to the mountains,
                to behold the gardens and orchards, the vineyards and fountains
                of water; where also they drank and washed themselves, and did
                freely eat of the vineyards. Now there were on the tops of these
                mountains Shepherds feeding their flocks, and they stood by the
                highway side. The Pilgrims therefore went to them, and leaning
                upon their staves, (as is common with weary pilgrims when they
                stand to talk with any by the way,) they asked, Whose <hi rend="italic">Delectable
                Mountains</hi> are these? And whose be the sheep that feed upon them?</p>
                
                <lg type="stanza">

                sight of his city; and the sheep also are his, and he laid down

                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Is this the way to the <hi rend="italic">Celestial City</hi>?

                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Shep.</hi>  Too far for any but those that shall get thither indeed.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Is the way safe or dangerous?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Shep.</hi>  Safe for those for whom it is to be safe; <hi rend="italic">but the

                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Is there, in this place, any relief for pilgrims that are
                weary and faint in the way?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Shep.</hi>  The Lord of these mountains hath given us a charge not to
                be <hi rend="italic">forgetful to entertain strangers</hi>, therefore the good of the
                place is before you.
                </p><p>
                I saw also in my dream, that when the Shepherds perceived that
                they were wayfaring men, they also put questions to them, to
                which they made answer as in other places; as, Whence came you?
                and, How got you into the way? and, By what means have you so
                persevered therein? For but few of them that begin to come
                hither do shew their face on these mountains. But when the
                Shepherds heard their answers, being pleased therewith, they
                looked very lovingly upon them, and said, Welcome to the
                <hi rend="italic">Delectable Mountains</hi>.
                </p><p>
                The Shepherds, I say, whose names were <hi rend="italic">Knowledge</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Experience</hi>,
                <hi rend="italic">Watchful</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Sincere</hi>, took them by the hand, and had them to
                their tents, and made them partake of that which was ready at
                present. They said, moreover, We would that ye should stay here
                awhile, to be acquainted with us; and yet more to solace
                yourselves with the good of these <hi rend="italic">Delectable Mountains</hi>. They
                then told them, that they were content to stay; so they went to
                their rest that night, because it was very late.
                </p><p>
                Then I saw in my dream, that in the morning the Shepherds called
                up to <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi> to walk with them upon the
                mountains; so they went forth with them, and walked a while,
                having a pleasant prospect on every side. Then said the
                Shepherds one to another, Shall we shew these pilgrims some
                wonders? So when they had concluded to do it, they had them
                first to the top of a hill called Error, which was very steep on
                the furthest side, and bid them look down to the bottom. So
                <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi> looked down, and saw at the bottom several
                men dashed all to pieces by a fall that they had from the top.
                Then said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, What meaneth this? The Shepherds answered,
                Have you not heard of them that were made
                to err by hearkening to Hymeneus and Philetus as concerning the
                faith of the resurrection of the body? They answered, Yes. Then
                said the Shepherds, Those that you see lie dashed in pieces at
                the bottom of this mountain are they; and they have continued to
                this day unburied, as you see, for an example to others to take
                heed how they clamber too high, or how they come too near the
                brink of this mountain.
                </p><p>
                Then I saw that they had them to the top of another mountain,
                and the name of that is <hi rend="italic">Caution</hi>, and bid them look afar off;
                which, when they did, they perceived, as they thought, several
                men walking up and down among the tombs that were there; and
                they perceived that the men were blind, because they stumbled
                sometimes upon the tombs, and because they could not get out
                from among them. Then said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, What means this?
                </p><p>
                The Shepherds then answered, Did you not see a little below
                these mountains a stile, that led into a meadow, on the left
                hand of this way? They answered, Yes. Then said the Shepherds,
                From that stile there goes a path that leads directly to
                <hi rend="italic">Doubting</hi> Castle, which is kept by Giant <hi rend="italic">Despair</hi>, and these,
                pointing to them among the tombs, came once on pilgrimage, as
                you do now, even till they came to that same stile; and because
                the right way was rough in that place, they chose to go out of
                it into that meadow, and there were taken by Giant <hi rend="italic">Despair</hi>, and
                cast into <hi rend="italic">Doubting</hi> Castle; where, after they had been a while
                kept in the dungeon, he at last did put out their eyes, and led
                them among those tombs, where he has left them to wander to this
                very day, that the saying of the wise man might be fulfilled, <hi rend="italic">He
                that wandereth out of the way of understanding, shall remain in
                the congregation of the
                dead.</hi> Then <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi> looked upon one another, with
                tears gushing out, but yet said nothing to the Shepherds.
                </p><p>
                Then I saw in my dream, that the Shepherds had them to another
                place, in a bottom, where was a door in the side of a hill, and
                they opened the door, and bid them look in. They looked in,
                therefore, and saw that within it was very dark and smoky; they
                also thought that they heard there a rumbling noise as of fire,
                and a cry of some tormented, and that they smelt the scent of
                brimstone. Then said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, What means this? The Shepherds
                told them, This is a by-way to hell, a way that hypocrites go in
                at; namely, such as sell their birthright, with Esau; such as
                sell their master, with Judas; such as blaspheme the gospel,
                with Alexander; and that lie and dissemble, with Ananias and
                Sapphira his wife. Then said <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi> to the Shepherds, I
                perceive that these had on them, even every one, a show of
                pilgrimage, as we have now; had they not?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Shep.</hi>  Yes, and held it a long time too.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> How far might they go on in pilgrimage in their day, since
                they notwithstanding were thus miserably cast away?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Shep.</hi> Some further, and some not so far, as these mountains.
                
                Then said the Pilgrims one to another, We have need to cry to
                the Strong for strength.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Shep.</hi>  Ay, and you will have need to use it, when you have it,
                too.
                </p><p>
                By this time the Pilgrims had a desire to go forward, and the
                Shepherds a desire they should; so they walked together towards
                the end of the mountains. Then said then
                Shepherds one to another, Let us here shew to the Pilgrims the
                gates of the <hi rend="italic">Celestial City</hi>, if they have skill to look through
                our perspective glass. The Pilgrims then lovingly accepted the
                motion; so they had them to the top of a high hill, called
                <hi rend="italic">Clear</hi>, and gave them their glass to look.
                </p><p>
                Then they essayed to look, but the remembrance of that last
                thing that the Shepherds had shewn them, made their hands shake;
                by means of which impediment, they could not look steadily
                through the glass; yet they thought they saw something like the
                gate, and also some of the glory of the place. Then they went
                away, and sang this song -- </p>
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                <l rend="indent">Thus, by the Shepherds, secrets are reveal'd,
                </l><l rend="indent">Which from all other men are kept conceal'd.
                </l><l rend="indent">Come to the Shepherds, then, if you would see

                <p>
                When they were about to depart, one of the Shepherds gave them
                a note of the way. Another of them bid them beware of the
                <hi rend="italic">Flatterer</hi>. The third bid them take heed that they sleep not upon
                the <hi rend="italic">Enchanted Ground</hi>. And the fourth bid them God-speed. So I
                awoke from my dream.
                </p><p>
                And I slept, and dreamed again, and saw the same two Pilgrims
                going down the mountains along the highway towards the city.
                Now, a little below these mountains, on the left hand, lieth the
                country of <hi rend="italic">Conceit</hi>; from which country there comes into the way
                in which the Pilgrims walked, a little crooked lane. Here,
                therefore, they met with a very brisk lad, that came out of that
                country; and his name was <hi rend="italic">Ignorance</hi>. So <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> asked him from
                what parts he came, and whither he was going.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Ignor.</hi>   Sir, I was born in the country that lieth off there a
                little on the left hand, and I am going to the <hi rend="italic">Celestial City</hi>.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> But how do you think to get in at the gate? for you may
                find some difficulty there.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Ignor.</hi>   As other people do, said he.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> But what have you to shew at that gate, that may cause that
                the gate should be opened to you?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Ignor.</hi> I know my Lord's will, and I have been a good liver; I
                pay every man his own; I pray, fast, pay tithes, and give alms,
                and have left my country for whither I am going.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> But thou camest not in at the wicket-gate that is at the
                head of this way; thou camest in hither through that same
                crooked lane, and therefore, I fear, however thou mayest think
                of thyself, when the reckoning day shall come, thou wilt have
                laid to thy charge that thou art a thief and a robber, instead
                of getting admittance into the city.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Ignor.</hi>  Gentlemen, ye be utter strangers to me, I know you not;
                be content and follow the religion of your country, and I will
                follow the religion of mine. I hope all will be well. And as for
                the gate that you talk of, all the world knows that that is a
                great way off of our country. I cannot think that any man in all
                our parts doth so much as know the way to it, nor need they
                matter whether they do or no, since we have, as you see, a fine,
                pleasant green lane, that comes down from our country, the next
                way into the way.
                
                </p><p>When <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> saw that the man was <hi rend="italic">wise in his own conceit</hi>, he
                said to <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi>, whisperingly, <hi rend="italic">There is more hope of a fool than
                of him.</hi> And said, moreover, <hi rend="italic">When
                he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth him,
                and he saith to every one that he is a fool.</hi> What, shall we talk
                further with him, or out-go him at present, and so leave him to
                think of what he hath heard already, and then stop again for him
                afterwards, and see if by degrees we can do any good to him?
                Then said <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi> -- </p>
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                <l rend="indent">Let <hi rend="italic">Ignorance</hi> a little while now muse
                </l><l rend="indent">On what is said, and let him not refuse
                </l><l rend="indent">Good counsel to embrace, lest he remain
                </l><l rend="indent">Still ignorant of what's the chiefest gain.
                </l><l rend="indent">God saith, those that no understanding have,
                </l><l rend="indent">Although he made them, them he will not save.</l>
                </lg>
                
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> He further added, It is not good, I think, to say all to
                him at once; let us pass him by, if you will, and talk to him
                anon, even as he is able to bear it.
                </p><p>
                So they both went on, and <hi rend="italic">Ignorance</hi> he came after. Now when they
                had passed him a little way, they entered into a very dark lane,
                where they met a man whom seven devils had bound with seven
                strong cords, and were carrying of him back to the door that
                they saw on the side of the hill. Now good <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> began to
                tremble, and so did <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi> his companion; yet as the devils led
                away the man, <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> looked to see if he knew him; and he
                thought it might be one <hi rend="italic">Turn-away</hi>, that dwelt in the town of
                <hi rend="italic">Apostasy</hi>. But he did not perfectly see his face, for he did hang
                his head like a thief that is found. But being once past,
                <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi> looked after him, and espied on his back a paper with
                this inscription, <hi rend="italic">Wanton</hi> professor and damnable apostate. Then
                said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> to his fellow, Now I call to remembrance, that
                which was told me of a
                thing that happened to a good man hereabout. The name of the man
                was <hi rend="italic">Little-faith</hi>, but a good man, and he dwelt in the town of
                <hi rend="italic">Sincere</hi>. The thing was this: -- At the entering in at this
                passage, there comes down from <hi rend="italic">Broad-way Gate</hi>, a lane called
                <hi rend="italic">Dead Man's Lane</hi>; so called because of the murders that are
                commonly done there; and this <hi rend="italic">Little-faith</hi> going on pilgrimage,
                as we do now, chanced to sit down there, and slept. Now there
                happened, at that time, to come down the lane, from <hi rend="italic">Broad-way
                Gate</hi>, three sturdy rogues, and their names were <hi rend="italic">Faint-heart</hi>,
                <hi rend="italic">Mistrust</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Guilt</hi>, (three brothers,) and they espying
                <hi rend="italic">Little-faith</hi>, where he was, came galloping up with speed. Now
                the good man was just awake from his sleep, and was getting up
                to go on his journey. So they came up all to him, and with
                threatening language bid him stand. At this <hi rend="italic">Little-faith</hi> looked
                as white as a clout, and had neither power to fight nor fly.
                Then said <hi rend="italic">Faint-heart</hi>, Deliver thy purse. But he making no haste
                to do it (for he was loath to lose his money,) <hi rend="italic">Mistrust</hi> ran up
                to him, and thrusting his hand into his pocket, pulled out
                thence a bag of silver. Then he cried out, Thieves! Thieves!
                With that <hi rend="italic">Guilt</hi>, with a great club that was in his hand, struck
                <hi rend="italic">Little-faith</hi> on the head, and with that blow felled him flat to
                the ground, where he lay bleeding as one that would bleed to
                death. All this while the thieves stood by. But, at last, they
                hearing that some were upon the road, and fearing lest it should
                be one <hi rend="italic">Great-grace</hi>, that dwells in the city of <hi rend="italic">Good-confidence</hi>,
                they betook themselves to their heels, and left this good man to
                shift for himself. Now, after a while, <hi rend="italic">Little-faith</hi> came to
                himself, and getting up, made shift to scrabble on his way. This
                was the story.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> But did they take from him all that ever he had?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> No; the place where his jewels were they never ransacked,
                so those he kept still. But, as I was told, the good man was
                much afflicted for his loss, for the thieves got most of his
                spending-money. That which they got not (as I said) were jewels,
                also he had a little odd money left, but scarce enough to bring
                him to his journey's end; nay, if I was not misinformed, he was
                forced to beg as he went, to keep himself alive; for his jewels
                he might not sell. But beg, and do what he could, he went (as we
                say) with many a hungry belly the most part of the rest of the
                way.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> But is it not a wonder they got not from him his
                certificate, by which he was to receive his admittance at the
                <hi rend="italic">Celestial Gate</hi>?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> It is a wonder; but they got not that, though they missed
                it not through any good cunning of his; for he, being dismayed
                with their coming upon him, had neither power nor skill to hide
                anything; so it was more by good Providence than by his
                endeavour, that they missed of that good thing.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> But it must needs be a comfort to him, that they got not
                his jewels from him.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> It might have been great comfort to him, had he used it as
                he should; but they that told me the story said, that he made
                but little use of it all the rest of the way, and that because
                of the dismay that he had in the taking away his money; indeed,
                he forgot it a great part of the rest of his journey; and
                besides, when at any time it came into his mind, and he began to
                be comforted therewith,
                then would fresh thoughts of his loss come again upon him, and
                those thoughts would swallow up all.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> Alas! poor man! This could not but be a great grief to
                him.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Grief! ay, a grief indeed. Would it not have been so to any
                of us, had we been used as he, to be robbed, and wounded too,
                and that in a strange place, as he was? It is a wonder he did
                not die with grief, poor heart! I was told that he scattered
                almost all the rest of the way with nothing but doleful and
                bitter complaints; telling also to all that overtook him, or
                that he overtook in the way as he went, where he was robbed, and
                how; who they were that did it, and what he lost; how he was
                wounded, and that he hardly escaped with his life.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> But it is a wonder that his necessity did not put him upon
                selling or pawning some of his jewels, that he might have
                wherewith to relieve himself in his journey.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Thou talkest like one upon whose head is the shell to this
                very day; for what should he pawn them, or to whom should he
                sell them? In all that country where he was robbed, his jewels
                were not accounted of; nor did he want that relief which could
                from thence be administered to him. Besides, had his jewels been
                missing at the gate of the <hi rend="italic">Celestial City</hi>, he had (and that he
                knew well enough) been excluded from an inheritance there; and
                that would have been worse to him than the appearance and
                villainy of ten thousand thieves.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> Why art thou so tart, my brother? Esau sold his
                birthright, and that for a mess of pottage, and that birthright
                was his greatest jewel; and if he, why might not <hi rend="italic">Little-faith</hi> do
                so too?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Esau did sell his birthright indeed, and so do many
                besides, and by so doing exclude themselves from the chief
                blessing, as also that caitiff did; but you must put a
                difference betwixt Esau and <hi rend="italic">Little-faith</hi>, and also betwixt their
                estates. Esau's birthright was typical, but <hi rend="italic">Little-faith</hi>'s
                jewels were not so; Esau's belly was his god, but <hi rend="italic">Little-faith</hi>'s
                belly was not so; Esau's want lay in his fleshly appetite,
                <hi rend="italic">Little-faith</hi>'s did not so. Besides, Esau could see no further
                than to the fulfilling of his lusts; <hi rend="italic">Behold, I am at the point
                to die</hi>, (said he,) <hi rend="italic">and what profit shall this birthright do me?</hi>
                But <hi rend="italic">Little-faith</hi>, though it was his lot to have but a little
                faith, was by his little faith kept from such extravagances, and
                made to see and prize his jewels more than to sell them, as Esau
                did his birthright. You read not anywhere that Esau had faith,
                no, not so much as a little; therefore, no marvel if, where the
                flesh only bears sway, (as it will in that man where no faith is
                to resist,) if he sells his birthright, and his soul and all,
                and that to the devil of hell; for it is with such, as it is
                with the ass, who in her occasions cannot be turned away. When
                their minds are set upon their lusts, they will have them
                whatever they cost. But <hi rend="italic">Little-faith</hi> was of another temper, his
                mind was on things divine; his livelihood was upon things that
                were spiritual, and from above; therefore, to what end should he
                that is of such a temper sell his jewels (had there been any
                that would have bought them) to fill his mind with empty things?
                Will a man give a penny to fill his belly with hay; or can you
                persuade the turtle-dove to live upon carrion like the crow?
                Though faithless ones can, for carnal lusts, pawn, or mortgage,
                or sell what they have, and themselves outright to boot; yet
                they that have
                faith, saving faith, though but a little of it, cannot do so.
                Here, therefore, my brother, is thy mistake.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> I acknowledge it; but yet your severe reflection had
                almost made me angry.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Why, I did but compare thee to some of the birds that are
                of the brisker sort, who will run to and fro in untrodden paths,
                with the shell upon their heads; but pass by that, and consider
                the matter under debate, and all shall be well betwixt thee and
                me.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> But, <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, these three fellows, I am persuaded in my
                heart, are but a company of cowards; would they have run else,
                think you, as they did, at the noise of one that was coming on
                the road? Why did not <hi rend="italic">Little-faith</hi> pluck up a greater heart? He
                might, methinks, have stood one brush with them, and have
                yielded when there had been no remedy.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> That they are cowards, many have said, but few have found
                it so in the time of trial. As for a great heart, <hi rend="italic">Little-faith</hi>
                had none; and I perceive by thee, my brother, hadst thou been
                the man concerned, thou art but for a brush, and then to yield.
                And, verily, since this is the height of thy stomach, now they
                are at a distance from us, should they appear to thee as they
                did to him they might put thee to second thoughts.
                </p><p>
                But, consider again, they are but journeymen thieves, they serve
                under the king of the bottomless pit, who, if need be, will come
                into their aid himself, and his voice is as the roaring of a
                lion. I myself have been engaged as this <hi rend="italic">Little-faith</hi> was, and
                I found it a terrible thing. These three villains set upon me,
                and I beginning, like a <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, to resist, they gave but a
                call, and in came their master. I would, as the saying is, have
                given my life for
                a penny, but that, as God would have it, I was clothed with
                armour of proof. Ay, and yet, though I was so harnessed, I found
                it hard work to quit myself like a man. No man can tell what in
                that combat attends us, but he that hath been in the battle
                himself.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> Well, but they ran, you see, when they did but suppose
                that one <hi rend="italic">Great-grace</hi> was in the way.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> True, they have often fled, both they and their master,
                when <hi rend="italic">Great-grace</hi> hath but appeared; and no marvel; for he is the
                King's champion. But, I trow, you will put some difference
                betwixt <hi rend="italic">Little-faith</hi> and the King's champion. All the King's
                subjects are not his champions, nor can they, when tried, do
                such feats of war as he. Is it meet to think that a little child
                should handle Goliath as David did? Or that there should be the
                strength of an ox in a wren? Some are strong, some are weak;
                some have great faith, some have little. This man was one of the
                weak, and therefore he went to the wall.

                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> If it had been, he might have had his hands full; for I
                must tell you, that though <hi rend="italic">Great-grace</hi> is excellent good at his
                weapons, and has, and can, so long as he keeps them at sword's
                point, do well enough with them; yet, if they get within him,
                even <hi rend="italic">Faint-heart</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Mistrust</hi>, or the other, it shall go hard but
                they will throw up his heels. And when a man is down, you know,
                what can he do?

                Whoso looks well upon <hi rend="italic">Great-grace</hi>'s face, shall see those scars
                and cuts there, that shall easily give demonstration of what I
                say. Yea, once I heard that he should say, (and that when he was
                in the combat,) <hi rend="italic">We despaired even of life.</hi> How did these sturdy
                rogues and their fellows make David groan, mourn, and roar? Yea,
                Heman,
                and Hezekiah, too, though champions in their day, were forced to
                bestir them, when by these assaulted; and yet, notwithstanding,
                they had their coats soundly brushed by them. Peter, upon a
                time, would go try what he could do; but though some do say of
                him that he is the prince of the apostles, they handled him so,
                that they made him at last afraid of a sorry girl.
                
                </p><p>
                Besides, their king is at their whistle. He is never out of
                hearing; and if at any time they be put to the worst, he, if
                possible, comes in to help them; and of him it is said, <hi rend="italic">The
                sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold the spear, the dart,
                nor the habergeon; he esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as
                rotten wood. The arrow cannot make him flee; sling stones are
                turned with him into stubble. Darts are counted as stubble: he
                laugheth at the shaking of a spear.</hi> What can a man do in this
                case? It is true, if a man could, at every turn, have Job's
                horse, and had skill and courage to ride him, he might do
                notable things; <hi rend="italic">for his neck is clothed with thunder, he will
                not be afraid of the grasshopper; the glory of his nostrils is
                terrible: he paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his
                strength, he goeth on to meet the armed men. He mocketh at fear,
                and is not affrighted, neither turneth he back from the sword.
                The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear, and the
                shield. He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage,
                neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet. He
                saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha! and he smelleth the battle
                afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.</hi>
                </p><p>
                But for such footmen as thee and I are, let us never desire to
                meet with an enemy, nor vaunt as if we could do better, when we
                hear of others that they have been foiled,
                </p><p>
                Nor be tickled at the thoughts of our own manhood; for such
                commonly come by the worst when tried. Witness Peter, of whom I
                made mention before. He would swagger, ay, he would; he would,
                as his vain mind prompted him to say, do better, and stand more
                for his Master than all men; but who so foiled, and run down by
                these villains, as he?
                </p><p>
                When, therefore, we hear that such robberies are done on the
                King's highway, two things become us to do: --
                1. To go out harnessed, and to be sure to take a shield with us;
                for it was for want of that, that he that laid so lustily at
                Leviathan could not make him yield; for, indeed, if that be
                wanting, he fears us not at all. Therefore, he that had skill
                hath said, <hi rend="italic">Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye
                shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.</hi>
                </p><p>
                2. It is good, also, that we desire of the King a convoy, yea,
                that he will go with us himself. This made David rejoice when in
                the Valley of the <hi rend="italic">Shadow of Death</hi>; and <hi rend="italic">Moses</hi> was rather for
                dying where he stood, than to go one step without his God. Oh,
                my brother, if he will but go along with us, what need we be
                afraid of ten thousands that shall set themselves against us?
                But, without him, the proud helpers <hi rend="italic">fall under the slain</hi>.
                </p><p>
                I, for my part, have been in the fray before now; and though,
                through the goodness of him that is best, I am, as you see,
                alive, yet I cannot boast of my manhood. Glad shall I be, if I
                meet with no more such brunts; though I fear we are not got
                beyond all danger. However, since the lion and the bear have not
                as yet devoured me, I hope God will also deliver us from the
                next uncircumcised Philistine. Then sang <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> -- </p>

                So they went on and <hi rend="italic">Ignorance</hi> followed. They went then till they
                came at a place where they saw a way put itself into their way,
                and seemed withal to lie as straight as the way which they
                should go: and here they knew not which of the two to take, for
                both seemed straight before them; therefore, here they stood
                still to consider. And as they were thinking about the way,
                behold a man, black of flesh, but covered with a very light
                robe, came to them, and asked them why they stood there. They
                answered they were going to the <hi rend="italic">Celestial City</hi>, but knew not
                which of these ways to take. Follow me, said the man, it is
                thither that I am going. So they followed him in the way that
                but now came into the road, which by degrees turned, and turned
                them so from the city that they desired to go to, that, in
                little time, their faces were turned away from it; yet they
                followed him. But by and by, before they were aware, he led them
                both within the compass of a net, in which they were both so
                entangled that they knew not what to do; and with that the white
                robe fell off the black man's back. Then they saw where they
                were. Wherefore, there they lay crying some time, for they could
                not get themselves out.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Then said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> to his fellow, Now do I see myself in
                error. Did not the Shepherds bid us beware of the flatterers? As
                is the saying of the wise man, so we have found it this day. <hi rend="italic">A
                man that flattereth his neighbour, spreadeth a net for his feet.</hi>
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> They also gave us a note of directions about the way, for
                our more sure finding thereof; but therein we have also
                forgotten to read, and have not kept ourselves from the paths of
                the destroyer. Here David was wiser than we; for saith he,
                <hi rend="italic">Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips, I have
                kept me from the paths of the destroyer.</hi> Thus they lay bewailing
                themselves in the net. At last they espied a Shining One coming
                towards them with a whip of small cord in his hand. When he was
                come to the place where they were, he asked them whence they
                came, and what they did there. They told him that they were poor
                pilgrims going to <hi rend="italic">Zion</hi>, but were led out of their way by a black
                man, clothed in white, who bid us, said they, follow him, for he
                was going thither too. Then said he with the whip, It is
                <hi rend="italic">Flatterer</hi>, a false apostle, that hath transformed himself into
                an angel of light. So he rent the net, and let the men out. Then
                said he to them, Follow me, that I may set you in your way
                again. So he led them back to the way which they had left to
                follow the Flatterer. Then he asked them, saying, Where did you
                lie the last night? They said, With the Shepherds upon the
                <hi rend="italic">Delectable Mountains</hi>. He asked them then if they had not of
                those Shepherds a note of direction for the way. They answered,
                Yes. But did you, said he, when you were at a stand, pluck out
                and read your note? They answered, No. He asked them, Why? They
                said, they forgot. He asked, moreover, if the Shepherds did not
                bid them beware of the <hi rend="italic">Flatterer</hi>? They answered, Yes, but we did
                not imagine, said they, that this fine-spoken man had been he.
                </p><p>
                Then I saw in my dream that he commanded them to lie down;
                which, when they did, he chastised them sore,
                to teach them the good way wherein they should walk; and as he
                chastised them he said, <hi rend="italic">As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten;
                be zealous, therefore, and repent.</hi> This done, he bid them go on
                their way, and take good heed to the other directions of the
                shepherds. So they thanked him for all his kindness, and went
                softly along the right way, singing -- </p>
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                <l rend="indent">Come hither, you that walk along the way;

                <p>
                Now, after a while, they perceived, afar off, one coming softly
                and alone all along the highway to meet them. Then said
                <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> to his fellow, Yonder is a man with his back towards
                <hi rend="italic">Zion</hi>, and he is coming to meet us.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> I see him; let us take heed to ourselves now, lest he
                should prove a flatterer also. So he drew nearer and nearer, and
                at last came up unto them. His name was Atheist, and he asked
                them whither they were going.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> We are going to Mount <hi rend="italic">Zion</hi>.
                
                </p><p>Then <hi rend="italic">Atheist</hi> fell into a very great laughter.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> What is the meaning of your laughter?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Atheist</hi> . I laugh to see what ignorant persons you are, to take
                upon you so tedious a journey, and you are like to have nothing
                but your travel for your pains.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Why, man, do you think we shall not be received?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Atheist</hi> . Received! There is no such place as you dream of in all
                this world.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> But there is in the world to come.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Atheist</hi> . When I was at home in mine own country, I heard as you
                now affirm, and from that hearing went out to see, and have been
                seeking this city this twenty years; but find no more of it than
                I did the first day I set out.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> We have both heard and believe that there is such a place
                to be found.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Atheist</hi> . Had not I, when at home, believed, I had not come thus
                far to seek; but finding none, (and yet I should, had there been
                such a place to be found, for I have gone to seek it further
                than you,) I am going back again, and will seek to refresh
                myself with the things that I then cast away, for hopes of that
                which, I now see, is not.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Then said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi> his fellow, Is it true which

                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> Take heed, he is one of the flatterers; remember what it
                hath cost us once already for our hearkening to such kind of

                <hi rend="italic">Delectable Mountains</hi> the gate of the city? Also, are we not now
                to walk by faith? Let us go on, said <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi>, lest the man with
                the whip overtake us again. You should have taught me that
                lesson, which I will round you in the ears withal: <hi rend="italic">Cease, my
                son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words

                <hi rend="italic">believe to the saving of the soul.</hi>
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> My brother, I did not put the question to thee for that I
                doubted of the truth of our belief myself, but to prove thee,
                and to fetch from thee a fruit of the honesty of thy heart. As
                for this man, I know that he is blinded by the god of this
                world. Let thee and I go on, knowing
                that we have belief of the truth, <hi rend="italic">and no lie is of the truth</hi>.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> Now do I rejoice in hope of the glory of God. So they
                turned away from the man; and he laughing at them went his way.
                
                </p><p>I saw then in my dream, that they went till they came into a
                certain country, whose air naturally tended to make one drowsy,
                if he came a stranger into it. And here <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi> began to be very
                dull and heavy of sleep; wherefore he said unto <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, I do
                now begin to grow so drowsy that I can scarcely hold up mine
                eyes, let us lie down here and take one nap.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> By no means, said the other, lest sleeping, we never awake

                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> Why, my brother? Sleep is sweet to the labouring man; we
                may be refreshed if we take a nap.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Do you not remember that one of the Shepherds bid us beware
                of the <hi rend="italic">Enchanted Ground</hi>? He meant by that that we should beware
                of sleeping; <hi rend="italic">Therefore let us not sleep, as do others, but let
                us watch and be sober.</hi>
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> I acknowledge myself in a fault, and had I been here alone
                I had by sleeping run the danger of death. I see it is true that
                the wise man saith, <hi rend="italic">Two are better than one.</hi> Hitherto hath thy
                company been my mercy, and thou shalt have a good reward for thy

                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Now then, said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, to prevent drowsiness in this

                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> With all my heart, said the other.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Where shall we begin?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> Where God began with us. But do you begin, if you please.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> I will sing you first this song: --</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Then <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> began and said, I will ask you a question.
                How came you to think at first of so doing as you do now?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> Do you mean, how came I at first to look after the good of
                my soul?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Yes, that is my meaning.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> I continued a great while in the delight of those things
                which were seen and sold at our fair; things which, I believe
                now, would have, had I continued in them, still drowned me in
                perdition and destruction.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> What things are they?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> All the treasures and riches of the world. Also, I
                delighted much in rioting, revelling, drinking, swearing, lying,
                uncleanness, Sabbath-breaking, and what not, that tended to
                destroy the soul. But I found at last, by hearing and
                considering of things that are divine, which indeed I heard of
                you, as also of beloved <hi rend="italic">Faithful</hi> that was put to death for his
                faith and good living in <hi rend="italic">Vanity Fair</hi>, that <hi rend="italic">the end of these
                things is death.</hi> And that for these things' sake <hi rend="italic">cometh the
                wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.</hi>
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> And did you presently fall under the power of this
                conviction?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> No, I was not willing presently to know the evil of sin,
                nor the damnation that follows upon the commission
                of it; but endeavoured, when my mind at first began to
                be shaken with the Word, to shut mine eyes against the light
                thereof.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> But what was the cause of your carrying of it thus to the
                first workings of God's blessed Spirit upon you?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> The causes were -- 1. I was ignorant that this was the
                work of God upon me. I never thought that, by awakenings for
                sin, God at first begins the conversion of a sinner. 2. Sin was
                yet very sweet to my flesh, and I was loath to leave it. 3. I
                could not tell how to part with mine old companions, their
                presence and actions were so desirable unto me. 4. The hours in
                which convictions were upon me were such troublesome and such
                heart-affrighting hours that I could not bear, no not so much as
                the remembrance of them, upon my heart.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Then, as it seems, sometimes you got rid of your trouble.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> Yes, verily, but it would come into my mind again, and
                then I should be as bad, nay, worse, than I was before.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Why, what was it that brought your sins to mind again?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> Many things; as,
                </p><p>
                1. If I did but meet a good man in the streets; or,
                </p><p>
                2. If I have heard any read in the Bible; or,
                </p><p>
                3. If mine head did begin to ache; or,
                </p><p>
                4. If I were told that some of my neighbours were sick; or,
                </p><p>
                5. If I heard the bell toll for some that were dead; or,
                </p><p>
                6. If I thought of dying myself; or,
                </p><p>
                7. If I heard that sudden death happened to others;
                </p><p>
                8. But especially, when I thought of myself, that I must quickly
                come to judgment.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> And could you at any time, with ease, get off the guilt of
                sin, when by any of these ways it came upon you?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> No, not I, for then they got faster hold of my conscience;
                and then, if I did but think of going back to sin, (though my
                mind was turned against it,) it would be double torment to me.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> And how did you do then?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> I thought I must endeavour to mend my life; for else,
                thought I, I am sure to be damned.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> And did you endeavour to mend?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> Yes; and fled from not only my sins, but sinful company
                too; and betook me to religious duties, as prayer, reading,
                weeping for sin, speaking truth to my neighbours, &amp;c. These
                things did I, with many others, too much here to relate.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> And did you think yourself well then?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> Yes, for a while; but at the last, my trouble came
                tumbling upon me again, and that over the neck of all my
                reformations.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> How came that about, since you were now reformed?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> There were several things brought it upon me, especially
                such sayings as these: <hi rend="italic">All our righteousnesses are as filthy
                rags. By the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. When
                ye shall have done all those things, say, We are unprofitable</hi>;
                with many more such like. From whence I began to reason with
                myself thus: If ALL my righteousnesses are filthy rags; if, by
                the deeds of the law, NO man can be justified; and if, when we
                have done ALL, we are yet unprofitable, then it is but a folly
                to think
                of heaven by the law. I further thought thus: If a man runs a
                hundred pounds into the shopkeeper's debt, and after that shall
                pay for all that he shall fetch; yet, if this old debt stands
                still in the book uncrossed, for that the shopkeeper may sue
                him, and cast him into prison till he shall pay the debt.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Well, and how did you apply this to yourself? I thought
                thus with myself.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> Why; I have, by my sins, run a great way into God's book,
                and that my now reforming will not pay off that score; therefore
                I should think still, under all my present amendments, But how
                shall I be freed from that damnation that I have brought myself
                in danger of by my former transgressions?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> A very good application: but, pray, go on.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> Another thing that hath troubled me, even since my late
                amendments, is, that if I look narrowly into the best of what I
                do now, I still see sin, new sin, mixing itself with the best of
                that I do; so that now I am forced to conclude, that
                notwithstanding my former fond conceits of myself and duties, I
                have committed sin enough in one duty to send me to hell, though
                my former life had been faultless.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> And what did you do then?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> Do! I could not tell what to do, until I brake my mind to
                <hi rend="italic">Faithful</hi>, for he and I were well acquainted. And he told me,
                that unless I could obtain the righteousness of a man that never
                had sinned, neither mine own, nor all the righteousness of the
                world could save me.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> And did you think he spake true?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> Had he told me so when I was pleased and satisfied with
                mine own amendment, I had called him fool
                for his pains; but now, since I see mine own infirmity, and the
                sin that cleaves to my best performance, I have been forced to
                be of his opinion.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> But did you think, when at first he suggested it to you,
                that there was such a man to be found, of whom it might justly
                be said that he never committed sin?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> I must confess the words at first sounded strangely, but
                after a little more talk and company with him, I had full
                conviction about it.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> And did you ask him what man this was, and how you must be
                justified by him?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> Yes, and he told me it was the Lord Jesus, that dwelleth
                on the right hand of the Most High. And thus, said he, you must
                be justified by him, even by trusting to what he hath done by
                himself, in the days of his flesh, and suffered when he did hang
                on the tree. I asked him further, how that man's righteousness
                could be of that efficacy to justify another before God? And he
                told me he was the mighty God, and did what he did, and died the
                death also, not for himself, but for me; to whom his doings, and
                the worthiness of them, should be imputed, if I believed on him.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> And what did you do then?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> I made my objections against my believing, for that I
                thought he was not willing to save me.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> And what said <hi rend="italic">Faithful</hi> to you then?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> He bid me go to him and see. Then I said it was
                presumption; but he said, No, for I was invited to come. Then he
                gave me a book of Jesus, his inditing, to encourage me the more
                freely to come; and he said, concerning that book, that every
                jot and tittle thereof stood firmer than heaven and earth. Then
                I asked him, What I must
                do when I came; and he told me, I must entreat upon my knees,
                with all my heart and soul, the Father to reveal him to me. Then
                I asked him further, how I must make my supplication to him? And
                he said, Go, and thou shalt find him upon a mercy-seat, where he
                sits all the year long, to give pardon and forgiveness to them
                that come. I told him that I knew not what to say when I came.
                And he bid me say to this effect: God be merciful to me a
                sinner, and make me to know and believe in Jesus Christ; for I
                see, that if his righteousness had not been, or I have not faith
                in that righteousness, I am utterly cast away. Lord, I have
                heard that thou art a merciful God, and hast ordained that thy
                Son Jesus Christ should be the Saviour of the world; and
                moreover, that thou art willing to bestow him upon such a poor
                sinner as I am, (and I am a sinner indeed;) Lord, take therefore
                this opportunity and magnify thy grace in the salvation of my
                soul, through thy Son Jesus Christ. Amen.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> And did you do as you were bidden?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> Yes; over, and over, and over.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> And did the Father reveal his Son to you?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> Not at the first, nor second, nor third, nor fourth, nor
                fifth; no, nor at the sixth time neither.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> What did you do then?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi>  What! why, I could not tell what to do.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Had you not thoughts of leaving off praying?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> Yes; an hundred times twice told.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> And what was the reason you did not?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> I believed that that was true which had been told me, to
                wit, that without the righteousness of this Christ, all the
                world could not save me; and therefore, thought I with myself,
                if I leave off I die, and I can but
                die at the throne of grace. And withal, this came into my mind,
                <hi rend="italic">Though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it
                will not tarry</hi>. So I continued praying until the Father shewed
                me his Son.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> And how was he revealed unto you?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> I did not see him with my bodily eyes, but with the eyes
                of my understanding; and thus it was: One day I was very sad, I
                think sadder than at any one time in my life, and this sadness
                was through a fresh sight of the greatness and vileness of my
                sins. And as I was then looking for nothing but hell, and the
                everlasting damnation of my soul, suddenly, as I thought, I saw
                the Lord Jesus Christ look down from heaven upon me, and saying,
                <hi rend="italic">Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.</hi>
                
                </p><p>But I replied, Lord, I am a great, a very great sinner. And he
                answered, <hi rend="italic">My grace is sufficient for thee.</hi> Then I said, But,
                Lord, what is believing? And then I saw from that saying, <hi rend="italic">He
                that cometh to me shall never hunger, and he that believeth on
                me shall never thirst</hi>, that believing and coming was all one;
                and that he that came, that is, ran out in his heart and
                affections after salvation by Christ, he indeed believed in
                Christ. Then the water stood in mine eyes, and I asked further.
                But, Lord, may such a great sinner as I am be indeed accepted of
                thee, and be saved by thee? And I heard him say, <hi rend="italic">And him that
                cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</hi> Then I said, But how,
                Lord, must I consider of thee in my coming to thee, that my
                faith may be placed aright upon thee? Then he said, <hi rend="italic">Christ Jesus
                came into the world to save sinners. He is the end of the law
                for righteousness to every one that believeth. He died for our
                sins, and rose again for our justification. He loved us, and
                washed us
                from our sins in his own blood. He is mediator betwixt God and
                us. He ever liveth to make intercession for us.</hi> From all which
                I gathered, that I must look for righteousness in his person,
                and for satisfaction for my sins by his blood; that what he did
                in obedience to his Father's law, and in submitting to the
                penalty thereof, was not for himself, but for him that will
                accept it for his salvation, and be thankful. And now was my
                heart full of joy, mine eyes full of tears, and mine affections
                running over with love to the name, people, and ways of Jesus
                Christ.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> This was a revelation of Christ to your soul indeed; but
                tell me particularly what effect this had upon your spirit.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> It made me see that all the world, notwithstanding all the
                righteousness thereof, is in a state of condemnation. It made me
                see that God the Father, though he be just, can justly justify
                the coming sinner. It made me greatly ashamed of the vileness of
                my former life, and confounded me with the sense of mine own
                ignorance; for there never came thought into my heart before now
                that shewed me so the beauty of Jesus Christ. It made me love a
                holy life, and long to do something for the honour and glory of
                the name of the Lord Jesus; yea, I thought that had I now a
                thousand gallons of blood in my body, I could spill it all for
                the sake of the Lord Jesus.
                
                </p><p>I saw then in my dream that <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi> looked back and saw
                <hi rend="italic">Ignorance</hi>, whom they had left behind, coming after. Look, said
                he to <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, how far yonder youngster loitereth behind.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Ay, ay, I see him; he careth not for our company.

                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> That is true; but I warrant you he thinketh otherwise.

                </p><p>Then <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> said to him, Come away, man, why do you stay so

                he cared not for our company? But, however, said he, come up,
                and let us talk away the time in this solitary place. Then
                directing his speech to <hi rend="italic">Ignorance</hi>, he said, Come, how do you?
                How stands it between God and your soul now?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Ignor.</hi>  I hope well; for I am always full of good motions, that

                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> So do many that are never like to come there. <hi rend="italic">The soul of

                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Ignor.</hi>  But I think of them, and leave all for them.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> That I doubt; for leaving all is a hard matter: yea, a

                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Ignor.</hi>  My heart tells me so.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> The wise man says, <hi rend="italic">He that trusts his own heart is a fool.</hi>

                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> But how dost thou prove that?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Ignor.</hi>  It comforts me in hopes of heaven.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> That may be through its deceitfulness; for a man's heart
                may minister comfort to him in the hopes of that thing for which
                he yet has no ground to hope.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Ignor.</hi>  But my heart and life agree together, and therefore my

                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Who told thee that thy heart and life agree together?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Ignor.</hi>  My heart tells me so.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Ask my fellow if I be a thief! Thy heart tells thee so!
                Except the Word of God beareth witness in this matter, other
                testimony is of no value.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Ignor.</hi>  But is it not a good heart that hath good thoughts? and
                is not that a good life that is according to God's commandments?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Yes, that is a good heart that hath good thoughts, and that
                is a good life that is according to God's commandments; but it
                is one thing, indeed, to have these, and another thing only to
                think so.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Ignor.</hi>  Pray, what count you good thoughts, and a life according

                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> There are good thoughts of divers kinds; some respecting
                ourselves, some God, some Christ, and some other things.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Ignor.</hi>  What be good thoughts respecting ourselves?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Such as agree with the Word of God.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Ignor.</hi>  When do our thoughts of ourselves agree with the Word of
                God?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> When we pass the same judgment upon ourselves
                which the Word passes. To explain myself -- the Word of God
                saith of persons in a natural condition, <hi rend="italic">There is none
                righteous, there is none that doeth good.</hi> It saith also, that
                <hi rend="italic">every imagination of the heart of man is only evil, and that
                continually.</hi> And again, <hi rend="italic">The imagination of man's heart is evil
                from his youth.</hi> Now then, when we think thus of ourselves,
                having sense thereof, then are our thoughts good ones, because
                according to the Word of God.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Ignor.</hi>  I will never believe that my heart is thus bad.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Therefore thou never hadst one good thought concerning
                thyself in thy life. But let me go on. As the Word passeth a
                judgment upon our heart, so it passeth a judgment upon our ways;
                and when OUR thoughts of our hearts and ways agree with the
                judgment which the Word giveth of both, then are both good,
                because agreeing thereto.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Ignor.</hi>  Make out your meaning.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Why, the Word of God saith that man's ways are crooked
                ways; not good, but perverse. It saith they are naturally out of
                the good way, that they have not known it. Now, when a man thus
                thinketh of his ways, -- I say, when he doth sensibly, and with
                heart-humiliation, thus think, then hath he good thoughts of his
                own ways, because his thoughts now agree with the judgment of
                the Word of God.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Ignor.</hi>  What are good thoughts concerning God?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Even as I have said concerning ourselves, when our thoughts
                of God do agree with what the Word saith of him; and that is,
                when we think of his being and attributes as the Word hath
                taught, of which I cannot now discourse at large; but to speak
                of him with reference to
                us: Then we have right thoughts of God, when we think that he
                knows us better than we know ourselves, and can see sin in us
                when and where we can see none in ourselves; when we think he
                knows our inmost thoughts, and that our heart, with all its
                depths, is always open unto his eyes; also, when we think that
                all our righteousness stinks in his nostrils, and that,
                therefore, he cannot abide to see us stand before him in any
                confidence, even in all our best performances.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Ignor.</hi>  Do you think that I am such a fool as to think God can
                see no further than I? or, that I would come to God in the best
                of my performances?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Why, how dost thou think in this matter?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Ignor.</hi>  Why, to be short, I think I must believe in Christ for
                justification.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> How! think thou must believe in Christ, when thou seest not
                thy need of him! Thou neither seest thy original nor actual
                infirmities; but hast such an opinion of thyself, and of what
                thou dost, as plainly renders thee to be one that did never see
                a necessity of Christ's personal righteousness to justify thee
                before God. How, then, dost thou say, I believe in Christ?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Ignor.</hi>  I believe well enough for all that.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> How dost thou believe?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Ignor.</hi>  I believe that Christ died for sinners, and that I shall
                be justified before God from the curse, through his gracious
                acceptance of my obedience to his law. Or thus, Christ makes my
                duties, that are religious, acceptable to his Father, by virtue
                of his merits; and so shall I be justified.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Let me give an answer to this confession of thy faith: --
                
                </p><p>1. Thou believest with a fantastical faith; for this faith is
                nowhere described in the Word.
                
                </p><p>2. Thou believest with a false faith; because it taketh
                justification from the personal righteousness of Christ, and
                applies it to thy own.
                
                </p><p>3. This faith maketh not Christ a justifier of thy person, but
                of thy actions; and of thy person for thy actions' sake, which
                is false.
                
                </p><p>4. Therefore, this faith is deceitful, even such as will leave
                thee under wrath, in the day of God Almighty; for true
                justifying faith puts the soul, as sensible of its condition by
                the law, upon flying for refuge unto Christ's righteousness,
                which righteousness of his is not an act of grace, by which he
                maketh for justification, thy obedience accepted with God; but
                his personal obedience to the law, in doing and suffering for us
                what that required at our hands; this righteousness, I say, true
                faith accepteth; under the skirt of which, the soul being
                shrouded, and by it presented as spotless before God, it is
                accepted, and acquit from condemnation.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Ignor.</hi>  What! would you have us trust to what Christ, in his own
                person, has done without us? This conceit would loosen the reins
                of our lust, and tolerate us to live as we list; for what matter
                how we live, if we may be justified by Christ's personal
                righteousness from all, when we believe it?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi>  <hi rend="italic">Ignorance</hi> is thy name, and as thy name is, so art thou;
                even this thy answer demonstrateth what I say. Ignorant thou art
                of what justifying righteousness is, and as ignorant how to
                secure thy soul, through the faith of it, from the heavy wrath
                of God. Yea, thou also art
                ignorant of the true effects of saving faith in this
                righteousness of Christ, which is, to bow and win over the heart
                to God in Christ, to love his name, his word, ways, and people,
                and not as thou ignorantly imaginest.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> Ask him if ever he had Christ revealed to him from heaven.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Ignor.</hi>  What! you are a man for revelations! I believe that what
                both you, and all the rest of you, say about that matter, is but

                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> Why, man! Christ is so hid in God from the natural

                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Ignor.</hi>  That is your faith, but not mine; yet mine, I doubt not,

                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Give me leave to put in a word. You ought not so slightly
                to speak of this matter; for this I will boldly affirm, even as
                my good companion hath done, that no man can know Jesus Christ
                but by the revelation of the Father; yea, and faith too, by
                which the soul layeth hold upon Christ, if it be right, must be
                wrought by the exceeding greatness of his mighty power; the
                working of which faith, I perceive, poor <hi rend="italic">Ignorance</hi>, thou art
                ignorant of. Be awakened, then, see thine own wretchedness, and
                fly to the Lord Jesus; and by his righteousness, which is the
                righteousness of God, for he himself is God, thou shalt be
                delivered from condemnation.

                <p>Then <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> addressed thus himself to his fellow: --
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Well, come, my good <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi>, I perceive that thou and I
                must walk by ourselves again.
                
                </p><p>So I saw in my dream that they went on apace before, and
                <hi rend="italic">Ignorance</hi> he came hobbling after. Then said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> to his
                companion, It pities me much for this poor man, it will
                certainly go ill with him at last.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> Alas! there are abundance in our town in his condition,
                whole families, yea, whole streets, and that of pilgrims too;
                and if there be so many in our parts, how many, think you, must
                there be in the place where he was born?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Indeed the Word saith, <hi rend="italic">He hath blinded their eyes lest they
                should see,</hi> &amp;c. But now we are by ourselves, what do you think
                of such men? Have they at no time, think you, convictions of
                sin, and so consequently fears that their state is dangerous?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> Nay, do you answer that question yourself, for you are the
                elder man.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Then I say, sometimes (as I think) they may; but they being
                naturally ignorant, understand not that such convictions tend to
                their good; and therefore they
                do desperately seek to stifle them, and presumptuously continue
                to flatter themselves in the way of their own hearts.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> I do believe, as you say, that fear tends much to men's
                good, and to make them right, at their beginning to go on
                pilgrimage.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Without all doubt it doth, if it be right; for so says the
                Word, <hi rend="italic">The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.</hi>
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> How will you describe right fear?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> True or right fear is discovered by three things: --
                
                </p><p>1. By its rise; it is caused by saving convictions for sin.
                
                </p><p>2. It driveth the soul to lay fast hold of Christ for salvation.
                
                </p><p>3. It begetteth and continueth in the soul a great reverence of
                God, his Word, and ways, keeping it tender, and making it afraid
                to turn from them, to the right hand or to the left, to anything
                that may dishonour God, break its peace, grieve the Spirit, or
                cause the enemy to speak reproachfully.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> Well said; I believe you have said the truth. Are we now
                almost got past the <hi rend="italic">Enchanted Ground</hi>?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Why, art thou weary of this discourse?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> No, verily, but that I would know where we are.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> We have not now above two miles further to go thereon. But
                let us return to our matter. Now the ignorant know not that such
                convictions as tend to put them in fear are for their good, and
                therefore they seek to stifle them.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> How do they seek to stifle them?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> 1. They think that those fears are wrought by the devil,
                (though indeed they are wrought of God;) and, thinking so, they
                resist them as things that directly tend to their overthrow. 2.
                They also think that these fears tend to the spoiling of their
                faith, when, alas, for them, poor men that they are, they have
                none at all! and therefore they harden their. hearts against
                them. 3. They presume they ought not to fear; and, therefore, in
                despite of them, wax presumptuously confident. 4. They see that
                those fears tend to take away from them their pitiful old
                self-holiness, and therefore they resist them with all their
                might.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> I know something of this myself; for, before I knew
                myself, it was so with me.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Well, we will leave, at this time, our neighbour <hi rend="italic">Ignorance</hi>
                by himself, and fall upon another profitable question.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> With all my heart, but you shall still begin.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Well then, did you not know, about ten years ago, one
                <hi rend="italic">Temporary</hi>  in your parts, who was a forward man in religion then?
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> Know him! yes, he dwelt in <hi rend="italic">Graceless</hi>, a town about two
                miles off of <hi rend="italic">Honesty</hi>, and he dwelt next door to one <hi rend="italic">Turnback</hi>.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> Right, he dwelt under the same roof with him. Well, that
                man was much awakened once; I believe that then he had some
                sight of his sins, and of the wages that were due thereto.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> I am of your mind, for, my house not being above three
                miles from him, he would ofttimes come to me, and that with many
                tears. Truly I pitied the man,
                and was not altogether without hope of him; but one may see, it
                is not every one that cries, Lord, Lord.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> He told me once that he was resolved to go on pilgrimage,
                as we do now; but all of a sudden he grew acquainted with one
                <hi rend="italic">Save-self</hi> , and then he became a stranger to me.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> Now, since we are talking about him, let us a little
                inquire into the reason of the sudden backsliding of him and
                such others.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> It may be very profitable, but do you begin.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> Well, then, there are in my judgment four reasons for it:
                --
                
                </p><p>1. Though the consciences of such men are awakened, yet their
                minds are not changed; therefore, when the power of guilt
                weareth away, that which provoked them to be religious ceaseth,
                wherefore they naturally turn to their own course again, even as
                we see the dog that is sick of what he has eaten, so long as his
                sickness prevails he vomits and casts up all; not that he doth
                this of a free mind (if we may say a dog has a mind), but
                because it troubleth his stomach; but now, when his sickness is
                over, and so his stomach eased, his desire being not at all
                alienate from his vomit, he turns him about and licks up all,
                and so it is true which is written, <hi rend="italic">The dog is turned to his own
                vomit again</hi>. Thus I say, being hot for heaven, by virtue only of
                the sense and fear of the torments of hell, as their sense of
                hell and the fears of damnation chills and cools, so their
                desires for heaven and salvation cool also. So then it comes to
                pass, that when their guilt and fear is gone, their desires for
                heaven and happiness die, and they return to their course again.
                
                </p><p>2. Another reason is, they have slavish fears that do overmaster
                them; I speak now of the fears that they have of men, for <hi rend="italic">the
                fear of man bringeth a snare.</hi> So then, though they seem to be
                hot for heaven, so long as the flames of hell are about their
                ears, yet when that terror is a little over, they betake
                themselves to second thoughts; namely, that it is good to be
                wise, and not to run (for they know not what) the hazard of
                losing all, or, at least, of bringing themselves into
                unavoidable and unnecessary troubles, and so they fall in with
                the world again.
                
                </p><p>3. The shame that attends religion lies also as a block in their
                way; they are proud and haughty; and religion in their eye is
                low and contemptible, therefore, when they have lost their sense
                of hell and wrath to come, they return again to their former
                course.
                
                </p><p>4. Guilt, and to meditate terror, are grievous to them. They
                like not to see their misery before they come into it; though
                perhaps the sight of it first, if they loved that sight, might
                make them fly whither the righteous fly and are safe. But
                because they do, as I hinted before, even shun the thoughts of
                guilt and terror, therefore, when once they are rid of their
                awakenings about the terrors and wrath of God, they harden their
                hearts gladly, and choose such ways as will harden them more and
                more.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> You are pretty near the business, for the bottom of all is
                for want of a change in their mind and will. And therefore they
                are but like the felon that standeth before the judge, he quakes
                and trembles, and seems to repent most heartily, but the bottom
                of all is the fear of the halter; not that he hath any
                detestation of the offence, as is evident, because, let but this
                man have his liberty, and
                he will be a thief, and so a rogue still, whereas, if his mind
                was changed, he would be otherwise.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Hope.</hi> Now I have shewed you the reasons of their going back, do
                you shew me the manner thereof.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Chr.</hi> So I will willingly.
                
                </p><p>1. They draw off their thoughts, all that they may, from the
                remembrance of God, death, and judgment to come.
                
                </p><p>2. Then they cast off by degrees private duties, as closet
                prayer, curbing their lusts, watching, sorrow for sin, and the
                like.
                
                </p><p>3. Then they shun the company of lively and warm <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>s.
                
                </p><p>4. After that they grow cold to public duty, as hearing,
                reading, godly conference, and the like.
                
                </p><p>5. Then they begin to pick holes, as we say, in the coats of
                some of the godly; and that devilishly, that they may have a
                seeming colour to throw religion (for the sake of some infirmity
                they have espied in them) behind their backs.
                
                </p><p>6. Then they begin to adhere to, and associate themselves with,
                carnal, loose, and wanton men.
                
                </p><p>7. Then they give way to carnal and wanton discourses in secret;
                and glad are they if they can see such things in any that are
                counted honest, that they may the more boldly do it through
                their example.
                
                </p><p>8. After this they begin to play with little sins openly.
                
                </p><p>9. And then, being hardened, they shew themselves as they are.
                Thus, being launched again into the gulf of misery, unless a
                miracle of grace prevent it, they everlastingly perish in their
                own deceivings.
                
                </p><p>Now I saw in my dream, that by this time the Pilgrims
                were got over the <hi rend="italic">Enchanted Ground</hi>, and entering into the
                country of <hi rend="italic">Beulah</hi>, whose air was very sweet and pleasant, the
                way lying directly through it, they solaced themselves there for
                a season. Yea, here they heard continually the singing of birds,
                and saw every day the flowers appear on the earth, and heard the
                voice of the turtle in the land. In this country the sun shineth
                night and day. wherefore this was beyond the Valley of the
                <hi rend="italic">Shadow of Death</hi>, and also out of the reach of Giant <hi rend="italic">Despair</hi>,
                neither could they from this place so much as see <hi rend="italic">Doubting</hi>
                Castle. Here they were within sight of the city they were going
                to, also here met them some of the inhabitants thereof; for in
                this land the Shining Ones commonly walked, because it was upon
                the borders of heaven. In this land also, the contract between
                the bride and the bridegroom was renewed; yea, here, <hi rend="italic">As the
                bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so did their God rejoice
                over them.</hi> Here they had no want of corn and wine; for in this
                place they met with abundance of what they had sought for in all
                their pilgrimage. Here they heard voices from out of the city,
                loud voices, saying, <hi rend="italic">Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy
                salvation cometh! Behold, his reward is with him!</hi> Here all the
                inhabitants of the country called them, <hi rend="italic">The holy people, The
                redeemed of the Lord, Sought out,</hi> &amp;c.
                
                </p><p>Now as they walked in this land, they had more rejoicing than in
                parts more remote from the kingdom to which they were bound; and
                drawing near to the city, they had yet a more perfect view
                thereof. It was builded of pearls and precious stones, also the
                street thereof was paved with gold; so that by reason of the
                natural glory of the city, and the reflection of the sunbeams
                upon it, <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>
                with desire fell sick; <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi> also had a fit or two
                of the same disease. Wherefore, here they lay by it a while,
                crying out, because of their pangs, <hi rend="italic">If ye find my beloved, tell
                him that I am sick of love.</hi>
                
                </p><p>But, being a little strengthened, and better able to bear their
                sickness, they walked on their way, and came yet nearer and
                nearer, where were orchards, vineyards, and gardens, and their
                gates opened into the highway. Now, as they came up to these
                places, behold the gardener stood in the way, to whom the
                Pilgrims said, Whose goodly vineyards and gardens are these? He
                answered, They are the King's, and are planted here for his own
                delight, and also for the solace of pilgrims. So the gardener
                had them into the vineyards, and bid them refresh themselves
                with the dainties. He also shewed them there the King's walks,
                and the arbours where he delighted to be; and here they tarried
                and slept.
                
                </p><p>Now I beheld in my dream that they talked more in their sleep at
                this time than ever they did in all their journey; and being in
                a muse thereabout, the gardener said even to me, Wherefore
                musest thou at the matter? It is the nature of the fruit of the
                grapes of these vineyards to go down so sweetly as to cause the
                lips of them that are asleep to speak.
                
                </p><p>So I saw that when they awoke, they addressed themselves to go
                up to the city; but, as I said, the reflection of the sun upon
                the city (for <hi rend="italic">the city was pure gold</hi>) was so extremely glorious
                that they could not, as yet, with open face behold it, but
                through an instrument made for that purpose. So I saw, that as
                I went on, there met them two men, in raiment that shone like
                gold; also their faces shone as the light.
                
                </p><p>These men asked the Pilgrims whence they came; and they told
                them. They also asked them where they had lodged, what
                difficulties and dangers, what comforts and pleasures they had
                met in the way; and they told them. Then said the men that met
                them, You have but two difficulties more to meet with, and then
                you are in the city.
                
                </p><p><hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> then, and his companion, asked the men to go along
                with them; so they told them they would. But, said they, you
                must obtain it by your own faith. So I saw in my dream that they
                went on together, until they came in sight of the gate.
                
                </p><p>Now, I further saw, that betwixt them and the gate was a river,
                but there was no bridge to go over: the river was very deep. At
                the sight, therefore, of this river, the Pilgrims were much
                stunned; but the men that went in with them said, You must go
                through, or you cannot come at the gate.
                
                </p><p>The Pilgrims then began to inquire if there was no other way to
                the gate; to which they answered, Yes; but there hath not any,
                save two, to wit, Enoch and Elijah, been permitted to tread that
                path since the foundation of the world, nor shall, until the
                last trumpet shall sound. The Pilgrims then, especially
                <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, began to despond in their minds, and looked this way
                and that, but no way could be found by them by which they might
                escape the river. Then they asked the men if the waters were all
                of a depth. They said: No; yet they could not help them in that
                case; for, said they, you shall find it deeper or shallower as
                you believe in the King of the place.
                
                </p><p>They then addressed themselves to the water and,
                entering, <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> began to sink, and crying out to his good
                friend <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi>, he said, I sink in deep waters; the billows go
                over my head, all his waves go over me! Selah.
                
                </p><p>Then said the other, Be of good cheer, my brother, I feel the
                bottom, and it is good. Then said <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, Ah! my friend, <hi rend="italic">the
                sorrows of death hath compassed me about</hi>; I shall not see the
                land that flows with milk and honey; and with that a great
                darkness and horror fell upon <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, so that he could not
                see before him. Also here he in great measure lost his senses,
                so that he could neither remember nor orderly talk of any of
                those sweet refreshments that he had met with in the way of his
                pilgrimage. But all the words that he spake still tended to
                discover that he had horror of mind, and heart fears that he
                should die in that river, and never obtain entrance in at the
                gate. Here also, as they that stood by perceived, he was much in
                the troublesome thoughts of the sins that he had committed, both
                since and before he began to be a pilgrim. It was also observed
                that he was troubled with apparitions of hobgoblins and evil
                spirits, for ever and anon he would intimate so much by words.
                <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi>, therefore, here had much ado to keep his brother's head
                above water; yea, sometimes he would be quite gone down, and
                then, ere a while, he would rise up again half dead. <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi>
                also would endeavour to comfort him, saying, Brother, I see the
                gate, and men standing by to receive us: but <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> would
                answer, It is you, it is you they wait for; you have been
                <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi> ever since I knew you. And so have you, said he to
                <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>. Ah! brother! said he, surely if I was right he would
                now arise to help me; but for my sins he hath brought me into
                the snare,
                and hath left me. Then said <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi>, My brother, you have quite
                forgot the text, where it is said of the wicked, <hi rend="italic">There are no
                bands in their death, but their strength is firm. They are not
                in trouble as other men</hi>, neither are they plagued like other
                men. These troubles and distresses that you go through in these
                waters are no sign that God hath forsaken you; but are sent to
                try you, whether you will call to mind that which heretofore you
                have received of his goodness, and live upon him in your
                distresses.
                
                </p><p>Then I saw in my dream, that <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> was as in a muse a while.
                To whom also <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi> added this word, Be of good cheer, Jesus
                Christ maketh thee whole; and with that <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> brake out with
                a loud voice, Oh, I see him again! and he tells me, <hi rend="italic">When thou
                passest through the waters, I will be with thee, and through the
                rivers, they shall not overflow thee</hi>. Then they both took
                courage, and the enemy was after that as still as a stone, until
                they were gone over. <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> therefore presently found ground
                to stand upon, and so it followed that the rest of the river was
                but shallow. Thus they got over. Now, upon the bank of the
                river, on the other side, they saw the two shining men again,
                who there waited for them; wherefore, being come out of the
                river, they saluted them, saying, We are ministering spirits,
                sent forth to minister for those that shall be heirs of
                salvation. Thus they went along towards the gate.</p>
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                <l rend="indent">Now, now look how the holy pilgrims ride,
                </l><l rend="indent">Clouds are their chariots, angels are their guide:
                </l><l rend="indent">Who would not here for him all hazards run,
                </l><l rend="indent">That thus provides for his when this world's done.</l>
                </lg>
                
                <p>Now you must note that the city stood upon a mighty hill, but
                the Pilgrims went up that hill with ease, because they had these
                two men to lead them up by the arms; also, they had left their
                mortal garments behind them in the river, for though they went
                in with them, they came out without them. They, therefore, went
                up here with much agility and speed, though the foundation upon
                which the city was framed was higher than the clouds. They
                therefore went up through the regions of the air, sweetly
                talking as they went, being comforted, because they safely got
                over the river, and had such glorious companions to attend them.
                
                </p><p>The talk they had with the Shining Ones was about the glory of
                the place; who told them that the beauty and glory of it was
                inexpressible. There, said they, is the <hi rend="italic">Mount Zion, the heavenly
                Jerusalem, the innumerable company of angels, and the spirits of
                just men made perfect.</hi> You are going now, said they, to the
                paradise of God, wherein you shall see the tree of life, and eat
                of the never-fading fruits thereof; and when you come there, you
                shall have white robes given you, and your walk and talk shall
                be every day with the King, even all the days of eternity. There
                you shall not see again such things as you saw when you were in
                the lower region upon the earth, to wit, sorrow, sickness,
                affliction, and death, <hi rend="italic">for the former things are passed away.</hi>
                You are now going to Abraham, to Isaac, and Jacob, and to the
                prophets -- men that God hath taken away from the evil to come,
                and that are now resting upon their beds, each one walking in
                his righteousness. The men then asked, What must we do in the
                holy place? To whom it was answered, You must there receive the
                comforts of all your toil, and have
                joy for all your sorrow; you must reap what you have sown, even
                the fruit of all your prayers, and tears, and sufferings for the
                King by the way. In that place you must wear crowns of gold, and
                enjoy the perpetual sight and vision of the Holy One, for <hi rend="italic">there
                you shall see him as he is</hi>. There also you shall serve him
                continually with praise, with shouting, and thanksgiving, whom
                you desired to serve in the world, though with much difficulty,
                because of the infirmity of your flesh. There your eyes shall be
                delighted with seeing, and your ears with hearing the pleasant
                voice of the Mighty One. There you shall enjoy your friends
                again that are gone thither before you; and there you shall with
                joy receive, even every one that follows into the holy place
                after you. There also shall you be clothed with glory and
                majesty, and put into an equipage fit to ride out with the King
                of Glory. When he shall come with sound of trumpet in the
                clouds, as upon the wings of the wind, you shall come with him;
                and when he shall sit upon the throne of judgment; you shall sit
                by him; yea, and when he shall pass sentence upon all the
                workers of iniquity, let them be angels or men, you also shall
                have a voice in that judgment, because they were his and your
                enemies. Also, when he shall again return to the city, you shall
                go too, with sound of trumpet, and be ever with him.
                
                </p><p>Now while they were thus drawing towards the gate, behold a
                company of the heavenly host came out to meet them; to whom it
                was said, by the other two Shining Ones, These are the men that
                have loved our Lord when they were in the world, and that have
                left all for his holy name; and he hath sent us to fetch them,
                and we have brought them thus far on their desired journey, that
                they
                may go in and look their Redeemer in the face with joy. Then the
                heavenly host gave a great shout, saying, <hi rend="italic">Blessed are they which
                are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb.</hi> There came out
                also at this time to meet them, several of the King's
                trumpeters, clothed in white and shining raiment, who, with
                melodious noises, and loud, made even the heavens to echo with
                their sound. These trumpeters saluted <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> and his fellow
                with ten thousand welcomes from the world; and this they did
                with shouting, and sound of trumpet.
                
                </p><p>This done, they compassed them round on every side; some went
                before, some behind, and some on the right hand, some on the
                left, (as it were to guard them through the upper regions,)
                continually sounding as they went, with melodious noise, in
                notes on high: so that the very sight was, to them that could
                behold it, as if heaven itself was come down to meet them. Thus,
                therefore, they walked on together; and as they walked, ever and
                anon these trumpeters, even with joyful sound, would, by mixing
                their music with looks and gestures, still signify to <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>
                and his brother, how welcome they were into their company, and
                with what gladness they came to meet them; and now were these
                two men, as it were, in heaven, before they came at it, being
                swallowed up with the sight of angels, and with hearing of their
                melodious notes. Here also they had the city itself in view, and
                they thought they heard all the bells therein to ring, to
                welcome them thereto. But above all, the warm and joyful
                thoughts that they had about their own dwelling there, with such
                company, and that for ever and ever. Oh, by what tongue or pen
                can their glorious joy be expressed! And thus they came up to
                the gate.
                
                </p><p>Now, when they were come up to the gate, there was written over
                it in letters of gold, <hi rend="italic">Blessed are they that do his
                commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and
                may enter in through the gates into the city.</hi>
                
                </p><p>Then I saw in my dream that the Shining Men bid them call at the
                gate; the which, when they did, some looked from above over the
                gate, to wit, Enoch, <hi rend="italic">Moses</hi>, and Elijah, &amp;c., to whom it was
                said, These pilgrims are come from the City of <hi rend="italic">Destruction</hi>, for
                the love that they bear to the King of this place; and then the
                Pilgrims gave in unto them each man his certificate, which they
                had received in the beginning; those, therefore, were carried in
                to the King, who, when he had read them, said, Where are the
                men? To whom it was answered, They are standing without the
                gate. The King then commanded to open the gate, <hi rend="italic">That the
                righteous nation,</hi> said he, <hi rend="italic">which keepeth the truth, may enter
                in.</hi>
                
                </p><p>Now I saw in my dream that these two men went in at the gate:
                and lo, as they entered, they were transfigured, and they had
                raiment put on that shone like gold. There was also that met
                them with harps and crowns, and gave them to them -- the harps
                to praise withal, and the crowns in token of honour. Then I
                heard in my dream that all the bells in the city rang again for
                joy, and that it was said unto them, <hi rend="italic">Enter ye into the joy of
                your Lord.</hi> I also heard the men themselves, that they sang with
                a loud voice, saying, <hi rend="italic">Blessing and honour, and glory, and power,
                be unto him that sitteth Upon the throne, and unto the Lamb, for
                ever and ever.</hi>
                
                </p><p>Now, just as the gates were opened to let in the men, I looked
                in after them, and, behold, the City shone like the sun; the
                streets also were paved with gold, and in
                them walked many men, with crowns on their heads, palms in their
                hands, and golden harps to sing praises withal.
                
                </p><p>There were also of them that had wings, and they answered one
                another without intermission, saying, <hi rend="italic">Holy, holy, holy, is the
                Lord.</hi> And after that they shut up the gates; which, when I had
                seen, I wished myself among them.
                
                </p><p>Now while I was gazing upon all these things, I turned my head
                to look back, and saw <hi rend="italic">Ignorance</hi> come up to the river side; but
                he soon got over, and that without half that difficulty which
                the other two men met with. For it happened that there was then
                in that place, one Vain-hope, a ferryman, that with his boat
                helped him over; so he, as the other I saw, did ascend the hill,
                to come up to the gate, only he came alone; neither did any man
                meet him with the least encouragement. When he was come up to
                the gate, he looked up to the writing that was above, and then
                began to knock, supposing that entrance should have been quickly
                administered to him; but he was asked by the men that looked
                over the top of the gate, Whence came you, and what would you
                have? He answered, I have eat and drank in the presence of the
                King, and he has taught in our streets. Then they asked him for
                his certificate, that they might go in and shew it to the King;
                so he fumbled in his bosom for one, and found none. Then said
                they, Have you none? But the man answered never a word. So they
                told the King, but he would not come down to see him, but
                commanded the two Shining Ones that conducted <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> and
                <hi rend="italic">Hopeful</hi> to the City, to go out and take <hi rend="italic">Ignorance</hi>, and bind him
                hand and foot, and have him away. Then they took him
                up, and carried him through the air to the door that I saw in
                the side of the hill, and put him in there. Then I saw that
                there was a way to hell, even from the gates of heaven, as well
                as from the City of <hi rend="italic">Destruction</hi>. So I awoke, and behold it was
                a dream.</p>
