         <head type="title">KUBLA KHAN </head>
         <head type="sub">Or, A Vision in a Dream. A Fragment.</head>
          <p>The following fragment is here published at the request
          of a poet of great and deserved celebrity, and,
          as far as the Author's own opinions are concerned, rather as
          a psychological curiosity, than on the ground of any supposed
          poetic merits.</p>
          
          <p>In the summer of the year 1797, the Author, then in ill
          health, had retired to a lonely farm-house between Porlock
          and Linton, on the Exmoor confines of Somerset and Devonshire.
          In consequence of a slight indisposition, an anodyne
          had been prescribed, from the effects of which he fell asleep
          in his chair at the moment that he was reading the following
          sentence, or words of the same substance, in 'Purchas's
          Pilgrimage': 'Here the Khan Kubla commanded a palace
          to be built, and a stately garden thereunto. And thus ten
          miles of fertile ground were inclosed with a wall.'[296:1] The
          Author continued for about three hours in a profound sleep,
          at least of the external senses, during which time he has the
          most vivid confidence, that he could not have composed less
          than from two to three hundred lines; if that indeed can
          be called composition in which all the images rose up before20
          him as things, with a parallel production of the correspondent
          expressions, without any sensation or consciousness of effort.
          On awaking he appeared to himself to have a distinct recollection
          of the whole, and taking his pen, ink, and paper, instantly
          and eagerly wrote down the lines that are here preserved. At
          this moment he was unfortunately called out by a person on
          business from Porlock, and detained by him above an hour,
          and on his return to his room, found, to his no small surprise
          and mortification, that though he still retained some vague
          and dim recollection of the general purport of the vision, yet,30
          with the exception of some eight or ten scattered lines and
          images, all the rest had passed away like the images on the
          surface of a stream into which a stone has been cast, but, alas!
          without the after restoration of the latter!</p>
          
          <div type="poem">
          <lg type="stanza">
              <l>Then all the charm</l>
              <l>Is broken—all that phantom-world so fair</l>
              <l>Vanishes, and a thousand circlets spread,</l>
              <l>And each mis-shape['s] the other. Stay awhile,</l>
              <l>Poor youth! who scarcely dar'st lift up thine eyes—</l>
              <l>The stream will soon renew its smoothness, soon40</l>
              <l>The visions will return! And lo, he stays,</l>
              <l>And soon the fragments dim of lovely forms</l>
              <l>Come trembling back, unite, and now once more</l>
              <l>The pool becomes a mirror.</l></lg></div>
          
          <p>Yet from the still surviving recollections in his mind, the
          Author has frequently purposed to finish for himself what had
          [297]been originally, as it were, given to him. Σαμερον αδιον ασω[297:1]
          [Αὔριον ἅδιον ἄσω 1834]: but the to-morrow is yet to come.</p>
          
          <p>As a contrast to this vision, I have annexed a fragment of a
          very different character, describing with equal fidelity the50
          dream of pain and disease.[297:2]</p>
          
          <head>KUBLA KHAN</head>
          <div type="poem">
          <lg><l>In Xanadu did Kubla Khan</l>
              <l>A stately pleasure-dome decree:</l>
              <l>Where Alph, the sacred river, ran</l>
              <l>Through caverns measureless to man</l>
              <l>Down to a sunless sea.</l>
              <l>So twice five miles of fertile ground</l>
              <l>With walls and towers were girdled round:</l>
              <l>And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,</l>
              <l>Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;</l>
              <l> And here were forests ancient as the hills,10</l>
              <l>Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.</l>
              <l>But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted</l>
              <l>Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!</l>
              <l>A savage place! as holy and enchanted</l>
              <l>As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted15</l>
              <l>By woman wailing for her demon-lover![297:3]</l>
              <l> [297:4]And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,</l>
              <l>As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,</l>
              <l>A mighty fountain momently was forced:</l>
              <l>Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst20</l>
              <l>Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,</l>
              <l>Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail:</l>
              <l>And 'mid these dancing rocks at once and ever</l>
              <l> It flung up momently the sacred river.</l>
              <l>Five miles meandering with a mazy motion25[298]</l>
              <l>Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,</l>
              <l>Then reached the caverns measureless to man</l>
              <l>And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:</l>
              <l>And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from far</l>
              <l>Ancestral voices prophesying war!30</l>
              <l>The shadow of the dome of pleasure</l>
              <l>Floated midway on the waves;</l>
              <l>Where was heard the mingled measure</l>
              <l>From the fountain and the caves.</l>
              <l>It was a miracle of rare device,35</l>
              <l>A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice![298:1]</l>
              <l>A damsel with a dulcimer</l>
              <l>In a vision once I saw:</l>
              <l>It was an Abyssinian maid,</l>
              <l>And on her dulcimer she played,40</l>
              <l>Singing of Mount Abora.</l>
              <l>Could I revive within me</l>
              <l>Her symphony and song,</l>
              <l>To such a deep delight 'twould win me,</l>
              <l>That with music loud and long,45</l>
              <l>I would build that dome in air,</l>
              <l>That sunny dome! those caves of ice![298:2]</l>
              <l>And all who heard should see them there,</l>
              <l>And all should cry, Beware! Beware!</l>
              <l> His flashing eyes, his floating hair!50</l>
              <l> Weave a circle round him thrice,</l>
              <l> And close your eyes with holy dread,</l>
              <l>For he on honey-dew hath fed,</l>
              <l>And drunk the milk of Paradise.</l>
