    <l>Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?</l></lg>

    <lg type="stanza">
        <l>"The Bridegroom's doors are opened wide,</l>

        <lg type="stanza">
            <l>He holds him with his skinny hand,</l>

                <l>And listens like a three years child:</l>
                <l>The Mariner hath his will.</l></lg>
