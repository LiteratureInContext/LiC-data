                     <note>Coleridge revised this poem several times, so there are a number of different versions, each of which is interesting in its own way, so it is a matter of editorial choice as to which version to reproduce in a particular edition. Here, we have chosen to reproduce the first version of the poem, printed in the first London edition of <hi rend="italic">Lyrical Ballads</hi>, the ground-breaking collection of poetry that Coleridge and William Wordsworth produced in 1798. This version preserves some of the archaic spellings (such as "ancyent") that Coleridge toned down in later versions. Our page images have been sourced from Google Books.</note>
