At this time, Naples was ruled by Spain, which explains why so many characters in the play have been traveling back and forth between Naples and places like Madrid and Pamplona.

More generally, however, it was true that during the 1650s, the time during which the action of the play takes place, many English cavaliers were hiring themselves out as mercenary soldiers to armies in contintental Europe, including Spain, so placing military action at Pamplona is quite plausible.

which made the Book-sellers fear some trouble from the Proprietor of that Admirable
Play, which indeed has Wit enough to stock a Poet, and is not to be peec't or mended
by any but the Excellent Author himself; That I have stoln some hints from it,
may be a proof, that I valu'd it more than to pretend to alter it; had I had the
Dexterity of some Poets, who are not more Expert in stealing than in the Art of
Concealing, and who even that way out-do the <hi>Spartan</hi>-Boyes. I might have appropriated
all to my self, but I, vainly proud of my Iudgment, hang out the Sign
of <hi>Angellica,</hi> (the only stoln Object) to give Notice where a great part of the Wit
dwelt; tho if the Play of the <hi>Novella</hi> were as well worth remembring as <hi>Thomaso,</hi>
they might (bating the Name) have as well said, I took it from thence: I will
only say the Plot and Bus'ness (not to boast on't) is my own: as for the Words
and Characters, I leave the Reader to judge and compare 'em with <hi>Thomaso,</hi> to
whom I recommend the great Entertainment of reading it, tho had this succeeded ill,
I shou'd have had no need of imploring that Justice from the Criticks, who are naturally
so kind to any that pretend to usurp their Dominion, they wou'd doubtless
have given me the whole Honour on't. Therefore I will only say in <hi>English</hi> what
