                <head> Ode to a Nightingale</head>
                <l n="1">My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains</l>
                <l n="2">My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,</l>
                <l n="3">Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains</l>
                <l n="4">One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk</l>
                <l n="5">'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,</l>
                <l n="6">But being too happy in thine happiness, â€”</l>
                <l n="7">That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees,</l>
                <l n="8">In some melodious plot</l>
                <l n="9">Of beechen green, and shadows numberless,</l>
                <l n="10">Singest of summer in full-throated ease.</l>
                <l n="11">O, for a draught of vintage! that hath been</l>
                <l n="12">Cool'd a long age in the deep-delved earth,</l>
                <l n="13">Tasting of Flora and the country green,</l>
                <l n="14">Dance, and Provencal song, and sunburnt mirth!</l>
                <l n="15">O for a beaker full of the warm south,</l>
                <l n="16">Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene,</l>
                <l n="17">With beaded bubbles winking at the brim,</l>
                <l n="18">And purple-stained mouth;</l>
                <l n="19">That I might drink, and leave the world unseen,</l>
                <l n="20">And with thee fade away into the forest dim</l>
                <l n="21">Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget</l>
                <l n="22">The weariness, the fever, and the fret</l>
                <l n="23">Here, where men sit and hear each other groan;</l>
                <l n="24">Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs,</l>
                <l n="25">Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies;</l>
                <l n="26">Where but to think is to be full of sorrow</l>
                <l n="27">And leaden-eyed despairs,</l>
                <l n="28">Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes,</l>
                <l n="29">Or new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow.</l>
                <l n="30">Away! away! for I will fly to thee,</l>
                <l n="31">Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards,</l>
                <l n="32">But on the viewless wings of Poesy,</l>
                <l n="33">Though the dull brain perplexes and retards</l>
                <l n="34">Already with thee! tender is the night,</l>
                <l n="35">And haply the Queen-Moon- is on her throne,</l>
                <l n="36">Cluster'd around by all her starry Fays;</l>
                <l n="37">But here there is no light,</l>
                <l n="38">Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown</l>
                <l n="39">Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways.</l>
                <l n="40">I cannot see what flowers are at my feet,</l>
                <l n="50">Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs,</l>
                <l n="51">But, in embalmed darkness, guess each sweet</l>
                <l n="52">Wherewith the seasonable month endows</l>
                <l n="53">The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild;</l>
                <l n="54">White hawthorn, and the pastoral eglantine;</l>
                <l n="55">Fast fading violets cover'd up in leaves;</l>
                <l n="56">And mid-May's eldest child,</l>
                <l n="57">The coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine,</l>
                <l n="58">The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves.</l>
                <l n="59">Darkling I listen; and, for many a time</l>
                <l n="60">I have been half in love with easeful Death,</l>
                <l n="61">Call'd him soft names in many a mused rhyme,</l>
                <l n="62">To take into the air my quiet breath;</l>
                <l n="63">Now more than ever seems it rich to die,</l>
                <l n="64">To cease upon the midnight with no pain,</l>
                <l n="65">While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad</l>
                <l n="66">In such an ecstasy!</l>
                <l n="67">Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain â€”</l>
                <l n="68">To thy high requiem become a sod.</l>
                <l n="69">Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!</l>
                <l n="70">No hungry generations tread thee down;</l>
                <l n="71">The voice I hear this passing night was heard</l>
                <l n="72">In ancient days by emperor and clown</l>
                <l n="73">Perhaps the self-same song that found a path</l>
                <l n="74">She stood in tears amid the alien corn;</l>
                <l n="75">The same that oft-times hath</l>
                <l n="76">Charm'd magic casements, opening on the foam</l>
                <l n="77">Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.</l>
                <l n="78">Forlorn! the very word is like a bell</l>
                <l n="79">To toll me back from thee to my sole self!</l>
                <l n="80">Adieu! the fancy cannot cheat so well</l>
                <l n="81">As she is fam'd to do, deceiving elf.</l>
                <l n="82">Adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades</l>
                <l n="83">Past the near meadows, over the still stream,</l>
                <l n="84">Up the hill-side; and now 'tis buried deep</l>
                <l n="85">In the next valley-glades</l>
                <l n="86">Was it a vision, or a waking dream?</l>
