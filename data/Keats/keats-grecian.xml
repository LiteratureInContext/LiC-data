    <head> Ode on a Grecian Urn</head>
    <l>Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness,</l>
    <l>Thou foster-child of silence and slow time,</l>
    <l>Sylvan historian, who canst thus express</l>
    <l>A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme</l>
    <l>What leaf-fring'd legend haunts about thy shape</l>
    <l>Of deities or mortals, or of both,</l>
    <l>In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?</l>
    <l>What men or gods are these? What maidens loth?</l>
    <l>What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?</l>
    <l>What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?</l>
    <l>Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard</l>
    <l>Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;</l>
    <l>Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd,</l>
    <l>Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone</l>
    <l>Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave</l>
    <l>Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare;</l>
    <l>Bold lover, never, never canst thou kiss,</l>
    <l>Though winning near the goal — yet, do not grieve;</l>
    <l>She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,</l>
    <l>For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!</l>
    <milestone unit="page" n="373"/>
    <l>Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed</l>
    <l>Your leaves, nor ever bid the spring adieu;</l>
    <l>And, happy melodist, unwearied,</l>
    <l>For ever piping songs for ever new;</l>
    <l>More happy love! more happy, happy love!</l>
    <l>For ever warm and still to be enjoy'd,</l>
    <l>For ever panting, and for ever young;</l>
    <l>All breathing human passion far above,</l>
    <l>A burning forehead, and a parching tongue.</l>
    <l>Who are these coming to the sacrifice?</l>
    <l>To what green altar, O mysterious priest,</l>
    <l>Lead'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,</l>
    <l>And all her silken flanks with garlands drest?</l>
    <l>What little town by river or sea shore,</l>
    <l>Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,</l>
    <l>Is emptied of this folk, this pious morn?</l>
    <l>And, little town, thy streets for evermore</l>
    <l>Will silent be; and not a soul to tell</l>
    <l>Why thou art desolate, can e'er return.</l>
    <l>O Attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede</l>
    <l>Of marble men and maidens overwrought,</l>
    <l>With forest branches and the trodden weed;</l>
    <l>Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought</l>
    <l>As doth eternity Cold Pastoral!</l>
    <l>When old age shall this generation waste,</l>
    <l>Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe</l>
    <l>Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say'st,</l>
    <l>Beauty is truth, truth beauty, — that is all</l>
    <l>Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.</l>
