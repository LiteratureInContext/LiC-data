                     <note>"Ode on a Grecian Urn" was composed in 1819 and first published anonymously in the journal <hi rend="italic">Annals of the Fine Arts</hi> that year. It was then published in 1820 in an edition of Keats's poems entitled <hi rend="italic">Lamia, Isabella, The Eve of St, Agnes and other Poems</hi>issued by the London publisher Taylor and Cressey. Our edition follows the version in the 1820 volume, which differs slightly from the version published the year before (see especially the note to line 47).

In the version of "Ode on a Grecian Urn" that was published <hi rend="italic">Lamia, Isabella, The Eve of St. Agnes and other Poems</hi>, which is the version that we include in our anthology, Keats puts the phrase "Beauty is truth, truth beauty" in quotation marks, which makes it seem as though the speaker of the line might be the urn itself. But in the version that he published in the journal <graphic url="https://lic-assets-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/keats-grecian/pageImages/annals.png"/><hi rend="italic">Annals of the Fine Arts</hi> in 1819 (depicted here), Keats did not, which makes it seem as if the speaker is the voice of the poet himself. Neither version is better or more authentic than the other; Keats never explained the why he added the quotation marks in 1820. But how we think about the poem can be quite different depending on which version of this closing couplet we are reading.</note>--that is all</l>
