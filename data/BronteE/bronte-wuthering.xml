            users should note that a great many spelling, typographical and punctuation emendations
            have been introduced by the Oxford editor, Ian Jack. This is especially true in the
            passages where Bronte has attempted to reproduce the Yorkshire dialect. Note also that,
            while this edition is broken into two volumes of chapters 1-14 and 1-20, earlier

               <p>1801. ---I have just returned from a visit to my landlord--- the solitary
                  neighbour that I shall be troubled with. This is certainly a beautiful country! In
                  all England, I do not believe that I could have fixed on a situation so completely
                  removed from the stir of society. A perfect misanthropist's heaven; and Mr.
                  Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us. A
                  capital fellow! He little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld
                  his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows, as I rode up, and when
                  his fingers sheltered themselves, with a jealous resolution, still further in his
                  waistcoat, as I announced my name. </p>
               <p>"Mr. Heathcliff?" I said. </p>
               <p>A nod was the answer. </p>
               <p>"Mr. Lockwood, your new tenant, sir. I do myself the honour of calling as soon as
                  possible after my arrival, to express the hope that I have not inconvenienced you
                  by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of Thrushcross Grange. I heard
                  yesterday you had had some thoughts -- " </p>
               <p>"Thrushcross Grange is my own, sir," he interrupted, wincing. "I should not allow
                  any one to inconvenience me, if I could hinder it. Walk in!" </p>
               <p>The "walk in" was uttered with closed teeth, and expressed the sentiment, "Go to
                  the deuce." Even the gate <pb n="2"/> over which he leant manifested no
                  sympathizing movement to the words; and I think that circumstance determined me to
                  accept the invitation. I felt interested in a man who seemed more exaggeratedly
                  reserved than myself. </p>
               <p>When he saw my horse's breast fairly pushing the barrier, he did put out his hand
                  to unchain it, and then sullenly preceded me up the causeway, calling, as we
                  entered the court, "Joseph, take Mr. Lockwood's horse, and bring up some wine." </p>
               <p>"Here we have the whole establishment of domestics, I suppose," was the reflection
                  suggested by this compound order. "No wonder the grass grows up between the flags,
                  and cattle are the only hedge-cutters." </p>
               <p>Joseph was an elderly, nay, an old man -- very old, perhaps, though hale and
                  sinewy. "The Lord help us!" he soliloquized in an undertone of peevish
                  displeasure, while relieving me of my horse, looking, meantime, in my face so
                  sourly that I charitably conjectured he must have need of divine aid to digest his
                  dinner, and his pious ejaculation had no reference to my unexpected advent. </p>
               <p>Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr. Heathcliff's dwelling, "wuthering" being a
                  significant provincial adjective, descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which
                  its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure, bracing ventilation they must have
                  up there at all times, indeed. One may guess the power of the north wind blowing
                  over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the
                  house, and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as if
                  craving alms of the sun. Happily the architect had foresight to build it strong.
                  The narrow windows are deeply set in the wall, and the corners defended with large
                  jutting stones. </p>
               <p>Before passing the threshold, I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving
                  lavished over the front, and especially about the principal door; above which,
                  among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys, I detected the
                  date "1500," and the name "Hareton Earnshaw." I would have made a few comments,
                  and requested a short history of the place from <pb n="3"/>the surly owner; but
                  his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance or complete
                  departure, and I had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting
                  the penetralium. </p>
               <p>One step brought us into the family sitting-room, without any introductory lobby
                  or passage. They call it here "the house" pre-eminently. It includes kitchen and
                  parlour generally. But, I believe, at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to
                  retreat altogether into another quarter -- at least I distinguished a chatter of
                  tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within; and I observed no signs of
                  roasting, boiling, or baking about the huge fireplace, nor any glitter of copper
                  saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end, indeed, reflected splendidly
                  both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes, interspersed with silver
                  jugs and tankards, towering row after row, on a vast oak dresser, to the very
                  roof. The latter had never been underdrawn; its entire anatomy lay bare to an
                  inquiring eye, except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of
                  legs of beef, mutton, and ham concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry
                  villainous old guns and a couple of horse-pistols, and, by way of ornament, three
                  gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth, white
                  stone; the chairs, high-backed, primitive structures painted green, one or two
                  heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge
                  liver-coloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies, and other
                  dogs haunted other recesses. </p>
               <p>The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to
                  a homely, northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out
                  to advantage in knee-breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his
                  armchair, his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him, is to be seen in
                  any circuit of five or six miles among these hills, if you go at the right time
                  after dinner. But Mr. Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style
                  of living. He is a dark-skinned gipsy in aspect. in dress and manners a gentleman
                  -- that is, as much a gentleman as many a country squire; rather slovenly, <pb
                     n="4"/>perhaps, yet not looking amiss with his negligence, because he has an
                  erect and handsome figure, and rather morose. Possibly, some people might suspect
                  him of a degree of underbred pride; I have a sympathetic chord within that tells
                  me it is nothing of the sort. I know, by instinct, his reserve springs from an
                  aversion to showy displays of feeling, to manifestations of mutual kindliness.
                  He'll love and hate equally under cover, and esteem it a species of impertinence
                  to be loved or hated again. No, I'm running on too fast. I bestow my own
                  attributes over liberally on him. Mr. Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar
                  reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a would-be acquaintance
                  to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar. My dear
                  mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home, and only last summer I
                  proved myself perfectly unworthy of one. </p>
               <p>While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea coast, I was thrown into the
                  company of a most fascinating creature -- a real goddess in my eyes, as long as
                  she took no notice of me. I "never told my love" vocally; still, if looks have
                  language, the merest idiot might have guessed I was over head and ears. She
                  understood me at last, and looked a return -- the sweetest of all imaginable
                  looks. And what did I do? I confess it with shame -- shrank icily into myself,
                  like a snail; at every glance retired colder and farther, till finally the poor
                  innocent was led to doubt her own senses, and, overwhelmed with confusion at her
                  supposed mistake, persuaded her mamma to decamp. By this curious turn of
                  disposition I have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness; how
                  undeserved I alone can appreciate. </p>
               <p>I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my
                  landlord advanced, and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress
                  the canine mother, who had left her nursery, and was sneaking wolfishly to the
                  back of my legs, her lip curled up, and her white teeth watering for a snatch. My
                  caress provoked a long, guttural gnarl. </p>
               <p>"You'd better let the dog alone," growled Mr. Heathcliff, in unison, checking
                  fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot. <pb n="5"/>"She's not accustomed
                  to be spoiled -- not kept for a pet." Then, striding to a side door, he shouted
                  again, "Joseph!" </p>
               <p>Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar, but gave no intimation of
                  ascending; so his master dived down to him, leaving me vis-a-vis the ruffianly
                  bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheep-dogs, who shared with her a jealous
                  guardianship over all my movements. Not anxious to come in contact with their
                  fangs, I sat still; but, imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults, I
                  unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio, and some turn of
                  my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on
                  my knees. I flung her back, and hastened to interpose the table between us. This
                  proceeding roused the whole hive. Half a dozen four-footed fiends, of various
                  sizes and ages, issued from hidden dens to the common centre. I felt my heels and
                  coat-laps peculiar subjects of assault; and parrying off the larger combatants as
                  effectually as I could with the poker, I was constrained to demand, aloud,
                  assistance from some of the household in re-establishing peace. </p>
               <p>Mr. Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm. I don't
                  think they moved one second faster than usual, though the hearth was an absolute
                  tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily, an inhabitant of the kitchen made more
                  dispatch. A lusty dame, with tucked-up gown, bare arms, and fire-flushed cheeks,
                  rushed into the midst of us flourishing a frying-pan, and used that weapon and her
                  tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically, and she only remained,
                  heaving like a sea after a high wind, when her master entered on the scene. </p>
               <p>"What the devil is the matter?" he asked, eyeing me in a manner that I could ill
                  endure after this inhospitable treatment. </p>
               <p>"What the devil, indeed!" I muttered. "The herd of possessed swine could have had
                  no worse spirits in them than those animals of yours, sir. You might as well leave
                  a stranger with a brood of tigers!" </p>
               <p>"They won't meddle with persons who touch nothing," he <pb n="6"/>remarked,
                  putting the bottle before me, and restoring the displaced table. "The dogs do
                  right to be vigilant. Take a glass of wine." </p>
               <p>"No, thank you." </p>
               <p>"Not bitten, are you?" </p>
               <p>"If I had been, I would have set my signet on the biter." </p>
               <p>Heathcliff's countenance relaxed into a grin. </p>
               <p>"Come, come," he said; "you are flurried, Mr. Lockwood. Here, take a little wine.
                  Guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that I and my dogs, I am willing to
                  own, hardly know how to receive them. Your health, sir!" </p>
               <p>I bowed and returned the pledge, beginning to perceive that it would be foolish to
                  sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs; besides, I felt loath to yield
                  the fellow further amusement at my expense, since his humour took that turn. </p>
               <p>He -- probably swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good
                  tenant -- relaxed a little in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and
                  auxiliary verbs, and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to
                  me -- a discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of
                  retirement. </p>
               <p>I found him very intelligent on the topics we touched; and before I went home I
                  was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit to-morrow. </p>
               <p>He evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion. I shall go, notwithstanding. It
                  is astonishing how sociable I feel myself, compared with him.</p>

               <pb n="7"/>
               <p>Yesterday afternoon set in misty and cold. I had half a mind to spend it by my
                  study fire, instead of wading through heath and mud to Wuthering Heights. </p>
               <p>On coming up from dinner, however, (N.B. I dine between twelve and one o'clock;
                  the housekeeper, a matronly lady taken as a fixture along with the house, could
                  not, or would not comprehend my request that I might be served at five), -- on
                  mounting the stairs with this lazy intention, and stepping into the room, I saw a
                  servant-girl on her knees, surrounded by brushes and coal-scuttles, and raising an
                  infernal dust as she extinguished the flames with heaps of cinders. This spectacle
                  drove me back immediately; I took my hat, and, after a four miles walk, arrived at
                  Heathcliff's garden gate just in time to escape the first feathery flakes of a
                  snow shower.</p>
               <p>On that bleak hill top the earth was hard with a black frost, and the air made me
                  shiver through every limb. Being unable to remove the chain, I jumped over, and,
                  running up the flagged causeway bordered with straggling gooseberry bushes,
                  knocked vainly for admittance, till my knuckles tingled and the dogs howled.</p>
               <p> "Wretched inmates!" I ejaculated, mentally, "you deserve perpetual isolation from
                  your species for your churlish inhospitality. At least, I would not keep my doors
                  barred in the day time -- I don't care -- I will get in !"</p>
               <p>So resolved, I grasped the latch, and shook it vehemently. Vinegar-faced Joseph
                  projected his head from a round window of the barn.</p>
               <p>"What are ye for?" he shouted. "T' maister's down i' t' fowld. Go round by th' end
                  ut' laith, if ye went to spake to him." </p>
               <p>"Is there nobody inside to open the door?" I hallooed responsively. </p>
               <pb n="8"/>
               <p>"There's nobbut t' missis, and shoo'll not oppen't an ye mak yer flaysome dins
                  till neeght." </p>
               <p>"Why? Cannot you tell her who I am, eh, Joseph?" </p>
               <p>"Nor-ne me! I'll hae noa hend wi't," muttered the head, vanishing. </p>
               <p>The snow began to drive thickly. I seized the handle to essay another trial, when
                  a young man without coat, and shouldering a pitchfork, appeared in the yard
                  behind. He hailed me to follow him; and, after marching through a wash-house, and
                  a paved area containing a coal-shed, pump, and pigeon-cot, we at length arrived in
                  the huge, warm, cheerful apartment where I was formerly received. It glowed
                  delightfully in the radiance of an immense fire, compounded of coal, peat, and
                  wood; and near the table, laid for a plentiful evening meal, I was pleased to
                  observe the "missis," an individual whose existence I had never previously
                  suspected. I bowed and waited, thinking she would bid me take a seat. She looked
                  at me, leaning back in her chair, and remained motionless and mute. </p>
               <p>"Rough weather!" I remarked. "I'm afraid, Mrs. Heathcliff, the door must bear the
                  consequence of your servants' leisure attendance. I had hard work to make them
                  hear me." </p>
               <p>She never opened her mouth. I stared -- she stared also. At any rate, she kept her
                  eyes on me in a cool, regardless manner, exceedingly embarrassing and
                  disagreeable. </p>
               <p>"Sit down," said the young man gruffly. "He'll be in soon." </p>
               <p>I obeyed, and hemmed, and called the villain Juno, who deigned, at this second
                  interview, to move the extreme tip of her tail, in token of owning my
                  acquaintance. </p>
               <p>"A beautiful animal!" I commenced again. "Do you intend parting with the little
                  ones, madam?"</p>
               <p/>
               <p>"They are not mine," said the amiable hostess, more repellingly than Heathcliff
                  himself could have replied. </p>
               <p>"Ah, your favourites are among these?" I continued, turning to an obscure cushion
                  full of something like cats. </p>
               <p>"A strange choice of favourites!" she observed scornfully. </p>
               <pb n="9"/>
               <p>Unluckily it was a heap of dead rabbits. I hemmed once more, and drew closer to
                  the hearth, repeating my comment on the wildness of the evening. </p>
               <p>"You should not have come out," she said, rising and reaching from the
                  chimney-piece two of the painted canisters. </p>
               <p>Her position before was sheltered from the light; now, I had a distinct view of
                  her whole figure and countenance. She was slender, and apparently scarcely past
                  girlhood; an admirable form, and the most exquisite little face that I have ever
                  had the pleasure of beholding; small features, very fair; flaxen ringlets, or
                  rather golden, hanging loose on her delicate neck; and eyes, had they been
                  agreeable in expression, that would have been irresistible. Fortunately for my
                  susceptible heart, the only sentiment they evinced hovered between scorn and a
                  kind of desperation, singularly unnatural to be detected there. The canisters were
                  almost out of her reach. I made a motion to aid her. She turned upon me as a miser
                  might turn if any one attempted to assist him in counting his gold. </p>
               <p>"I don't want your help," she snapped. "I can get them for myself." </p>
               <p>"I beg your pardon," I hastened to reply. </p>
               <p>"Were you asked to tea?" she demanded, tying an apron over her neat black frock,
                  and standing with a spoonful of the leaf poised over the pot. </p>
               <p>"I shall be glad to have a cup," I answered. </p>
               <p>"Were you asked?" she repeated. </p>
               <p> "No," I said, half smiling. "You are the proper person to ask me." </p>
               <p>She flung the tea back, spoon and all, and resumed her chair in a pet. Her
                  forehead corrugated, and her red under-lip pushed out, like a child's ready to
                  cry. </p>
               <p>Meanwhile, the young man had slung on to his person a decidedly shabby upper
                  garment, and, erecting himself before the blaze, looked down on me from the corner
                  of his eyes, for all the world as if there were some mortal feud unavenged between
                  us. I began to doubt whether he were a servant or not. <pb n="10"/>His dress and
                  speech were both rude, entirely devoid of the superiority observable in Mr. and
                  Mrs. Heathcliff. His thick brown curls were rough and uncultivated, his whiskers
                  encroached bearishly over his cheeks, and his hands were embrowned like those of a
                  common labourer. Still his bearing was free, almost haughty, and he showed none of
                  a domestic's assiduity in attending on the lady of the house. In the absence of
                  clear proofs of his condition, I deemed it best to abstain from noticing his
                  curious conduct; and, five minutes afterwards, the entrance of Heathcliff relieved
                  me, in some measure, from my uncomfortable state. </p>
               <p>"You see, sir, I am come, according to promise," I exclaimed, assuming the
                  cheerful; "and I fear I shall be weather-bound for half an hour, if you can afford
                  me shelter during that space." </p>
               <p>"Half an hour?" he said, shaking the white flakes from his clothes. "I wonder you
                  should select the thick of a snowstorm to ramble about in. Do you know that you
                  run a risk of being lost in the marshes? People familiar with these moors often
                  miss their road on such evenings; and I can tell you there is no chance of a
                  change at present." </p>
               <p>"Perhaps I can get a guide among your lads, and he might stay at the Grange till
                  morning. Could you spare me one?" </p>
               <p>"No, I could not." </p>
               <p>"Oh, indeed! Well, then, I must trust to my own sagacity." </p>
               <p>"Umph!" </p>
               <p>"Are you going to mak th' tea?" demanded he of the shabby coat, shifting his
                  ferocious gaze from me to the young lady. </p>
               <p>"Is he to have any?" she asked, appealing to Heathcliff. </p>
               <p>"Get it ready, will you?" was the answer, uttered so savagely that I started. The
                  tone in which the words were said revealed a genuine bad nature. I no longer felt
                  inclined to call Heathcliff a capital fellow. When the preparations were finished,
                  he invited me with -- "Now, sir, bring forward your chair." And we all, including
                  the rustic youth, drew round the table, an austere silence prevailing while we
                  discussed our meal. </p>
               <pb n="11"/>
               <p>I thought, if I had caused the cloud, it was my duty to make an effort to dispel
                  it. They could not every day sit so grim and taciturn; and it was impossible,
                  however ill-tempered they might be, that the universal scowl they wore was their
                  everyday countenance. </p>
               <p>"It is strange," I began, in the interval of swallowing one cup of tea and
                  receiving another -- "it is strange how custom can mould our tastes and ideas.
                  Many could not imagine the existence of happiness in a life of such complete exile
                  from the world as you spend, Mr. Heathcliff; yet, I'll venture to say, that
                  surrounded by your family, and with your amiable lady as the presiding genius over
                  your home and heart -- " </p>
               <p>"My amiable lady!" he interrupted, with an almost diabolical sneer on his face.
                  "Where is she -- my amiable lady?" </p>
               <p>"Mrs. Heathcliff, your wife, I mean." </p>
               <p>"Well, yes -- Oh! you would intimate that her spirit has taken the post of
                  ministering angel, and guards the fortunes of Wuthering Heights, even when her
                  body is gone. Is that it?" </p>
               <p>Perceiving myself in a blunder, I attempted to correct it. I might have seen there
                  was too great a disparity between the ages of the parties to make it likely that
                  they were man and wife. One was about forty, a period of mental vigour at which
                  men seldom cherish the delusion of being married for love, by girls: that dream is
                  reserved for the solace of our declining years. The other did not look seventeen. </p>
               <p>Then it flashed upon me -- "The clown at my elbow, who is drinking his tea out of
                  a basin and eating his bread with unwashed hands, may be her husband. Heathcliff,
                  junior, of course. Here is the consequence of being buried alive: she has thrown
                  herself away upon that boor, from sheer ignorance that better individuals existed!
                  A sad pity -- I must beware how I cause her to regret her choice." </p>
               <p>The last reflection may seem conceited; it was not. My neighbour struck me as
                  bordering on repulsive. I knew, through experience, that I was tolerably
                  attractive. </p>
               <p>"Mrs. Heathcliff is my daughter-in-law," said Heathcliff, corroborating my
                  surmise. He turned, as he spoke, a peculiar <pb n="12"/>look in her direction, a
                  look of hatred, unless he has a most perverse set of facial muscles that will not,
                  like those of other people, interpret the language of his soul. </p>
               <p>"Ah, certainly -- I see now; you are the favoured possessor of the beneficent
                  fairy," I remarked, turning to my neighbour. </p>
               <p>This was worse than before: the youth grew crimson, and clenched his fist with
                  every appearance of a meditated assault. But he seemed to recollect himself,
                  presently, and smothered the storm in a brutal curse, muttered on my behalf, which
                  however, I took care not to notice. </p>
               <p>"Unhappy in your conjectures, sir!" observed my host; "we neither of us have the
                  privilege of owning your good fairy; her mate is dead. I said she was my
                  daughter-in-law, therefore, she must have married my son." </p>
               <p>"And this young man is -- " </p>
               <p>"Not my son, assuredly." </p>
               <p>Heathcliff smiled again, as if it were rather too bold a jest to attribute the
                  paternity of that bear to him.</p>
               <p>"My name is Hareton Earnshaw," growled the other; "and I'd counsel you to respect
                  it!" </p>
               <p>"I've shown no disrespect," was my reply, laughing internally at the dignity with
                  which he announced himself. </p>
               <p>He fixed his eye on me longer than I cared to return the stare, for fear I might
                  be tempted either to box his ears or render my hilarity audible. I began to feel
                  unmistakably out of place in that pleasant family circle. The dismal spiritual
                  atmosphere overcame, and more than neutralized, the glowing physical comforts
                  round me; and I resolved to be cautious how I ventured under those rafters a third
                  time. </p>
               <p>The business of eating being concluded, and no one uttering a word of sociable
                  conversation, I approached a window to examine the weather. A sorrowful sight I
                  saw -- dark night coming down prematurely, and sky and hills mingled in one bitter
                  whirl of wind and suffocating snow. </p>
               <pb n="13"/>
               <p>"I don't think it possible for me to get home now without a guide," I could not
                  help exclaiming. "The roads will be buried already; and, if they were bare, I
                  could scarcely distinguish a foot in advance." </p>
               <p>"Hareton, drive those dozen sheep into the barn porch. They'll be covered if left
                  in the fold all night. And put a plank before them," said Heathcliff. </p>
               <p>"How must I do?" I continued, with rising irritation. </p>
               <p>There was no reply to my question; and on looking round I saw only Joseph bringing
                  in a pail of porridge for the dogs, and Mrs. Heathcliff leaning over the fire,
                  diverting herself with burning a bundle of matches which had fallen from the
                  chimney-piece as she restored the tea-canister to its place. The former, when he
                  had deposited his burden, took a critical survey of the room, and in cracked tones
                  grated out, -- </p>
               <p>"Aw woonder how yah can faishion to stand thear i' idleness un war, when all on
                  'em's goan out! Bud yah're a nowt, and it's no use talking; yah'll niver mend o'
                  yer ill ways, but goa raight to t' divil, like yer mother afore ye!" </p>
               <p>I imagined for a moment that this piece of eloquence was addressed to me; and,
                  sufficiently enraged, stepped towards the aged rascal with an intention of kicking
                  him out of the door. Mrs. Heathcliff, however, checked me by her answer. </p>
               <p>"You scandalous old hypocrite!" she replied. "Are you not afraid of being carried
                  away bodily, whenever you mention the devil's name? I warn you to refrain from
                  provoking me, or I'll ask your abduction as a special favour. Stop! Look here,
                  Joseph," she continued, taking a long, dark book from a shelf; "I'll show you how
                  far I've progressed in the black art. I shall soon be competent to make a clear
                  house of it. The red cow didn't die by chance, and your rheumatism can hardly be
                  reckoned among providential visitations!" </p>
               <p>"Oh, wicked, wicked!" gasped the elder; "may the Lord deliver us from evil!" </p>
               <p>"No, reprobate; you are a castaway. Be off, or I'll hurt you <pb n="14"
                  />seriously. I'll have you all modelled in wax and clay; and the first who passes
                  the limits I fix shall -- I'll not say what he shall be done to, but you'll see!
                  Go! I'm looking at you." </p>
               <p>The little witch put a mock malignity into her beautiful eyes, and Joseph,
                  trembling with sincere horror, hurried out, praying and ejaculating "wicked" as he
                  went. I thought her conduct must be prompted by a species of dreary fun; and, now
                  that we were alone, I endeavoured to interest her in my distress. </p>
               <p>"Mrs. Heathcliff," I said earnestly, "you must excuse me for troubling you. I
                  presume, because, with that face, I'm sure you cannot help being good-hearted. Do
                  point out some landmarks by which I may know my way home. I have no more idea how
                  to get there than you would have how to get to London." </p>
               <p>"Take the road you came," she answered, ensconcing herself in a chair, with a
                  candle, and the long book open before her. "It is brief advice, but as sound as I
                  can give." </p>
               <p>"Then, if you hear of me being discovered dead in a bog or a pit full of snow,
                  your conscience won't whisper that it is partly your fault?" </p>
               <p>"How so? I cannot escort you. They wouldn't let me go to the end of the garden
                  wall." </p>
               <p>"You! I should be sorry to ask you to cross the threshold for my convenience on
                  such a night," I cried. "I want you to tell me my way, not to show it, or else to
                  persuade Mr. Heathcliff to give me a guide." </p>
               <p>"Who? There is himself, Earnshaw, Zillah, Joseph, and I. Which would you have?" </p>
               <p>"Are there no boys at the farm?" </p>
               <p>"No; those are all." </p>
               <p>"Then, it follows that I am compelled to stay." </p>
               <p>"That you may settle with your host. I have nothing to do with it." </p>
               <p>"I hope it will be a lesson to you to make no more rash journeys on these hills,"
                  cried Heathcliff's stern voice from the kitchen entrance. "As to staying here, I
                  don't keep accommodations <pb n="15"/>for visitors. You must share a bed with
                  Hareton or Joseph, if you do." </p>
               <p>"I can sleep on a chair in this room," I replied. </p>
               <p>"No, no! A stranger is a stranger, be he rich or poor. It will not suit me to
                  permit any one the range of the place while I am off guard!" said the unmannerly
                  wretch. </p>
               <p>With this insult, my patience was at an end. I uttered an expression of disgust,
                  and pushed past him into the yard, running against Earnshaw in my haste. It was so
                  dark that I could not see the means of exit; and, as I wandered round, I heard
                  another specimen of their civil behaviour amongst each other. At first the young
                  man appeared about to befriend me. </p>
               <p>"I'll go with him as far as the park," he said. </p>
               <p>"You'll go with him to hell!" exclaimed his master, or whatever relation he bore.
                  "And who is to look after the horses, eh?" </p>
               <p>"A man's life is of more consequence than one evening's neglect of the horses.
                  Somebody must go," murmured Mrs. Heathcliff, more kindly than I expected. </p>
               <p>"Not at your command!" retorted Hareton. "If you set store on him, you'd better be
                  quiet." </p>
               <p>"Then I hope his ghost will haunt you; and I hope Mr. Heathcliff will never get
                  another tenant till the Grange is a ruin!" she answered sharply. </p>
               <p>"Hearken, hearken; shoo's cursing on 'em!" muttered Joseph, towards whom I had
                  been steering. </p>
               <p>He sat within earshot, milking the cows by the light of a lantern, which I seized
                  unceremoniously, and calling out that I would send it back on the morrow, rushed
                  to the nearest postern. </p>
               <p>"Maister, maister, he's staling t' lanthern!" shouted the ancient, pursuing my
                  retreat. "Hey, Gnasher! Hey, dog! Hey, Wolf, holld him, holld him!" </p>
               <p>On opening the little door, two hairy monsters flew at my throat, bearing me down
                  and extinguishing the light; while a mingled guffaw from Heathcliff and Hareton
                  put the copestone on my rage and humiliation. <pb n="16"/>Fortunately, the beasts
                  seemed more bent on stretching their paws and yawning, and flourishing their
                  tails, than devouring me alive; but they would suffer no resurrection, and I was
                  forced to lie till their malignant masters pleased to deliver me. Then, hatless
                  and trembling with wrath, I ordered the miscreants to let me out -- on their peril
                  to keep me one minute longer -- with several incoherent threats of retaliation
                  that, in their indefinite depth of virulency, smacked of King Lear. </p>
               <p>The vehemence of my agitation brought on a copious bleeding at the nose; and still
                  Heathcliff laughed, and still I scolded. I don't know what would have concluded
                  the scene had there not been one person at hand rather more rational than myself
                  and more benevolent than my entertainer. This was Zillah, the stout housewife, who
                  at length issued forth to inquire into the nature of the uproar. She thought that
                  some of them had been laying violent hands on me; and, not daring to attack her
                  master, she turned her vocal artillery against the younger scoundrel. </p>
               <p>"Well, Mr. Earnshaw," she cried, "I wonder what you'll have agait next! Are we
                  going to murder folk on our very door-stones? I see this house will never do for
                  me. Look at t' poor lad; he's fair choking! -- Wisht, wisht! you munn't go on so.
                  Come in, and I'll cure that. There now, hold ye still." </p>
               <p>With these words she suddenly splashed a pint of icy water down my neck, and
                  pulled me into the kitchen. Mr. Heathcliff followed, his accidental merriment
                  expiring quickly in his habitual moroseness. </p>
               <p>I was sick exceedingly, and dizzy and faint, and thus compelled perforce to accept
                  lodgings under his roof. He told Zillah to give me a glass of brandy, and then
                  passed on to the inner room; while she condoled with me on my sorry predicament,
                  and having obeyed his orders, whereby I was somewhat revived, ushered me to
                  bed.</p>

               <p>While leading the way upstairs, she recommended that I should hide the candle, and
                  not make a noise; for her master had an odd notion about the chamber she would put
                  me in, and never let anybody lodge there willingly.</p>
               <p>I asked the reason.</p>
               <p>She did not know, she answered; she had only lived there a year or two; and they
                  had so many queer goings on, she could not begin to be curious.</p>
               <p>Too stupified to be curious myself, I fastened my door and glanced round for the
                  bed. The whole furniture consisted of a chair, a clothes-press, and a large oak
                  case, with squares cut out near the top resembling coach windows.</p>
               <p>Having approached this structure, I looked inside, and perceived it to be a
                  singular sort of old-fashioned couch, very conveniently designed to obviate the
                  necessity for every member of the family having a room to himself. In fact, it
                  formed a little closet, and the ledge of a window, which it enclosed, served as a
                  table.</p>
               <p>I slid back the panelled sides, got in with my light, pulled them together again,
                  and felt secure against the vigilance of Heathcliff, and every one else.</p>
               <p>The ledge, where I placed my candle, had a few mildewed books piled up in one
                  corner; and it was covered with writing scratched on the paint. This writing,
                  however, was nothing but a name repeated in all kinds of characters, large and
                  small -- Catherine Earnshaw, here and there varied to Catherine Heathcliff and
                  then again to Catherine Linton. </p>
               <p>In vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window, and continued spelling
                  over Catherine Earnshaw -- Heathcliff -- Linton, till my eyes closed. But they had
                  not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters started from the dark as
                  vivid as spectres -- the air swarmed with Catherines; and rousing myself to dispel
                  the <pb n="18"/>obtrusive name, I discovered my candle-wick reclining on one of
                  the antique volumes, and perfuming the place with an odour of roasted calf-skin. I
                  snuffed it off, and, very ill at ease under the influence of cold and lingering
                  nausea, sat up and spread open the injured tome on my knee. It was a Testament, in
                  lean type, and smelling dreadfully musty. A fly-leaf bore the inscription,
                  "Catherine Earnshaw, her book," and a date some quarter of a century back. I shut
                  it, and took up another, and another, till I had examined all. Catherine's library
                  was select, and its state of dilapidation proved it to have been well used, though
                  not altogether for a legitimate purpose. Scarcely one chapter had escaped a
                  pen-and-ink commentary -- at least, the appearance of one -- covering every morsel
                  of blank that the printer had left. Some were detached sentences; other parts took
                  the form of a regular diary, scrawled in an unformed, childish hand. At the top of
                  an extra page (quite a treasure, probably, when first lighted on) I was greatly
                  amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend Joseph, rudely yet
                  powerfully sketched. An immediate interest kindled within me for the unknown
                  Catherine, and I began forthwith to decipher her faded hieroglyphics. </p>
               <p>"An awful Sunday!" commenced the paragraph beneath. "I wish my father were back
                  again. Hindley is a detestable substitute -- his conduct to Heathcliff is
                  atrocious -- H. and I are going to rebel -- we took our initiatory step this
                  evening. </p>
               <p>"All day had been flooding with rain. We could not go to church, so Joseph must
                  needs get up a congregation in the garret; and while Hindley and his wife basked
                  downstairs before a comfortable fire -- doing anything but reading their Bibles,
                  I'll answer for it -- Heathcliff, myself, and the unhappy plough-boy were
                  commanded to take our prayer-books and mount. We were ranged in a row on a sack of
                  corn, groaning and shivering, and hoping that Joseph would shiver too, so that he
                  might give us a short homily for his own sake. A vain idea! The service lasted
                  precisely three hours; and yet my brother had the face to exclaim, when he saw us
                  descending, <pb n="19"/>"'What! done already?' </p>
               <p>On Sunday evenings we used to be permitted to play, if we did not make much noise;
                  now a mere titter is sufficient to send us into corners! </p>
               <p>" 'You forget you have a master here,' says the tyrant. 'I'll demolish the first
                  who puts me out of temper! I insist on perfect sobriety and silence. O boy! was
                  that you? -- Frances darling, pull his hair as you go by. I heard him snap his
                  fingers.' Frances pulled his hair heartily, and then went and seated herself on
                  her husband's knee; and there they were, like two babies, kissing and talking
                  nonsense by the hour -- foolish palaver that we should be ashamed of. We made
                  ourselves as snug as our means allowed in the arch of the dresser. I had just
                  fastened our pinafores together, and hung them up for a curtain, when in comes
                  Joseph on an errand from the stables. He tears down my handiwork, boxes my ears,
                  and croaks, -- </p>
               <p>" 'T' maister nobbut just buried, and Sabbath no o'ered, und t' sound o' t' gospel
                  still i' yer lugs, and ye darr be laiking! Shame on ye! Sit ye down, ill childer;
                  there's good books eneugh if ye'll read 'em. Sit ye down, and think o' yer sowls!' </p>
               <p>"Saying this, he compelled us so to square our positions that we might receive
                  from the far-off fire a dull ray to show us the text of the lumber he thrust upon
                  us. I could not bear the employment. I took my dingy volume by the scroop, and
                  hurled it into the dog-kennel, vowing I hated a good book. Heathcliff kicked his
                  to the same place. Then there was a hubbub! </p>
               <p>" 'Maister Hindley!' shouted our chaplain. 'Maister, coom hither! Miss Cathy's
                  riven th' back off "Th' Helmet o' Salvation," un Heathcliff's pawsed his fit into
                  t' first part o' "T' Brooad Way to Destruction!" It's fair flaysome that ye let
                  'em go on this gait. Ech! th' owd man wad ha' laced 'em properly; but he's goan!' </p>
               <p>"Hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth, and <pb n="20"/>seizing one
                  of us by the collar, and the other by the arm, hurled both into the back kitchen,
                  where, Joseph asseverated, `owd Nick' would fetch us as sure as we were living;
                  and, so comforted, we each sought a separate nook to await his advent. </p>
               <p>"I reached this book, and a pot of ink from a shelf, and pushed the house-door
                  ajar to give me light, and I have got the time on with writing for twenty minutes;
                  but my companion is impatient and proposes that we should appropriate the dairy
                  woman's cloak, and have a scamper on the moors, under its shelter. A pleasant
                  suggestion -- and then, if the surly old man come in, he may believe his prophesy
                  verified -- we cannot be damper, or colder, in the rain than we are here." </p>
               <p>I suppose Catherine fulfilled her project, for the next sentence took up another
                  subject; she waxed lachrymose. </p>
               <p>"How little did I dream that Hindley would ever make me cry so!" she wrote. "My
                  head aches, till I cannot keep it on the pillow; and still I can't give over. Poor
                  Heathcliff! Hindley calls him a vagabond, and won't let him sit with us, nor eat
                  with us any more; and he says, he and I must not play together, and threatens to
                  turn him out of the house if we break his orders. </p>
               <p>"He has been blaming our father (how dared he?) for treating H. too liberally; and
                  swears he will reduce him to his right place -- " </p>
               <p>I began to nod drowsily over the dim page; my eye wandered from manuscript to
                  print. I saw a red ornamented title -- "Seventy Times Seven, and the First of the
                  Seventy-First. A Pious Discourse delivered by the Reverend Jabes Branderham, in
                  the Chapel of Gimmerden Sough." And while I was, half consciously, worrying my
                  brain to guess what Jabes Branderham would make of his subject, I sank back in
                  bed, and fell asleep. </p>
               <p>Alas, for the effects of bad tea and bad temper! what else could it be that made
                  me pass such a terrible night? I don't remember another that I can at all compare
                  with it since I was capable of suffering. </p>
               <pb n="21"/>
               <p>I began to dream, almost before I ceased to be sensible of my locality. I thought
                  it was morning, and I had set out on my way home, with Joseph for a guide. The
                  snow lay yards deep in our road; and, as we floundered on, my companion wearied me
                  with constant reproaches that I had not brought a pilgrim's staff, telling me I
                  could never get into the house without one, and boastfully flourishing a
                  heavy-headed cudgel, which I understood to be so denominated. </p>
               <p>For a moment I considered it absurd that I should need such a weapon to gain
                  admittance into my own residence. Then a new idea flashed across me. I was not
                  going there. We were journeying to hear the famous Jabes Branderham preach from
                  the text, "Seventy Times Seven," and either Joseph the preacher or I had committed
                  the "First of the Seventy-First," and were to be publicly exposed and
                  excommunicated. </p>
               <p>We came to the chapel. I have passed it really in my walks twice or thrice. It
                  lies in a hollow between two hills -- an elevated hollow, near a swamp, whose
                  peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes of embalming on the few corpses
                  deposited there. The roof has been kept whole hitherto; but as the clergyman's
                  stipend is only twenty pounds per annum, and a house with two rooms, threatening
                  speedily to determine into one, no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor,
                  especially as it is currently reported that his flock would rather let him starve
                  than increase the living by one penny from their own pockets. However, in my
                  dream, Jabes had a full and attentive congregation, and he preached -- good God!
                  what a sermon, divided into four hundred and ninety parts, each fully equal to an
                  ordinary address from the pulpit, and each discussing a separate sin! Where he
                  searched for them, I cannot tell. He had his private manner of interpreting the
                  phrase, and it seemed necessary the brother should sin different sins on every
                  occasion. They were of the most curious character -- odd transgressions that I
                  never imagined previously. </p>
               <p>Oh, how weary I grew! How I writhed, and yawned, and nodded, and revived! How I
                  pinched, and pricked myself, and rubbed my eyes, and stood up, and sat down again,
                  and nudged <pb n="22"/>Joseph to inform me if he would ever have done! I was
                  condemned to hear all out. Finally, he reached the "First of the Seventy-First."
                  At that crisis, a sudden inspiration descended on me. I was moved to rise and
                  denounce Jabes Branderham as the sinner of the sin that no Christian need pardon. </p>
               <p>"Sir," I exclaimed, "sitting here within these four walls, at one stretch, I have
                  endured and forgiven the four hundred and ninety heads of your discourse. Seventy
                  times seven times have I plucked up my hat and been about to depart; seventy times
                  seven times have you preposterously forced me to resume my seat. The four hundred
                  and ninety-first is too much. -- Fellow-martyrs, have at him! Drag him down, and
                  crush him to atoms, that the place which knows him may know him no more!" </p>
               <p>"Thou art the man!" cried Jabes, after a solemn pause, leaning over his cushion.
                  "Seventy times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy visage; seventy times
                  seven did I take counsel with my soul. Lo, this is human weakness; this also may
                  be absolved! The 'First of the Seventy-First' is come. Brethren, execute upon him
                  the judgment written. Such honour have all His saints!" </p>
               <p>With that concluding word, the whole assembly, exalting their pilgrim's staves,
                  rushed round me in a body; and I, having no weapon to raise in self-defence,
                  commenced grappling with Joseph, my nearest and most ferocious assailant, for his.
                  In the confluence of the multitude several clubs crossed; blows aimed at me fell
                  on other sconces. Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and
                  counter-rappings. Every man's hand was against his neighbour; and Branderham,
                  unwilling to remain idle, poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the
                  boards of the pulpit, which responded so smartly that at last, to my unspeakable
                  relief, they woke me. And what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult?
                  What had played Jabes's part in the row? Merely the branch of a fir-tree that
                  touched my lattice, as the blast wailed by, and rattled its dry cones against the
                  panes! <pb n="23"/>I listened doubtingly an instant, detected the disturber, then
                  turned and dozed, and dreamt again -- if possible, still more disagreeably than
                  before. </p>
               <p>This time I remembered I was lying in the oak closet, and I heard distinctly the
                  gusty wind and the driving of the snow. I heard also the fir-bough repeat its
                  teasing sound, and ascribed it to the right cause. But it annoyed me so much that
                  I resolved to silence it, if possible; and I thought I rose and endeavoured to
                  unhasp the casement. The hook was soldered into the staple -- a circumstance
                  observed by me when awake, but forgotten. "I must stop it, nevertheless!" I
                  muttered, knocking my knuckles through the glass, and stretching an arm out to
                  seize the importunate branch; instead of which, my fingers closed on the fingers
                  of a little, ice-cold hand! The intense horror of nightmare came over me. I tried
                  to draw back my arm, but the hand clung to it, and a most melancholy voice sobbed,
                  "Let me in -- let me in!" "Who are you?" I asked, struggling, meanwhile, to
                  disengage myself. "Catherine Linton," it replied shiveringly. (Why did I think of
                  Linton? I had read Earnshaw twenty times for Linton.) "I'm come home. I'd lost my
                  way on the moor." As it spoke, I discerned, obscurely, a child's face looking
                  through the window. Terror made me cruel; and finding it useless to attempt
                  shaking the creature off, I pulled its wrist on to the broken pane, and rubbed it
                  to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes. Still it wailed,
                  "Let me in!" and maintained its tenacious gripe, almost maddening me with fear.
                  "How can I?" I said at length. "Let me go, if you want me to let you in!" The
                  fingers relaxed; I snatched mine through the hole, hurriedly piled the books up in
                  a pyramid against it, and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer. I
                  seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour; <pb n="24"/>yet the instant
                  I listened again, there was the doleful cry moaning on! "Begone!" I shouted; "I'll
                  never let you in -- not if you beg for twenty years." "It is twenty years,"
                  mourned the voice -- "twenty years. I've been a waif for twenty years!" Thereat
                  began a feeble scratching outside, and the pile of books moved as if thrust
                  forward. I tried to jump up, but could not stir a limb, and so yelled aloud in a
                  frenzy of fright. To my confusion, I discovered the yell was not ideal. Hasty
                  footsteps approached my chamber door; somebody pushed it open with a vigorous
                  hand, and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed. I sat
                  shuddering yet, and wiping the perspiration from my forehead. The intruder
                  appeared to hesitate, and muttered to himself. At last he said in a half-whisper,
                  plainly not expecting an answer, "Is any one here?" I considered it best to
                  confess my presence, for I knew Heathcliff's accents, and feared he might search
                  further if I kept quiet. With this intention I turned and opened the panels. I
                  shall not soon forget the effect my action produced. </p>
               <p>Heathcliff stood near the entrance, in his shirt and trousers, with a candle
                  dripping over his fingers, and his face as white as the wall behind him. The first
                  creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock. The light leaped from his
                  hold to a distance of some feet, and his agitation was so extreme that he could
                  hardly pick it up. </p>
               <p>"It is only your guest, sir," I called out, desirous to spare him the humiliation
                  of exposing his cowardice further. "I had the misfortune to scream in my sleep,
                  owing to a frightful nightmare. I'm sorry I disturbed you." </p>
               <p>"Oh, God confound you, Mr. Lockwood! I wish you were at the -- " commenced my
                  host, setting the candle on a chair, because he found it impossible to hold it
                  steady. <pb n="25"/>"And who showed you up into this room?" he continued, crushing
                  his nails into his palms and grinding his teeth to subdue the maxillary
                  convulsions. "Who was it? I've a good mind to turn them out of the house this
                  moment." </p>
               <p>"It was your servant Zillah," I replied, flinging myself on to the floor, and
                  rapidly resuming my garments. "I should not care if you did, Mr. Heathcliff; she
                  richly deserves it. I suppose that she wanted to get another proof that the place
                  was haunted, at my expense. Well, it is -- swarming with ghosts and goblins! You
                  have reason in shutting it up, I assure you. No one will thank you for a doze in
                  such a den!" </p>
               <p>"What do you mean?" asked Heathcliff, "and what are you doing? Lie down and finish
                  out the night, since you are here; but, for Heaven's sake, don't repeat that
                  horrid noise. Nothing could excuse it, unless you were having your throat cut!" </p>
               <p>"If the little fiend had got in at the window, she probably would have strangled
                  me!" I returned. "I'm not going to endure the persecutions of your hospitable
                  ancestors again. Was not the Reverend Jabes Branderham akin to you on the mother's
                  side? And that minx, Catherine Linton, or Earnshaw, or however she was called, she
                  must have been a changeling -- wicked little soul! She told me she had been
                  walking the earth those twenty years -- a just punishment for her mortal
                  transgressions, I've no doubt." </p>
               <p>Scarcely were these words uttered, when I recollected the association of
                  Heathcliff's with Catherine's name in the book, which had completely slipped from
                  my memory, till thus awakened. I blushed at my inconsideration; but without
                  showing further consciousness of the offence, I hastened to add, "The truth is,
                  sir, I passed the first part of the night in -- " Here I stopped afresh. I was
                  about to say "perusing those old volumes" -- then it would have revealed my
                  knowledge of their written as well as their printed contents; so, correcting
                  myself, I went on, "In spelling over the name scratched on that window-ledge -- a
                  monotonous occupation, calculated to set me asleep, like counting, or -- " </p>
               <pb n="26"/>
               <p>"What can you mean by talking in this way to me?" thundered Heathcliff, with
                  savage vehemence. "How -- how dare you, under my roof? -- God, he's mad to speak
                  so!" And he struck his forehead with rage. </p>
               <p>I did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my explanation; but he
                  seemed so powerfully affected that I took pity and proceeded with my dreams,
                  affirming I had never heard the appellation of "Catherine Linton" before, but
                  reading it often over produced an impression which personified itself when I had
                  no longer my imagination under control. Heathcliff gradually fell back into the
                  shelter of the bed as I spoke, finally sitting down almost concealed behind it. I
                  guessed, however, by his irregular and intercepted breathing, that he struggled to
                  vanquish an excess of violent emotion. Not liking to show him that I had heard the
                  conflict, I continued my toilet rather noisily, looked at my watch, and
                  soliloquized on the length of the night. Not three o'clock yet! I could have taken
                  oath it had been six. Time stagnates here. We must surely have retired to rest at
                  eight! </p>
               <p>"Always at nine in winter, and rise at four," said my host, suppressing a groan,
                  and, as I fancied, by the motion of his arm's shadow, dashing a tear from his
                  eyes. "Mr. Lockwood," he added, "you may go into my room. You'll only be in the
                  way, coming downstairs so early; and your childish outcry has sent sleep to the
                  devil for me." </p>
               <p>"And for me too," I replied. "I'll walk in the yard till daylight, and then I'll
                  be off; and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion. I'm now quite cured
                  of seeking pleasure in society, be it country or town. A sensible man ought to
                  find sufficient company in himself." </p>
               <p>"Delightful company!" muttered Heathcliff. "Take the candle, and go where you
                  please. I shall join you directly. Keep out of the yard, though -- the dogs are
                  unchained; and the house -- Juno mounts sentinel there, and -- nay, you can only
                  ramble about the steps and passages. But away with you! I'll come in two minutes!" </p>
               <pb n="27"/>
               <p>I obeyed, so far as to quit the chamber; when, ignorant where the narrow lobbies
                  led, I stood still, and was witness, involuntarily, to a piece of superstition on
                  the part of my landlord which belied oddly his apparent sense. He got on to the
                  bed and wrenched open the lattice, bursting, as he pulled at it, into an
                  uncontrollable passion of tears. "Come in! come in!" he sobbed. "Cathy, do come!
                  Oh, do -- once more! Oh, my heart's darling! hear me this time, Catherine, at
                  last!" The spectre showed a spectre's ordinary caprice. It gave no sign of being;
                  but the snow and wind whirled wildly through, even reaching my station, and
                  blowing out the light. </p>
               <p>There was such anguish in the gush of grief that accompanied this raving that my
                  compassion made me overlook its folly, and I drew off, half angry to have listened
                  at all, and vexed at having related my ridiculous nightmare, since it produced
                  that agony; though why was beyond my comprehension. I descended cautiously to the
                  lower regions, and landed in the back kitchen, where a gleam of fire, raked
                  compactly together, enabled me to rekindle my candle. Nothing was stirring except
                  a brindled, gray cat, which crept from the ashes, and saluted me with a querulous
                  mew. </p>
               <p>Two benches, shaped in sections of a circle, nearly enclosed the hearth. On one of
                  these I stretched myself, and Grimalkin mounted the other. We were both of us
                  nodding ere any one invaded our retreat, and then it was Joseph, shuffling down a
                  wooden ladder that vanished in the roof, through a trap -- the ascent to his
                  garret, I suppose. He cast a sinister look at the little flame which I had enticed
                  to play between the ribs, swept the cat from its elevation, and bestowing himself
                  in the vacancy, commenced the operation of stuffing a three-inch pipe with
                  tobacco. My presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of impudence
                  too shameful for remark. He silently applied the tube to his lips, folded his
                  arms, and puffed away. I let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed; and after sucking out
                     <pb n="28"/>his last wreath, and heaving a profound sigh, he got up, and
                  departed as solemnly as he came. </p>
               <p>A more elastic footstep entered next; and now I opened my mouth for a
                  "good-morning," but closed it again, the salutation unachieved, for Hareton
                  Earnshaw was performing his orisons, sotto voce, in a series of curses directed
                  against every object he touched, while he rummaged a corner for a spade or shovel
                  to dig through the drifts. He glanced over the back of the bench, dilating his
                  nostrils, and thought as little of exchanging civilities with me as with my
                  companion the cat. I guessed by his preparations that egress was allowed, and
                  leaving my hard couch, made a movement to follow him. He noticed this, and thrust
                  at an inner door with the end of his spade, intimating by an inarticulate sound
                  that there was the place where I must go if I changed my locality. </p>
               <p>It opened into the house, where the females were already astir -- Zillah urging
                  flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows; and Mrs. Heathcliff,
                  kneeling on the hearth, reading a book by the aid of the blaze. She held her hand
                  interposed between the furnace-heat and her eyes, and seemed absorbed in her
                  occupation, desisting from it only to chide the servant for covering her with
                  sparks, or to push away a dog, now and then, that snoozled its nose over-forwardly
                  into her face. I was surprised to see Heathcliff there also. He stood by the fire,
                  his back towards me, just finishing a stormy scene to poor Zillah, who ever and
                  anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron and heave an
                  indignant groan. </p>
               <p>"And you, you worthless -- " he broke out as I entered, turning to his
                  daughter-in-law, and employing an epithet as harmless as duck or sheep, but
                  generally represented by a dash -- . "There you are at your idle tricks again! The
                  rest of them do earn their bread; you live on my charity! Put your trash away, and
                  find something to do. You shall pay me for the plague of having you eternally in
                  my sight. Do you hear, damnable jade?" </p>
               <p>"I'll put my trash away, because you can make me if I refuse," <pb n="29"
                  />answered the young lady, closing her book and throwing it on a chair. "But I'll
                  not do anything, though you should swear your tongue out, except what I please!" </p>
               <p>Heathcliff lifted his hand, and the speaker sprang to a safer distance, obviously
                  acquainted with its weight. Having no desire to be entertained by a cat-and-dog
                  combat, I stepped forward briskly, as if eager to partake the warmth of the
                  hearth, and innocent of any knowledge of the interrupted dispute. Each had enough
                  decorum to suspend further hostilities. Heathcliff placed his fists, out of
                  temptation, in his pockets; Mrs. Heathcliff curled her lip, and walked to a seat
                  far off, where she kept her word by playing the part of a statue during the
                  remainder of my stay. That was not long. I declined joining their breakfast, and
                  at the first gleam of dawn took an opportunity of escaping into the free air, now
                  clear, and still, and cold as impalpable ice. </p>
               <p>My landlord hallooed for me to stop ere I reached the bottom of the garden, and
                  offered to accompany me across the moor. It was well he did, for the whole
                  hill-back was one billowy, white ocean, the swells and falls not indicating
                  corresponding rises and depressions in the ground. Many pits, at least, were
                  filled to a level, and entire ranges of mounds, the refuse of the quarries,
                  blotted from the chart which my yesterday's walk left pictured in my mind. I had
                  remarked on one side of the road, at intervals of six or seven yards, a line of
                  upright stones, continued through the whole length of the barren. These were
                  erected and daubed with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark, and also
                  when a fall, like the present, confounded the deep swamps on either hand with the
                  firmer path; but, excepting a dirty dot pointing up here and there, all traces of
                  their existence had vanished, and my companion found it necessary to warn me
                  frequently to steer to the right or left, when I imagined I was following
                  correctly the windings of the road. </p>
               <p>We exchanged little conversation, and he halted at the entrance of Thrushcross
                  Park, saying I could make no error there. Our adieus were limited to a hasty bow,
                  and then I pushed forward, <pb n="30"/>trusting to my own resources, for the
                  porter's lodge is untenanted as yet. </p>
               <p>The distance from the gate to the Grange is two miles; I believe I managed to make
                  it four, what with losing myself among the trees, and sinking up to the neck in
                  snow -- a predicament which only those who have experienced it can appreciate. At
                  any rate, whatever were my wanderings, the clock chimed twelve as I entered the
                  house, and that gave exactly an hour for every mile of the usual way from
                  Wuthering Heights. </p>
               <p>My human fixture and her satellites rushed to welcome me, exclaiming tumultuously
                  they had completely given me up. Everybody conjectured that I perished last night,
                  and they were wondering how they must set about the search for my remains. </p>
               <p>I bid them be quiet, now that they saw me returned, and, benumbed to my very
                  heart, I dragged upstairs; whence, after putting on dry clothes, and pacing to and
                  fro thirty or forty minutes, to restore the animal heat, I am adjourned to my
                  study, feeble as a kitten -- almost too much so to enjoy the cheerful fire and
                  smoking coffee which the servant has prepared for my refreshment. </p>

               <p>What vain weather-cocks we are ! I, who had determined to hold myself independent
                  of all social intercourse, and thanked my stars that, at length, I had lighted on
                  a spot where it was next to impracticable -- I, weak wretch, after maintaining
                  till dusk a struggle with low spirits and solitude, was finally compelled to
                  strike my colours; and, under pretence of gaining information concerning the
                  necessities of my establishment, I desired Mrs. Dean, when she brought in supper,
                  to sit down while I ate it, hoping sincerely she would prove a regular gossip, and
                  either rouse me to animation or lull me to sleep by her talk.</p>
               <p>"You have lived here a considerable time," I commenced; "did you not say sixteen
                  years ?"</p>
               <p>"Eighteen, sir; I came, when the mistress was married, to wait on her; after she
                  died, the master retained me for his house-keeper."</p>
               <p>"Indeed."</p>
               <p>l here ensued a pause. She was not a gossip, I feared, unless about her own
                  affairs, and those could hardly interest me. However, having studied for an
                  interval, with a fist on either knee, and a cloud of meditation over her ruddy
                  countenance, she ejaculated -- </p>
               <p>"Ah, times are greatly changed since then!"</p>
               <p>"Yes," I remarked; "you've seen a good many alterations, I suppose?" </p>
               <p>"I have; and troubles too," she said. </p>
               <p>"Oh, I'll turn the talk on my landlord's family!" I thought to myself. "A good
                  subject to start! And that pretty girl-widow, I should like to know her history --
                  whether she be a native of the country, or, as is more probable, an exotic that
                  the surly indigenae will not recognize for kin." With this intention I asked Mrs.
                  Dean why Heathcliff let <pb n="32"/>Thrushcross Grange, and preferred living in a
                  situation and residence so much inferior. "Is he not rich enough to keep the
                  estate in good order?" I inquired. </p>
               <p>"Rich, sir!" she returned. "He has nobody knows what money, and every year it
                  increases. Yes, yes; he's rich enough to live in a finer house than this. But he's
                  very near -- close-handed; and if he had meant to flit to Thrushcross Grange, as
                  soon as he heard of a good tenant he could not have borne to miss the chance of
                  getting a few hundreds more. It is strange people should be so greedy when they
                  are alone in the world!" </p>
               <p>"He had a son, it seems?" </p>
               <p>"Yes, he had one. He is dead." </p>
               <p>"And that young lady, Mrs. Heathcliff, is his widow?" </p>
               <p>"Yes." </p>
               <p>"Where did she come from originally?" </p>
               <p>"Why, sir, she is my late master's daughter. Catherine Linton was her maiden name.
                  I nursed her, poor thing! I did wish Mr. Heathcliff would remove here, and then we
                  might have been together again." </p>
               <p>"What! Catherine Linton?" I exclaimed, astonished. But a minute's reflection
                  convinced me it was not my ghostly Catherine. "Then," I continued, "my
                  predecessor's name was Linton?" </p>
               <p>"It was." </p>
               <p>"And who is that Earnshaw -- Hareton Earnshaw -- who lives with Mr. Heathcliff?
                  Are they relations?" </p>
               <p>"No; he is the late Mrs. Linton's nephew." </p>
               <p>"The young lady's cousin, then?" </p>
               <p>"Yes; and her husband was her cousin also -- one on the mother's side, the other
                  on the father's side. Heathcliff married Mr. Linton's sister." </p>
               <p>"I see the house at Wuthering Heights has 'Earnshaw' carved over the front door.
                  Are they an old family?" </p>
               <p>"Very old, sir; and Hareton is the last of them, as our Miss Cathy is of us -- I
                  mean of the Lintons. Have you been to <pb n="33"/>Wuthering Heights? I beg pardon
                  for asking; but I should like to hear how she is." </p>
               <p>"Mrs. Heathcliff? She looked very well, and very handsome; yet, I think, not very
                  happy." </p>
               <p>"Oh dear, I don't wonder! And how did you like the master?" </p>
               <p>"A rough fellow, rather, Mrs. Dean. Is not that his character?" </p>
               <p>"Rough as a saw-edge, and hard as whinstone. The less you meddle with him the
                  better." </p>
               <p>"He must have had some ups and downs in life to make him such a churl. Do you know
                  anything of his history?" </p>
               <p>"It's a cuckoo's, sir. I know all about it -- except where he was born, and who
                  were his parents, and how he got his money at first. And Hareton has been cast out
                  like an unfledged dunnock! The unfortunate lad is the only one in all this parish
                  that does not guess how he has been cheated." </p>
               <p>"Well, Mrs. Dean, it will be a charitable deed to tell me something of my
                  neighbours. I feel I shall not rest if I go to bed, so be good enough to sit and
                  chat an hour." </p>
               <p>"Oh, certainly, sir! I'll just fetch a little sewing, and then I'll sit as long as
                  you please. But you've caught cold -- I saw you shivering; and you must have some
                  gruel to drive it out." </p>
               <p>The worthy woman bustled off, and I crouched nearer the fire. My head felt hot,
                  and the rest of me chill; moreover, I was excited, almost to a pitch of
                  foolishness, through my nerves and brain. This caused me to feel, not
                  uncomfortable, but rather fearful (as I am still) of serious effects from the
                  incidents of to-day and yesterday. She returned presently, bringing a smoking
                  basin and a basket of work; and having placed the former on the hob, drew in her
                  seat, evidently pleased to find me so companionable. </p>

               <p>Before I came to live here, she commenced -- waiting no further invitation to her
                  story -- I was almost always at Wuthering Heights, because my mother had nursed
                  Mr. Hindley Earnshaw (that was <pb n="34"/>Hareton's father), and I got used to
                  playing with the children. I ran errands, too, and helped to make hay, and hung
                  about the farm, ready for anything that anybody would set me to. One fine summer
                  morning -- it was the beginning of harvest, I remember -- Mr. Earnshaw, the old
                  master, came downstairs, dressed for a journey; and after he had told Joseph what
                  was to be done during the day, he turned to Hindley, and Cathy, and me -- for I
                  sat eating my porridge with them -- and he said, speaking to his son, "Now, my
                  bonny man, I'm going to Liverpool to-day; what shall I bring you? You may choose
                  what you like. Only let it be little, for I shall walk there and back. Sixty miles
                  each way -- that is a long spell!" Hindley named a fiddle, and then he asked Miss
                  Cathy. She was hardly six years old, but she could ride any horse in the stable,
                  and she chose a whip. He did not forget me, for he had a kind heart, though he was
                  rather severe sometimes. He promised to bring me a pocketful of apples and pears;
                  and then he kissed his children, said good-bye, and set off. </p>
               <p>It seemed a long while to us all -- the three days of his absence -- and often did
                  little Cathy ask when he would be home. Mrs. Earnshaw expected him by supper-time
                  on the third evening, and she put the meal off hour after hour. There were no
                  signs of his coming, however, and at last the children got tired of running down
                  to the gate to look. Then it grew dark. She would have had them to bed, but they
                  begged sadly to be allowed to stay up; and just about eleven o'clock the
                  door-latch was raised quietly, and in stepped the master. He threw himself into a
                  chair, laughing and groaning, and bid them all stand off, for he was nearly
                  killed. He would not have such another walk for the three kingdoms. </p>
               <p>"And at the end of it, to be flighted to death!" he said, opening his greatcoat,
                  which he held bundled up in his arms. "See here, wife! I was never so beaten with
                  anything in my life; but you must e'en take it as a gift of God, though it's as
                  dark almost as if it came from the devil." </p>
               <pb n="35"/>
               <p>We crowded round, and over Miss Cathy's head I had a peep at a dirty, ragged,
                  black-haired child, big enough both to walk and talk. Indeed, its face looked
                  older than Catherine's; yet when it was set on its feet it only stared round, and
                  repeated over and over again some gibberish that nobody could understand. I was
                  frightened, and Mrs. Earnshaw was ready to fling it out of doors. She did fly up,
                  asking how he could fashion to bring that gipsy brat into the house, when they had
                  their own bairns to feed and fend for; what he meant to do with it, and whether he
                  were mad. The master tried to explain the matter; but he was really half dead with
                  fatigue, and all that I could make out, amongst her scolding, was a tale of his
                  seeing it starving, and houseless, and as good as dumb, in the streets of
                  Liverpool, where he picked it up and inquired for its owner. Not a soul knew to
                  whom it belonged, he said; and his money and time being both limited, he thought
                  it better to take it home with him at once, than run into vain expenses there,
                  because he was determined be would not leave it as he found it. Well, the
                  conclusion was that my mistress grumbled herself calm; and Mr. Earnshaw told me to
                  wash it, and give it clean things, and let it sleep with the children. </p>
               <p>Hindley and Cathy contented themselves with looking and listening till peace was
                  restored; then both began searching their father's pockets for the presents he had
                  promised them. The former was a boy of fourteen, but when he drew out what had
                  been a fiddle, crushed to morsels in the greatcoat, he blubbered aloud; and Cathy,
                  when she learned the master had lost her whip in attending on the stranger, showed
                  her humour by grinning and spitting at the stupid little thing, earning for her
                  pains a sound blow from her father to teach her cleaner manners. They entirely
                  refused to have it in bed with them, or even in their room; and I had no more
                  sense, so I put it on the landing of the stairs, hoping it might be gone on the
                  morrow. By chance, or else attracted by hearing his voice, it crept to Mr.
                  Earnshaw's door, and there he found it on quitting his chamber. Inquiries were
                  made as to how it got there. I was obliged to confess, and in recompense <pb
                     n="36"/>for my cowardice and inhumanity was sent out of the house. </p>
               <p>This was Heathcliff's first introduction to the family. On coming back a few days
                  afterwards (for I did not consider my banishment perpetual) I found they had
                  christened him "Heathcliff." It was the name of a son who died in childhood, and
                  it has served him ever since, both for Christian and surname. Miss Cathy and he
                  were now very thick; but Hindley hated him, and, to say the truth, I did the same;
                  and we plagued and went on with him shamefully, for I wasn't reasonable enough to
                  feel my injustice, and the mistress never put in a word on his behalf when she saw
                  him wronged. </p>
               <p>He seemed a sullen, patient child, hardened, perhaps, to ill-treatment. He would
                  stand Hindley's blows without winking or shedding a tear, and my pinches moved him
                  only to draw in a breath and open his eyes, as if he had hurt himself by accident
                  and nobody was to blame. This endurance made old Earnshaw furious when he
                  discovered his son persecuting the poor, fatherless child, as he called him. He
                  took to Heathcliff strangely, believing all he said (for that matter, he said
                  precious little, and generally the truth), and petting him up far above Cathy, who
                  was too mischievous and wayward for a favourite. </p>
               <p>So from the very beginning he bred bad feeling in the house; and at Mrs.
                  Earnshaw's death, which happened in less than two years after, the young master
                  had learned to regard his father as an oppressor rather than a friend, and
                  Heathcliff as a usurper of his parent's affections and his privileges, and he grew
                  bitter with brooding over these injuries. I sympathized a while; but when the
                  children fell ill of the measles, and I had to tend them, and take on me the cares
                  of a woman at once, I changed my ideas. Heathcliff was dangerously sick; and while
                  he lay at the worst he would have me constantly by his pillow. I suppose he felt I
                  did a good deal for him, and he hadn't wit to guess that I was compelled to do it.
                  However, I will say this -- he was the quietest child that ever nurse watched
                  over. The difference between him and the others forced me to be less <pb n="37"
                  />partial. Cathy and her brother harassed me terribly; he was as uncomplaining as
                  a lamb, though hardness, not gentleness, made him give little trouble. </p>
               <p>He got through, and the doctor affirmed it was in a great measure owing to me, and
                  praised me for my care. I was vain of his commendations, and softened towards the
                  being by whose means I earned them; and thus Hindley lost his last ally. Still I
                  couldn't dote on Heathcliff, and I wondered often what my master saw to admire so
                  much in the sullen boy, who never, to my recollection, repaid his indulgence by
                  any sign of gratitude. He was not insolent to his benefactor, he was simply
                  insensible, though knowing perfectly the hold he had on his heart, and conscious
                  he had only to speak and all the house would be obliged to bend to his wishes. As
                  an instance, I remember Mr. Earnshaw once bought a couple of colts at the parish
                  fair, and gave the lads each one. Heathcliff took the handsomest, but it soon fell
                  lame, and when he discovered it, he said to Hindley, -- </p>
               <p>"You must exchange horses with me -- I don't like mine; and if you won't, I shall
                  tell your father of the three thrashings you've given me this week, and show him
                  my arm, which is black to the shoulder." Hindley put out his tongue and cuffed him
                  over the ears. "You'd better do it at once," he persisted, escaping to the porch
                  (they were in the stable). "You will have to; and if I speak of these blows,
                  you'll get them again with interest." "Off, dog!" cried Hindley, threatening him
                  with an iron weight used for weighing potatoes and hay. "Throw it," he replied,
                  standing still, "and then I'll tell how you boasted that you would turn me out of
                  doors as soon as he died, and see whether he will not turn you out directly."
                  Hindley threw it, hitting him on the breast, and down he fell, but staggered up
                  immediately, breathless and white; and had I not prevented it, he would have gone
                  just so to the master, and got full revenge by letting his condition plead for
                  him, intimating who had caused it.</p>
               <pb n="38"/>
               <p>"Take my colt, gipsy, then!" said young Earnshaw. "And I pray that he may break
                  your neck. Take him, and be damned, you beggarly interloper; and wheedle my father
                  out of all he has. Only afterwards show him what you are, imp of Satan. And take
                  that! I hope he'll kick out your brains!" </p>
               <p>Heathcliff had gone to loose the beast and shift it to his own stall. He was
                  passing behind it, when Hindley finished his speech by knocking him under its
                  feet, and without stopping to examine whether his hopes were fulfilled, ran away
                  as fast as he could.</p>
               <p>I was surprised to witness how coolly the child gathered himself up, and went on
                  with his intention -- exchanging saddles and all, and then sitting down on a
                  bundle of hay to overcome the qualm which the violent blow occasioned, before he
                  entered the house.</p>
               <p>I persuaded him easily to let me lay the blame of his bruises on the horse. He
                  minded little what tale was told, since he had what he wanted. He complained so
                  seldom, indeed, of such stirs as these, that I really thought him not vindictive.
                  I was deceived completely, as you will hear. </p>

               <pb n="39"/>
               <p>In the course of time, Mr. Earnshaw began to fail. He had been active and healthy,
                  yet his strength left him suddenly; and when he was confined to the chimney-corner
                  he grew grievously irritable. A nothing vexed him, and suspected slights of his
                  authority nearly threw him into fits.</p>
               <p>This was especially to be remarked if any one attempted to impose upon, or
                  domineer over, his favourite: he was painfully jealous lest a word should be
                  spoken amiss to him, seeming to have got into his head the notion that, because he
                  liked Heathcliff, all hated, and longed to do him an ill-turn.</p>
               <p>It was a disadvantage to the lad, for the kinder among us did not wish to fret the
                  master, so we humoured his partiality; and that humouring was rich nourishment to
                  the child's pride and black tempers. Still it became in a manner necessary; twice,
                  or thrice, Hindley's manifestations of scorn, while his father was near, roused
                  the old man to a fury. He seized his stick to strike him, and shook with rage that
                  he could not do it.</p>
               <p>At last, our curate (we had a curate then who made the living answer by teaching
                  the little Lintons and Earnshaws, and farming his bit of land himself) -- he
                  advised that the young man should be sent to college, and Mr. Earnshaw agreed,
                  though with a heavy spirit, for he said -- </p>
               <p>"Hindley was naught, and would never thrive as where he wandered.</p>
               <p>I hoped heartily we should have peace now. It hurt me to think the master should
                  be made uncomfortable by his own good deed. I fancied the discontent of age and
                  disease arose from his family disagreements, as he would have it that it did.
                  Really, you know, sir, it was in his sinking frame.</p>
               <p>We might have got on tolerably, notwithstanding, but for <pb n="40"/>two people --
                  Miss Cathy and Joseph the servant. You saw him, I dare say, up yonder. He was, and
                  is yet most likely, the wearisomest self-righteous Pharisee that ever ransacked a
                  Bible to rake the promises to himself and fling the curses to his neighbours. By
                  his knack of sermonizing and pious discoursing he contrived to make a great
                  impression on Mr. Earnshaw; and the more feeble the master became, the more
                  influence he gained.</p>
               <p>He was relentless in worrying him about his soul's concerns, and about ruling his
                  children rigidly. He encouraged him to regard Hindley as a reprobate; and night
                  after night he regularly grumbled out a long string of tales against Heathcliff
                  and Catherine, always minding to flatter Earnshaw's weakness by heaping the
                  heaviest blame on the latter. </p>
               <p>Certainly she had ways with her such as I never saw a child take up before; and
                  she put all of us past our patience fifty times and oftener in a day. From the
                  hour she came downstairs till the hour she went to bed we had not a minute's
                  security that she wouldn't be in mischief. Her spirits were always at high-water
                  mark, her tongue always going -- singing, laughing, and plaguing everybody who
                  would not do the same. A wild, wicked slip she was; but she had the bonniest eye,
                  the sweetest smile, and lightest foot in the parish. And, after all, I believe she
                  meant no harm; for when once she made you cry in good earnest, it seldom happened
                  that she would not keep you company, and oblige you to be quiet, that you might
                  comfort her. She was much too fond of Heathcliff. The greatest punishment we could
                  invent for her was to keep her separate from him; yet she got chided more than any
                  of us on his account. In play she liked exceedingly to act the little mistress,
                  using her hands freely, and commanding her companions. She did so to me, but I
                  would not bear shopping and ordering, and so I let her know. </p>
               <p>Now, Mr. Earnshaw did not understand jokes from his children. He had always been
                  strict and grave with them; and Catherine, on her part, had no idea why her father
                  should be crosser and less patient in his ailing condition than he was in his
                  prime. <pb n="41"/>His peevish reproofs wakened in her a naughty delight to
                  provoke him. She was never so happy as when we were all scolding her at once, and
                  she defying us with her bold, saucy look and her ready words, turning Joseph's
                  religious curses into ridicule, baiting me, and doing just what her father hated
                  most -- showing how her pretended insolence, which he thought real, had more power
                  over Heathcliff than his kindness; how the boy would do her bidding in anything,
                  and his only when it suited his own inclination. After behaving as badly as
                  possible all day, she sometimes came fondling to make it up at night. "Nay,
                  Cathy," the old man would say, "I cannot love thee; thou'rt worse than thy
                  brother. Go say thy prayers, child, and ask God's pardon. I doubt thy mother and I
                  must rue that we ever reared thee!" That made her cry at first; and then being
                  repulsed continually hardened her, and she laughed if I told her to say she was
                  sorry for her faults, and beg to be forgiven. </p>
               <p>But the hour came at last that ended Mr. Earnshaw's troubles on earth. He died
                  quietly in his chair one October evening, seated by the fireside. A high wind
                  blustered round the house and roared in the chimney. It sounded wild and stormy,
                  yet it was not cold, and we were all together -- I, a little removed from the
                  hearth, busy at my knitting, and Joseph reading his Bible near the table (for the
                  servants generally sat in the house then, after their work was done). Miss Cathy
                  had been sick, and that made her still. She leant against her father's knee, and
                  Heathcliff was lying on the floor with his head in her lap. </p>
               <p>I remember the master, before he fell into a doze, stroking her bonny hair -- it
                  pleased him rarely to see her gentle -- and saying -- </p>
               <p>"Why canst thou not always be a good lass, Cathy?" </p>
               <p>And she turned her face up to his, and laughed, and answered -- </p>
               <p>"Why cannot you always be a good man, father?" </p>
               <p>But as soon as she saw him vexed again, she kissed his hand, <pb n="42"/>and said
                  she would sing him to sleep. She began singing very low, till his fingers dropped
                  from hers, and his head sank on his breast. Then I told her to hush, and not stir,
                  for fear she should wake him. We all kept as mute as mice a full half-hour, and
                  should have done so longer, only Joseph, having finished his chapter, got up and
                  said that he must rouse the master for prayers and bed. He stepped forward, and
                  called him by name, and touched his shoulder, but he would not move -- so he took
                  the candle and looked at him. </p>
               <p>I thought there was something wrong as he set down the light; and seizing the
                  children each by an arm, whispered them to "frame upstairs, and make little din --
                  they might pray alone that evening -- he had summut to do." </p>
               <p>"I shall bid father good-night first," said Catherine, putting her arms round his
                  neck, before we could hinder her. </p>
               <p>The poor thing discovered her loss directly -- she screamed out -- </p>
               <p>"Oh, he's dead, Heathcliff! he's dead!" </p>
               <p>And they both set up a heart-breaking cry. </p>
               <p>I joined my wail to theirs, loud and bitter; but Joseph asked what we could be
                  thinking of to roar in that way over a saint in heaven. </p>
               <p>He told me to put on my cloak and run to Gimmerton for the doctor and the parson.
                  I could not guess the use that either would be of, then. However, I went, through
                  wind and rain, and brought one, the doctor, back with me; the other said he would
                  come in the morning. </p>
               <p>Leaving Joseph to explain matters, I ran to the children's room; their door was
                  ajar, I saw they had never laid down, though it was past midnight; but they were
                  calmer, and did not need me to console them. The little souls were comforting each
                  other with better thoughts than I could have hit on; no parson in the world ever
                  pictured heaven so beautifully as they did, in their innocent talk; and, while I
                  sobbed and listened, I could not help wishing we were all there safe together.

               <head>Chapter 1.6</head>
               <pb n="43"/>
               <p>Mr. Hindley came home to the funeral; and -- a thing that amazed us, and set the
                  neighbours gossiping right and left -- he brought a wife with him.</p>
               <p>What she was, and where she was born, he never informed us; probably, she had
                  neither money nor name to recommend her, or he would scarcely have kept the union
                  from his father.</p>
               <p>She was not one that would have disturbed the house much on her own account. Every
                  object she saw, the moment she crossed the threshold, appeared to delight her; and
                  every circumstance that took place about her, except the preparing for the burial,
                  and the presence of the mourners.</p>
               <p>I thought she was half silly, from her behaviour while that went on; she ran into
                  her chamber, and made me come with her, though I should have been dressing the
                  children; and there she sat shivering and clasping her hands, and asking
                  repeatedly -- </p>
               <p>"Are they gone yet ?"</p>
               <p>Then she began describing with hysterical emotion the effect it produced on her to
                  see black; and started, and trembled, and, at last, fell a weeping -- and when I
                  asked what was the matter ? answered, she didn't know; but she felt so afraid of
                  dying!</p>
               <p>I imagined her as little likely to die as myself. She was rather thin, but young,
                  and fresh complexioned, and her eyes sparkled as bright as diamonds. I did remark,
                  to be sure, that mounting the stairs made her breathe very quick, that the least
                  sudden noise set her all in a quiver, and that she coughed troublesomely
                  sometimes: but I knew nothing of what these symptoms portended, and had no impulse
                  to sympathize with her. We don't in general take to foreigners here, Mr. Lockwood,
                  unless they take to us first. </p>
               <p>Young Earnshaw was altered considerably in the three years of his absence. He had
                  grown sparer, and lost his colour, and <pb n="44"/>spoke and dressed quite
                  differently; and, on the very day of his return, he told Joseph and me we must
                  thenceforth quarter ourselves in the back-kitchen, and leave the house for him.
                  Indeed, he would have carpeted and papered a small spare room for a parlour; but
                  his wife expressed such pleasure at the white floor, and huge glowing fire-place,
                  at the pewter dishes, and delf-case, and dog-kennel, and the wide space there was
                  to move about in, where they usually sat, that he thought it unnecessary to her
                  comfort, and so dropped the intention. </p>
               <p>She expressed pleasure, too, at finding a sister among her new acquaintance, and
                  she prattled to Catherine and kissed her and ran about with her, and gave her
                  quantities of presents, at the beginning. Her affection tired very soon, however,
                  and when she grew peevish, Hindley became tyrannical. A few words from her,
                  evincing a dislike to Heathcliff, were enough to rouse in him all his old hatred
                  of the boy. He drove him from their company to the servants, deprived him of the
                  instructions of the curate and insisted that he should labour out of doors
                  instead, compelling him to do so, as hard as any other lad on the farm. </p>
               <p>Heathcliff bore his degradation pretty well at first, because Cathy taught him
                  what she learnt, and worked or played with him in the fields. They both promised
                  fair to grow up as rude as savages, the young master being entirely negligent how
                  they behaved, and what they did, so they kept clear of him. He would not even have
                  seen after their going to church on Sundays, only Joseph and the curate
                  reprimanded his carelessness when they absented themselves, and that reminded him
                  to order Heathcliff a flogging, and Catherine a fast from dinner or supper. </p>
               <p>But it was one of their chief amusements to run away to the moors in the morning
                  and remain there all day, and the after-punishment grew a mere thing to laugh at.
                  The curate might set as many chapters as he pleased for Catherine to get by heart,
                  and Joseph might thrash Heathcliff till his arm ached; they forgot everything the
                  minute they were together again, at least the minute they contrived some naughty
                  plan of revenge; and many a time I've cried to myself to watch them growing more
                     <pb n="45"/>reckless daily, and I not daring to speak a syllable for fear of
                  losing the small power I still retained over the unfriended creatures. </p>
               <p>One Sunday evening, it chanced that they were banished from the sitting-room, for
                  making a noise, or a light offence of the kind, and when I went to call them to
                  supper, I could discover them nowhere. </p>
               <p>We searched the house, above and below, and the yard and stables; they were
                  invisible; and, at last, Hindley in a passion told us to bolt the doors, and swore
                  nobody should let them in that night. </p>
               <p>The household went to bed; and I, too anxious to lie down, opened my lattice and
                  put my head out to hearken, though it rained, determined to admit them in spite of
                  the prohibition, should they return. </p>
               <p>In a while, I distinguished steps coming up the road, and the light of a lantern
                  glimmered through the gate. </p>
               <p>I threw a shawl over my head and ran to prevent them from waking Mr. Earnshaw by
                  knocking. There was Heathcliff, by himself; it gave me a start to see him alone. </p>
               <p>"Where is Miss Catherine?" I cried hurriedly. "No accident, I hope?" </p>
               <p>"At Thrushcross Grange," he answered, "and I would have been there too, but they
                  had not the manners to ask me to stay." </p>
               <p>"Well, you will catch it!" I said, "you'll never be content will you're sent about
                  your business. What in the world led you wandering to Thrushcross Grange?" </p>
               <p>"Let me get off my wet clothes, and I'll tell you all about it, Nelly," he
                  replied. </p>
               <p>I bid him beware of rousing the master, and while he undressed, and I waited to
                  put out the candle, he continued -- </p>
               <p>"Cathy and I escaped from the wash-house to have a ramble at liberty, and getting
                  a glimpse of the Grange lights, we thought we would just go and see whether the
                  Lintons passed their Sunday evenings standing shivering in corners, while their
                  father and <pb n="46"/>mother sat eating and drinking, and singing and laughing,
                  and burning their eyes out before the fire. Do you think they do? Or reading
                  sermons, and being catechised by their man-servant, and set to learn a column of
                  Scripture names, if they don't answer properly?" </p>
               <p>"Probably not," I responded. "They are good children, no doubt, and don't deserve
                  the treatment you receive, for your bad conduct." </p>
               <p>"Don't you cant, Nelly" he said. "Nonsense! We ran from the top of the Heights to
                  the park, without stopping -- Catherine completely beaten in the race, because she
                  was barefoot. You'll have to seek for her shoes in the bog to-morrow. We crept
                  through a broken hedge, groped our way up the path, and planted ourselves on a
                  flower-plot under the drawing-room window. The light came from thence; they had
                  not put up the shutters, and the curtains were only half closed. Both of us were
                  able to look in by standing on the basement, and clinging to the ledge, and we saw
                  -- ah! it was beautiful -- a splendid place carpeted with crimson, and
                  crimson-covered chairs and tables, and a pure white ceiling bordered by gold, a
                  shower of glass-drops hanging in silver chains from the centre, and shimmering
                  with little soft tapers. Old Mr. and Mrs. Linton were not there. Edgar and his
                  sister had it entirely to themselves; shouldn't they have been happy? We should
                  have thought ourselves in heaven! And new, guess what your good children were
                  doing? Isabella -- I believe she is eleven, a year younger than Cathy -- lay
                  screaming at the farther end of the room, shrieking as if witches were running red
                  hot needles into her. Edgar stood on the hearth weeping silently, and in the
                  middle of the table sat a little dog shaking its paw and yelping, which from their
                  mutual accusations, we understood they had nearly pulled in two between them. The
                  idiots! That was their pleasure -- to quarrel who should hold a heap of warm hair,
                  and each begin to cry because both, after struggling to get it, refused to take
                  it. We laughed outright at the petted things. We did despise them. When would you
                  catch me wishing to have what Catherine wanted, or find us by ourselves seeking
                  entertainment in <pb n="47"/>yelling, and sobbing, and rolling on the ground,
                  divided by the whole room? I'd not exchange for a thousand lives my condition here
                  for Edgar Linton's at Thrushcross Grange -- not if I might have the privilege of
                  flinging Joseph off the highest gable, and painting the house-front with Hindley's
                  blood!" </p>
               <p>"Hush, hush!" I interrupted. "Still you have not told me, Heathcliff, how
                  Catherine is left behind." </p>
               <p>"I told you we laughed," he answered. "The Lintons heard us, and with one accord
                  they shot like arrows to the door. There was silence, and then a cry, 'O mamma,
                  mamma! O papa! O mamma, come here. O papa, oh!' They really did howl out something
                  in that way. We made frightful noises to terrify them still more, and then we
                  dropped off the ledge because somebody was drawing the bars, and we felt we had
                  better flee. I had Cathy by the hand, and was urging her on, when all at once she
                  fell down. 'Run, Heathcliff, run!' she whispered. 'They have let the bull-dog
                  loose, and he holds me!' The devil had seized her ankle, Nelly; I heard his
                  abominable snorting. She did not yell out -- no! she would have scorned to do it
                  if she had been spitted on the horns of a mad cow. I did, though. I vociferated
                  curses enough to annihilate any fiend in Christendom; and I got a stone and thrust
                  it between his jaws, and tried with all my might to cram it down his throat. A
                  beast of a servant came up with a lantern at last, shouting, 'Keep fast, Skulker,
                  keep fast!' He changed his note, however, when he saw Skulker's game. The dog was
                  throttled off, his huge purple tongue hanging half a foot out of his mouth, and
                  his pendent lips streaming with bloody slaver. The man took Cathy up. She was sick
                  -- not from fear, I'm certain, but from pain. He carried her in. I followed,
                  grumbling execrations and vengeance. 'What prey, Robert?' hallooed Linton from the
                  entrance. 'Skulker has caught a little girl, sir,' he replied; 'and there's a lad
                  here,' he added, making a clutch at me, 'who looks an out-and-outer. Very like,
                  the robbers were for putting them through <pb n="48"/>the window to open the doors
                  to the gang after all were asleep, that they might murder us at their ease -- Hold
                  your tongue, you foul-mouthed thief, you! You shall go to the gallows for this --
                  Mr. Linton, sir, don't lay by your gun.' 'No, no, Robert,' said the old fool. 'The
                  rascals knew that yesterday was my rent-day. They thought to have me cleverly.
                  Come in; I'll furnish them a reception. -- There, John, fasten the chain -- Give
                  Skulker some water, Jenny. To beard a magistrate in his stronghold, and on the
                  Sabbath, too! Where will their insolence stop? -- Oh, my dear Mary, look here!
                  Don't be afraid; it is but a boy, yet the villain scowls so plainly in his face;
                  would it not be a kindness to the country to hang him at once, before he shows his
                  nature in acts as well as features?' He pulled me under the chandelier, and Mrs.
                  Linton placed her spectacles on her nose and raised her hands in horror. The
                  cowardly children crept nearer also, Isabella lisping, 'Frightful thing! Put him
                  in the cellar, papa. He's exactly like the son of the fortune-teller that stole my
                  tame pheasant. -- Isn't he, Edgar?'</p>
               <p>"While they examined me Cathy came round. She heard the last speech, and laughed.
                  Edgar Linton, after an inquisitive stare, collected sufficient wit to recognize
                  her. They see us at church, you know, though we seldom meet them elsewhere.
                  'That's Miss Earnshaw!' he whispered to his mother; 'and look how Skulker has
                  bitten her -- how her foot bleeds!' </p>
               <p>" 'Miss Earnshaw! Nonsense!' cried the dame; 'Miss Earnshaw scouring the country
                  with a gipsy! And yet, my dear, the child is in mourning. Surely it is. And she
                  may be lamed for life.' </p>
               <p>" 'What culpable carelessness in her brother!' exclaimed Mr. Linton, turning from
                  me to Catherine. 'I've understood from Shielders' " (that was the curate, sir) "
                  'that he lets her grow up in absolute heathenism. But who is this? Where did she
                  pick up this companion? Oho! I declare he is that strange acquisition my late
                  neighbour made in his journey to Liverpool -- a little Lascar, or an American or
                  Spanish castaway.' </p>
               <pb n="49"/>
               <p>" 'A wicked boy, at all events,' remarked the old lady, 'and quite unfit for a
                  decent house! Did you notice his language, Linton? I'm shocked that my children
                  should have heard it.' </p>
               <p>"I recommenced cursing -- don't be angry, Nelly -- and so Robert was ordered to
                  take me off. I refused to go without Cathy. He dragged me into the garden, pushed
                  the lantern into my hand, assured me that Mr. Earnshaw should be informed of my
                  behaviour, and bidding me march directly, secured the door again. The curtains
                  were still looped up at one corner, and I resumed my station as spy; because, if
                  Catherine had wished to return, I intended shattering their great glass panes to a
                  million of fragments, unless they let her out. She sat on the sofa quietly. Mrs.
                  Linton took off the gray cloak of the dairymaid which we had borrowed for our
                  excursion, shaking her head and expostulating with her, I suppose. She was a young
                  lady, and they made a distinction between her treatment and mine. Then the
                  woman-servant brought a basin of warm water, and washed her feet; and Mr. Linton
                  mixed a tumbler of negus, and Isabella emptied a plateful of cakes into her lap,
                  and Edgar stood gaping at a distance. Afterwards they dried and combed her
                  beautiful hair, and gave her a pair of enormous slippers, and wheeled her to the
                  fire; and I left her, as merry as she could be, dividing her food between the
                  little dog and Skulker, whose nose she pinched as he ate, and kindling a spark of
                  spirit in the vacant blue eyes of the Lintons -- a dim reflection from her own
                  enchanting face. I saw they were full of stupid admiration; she is so immeasurably
                  superior to them -- to everybody on earth, is she not, Nelly?" </p>
               <p>"There will more come of this business than you reckon on," I answered, covering
                  him up and extinguishing the light. "You are incurable, Heathcliff; and Mr.
                  Hindley will have to proceed to extremities -- see if he won't." </p>
               <p>My words came truer than I desired. The luckless adventure made Earnshaw furious.
                  And then Mr. Linton, to mend matters, <pb n="50"/>paid us a visit himself on the
                  morrow, and read the young master such a lecture on the road he guided his family
                  that he was stirred to look about him in earnest.</p>
               <p>Heathcliff received no flogging, but he was told that the first word he spoke to
                  Miss Catherine should ensure a dismissal; and Mrs. Earnshaw undertook to keep her
                  sister-in-law in due restraint when she returned home, employing art, not force.
                  With force she would have found it impossible. </p>

               <p>Cathy stayed at Thrushcross Grange five weeks, till Christmas. By that time her
                  ankle was thoroughly cured, and her manners much improved. The mistress visited
                  her often, in the interval, and commenced her plan of reform by trying to raise
                  her self-respect with fine clothes and flattery, which she took readily: so that,
                  instead of a wild, hatless little savage jumping into the house, and rushing to
                  squeeze us all breathless, there lighted from a handsome black pony a very
                  dignified person, with brown ringlets falling from the cover of a feathered
                  beaver, and a long cloth habit which she was obliged to hold up with both hands
                  that she might sail in.</p>
               <p>Hindley lifted her from her horse, exclaiming delightedly,</p>
               <p>"Why, Cathy, you are quite a beauty! I should scarcely have known you -- you look
                  like a lady now -- Isabella Linton is not to be compared with her, is she, Frances
                  ?"</p>
               <p>"Isabella has not her natural advantages," replied his wife, "but she must mind
                  and not grow wild again here. Ellen, help Miss Catherine off with her things --
                  Stay, dear, you will disarrange your curls -- let me untie your hat."</p>
               <p>I removed the habit, and there shone forth beneath, a grand plaid silk frock,
                  white trousers, and burnished shoes; and, while her eyes sparkled joyfully when
                  the dogs came bounding up to welcome her, she dare hardly touch them lest they
                  should fawn upon her splendid garments.</p>
               <p>She kissed me gently -- I was all flour making the Christmas cake, and it would
                  not have done to give me a hug; and then she looked round for Heathcliff. Mr. and
                  Mrs. Earnshaw watched anxiously their meeting, thinking it would enable them to
                  judge, in some measure, what grounds they had for hoping to succeed in separating
                  the two friends. </p>
               <p>Heathcliff was hard to discover at first. If he were careless <pb n="52"/>and
                  uncared for before Catherine's absence, he had been ten times more so since.
                  Nobody but I even did him the kindness to call him a dirty boy, and bid him wash
                  himself, once a week; and children of his age seldom have a natural pleasure in
                  soap and water. Therefore, not to mention his clothes, which had seen three
                  months' service in mire and dust, and his thick uncombed hair, the surface of his
                  face and hands was dismally beclouded. He might well skulk behind the settle, on
                  beholding such a bright, graceful damsel enter the house, instead of a
                  rough-headed counterpart of himself, as he expected. "Is Heathcliff not here?" she
                  demanded, pulling off her gloves, and displaying fingers wonderfully whitened with
                  doing nothing and staying indoors. </p>
               <p>"Heathcliff, you may come forward," cried Mr. Hindley, enjoying his discomfiture,
                  and gratified to see what a forbidding young blackguard he would be compelled to
                  present himself. "You may come and wish Miss Catherine welcome, like the other
                  servants." </p>
               <p>Cathy, catching a glimpse of her friend in his concealment, flew to embrace him.
                  She bestowed seven or eight kisses on his cheek within the second, and then
                  stopped, and drawing back, burst into a laugh, exclaiming, "Why, how very black
                  and cross you look! and how -- how funny and grim! But that's because I'm used to
                  Edgar and Isabella Linton. Well, Heathcliff, have you forgotten me?" </p>
               <p>She had some reason to put the question, for shame and pride threw double gloom
                  over his countenance, and kept him immovable. </p>
               <p>"Shake hands, Heathcliff," said Mr. Earnshaw, condescendingly; "once in away that
                  is permitted." </p>
               <p>"I shall not," replied the boy, finding his tongue at last; "I shall not stand to
                  be laughed at. I shall not bear it." </p>
               <p>And he would have broken from the circle, but Miss Cathy seized him again. </p>
               <p>"I did not mean to laugh at you," she said; "I could not hinder <pb n="53"
                  />myself. Heathcliff, shake hands at least. What are you sulky for? It was only
                  that you looked odd. If you wash your face and brush your hair it will be all
                  right; but you are so dirty!" </p>
               <p>She gazed concernedly at the dusky fingers she held in her own, and also at her
                  dress, which she feared had gained no embellishment from its contact with his. </p>
               <p>"You needn't have touched me," he answered, following her eye and snatching away
                  his hand. "I shall be as dirty as I please; and I like to be dirty, and I will be
                  dirty." </p>
               <p>With that he dashed head foremost out of the room, amid the merriment of the
                  master and mistress, and to the serious disturbance of Catherine, who could not
                  comprehend how her remarks should have produced such an exhibition of bad temper. </p>
               <p>After playing lady's-maid to the newcomer, and putting my cakes in the oven, and
                  making the house and kitchen cheerful with great fires, befitting Christmas Eve, I
                  prepared to sit down and amuse myself by singing carols all alone, regardless of
                  Joseph's affirmations that he considered the merry tunes I chose as next door to
                  songs. He had retired to private prayer in his chamber, and Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw
                  were engaging Missy's attention by sundry gay trifles bought for her to present to
                  the little Lintons, as an acknowledgment of their kindness. They had invited them
                  to spend the morrow at Wuthering Heights, and the invitation had been accepted, on
                  one condition. Mrs. Linton begged that her darlings might be kept carefully apart
                  from that "naughty, swearing boy." </p>
               <p>Under these circumstances I remained solitary. I smelt the rich scent of the
                  heating spices, and admired the shining kitchen utensils, the polished clock,
                  decked in holly, the silver mugs ranged on a tray ready to be filled with mulled
                  ale for supper, and, above all, the speckless purity of my particular care -- the
                  scoured and well-swept floor. I gave due inward applause to every object, and then
                  I remembered how old Earnshaw used to come in when all was <pb n="54"/>tidied, and
                  call me a cant lass, and slip a shilling into my hand as a Christmas-box; and from
                  that I went on to think of his fondness for Heathcliff, and his dread lest he
                  should suffer neglect after death had removed him; and that naturally led me to
                  consider the poor lad's situation now, and from singing I changed my mind to
                  crying. It struck me soon, however, there would be more sense in endeavouring to
                  repair some of his wrongs than shedding tears over them. I got up and walked into
                  the court to seek him. He was not far. I found him smoothing the glossy coat of
                  the new pony in the stable, and feeding the other beasts, according to custom. </p>
               <p>"Make haste, Heathcliff!" I said; "the kitchen is so comfortable, and Joseph is
                  upstairs. Make haste, and let me dress you smart before Miss Cathy comes out, and
                  then you can sit together, with the whole hearth to yourselves, and have a long
                  chatter till bedtime." </p>
               <p>He proceeded with his task, and never turned his head towards me. </p>
               <p>"Come; are you coming?" I continued. "There's a little cake for each of you,
                  nearly enough; and you'll need half an hour's donning."' </p>
               <p>I waited five minutes, but getting no answer left him. Catherine supped with her
                  brother and sister-in-law. Joseph and I joined at an unsociable meal, seasoned
                  with reproofs on one side and sauciness on the other. His cake and cheese remained
                  on the table all night for the fairies. He managed to continue work till nine
                  o'clock, and then marched dumb and dour to his chamber. Cathy sat up late, having
                  a world of things to order for the reception of her new friends. She came into the
                  kitchen once to speak to her old one; but he was gone, and she only stayed to ask
                  what was the matter with him, and then went back. In the morning he rose early;
                  and as it was a holiday carried his ill-humour on to the moors, not reappearing
                  till the family <pb n="55"/> were departed for church. Fasting and reflection
                  seemed to have brought him to a better spirit. He hung about me for a while, and
                  having screwed up his courage, exclaimed abruptly, -- </p>
               <p>"Nelly, make me decent; I'm going to be good." </p>
               <p>"High time, Heathcliff," I said; "you have grieved Catherine. She's sorry she ever
                  came home, I dare say. It looks as if you envied her because she is more thought
                  of than you." </p>
               <p>The notion of envying Catherine was incomprehensible to him, but the notion of
                  grieving her he understood clearly enough. </p>
               <p>"Did she say she was grieved?" he inquired, looking very serious. </p>
               <p>"She cried when I told her you were off again this morning." </p>
               <p>"Well, I cried last night," he returned, "and I had more reason to cry than she." </p>
               <p>"Yes. You had the reason of going to bed with a proud heart and an empty stomach,"
                  said I. "Proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves. But, if you be ashamed of
                  your touchiness, you must ask pardon, mind, when she comes in. You must go up and
                  offer to kiss her, and say -- you know best what to say; only do it heartily, and
                  not as if you thought her converted into a stranger by her grand dress. And now,
                  though I have dinner to get ready, I'll steal time to arrange you so that Edgar
                  Linton shall look quite a doll beside you; and that he does. You are younger, and
                  yet, I'll be bound, you are taller and twice as broad across the shoulders. You
                  could knock him down in a twinkling. Don't you feel that you could?" </p>
               <p>Heathcliff's face brightened a moment; then it was overcast afresh, and he sighed. </p>
               <p>"But, Nelly, if I knocked him down twenty times, that wouldn't make him less
                  handsome or me more so. I wish I had light hair and a fair skin, and was dressed
                  and behaved as well, and had a chance of being as rich as he will be." </p>
               <p>"And cried for mamma at every turn," I added, "and trembled if a country lad
                  heaved his fist against you, and sat at home all day for a shower of rain. Oh,
                  Heathcliff, you are showing <pb n="56"/>a poor spirit! Come to the glass, and I'll
                  let you see what you should wish. Do you mark those two lines between your eyes;
                  and those thick brows that, instead of rising arched, sink in the middle; and that
                  couple of black fiends, so deeply buried, who never open their windows boldly, but
                  lurk glinting under them, like devil's spies? Wish and learn to smooth away the
                  surly wrinkles, to raise your lids frankly, and change the fiends to confident,
                  innocent angels, suspecting and doubting nothing, and always seeing friends where
                  they are not sure of foes. Don't get the expression of a vicious cur that appears
                  to know the kicks it gets are its desert, and yet hates all the world as well as
                  the kicker for what it suffers." </p>
               <p>"In other words, I must wish for Edgar Linton's great blue eyes and even
                  forehead," he replied. "I do, and that won't help me to them." </p>
               <p>"A good heart will help you to a bonny face, my lad," I continued, "if you were a
                  regular black; and a bad one will turn the bonniest into something worse than
                  ugly. And now that we've done washing, and combing, and sulking, tell me whether
                  you don't think yourself rather handsome? I'll tell you I do. You're fit for a
                  prince in disguise. Who knows but your father was Emperor of China, and your
                  mother an Indian queen, each of them able to buy up, with one week's income,
                  Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange together? And you were kidnapped by
                  wicked sailors and brought to England. Were I in your place, I would frame high
                  notions of my birth; and the thoughts of what I was should give me courage and
                  dignity to support the oppressions of a little farmer." </p>
               <p>So I chattered on; and Heathcliff gradually lost his frown and began to look quite
                  pleasant, when all at once our conversation was interrupted by a rumbling sound
                  moving up the road and entering the court. He ran to the window and I to the door,
                  just in time to behold the two Lintons descend from the family carriage, smothered
                  in cloaks and furs, and the Earnshaws dismount from their horses. They often rode
                  to church in winter. Catherine took a hand of each of the children, and brought
                  them into the house and set them before the fire, which quickly put colour into
                  their white faces. </p>
               <pb n="57"/>
               <p>I urged my companion to hasten now and show his amiable humour, and he willingly
                  obeyed; but ill luck would have it that, as he opened the door leading from the
                  kitchen on one side, Hindley opened it on the other. They met, and the master,
                  irritated at seeing him clean and cheerful, or, perhaps, eager to keep his promise
                  to Mrs. Linton, shoved him back with a sudden thrust, and angrily bade Joseph
                  "keep the fellow out of the room; send him into the garret till dinner is over.
                  He'll be cramming his fingers in the tarts and stealing the fruit, if left alone
                  with them a minute." </p>
               <p>"Nay, sir," I could not avoid answering; "he'll touch nothing -- not he; and I
                  suppose he must have his share of the dainties as well as we." </p>
               <p>"He shall have his share of my hand if I catch him downstairs till dark," cried
                  Hindley -- "Begone, you vagabond! What! you are attempting the coxcomb, are you?
                  Wait till I get hold of those elegant locks; see if I won't pull them a bit
                  longer." </p>
               <p>"They are long enough already," observed Master Linton, peeping from the doorway;
                  "I wonder they don't make his head ache. It's like a colt's mane over his eyes." </p>
               <p>He ventured this remark without any intention to insult; but Heathcliff's violent
                  nature was not prepared to endure the appearance of impertinence from one whom he
                  seemed to hate, even then, as a rival. He seized a tureen of hot apple sauce --
                  the first thing that came under his gripe -- and dashed it full against the
                  speaker's face and neck, who instantly commenced a lament that brought Isabella
                  and Catherine hurrying to the place. Mr. Earnshaw snatched up the culprit
                  directly, and conveyed him to his chamber, where, doubtless, he administered a
                  rough remedy to cool the fit of passion, for he appeared red and breathless. I got
                  the dish-cloth, and rather spitefully scrubbed Edgar's nose and mouth, affirming
                  it served him right for meddling. His sister began weeping to go home, and Cathy
                  stood by confounded, blushing for all. </p>
               <p>"You should not have spoken to him!" she expostulated with <pb n="58"/>Master
                  Linton. "He was in a bad temper; and now you've spoilt your visit, and he'll be
                  flogged. I hate him to be flogged. I can't eat my dinner. Why did you speak to
                  him, Edgar?" </p>
               <p>"I didn't," sobbed the youth, escaping from my hands and finishing the remainder
                  of the purification with his cambric pocket-handkerchief. "I promised mamma that I
                  wouldn't say one word to him, and I didn't." </p>
               <p>"Well, don't cry," replied Catherine contemptuously; "you're not killed. Don't
                  make more mischief. My brother is coming; be quiet! -- Hush, Isabella! Has anybody
                  hurt you?" </p>
               <p>"There, there, children; to your seats," cried Hindley, bustling in. "That brute
                  of a lad has warmed me nicely. Next time, Master Edgar, take the law into your own
                  fists; it will give you an appetite." </p>
               <p>The little party recovered its equanimity at sight of the fragrant feast. They
                  were hungry after their ride, and easily consoled, since no real harm had befallen
                  them. Mr. Earnshaw carved bountiful platefuls, and the mistress made them merry
                  with lively talk. I waited behind her chair, and was pained to behold Catherine,
                  with dry eyes and an indifferent air, commence cutting up the wing of a goose
                  before her. "An unfeeling child," I thought to myself; "how lightly she dismisses
                  her old playmate's troubles! I could not have imagined her to be so selfish." She
                  lifted a mouthful to her lips, then she set it down again; her cheeks flushed, and
                  the tears gushed over them. She slipped her fork to the floor, and hastily dived
                  under the cloth to conceal her emotion. I did not call her unfeeling long, for I
                  perceived she was in purgatory throughout the day, and wearying to find an
                  opportunity of getting by herself, or paying a visit to Heathcliff, who had been
                  locked up by the master, as I discovered, on endeavouring to introduce to him a
                  private mess of victuals. </p>
               <p>In the evening we had a dance. Cathy begged that he might be liberated then, as
                  Isabella Linton had no partner. Her entreaties were vain, and I was appointed to
                  supply the deficiency. We got rid of all gloom in the excitement of the exercise,
                  and <pb n="59"/>our pleasure was increased by the arrival of the Gimmerton band,
                  mustering fifteen strong -- a trumpet, a trombone, clarionets, bassoons, French
                  horns, and a bass viol, besides singers. They go the rounds of all the respectable
                  houses, and receive contributions every Christmas, and we esteemed it a first-rate
                  treat to hear them. After the usual carols had been sung, we set them to songs and
                  glees. Mrs. Earnshaw loved the music, and so they gave us plenty. </p>
               <p>Catherine loved it too, but she said it sounded sweetest at the top of the steps,
                  and she went up in the dark; I followed. They shut the house door below, never
                  noting our absence, it was so full of people. She made no stay at the stairs'
                  head, but mounted farther to the garret where Heathcliff was confined, and called
                  him. He stubbornly declined answering for a while; she persevered, and finally
                  persuaded him to hold communion with her through the boards. I let the poor things
                  converse unmolested, till I supposed the songs were going to cease, and the
                  singers to get some refreshment; then I clambered up the ladder to warn her.
                  Instead of finding her outside, I heard her voice within. The little monkey had
                  crept by the skylight of one garret, along the roof, into the skylight of the
                  other, and it was with the utmost difficulty I could coax her out again. When she
                  did come, Heathcliff came with her, and she insisted that I should take him into
                  the kitchen, as my fellow-servant had gone to a neighbour's to be removed from the
                  sound of our "devil's psalmody," as it pleased him to call it. I told them I
                  intended by no means to encourage their tricks, but as the prisoner had never
                  broken his fast since yesterday's dinner, I would wink at his cheating Mr. Hindley
                  that once. He went down. I set him a stool by the fire, and offered him a quantity
                  of good things; but he was sick, and could eat little, and my attempts to
                  entertain him were thrown away. He leant his two elbows on his knees, and his chin
                  on his hands, and remained wrapt in dumb meditation. On my inquiring the subject
                  of his thoughts he answered gravely, -- </p>
               <pb n="60"/>
               <p>"I'm trying to settle how I shall pay Hindley back. I don't care how long I wait,
                  if I can only do it at last. I hope he will not die before I do!" </p>
               <p>"For shame, Heathcliff!" said I "It is for God to punish wicked people; we should
                  learn to forgive." </p>
               <p>"No; God won't have the satisfaction that I shall," he returned. "I only wish I
                  knew the best way. Let me alone, and I'll plan it out; while I'm thinking of that
                  I don't feel pain." </p>
               <p>But, Mr. Lockwood, I forget these tales cannot divert you. I'm annoyed how I
                  should dream of chattering on at such a rate, and your gruel cold, and you nodding
                  for bed! I could have told Heathcliff's history -- all that you need hear -- in
                  half a dozen words. </p>
               <p>Thus interrupting herself, the housekeeper rose and proceeded to lay aside her
                  sewing; but I felt incapable of moving from the hearth, and I was very far from
                  nodding. "Sit still, Mrs. Dean," I cried, "do sit still another half-hour! You've
                  done just right to tell the story leisurely -- that is the method I like; and you
                  must finish it in the same style. I am interested in every character you have
                  mentioned, more or less." </p>
               <p>"The clock is on the stroke of eleven, sir." </p>
               <p>"No matter. I'm not accustomed to go to bed in the long hours. One or two is early
                  enough for a person who lies till ten." </p>
               <p>"You shouldn't lie till ten. There's the very prime of the morning gone long
                  before that time. A person who has not done one half his day's work by ten o'clock
                  runs a chance of leaving the other half undone." </p>
               <p>"Nevertheless, Mrs. Dean, resume your chair, because to-morrow I intend
                  lengthening the night till afternoon. I prognosticate for myself an obstinate
                  cold, at least." </p>
               <p>"I hope not, sir. Well, you must allow me to leap over some three years. During
                  that space Mrs. Earnshaw -- " </p>
               <p>"No, no; I'll allow nothing of the sort. Are you acquainted with the mood of mind
                  in which, if you were seated alone, and the cat licking its kitten on the rug
                  before you, you would watch the operation so intently that puss's neglect of one
                  ear would put you seriously out of temper?" </p>
               <pb n="61"/>
               <p>"A terribly lazy mood, I should say." </p>
               <p>"On the contrary, a tiresomely active one. It is mine at present; and, therefore,
                  continue minutely. I perceive that people in these regions acquire over people in
                  towns the value that a spider in a dungeon does over a spider in a cottage, to
                  their various occupants; and yet the deepened attraction is not entirely owing to
                  the situation of the looker-on. They do live more in earnest, more in themselves,
                  and less in surface, change, and frivolous external things. I could fancy a love
                  for life here almost possible; and I was a fixed unbeliever in any love of a
                  year's standing. One state resembles setting a hungry man down to a single dish,
                  on which he may concentrate his entire appetite and do it justice; the other,
                  introducing him to a table laid out by French cooks. He can perhaps extract as
                  much enjoyment from the whole, but each part is a mere atom in his regard and
                  remembrance." </p>
               <p>"Oh, here we are the same as anywhere else, when you get to know us," observed
                  Mrs. Dean, somewhat puzzled at my speech. </p>
               <p>"Excuse me," I responded. "You, my good friend, are a striking evidence against
                  that assertion. Excepting a few provincialisms of slight consequence, you have no
                  marks of the manners which I am habituated to consider as peculiar to your class.
                  I am sure you have thought a great deal more than the generality of servants
                  think. You have been compelled to cultivate your reflective faculties, for want of
                  occasions for frittering your life away in silly trifles." </p>
               <p>Mrs. Dean laughed.</p>
               <p/>
               <p>"I certainly esteem myself a steady, reasonable kind of body," she said -- "not
                  exactly from living among the hills and seeing one set of faces and one series of
                  actions from year's end to year's end, but I have undergone sharp discipline,
                  which has taught me wisdom; and then, I have read more than you would fancy, Mr.
                  Lockwood. You could not open a book in this library that I have not looked into,
                  and got something out of also -- unless it be that range of Greek and Latin, and
                  that of French; and those I know one from another. It is as much as you can expect
                  of a poor man's daughter. However, if I am to follow my story in true gossip's
                  fashion, <pb n="62"/>I had better go on; and instead of leaping three years, I
                  will be content to pass to the next summer -- the summer of 1778; that is nearly
                  twenty-three years ago." </p>

               <p>On the morning of a fine June day, my first bonny little nursling, and the last of
                  the ancient Earnshaw stock, was born.</p>
               <p>We were busy with the hay in a far away field, when the girl that usually brought
                  our breakfasts came running, an hour too soon, across the meadow and up the lane,
                  calling me as she ran.</p>
               <p>"Oh, such a grand bairn!" she panted out. "The finest lad that ever breathed! But
                  the doctor says missis must go; he says she's been in a consumption these many
                  months. I heard him tell Mr. Hindley -- and now she has nothing to keep her, and
                  she'll be dead before winter. You must come home directly. You're to nurse it,
                  Nelly -- to feed it with sugar and milk, and take care of it, day and night -- I
                  wish I were you, because it will be all yours when there is no missis!"</p>
               <p>"But is she very ill?" I asked, flinging down my rake, and tying my bonnet.</p>
               <p>"I guess she is; yet she looks bravely," replied the girl, "and she talks as if
                  she thought of living to see it grow a man. She's out of her head for joy, it's
                  such a beauty ! If I were her I'm certain I should not die. I should get better at
                  the bare-sight of it, in spite of Kenneth. I was fairly mad at him. Dame Archer
                  brought the cherub down to master, in the house, and his face just began to light
                  up, then the old croaker steps forward, and, says he: -- 'Earnshaw, it's a
                  blessing your wife has been spared to leave you this son. When she came, I felt
                  convinced we shouldn't keep her long; and now, I must tell you, the winter will
                  probably finish her. Don't take on and fret about it too much. It can't be helped.
                  And besides, you should have known better than to choose such a rush of a lass!'" </p>
               <p>"And what did the master answer?" I inquired. </p>
               <p>"I think he swore; but I didn't mind him -- I was straining to see the bairn." And
                  she began again to describe it rapturously. <pb n="64"/>I, as zealous as herself,
                  hurried eagerly home to admire, on my part, though I was very sad for Hindley's
                  sake. He had room in his heart only for two idols -- his wife and himself. He
                  doted on both, and adored one, and I couldn't conceive how he would bear the loss. </p>
               <p>When we got to Wuthering Heights, there he stood at the front door; and, as I
                  passed in, I asked, "How was the baby?" </p>
               <p>"Nearly ready to run about, Nell!" he replied, putting on a cheerful smile. </p>
               <p>"And the mistress?" I ventured to inquire; "the doctor says she's -- " </p>
               <p>"Damn the doctor!" he interrupted, reddening. "Frances is quite right; she'll be
                  perfectly well by this time next week. Are you going upstairs? Will you tell her
                  that I'll come, if she'll promise not to talk. I left her because she would not
                  hold her tongue; and she must. Tell her Mr. Kenneth says she must be quiet." </p>
               <p>I delivered this message to Mrs. Earnshaw. She seemed in flighty spirits, and
                  replied merrily, -- </p>
               <p>"I hardly spoke a word, Ellen, and there he has gone out twice, crying. Well, say
                  I promise I won't speak; but that does not bind me not to laugh at him." </p>
               <p>Poor soul! Till within a week of her death that gay heart never failed her, and
                  her husband persisted doggedly -- nay, furiously -- in affirming her health
                  improved every day. When Kenneth warned him that his medicines were useless at
                  that stage of the malady, and he needn't put him to further expense by attending
                  her, he retorted, -- </p>
               <p>"I know you need not; she's well -- she does not want any more attendance from
                  you! She never was in a consumption. It was a fever, and it is gone; her pulse is
                  as slow as mine now, and her cheek as cool." </p>
               <p>He told his wife the same story, and she seemed to believe him; but one night,
                  while leaning on his shoulder in the act of saying she thought she should be able
                  to get up to-morrow, a fit of coughing took her -- a very slight one. He raised
                  her in his arms; <pb n="65"/>she put her two hands about his neck, her face
                  changed, and she was dead. </p>
               <p>As the girl had anticipated, the child Hareton fell wholly into my hands. Mr.
                  Earnshaw, provided he saw him healthy, and never heard him cry, was contented, as
                  far as regarded him. For himself, he grew desperate; his sorrow was of that kind
                  that will not lament. He neither wept nor prayed; he cursed and defied --
                  execrated God and man, and gave himself up to reckless dissipation. The servants
                  could not bear his tyrannical and evil conduct long. Joseph and I were the only
                  two that would stay. I had not the heart to leave my charge; and besides, you know
                  I had been his foster-sister, and excused his behaviour more readily than a
                  stranger would. Joseph remained to hector over tenants and labourers, and because
                  it was his vocation to be where he had plenty of wickedness to reprove. </p>
               <p>The master's bad ways and bad companions formed a pretty example for Catherine and
                  Heathcliff. His treatment of the latter was enough to make a fiend of a saint.
                  And, truly, it appeared as if the lad were possessed of something diabolical at
                  that period. He delighted to witness Hindley degrading himself past redemption,
                  and became daily more notable for savage sullenness and ferocity. I could not half
                  tell what an infernal house we had. The curate dropped calling, and nobody decent
                  came near us at last, unless Edgar Linton's visits to Miss Cathy might be an
                  exception. At fifteen she was the queen of the countryside; she had no peer, and
                  she did turn out a haughty, headstrong creature! I own I did not like her after
                  her infancy was past, and I vexed her frequently by trying to bring down her
                  arrogance; she never took an aversion to me, though. She had a wondrous constancy
                  to old attachments -- even Heathcliff kept his hold on her affections unalterably;
                  and young Linton, with all his superiority, found it difficult to make an equally
                  deep impression. He was my late master; that is his portrait over the fireplace.
                  It used to hang on one side, and his wife's on the other; but hers <pb n="66"/>has
                  been removed, or else you might see something of what she was. Can you make that
                  out? </p>
               <p>Mrs. Dean raised the candle, and I discerned a soft-featured face, exceedingly
                  resembling the young lady at the Heights, but more pensive and amiable in
                  expression. It formed a sweet picture. The long light hair curled slightly on the
                  temples; the eyes were large and serious, the figure almost too graceful. I did
                  not marvel how Catherine Earnshaw could forget her first friend for such an
                  individual. I marvelled much how he, with a mind to correspond with his person,
                  could fancy my idea of Catherine Earnshaw. </p>
               <p>"A very agreeable portrait," I observed to the house-keeper. "Is it like?" </p>
               <p>"Yes," she answered; "but he looked better when he was animated. That is his
                  everyday countenance. He wanted spirit in general." </p>
               <p>Catherine had kept up her acquaintance with the Lintons since her five weeks'
                  residence among them; and as she had no temptation to show her rough side in their
                  company, and had the sense to be ashamed of being rude where she experienced such
                  invariable courtesy, she imposed unwittingly on the old lady and gentleman by her
                  ingenious cordiality, gained the admiration of Isabella, and the heart and soul of
                  her brother -- acquisitions that flattered her from the first, for she was full of
                  ambition, and led her to adopt a double character without exactly intending to
                  deceive any one. In the place where she heard Heathcliff termed a "vulgar young
                  ruffian," and "worse than a brute," she took care not to act like him; but at home
                  she had small inclination to practise politeness that would only be laughed at,
                  and restrain an unruly nature when it would bring her neither credit nor praise. </p>
               <p>Mr. Edgar seldom mustered courage to visit Wuthering Heights openly. He had a
                  terror of Earnshaw's reputation, and shrank from encountering him; and yet he was
                  always received with our best attempts at civility. The master himself avoided
                  offending <pb n="67"/>him, knowing why he came; and if he could not be gracious,
                  kept out of the way. I rather think his appearance there was distasteful to
                  Catherine. She was not artful, never played the coquette, and had evidently an
                  objection to her two friends meeting at all; for when Heathcliff expressed
                  contempt of Linton in his presence, she could not half coincide as she did in his
                  absence; and when Linton evinced disgust and antipathy to Heathcliff, she dared
                  not treat his sentiments with indifference, as if depreciation of her playmate
                  were of scarcely any consequence to her. I've had many a laugh at her perplexities
                  and untold troubles, which she vainly strove to hide from my mockery. That sounds
                  ill-natured, but she was so proud it became really impossible to pity her
                  distresses, till she should be chastened into more humility. She did bring
                  herself, finally, to confess, and to confide in me. There was not a soul else that
                  she might fashion into an adviser. </p>
               <p>Mr. Hindley had gone from home one afternoon, and Heathcliff presumed to give
                  himself a holiday on the strength of it. He had reached the age of sixteen then, I
                  think, and without having bad features or being deficient in intellect, he
                  contrived to convey an impression of inward and outward repulsiveness that his
                  present aspect retains no traces of. In the first place, he had by that time lost
                  the benefit of his early education. Continual hard work, begun soon and concluded
                  late, had extinguished any curiosity he once possessed in pursuit of knowledge,
                  and any love for books or learning. His childhood's sense of superiority instilled
                  into him by the favours of old Mr. Earnshaw was faded away. He struggled long to
                  keep up an equality with Catherine in her studies, and yielded with poignant
                  though silent regret; but he yielded completely, and there was no prevailing on
                  him to take a step in the way of moving upward, when he found he must necessarily
                  sink beneath his former level. Then personal appearance sympathized with mental
                  deterioration. He acquired a slouching gait and ignoble look; his naturally <pb
                     n="68"/> reserved disposition was exaggerated into an almost idiotic excess of
                  unsociable moroseness, and he took a grim pleasure, apparently, in exciting the
                  aversion rather than the esteem of his few acquaintance. </p>
               <p>Catherine and he were constant companions still at his seasons of respite from
                  labour, but he had ceased to express his fondness for her in words, and recoiled
                  with angry suspicion from her girlish caresses, as if conscious there could be no
                  gratification in lavishing such marks of affection on him. On the before-named
                  occasion he came into the house to announce his intention of doing nothing, while
                  I was assisting Miss Cathy to arrange her dress. She had not reckoned on his
                  taking it into his head to be idle, and imagining she would have the whole place
                  to herself, she managed, by some means, to inform Mr. Edgar of her brother's
                  absence, and was then preparing to receive him. </p>
               <p>"Cathy, are you busy this afternoon?" asked Heathcliff. "Are you going anywhere?" </p>
               <p>"No; it is raining," she answered. </p>
               <p>"Why have you that silk frock on, then?" he said. "Nobody coming here, I hope?" </p>
               <p>"Not that I know of," stammered miss; "but you should be in the field now,
                  Heathcliff. It is an hour past dinner-time. I thought you were gone." </p>
               <p>"Hindley does not often free us from his accursed presence," observed the boy.
                  "I'll not work any more to-day; I'll stay with you." </p>
               <p>"Oh, but Joseph will tell," she suggested. "You'd better go." </p>
               <p>"Joseph is loading lime on the further side of Pennistow Crag; it will take him
                  till dark, and he'll never know." </p>
               <p>So saying, he lounged to the fire and sat down. Catherine reflected an instant
                  with knitted brows; she found it needful to smooth the way for an intrusion.
                  "Isabella and Edgar Linton talked of calling this afternoon," she said, at the
                  conclusion of a minute's silence. "As it rains, I hardly expect them; but they may
                  come, and if they do you run the risk of being scolded for no good." </p>
               <p>"Order Ellen to say you are engaged, Cathy," he persisted. <pb n="69"/> "Don't
                  turn me out for those pitiful, silly friends of yours! I'm on the point,
                  sometimes, of complaining that they -- but I'll not." </p>
               <p>"That they what?" cried Catherine, gazing at him with a troubled countenance. --
                  "Oh, Nelly!" she added petulantly, jerking her head away from my hands, "you've
                  combed my hair quite out of curl. That's enough; let me alone. -- What are you on
                  the point of complaining about, Heathcliff?" </p>
               <p>"Nothing -- only look at the almanac on that wall." He pointed to a framed sheet
                  hanging near the window, and continued, "The crosses are for the evenings you have
                  spent with the Lintons, the dots for those spent with me. Do you see? I've marked
                  every day." </p>
               <p>"Yes; very foolish -- as if I took notice!" replied Catherine, in a peevish tone.
                  "And where is the sense of that?" </p>
               <p>"To show that I do take notice," said Heathcliff. </p>
               <p>"And should I always be sitting with you?" she demanded, growing more irritated.
                  "What good do I get? What do you talk about? You might be dumb, or a baby, for
                  anything you say to amuse me, or for anything you do either." </p>
               <p>"You never told me before that I talked too little, or that you disliked my
                  company, Cathy," exclaimed Heathcliff in much agitation. </p>
               <p>"It's no company at all, when people know nothing, and say nothing," she muttered. </p>
               <p>Her companion rose up; but he hadn't time to express his feelings further, for a
                  horse's feet were heard on the flags; and, having knocked gently, young Linton
                  entered, his face brilliant with delight at the unexpected summons he had
                  received. Doubtless Catherine marked the difference between her friends, as one
                  came in and the other went out. The contrast resembled what you see in exchanging
                  a bleak, hilly, coal country for a beautiful fertile valley; and his voice and
                  greeting were as opposite as his aspect. He had a sweet, low manner of speaking,
                  and pronounced his words as you do -- that's less gruff than we talk here, and
                  softer. </p>
               <p>"I'm not come too soon, am I?" he said, casting a look at me. <pb n="70"/>I had
                  begun to wipe the plate and tidy some drawers at the far end in the dresser. </p>
               <p>"No," answered Catherine -- "What are you doing there, Nelly?" </p>
               <p>"My work, miss," I replied. (Mr. Hindley had given me directions to make a third
                  party in any private visits Linton chose to pay.) She stepped behind me and
                  whispered crossly, "Take yourself and your dusters off. When company are in the
                  house, servants don't commence scouring and cleaning in the room where they are." </p>
               <p>"It's a good opportunity, now that master is away," I answered aloud. "He hates me
                  to be fidgeting over these things in his presence. I'm sure Mr. Edgar will excuse
                  me." </p>
               <p>"I hate you to be fidgeting in my presence," exclaimed the young lady imperiously,
                  not allowing her guest time to speak. She had failed to recover her equanimity
                  since the little dispute with Heathcliff. </p>
               <p>"I'm sorry for it, Miss Catherine," was my response; and I proceeded assiduously
                  with my occupation. </p>
               <p>She, supposing Edgar could not see her, snatched the cloth from my hand, and
                  pinched me, with a prolonged wrench, very spitefully on the arm. I've said I did
                  not love her, and rather relished mortifying her vanity now and then -- besides,
                  she hurt me extremely; so I started up from my knees, and screamed out, "O miss,
                  that's a nasty trick! You have no right to nip me, and I'm not going to bear it." </p>
               <p>"I didn't touch you, you lying creature!" cried she, her fingers tingling to
                  repeat the act, and her ears red with rage. She never had power to conceal her
                  passion; it always set her whole complexion in a blaze. </p>
               <p>"What's that, then?" I retorted, showing a decided purple witness to refute her. </p>
               <p>She stamped her foot, wavered a moment, and then, irresistibly impelled by the
                  naughty spirit within her, slapped me on the cheek -- a stinging blow that filled
                  both eyes with water. </p>
               <pb n="71"/>
               <p>"Catherine, love! Catherine!" interposed Linton, greatly shocked at the double
                  fault of falsehood and violence which his idol had committed. </p>
               <p>"Leave the room, Ellen!" she repeated, trembling all over. </p>
               <p>Little Hareton, who followed me everywhere, and was sitting near me on the floor,
                  at seeing my tears commenced crying himself, and sobbed out complaints against
                  "wicked Aunt Cathy," which drew her fury on to his unlucky head. She seized his
                  shoulders, and shook him till the poor child waxed livid, and Edgar thoughtlessly
                  laid hold of her hands to deliver him. In an instant one was wrung free, and the
                  astonished young man felt it applied over his own ear in a way that could not be
                  mistaken for jest. He drew back in consternation. I lifted Hareton in my arms, and
                  walked off to the kitchen with him, leaving the door of communication open, for I
                  was curious to watch how they would settle their disagreement. The insulted
                  visitor moved to the spot where he had laid his hat, pale and with a quivering
                  lip. </p>
               <p>"That's right!" I said to myself. "Take warning and begone! It's a kindness to let
                  you have a glimpse of her genuine disposition." </p>
               <p>"Where are you going?" demanded Catherine, advancing to the door. </p>
               <p>He swerved aside, and attempted to pass. </p>
               <p>"You must not go!" she exclaimed energetically. </p>
               <p>"I must and shall!" he replied in a subdued voice. </p>
               <p>"No," she persisted, grasping the handle; "not yet, Edgar Linton. Sit down. You
                  shall not leave me in that temper. I should be miserable all night, and I won't be
                  miserable for you!" </p>
               <p>"Can I stay, after you have struck me?" asked Linton. </p>
               <p>Catherine was mute. </p>
               <p>"You've made me afraid and ashamed of you," he continued. "I'll not come here
                  again." </p>
               <p>Her eyes began to glisten, and her lids to twinkle. </p>
               <p>"And you told a deliberate untruth," he said. </p>
               <p>"I didn't," she cried, recovering her speech. "I did nothing <pb n="72"
                  />deliberately. Well, go, if you please -- get away. And now I'll cry -- I'll cry
                  myself sick." </p>
               <p>She dropped down on her knees by a chair, and set to weeping in serious earnest.
                  Edgar persevered in his resolution as far as the court; there he lingered. I
                  resolved to encourage him. </p>
               <p>"Miss is dreadfully wayward, sir," I called out. "As bad as any marred child.
                  You'd better be riding home, or else she will be sick only to grieve us." </p>
               <p>The soft thing looked askance through the window. He possessed the power to depart
                  as much as a cat possesses the power to leave a mouse half killed or a bird half
                  eaten. Ah, I thought, there will be no saving him; he's doomed, and flies to his
                  fate! And so it was. He turned abruptly, hastened into the house again, shut the
                  door behind him; and when I went in a while after to inform them that Earnshaw had
                  come home rabid drunk, ready to pull the whole place about our ears (his ordinary
                  frame of mind in that condition), I saw the quarrel had merely effected a closer
                  intimacy -- had broken the outworks of youthful timidity, and enabled them to
                  forsake the disguise of friendship, and confess themselves lovers. </p>
               <p>Intelligence of Mr. Hindley's arrival drove Linton speedily to his horse, and
                  Catherine to her chamber. I went to hide little Hareton, and to take the shot out
                  of the master's fowling-piece, which he was fond of playing with in his insane
                  excitement, to the hazard of the lives of any who provoked or even attracted his
                  notice too much; and I had hit upon the plan of removing it, that he might do less
                  mischief if he did go the length of firing the gun. </p>

               <p>He entered, vociferating oaths dreadful to hear; and caught me in the act of
                  stowing his son away in the kitchen cupboard. Hareton was impressed with a
                  wholesome terror of encountering either his wild-beast's fondness or his madman's
                  rage -- for in one he ran a chance of being squeezed and kissed to death, and in
                  the other of being flung into the fire, or dashed against the wall -- and the poor
                  thing remained perfectly quiet wherever I chose to put him.</p>
               <p>"There, I've found it out at last!" cried Hindley, pulling me back by the skin of
                  the neck, like a dog. "By Heaven and Hell, you've sworn between you to murder that
                  child ! I know how it is, now, that he is always out of my way. But, with the help
                  of Satan, I shall make you swallow the carving knife, Nelly! You needn't laugh;
                  for I've just crammed Kenneth, head-downmost, in the Blackhorse marsh; and two is
                  the same as one -- and I want to kill some of you, I shall have no rest till I
                  do!"</p>
               <p>"But I don't like the carving knife, Mr. Hindley," I answered; "it has been
                  cutting red herrings -- I'd rather be shot, if you please."</p>
               <p>"You'd rather be damned!" he said, "and so you shall -- No law in England can
                  hinder a man from keeping his house decent, and mine's abominable ! open your
                  mouth."</p>
               <p>He held the knife in his hand, and pushed its point between my teeth; but, for my
                  part, I was never much afraid of his vagaries. I spat out, and affirmed it tasted
                  detestably; I would not take it on any account. </p>
               <p>"Oh!" said he, releasing me, "I see that hideous little villain is not Hareton. I
                  beg your pardon, Nell. If it be, he deserves flaying alive for not running to
                  welcome me, and for screaming as if I were a goblin. Unnatural cub, come hither.
                  I'll teach thee to impose on a good-hearted, deluded father. Now, don't you think
                  the lad would be handsomer cropped? It makes a dog <pb n="74"/> fiercer, and I
                  love something fierce -- get me a scissors -- something fierce and trim! Besides,
                  it's infernal affectation -- devilish conceit it is to cherish our ears -- we're
                  asses enough without them. Hush, child, hush! Well, then, it is my darling! Wisht,
                  dry thy eyes -- there's a joy; kiss me. What! it won't? Kiss me, Hareton! Damn
                  thee, kiss me! By God, as if I would rear such a monster! As sure as I'm living,
                  I'll break the brat's neck." </p>
               <p>Poor Hareton was squalling and kicking in his father's arms with all his might,
                  and redoubled his yells when he carried him upstairs and lifted him over the
                  banister. I cried out that he would frighten the child into fits, and ran to
                  rescue him. As I reached them, Hindley leant forward on the rails to listen to a
                  noise below, almost forgetting what he had in his hands. "Who is that?" he asked,
                  hearing some one approaching the stair's foot. I leant forward also, for the
                  purpose of signing to Heathcliff, whose step I recognized, not to come farther;
                  and at the instant when my eye quitted Hareton, he gave a sudden spring, delivered
                  himself from the careless grasp that held him, and fell. </p>
               <p>There was scarcely time to experience a thrill of horror before we saw that the
                  little wretch was safe. Heathcliff arrived underneath just at the critical moment;
                  by a natural impulse he arrested his descent, and setting him on his feet, looked
                  up to discover the author of the accident. A miser who has parted with a lucky
                  lottery ticket for five shillings, and finds next day he has lost in the bargain
                  five thousand pounds, could not show a blanker countenance than he did on
                  beholding the figure of Mr. Earnshaw above. It expressed, plainer than words could
                  do, the intensest anguish at having made himself the instrument of thwarting his
                  own revenge. Had it been dark, I dare say he would have tried to remedy the
                  mistake by smashing Hareton's skull on the steps; but we witnessed his salvation,
                  and I was presently below with my precious charge pressed to my heart. Hindley
                  descended more leisurely, sobered and abashed. </p>
               <pb n="75"/>
               <p>"It is your fault, Ellen," he said; "you should have kept him out of sight. You
                  should have taken him from me. Is he injured anywhere?" </p>
               <p>"Injured!" I cried angrily; "if he's not killed, he'll be an idiot! Oh, I wonder
                  his mother does not rise from her grave to see how you use him! You're worse than
                  a heathen -- treating your own flesh and blood in that manner!" </p>
               <p>He attempted to touch the child, who, on finding himself with me, sobbed off his
                  terror directly. At the first finger his father laid on him, however, he shrieked
                  again louder than before, and struggled as if he would go into convulsions. </p>
               <p>"You shall not meddle with him," I continued. "He hates you; they all hate you --
                  that's the truth! A happy family you have, and a pretty state you're come to!" </p>
               <p>"I shall come to a prettier yet, Nelly," laughed the misguided man, recovering his
                  hardness. "At present, convey yourself and him away. -- And hark you, Heathcliff;
                  clear you too quite from my reach and hearing. I wouldn't murder you to-night,
                  unless, perhaps, I set the house on fire; but that's as my fancy goes." </p>
               <p>While saying this he took a pint bottle of brandy from the dresser and poured some
                  into a tumbler. </p>
               <p>"Nay, don't!" I entreated. "Mr. Hindley, do take warning. Have mercy on this
                  unfortunate boy, if you care nothing for yourself!" </p>
               <p>"Any one will do better for him than I shall," he answered. </p>
               <p>"Have mercy on your own soul!" I said, endeavouring to snatch the glass from his
                  hand. </p>
               <p>"Not I! On the contrary I shall have great pleasure in sending it to perdition to
                  punish its Maker," exclaimed the blasphemer. "Here's to its hearty damnation!" </p>
               <p>He drank the spirits and impatiently bade us go, terminating his command with a
                  sequel of horrid imprecations too bad to repeat or remember. </p>
               <p>"It's a pity he cannot kill himself with drink," observed Heathcliff, muttering an
                  echo of curses back when the door was shut. <pb n="76"/>"He's doing his very
                  utmost, but his constitution defies him. Mr. Kenneth says he would wager his mare
                  that he'll outlive any man on this side Gimmerton, and go to the grave a hoary
                  sinner, unless some happy chance out of the common course befall him." </p>
               <p>I went into the kitchen and sat down to lull my little lamb to sleep. Heathcliff,
                  as I thought, walked through to the barn. It turned out afterwards that he only
                  got as far as the other side the settle, when he flung himself on a bench by the
                  wall, removed from the fire, and remained silent. </p>
               <p>I was rocking Hareton on my knee, and humming a song that began -- </p>
               <l>"It was far in the night, and the bairnies grat,</l>
               <l>The mither beneath the mools heard that" -- </l>

               <p>when Miss Cathy, who had listened to the hubbub from her room, put her head in and
                  whispered, -- </p>

               <p>"Are you alone, Nelly?"</p>

               <p>"Yes, miss," I replied.</p>

               <p>She entered and approached the hearth. I, supposing she was going to say
                  something, looked up. The expression of her face seemed disturbed and anxious. Her
                  lips were half asunder, as if she meant to speak, and she drew a breath; but it
                  escaped in a sigh instead of a sentence. I resumed my song, not having forgotten
                  her recent behaviour. </p>
               <p>"Where's Heathcliff?" she said, interrupting me. </p>
               <p>"About his work in the stable," was my answer. </p>
               <p>He did not contradict me; perhaps he had fallen into a doze. There followed
                  another long pause, during which I perceived a drop or two trickle from
                  Catherine's cheek to the flags. Is she sorry for her shameful conduct? I asked
                  myself. That will be a novelty. But she may come to the point as she will; I
                  shan't help her. No; she felt small trouble regarding any subject save her own
                  concerns. </p>
               <p>"Oh dear!" she cried at last, "I'm very unhappy!" </p>
               <pb n="77"/>
               <p>"A pity," observed I. "You're hard to please. So many friends, and so few cares,
                  and can't make yourself content!" </p>
               <p>"Nelly, will you keep a secret for me?" she pursued, kneeling down by me and
                  lifting her winsome eyes to my face with that sort of look which turns off bad
                  temper even when one has all the right in the world to indulge it. </p>
               <p>"Is it worth keeping?" I inquired less sulkily. </p>
               <p>"Yes, and it worries me, and I must let it out. I want to know what I should do.
                  To-day Edgar Linton has asked me to marry him, and I've given him an answer. Now,
                  before I tell you whether it was a consent or denial, you tell me which it ought
                  to have been." </p>
               <p>"Really, Miss Catherine, how can I know?" I replied. "To be sure, considering the
                  exhibition you performed in his presence this afternoon, I might say it would be
                  wise to refuse him; since he asked you after that, he must either be hopelessly
                  stupid or a venturesome fool." </p>
               <p>"If you talk so, I won't tell you any more," she returned peevishly, rising to her
                  feet. "I accepted him, Nelly. Be quick, and say whether I was wrong." </p>
               <p>"You accepted him! Then what good is it discussing the matter? You have pledged
                  your word, and cannot retract." </p>
               <p>"But say whether I should have done so -- do!" she exclaimed in an irritated tone,
                  chafing her hands together and frowning. </p>
               <p>"There are many things to be considered before that question can be answered
                  properly," I said sententiously. "First and foremost, do you love Mr. Edgar?" </p>
               <p>"Who can help it? Of course I do," she answered. </p>
               <p>Then I put her through the following catechism; for a girl of twenty-two it was
                  not injudicious. </p>
               <p>"Why do you love him, Miss Cathy?" </p>
               <p>"Nonsense; I do -- that's sufficient." </p>
               <p>"By no means; you must say why." </p>
               <p>"Well, because he is handsome and pleasant to be with."</p>
               <pb n="78"/>
               <p>"Bad!" was my commentary. </p>
               <p>"And because he is young and cheerful." </p>
               <p>"Bad still." </p>
               <p>"And because he loves me." </p>
               <p>"Indifferent, coming there." </p>
               <p>"And he will be rich, and I shall like to be the greatest woman of the
                  neighbourhood, and I shall be proud of having such a husband." </p>
               <p>"Worst of all. And now, say how you love him." </p>
               <p>"As everybody loves. You're silly, Nelly." </p>
               <p>"Not at all -- answer." </p>
               <p>"I love the ground under his feet, and the air over his head, and everything he
                  touches, and every word he says. I love all his looks, and all his actions, and
                  him entirely and altogether. There now!" </p>
               <p>"And why?" </p>
               <p>"Nay, you are making a jest of it. It is exceedingly ill-natured. It's no jest to
                  me!" said the young lady, scowling and turning her face to the fire. </p>
               <p>"I'm very far from jesting, Miss Catherine," I replied. </p>
               <p>"You love Mr. Edgar because he is handsome, and young, and cheerful, and rich, and
                  loves you. The last, however, goes for nothing -- you would love him without that
                  probably; and with it you wouldn't, unless he possessed the four former
                  attractions." </p>
               <p>"No; to be sure not. I should only pity him -- hate him, perhaps, if he were ugly
                  and a clown." </p>
               <p>"But there are several other handsome, rich young men in the world -- handsomer,
                  possibly, and richer than he is. What should hinder you from loving them?" </p>
               <p>"If there be any, they are out of my way. I've seen none like Edgar."</p>
               <p>"You may see some. And he won't always be handsome and young, and may not always
                  be rich." </p>
               <p>"He is now; and I have only to do with the present. I wish you would speak
                  rationally." </p>
               <p>"Well, that settles it. If you have only to do with the present, marry Mr.
                  Linton." </p>
               <pb n="79"/>
               <p>"I don't want your permission for that -- I shall marry him; and yet you have not
                  told me whether I'm right." </p>
               <p>"Perfectly right, if people be right to marry only for the present. And now, let
                  us hear what you are unhappy about. Your brother will be pleased; the old lady and
                  gentleman will not object, I think; you will escape from a disorderly, comfortless
                  home into a wealthy, respectable one; and you love Edgar, and Edgar loves you. All
                  seems smooth and easy. Where is the obstacle?" </p>
               <p>"Here, and here!" replied Catherine, striking one hand on her forehead and the
                  other on her breast; "in whichever place the soul lives. In my soul and in my
                  heart I'm convinced I'm wrong." </p>
               <p>"That's very strange. I cannot make it out." </p>
               <p>"It's my secret. But if you will not mock at me, I'll explain it. I can't do it
                  distinctly, but I'll give you a feeling of how I feel." </p>
               <p>She seated herself by me again; her countenance grew sadder and graver, and her
                  clasped hands trembled. </p>
               <p>"Nelly, do you never dream queer dreams?" she said suddenly, after some minutes'
                  reflection. </p>
               <p>"Yes; now and then," I answered. </p>
               <p>"And so do I. I've dreamt in my life dreams that have stayed with me ever after,
                  and changed my ideas; they've gone through and through me, like wine through
                  water, and altered the colour of my mind. And this is one. I'm going to tell it;
                  but take care not to smile at any part of it." </p>
               <p>"Oh! don't, Miss Catherine!" I cried. "We're dismal enough without conjuring up
                  ghosts and visions to perplex us. Come, come, be merry and like yourself! Look at
                  little Hareton! He's dreaming nothing dreary. How sweetly he smiles in his sleep!" </p>
               <p>"Yes; and how sweetly his father curses in his solitude! You remember him, I dare
                  say, when he was just such another as that chubby thing -- nearly as young and
                  innocent. However, Nelly, I shall oblige you to listen; it's not long, and I've no
                  power to be merry tonight." </p>
               <p>"I won't hear it, I won't hear it!" I repeated hastily. </p>
               <p>I was superstitious about dreams then, and am still; and Catherine </p>
               <pb n="80"/>
               <p>had an unusual gloom in her aspect that made me dread something from which I might
                  shape a prophecy and foresee a fearful catastrophe. She was vexed, but she did not
                  proceed. Apparently taking up another subject, she recommenced in a short time. </p>
               <p>"If I were in heaven, Nelly, I should be extremely miserable." </p>
               <p>"Because you are not fit to go there," I answered. </p>
               <p>"All sinners would be miserable in heaven." </p>
               <p>"But it is not for that. I dreamt once that I was there." </p>
               <p>"I tell you I won't hearken to your dreams, Miss Catherine! I'll go to bed," I
                  interrupted again. </p>
               <p>She laughed and held me down, for I made a motion to leave my chair. </p>
               <p>"This is nothing," cried she. "I was only going to say that heaven did not seem to
                  be my home, and I broke my heart with weeping to come back to earth; and the
                  angels were so angry that they flung me out into the middle of the heath on the
                  top of Wuthering Heights, where I woke sobbing for joy. That will do to explain my
                  secret as well as the other. I've no more business to marry Edgar Linton than I
                  have to be in heaven; and if the wicked man in there had not brought Heathcliff so
                  low, I shouldn't have thought of it. It would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now,
                  so he shall never know how I love him; and that not because he's handsome, Nelly,
                  but because he's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and
                  mine are the same; and Linton's is as different as a moonbeam from lightning, or
                  frost from fire." </p>
               <p>Ere this speech ended I became sensible of Heathcliff's presence. Having noticed a
                  slight movement, I turned my head and saw him rise from the bench and steal out
                  noiselessly. He had listened till he heard Catherine say it would degrade her to
                  marry him, and then he stayed to hear no further. My companion, sitting on the
                  ground, was prevented by the back of the settle from remarking his presence or
                  departure; but I started and bade her hush. </p>
               <p>"Why?" she asked, gazing nervously round. </p>
               <pb n="81"/>
               <p>"Joseph is here," I answered, catching opportunely the roll of his cart-wheels up
                  the road, "and Heathcliff will come in with him. I'm not sure whether he were not
                  at the door this moment." </p>
               <p>"Oh, he couldn't overhear me at the door," said she. "Give me Hareton while you
                  get the supper, and when it is ready ask me to sup with you. I want to cheat my
                  uncomfortable conscience, and be convinced that Heathcliff has no notion of these
                  things. He has not, has he? He does not know what being in love is?" </p>
               <p>"I see no reason that he should not know, as well as you," I returned; "and if you
                  are his choice, he'll be the most unfortunate creature that ever was born. As soon
                  as you become Mrs. Linton, he loses friend, and love, and all. Have you considered
                  how you'll bear the separation, and how he'll bear to be quite deserted in the
                  world? Because, Miss Catherine -- " </p>
               <p>"He quite deserted! we separated!" she exclaimed with an accent of indignation.
                  "Who is to separate us, pray? They'll meet the fate of Milo. Not as long as I
                  live, Ellen -- for no mortal creature. Every Linton on the face of the earth might
                  melt into nothing before I could consent to forsake Heathcliff. Oh, that's not
                  what I intend -- that's not what I mean! I shouldn't be Mrs. Linton were such a
                  price demanded! He'll be as much to me as he has been all his lifetime. Edgar must
                  shake off his antipathy, and tolerate him, at least. He will, when he learns my
                  true feelings towards him. Nelly, I see now -- you think me a selfish wretch; but
                  did it never strike you that if Heathcliff and I married, we should be beggars?
                  Whereas, if I marry Linton, I can aid Heathcliff to rise, and place him out of my
                  brother's power." </p>
               <p>"With your husband's money, Miss Catherine?" I asked. "You'll find him not so
                  pliable as you calculate upon; and, though I'm hardly a judge, I think that's the
                  worst motive you've given yet for being the wife of young Linton." </p>
               <p>"It is not!" retorted she; "it is the best! The others were the satisfaction of my
                  whims; and for Edgar's sake, too -- to satisfy him. This is for the sake of one
                  who comprehends in his person my feelings to Edgar and myself. I cannot express
                  it, but surely you <pb n="82"/>and everybody have a notion that there is or should
                  be an existence of yours beyond you. What were the use of my creation if I were
                  entirely contained here? My great miseries in this world have been Heathcliff's
                  miseries, and I watched and felt each from the beginning. My great thought in
                  living is himself. If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue
                  to be. And if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would turn
                  to a mighty stranger -- I should not seem a part of it. My love for Linton is like
                  the foliage in the woods; time will change it, I'm well aware, as winter changes
                  the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath -- a source
                  of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I am Heathcliff! He's always,
                  always in my mind -- not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to
                  myself, but as my own being. So don't talk of our separation again. It is
                  impracticable, and -- " </p>
               <p>She paused, and hid her face in the folds of my gown, but I jerked it forcibly
                  away. I was out of patience with her folly. </p>
               <p>"If I can make any sense of your nonsense, miss," I said, "it only goes to
                  convince me that you are ignorant of the duties you undertake in marrying, or else
                  that you are a wicked, unprincipled girl. But trouble me with no more secrets;
                  I'll not promise to keep them." </p>
               <p>"You'll keep that?" she asked eagerly. </p>
               <p>"No, I'll not promise," I repeated. </p>
               <p>She was about to insist, when the entrance of Joseph finished our conversation;
                  and Catherine removed her seat to a corner and nursed Hareton, while I made the
                  supper. After it was cooked, my fellow-servant and I began to quarrel who should
                  carry some to Mr. Hindley; and we didn't settle it till all was nearly cold. Then
                  we came to the agreement that we would let him ask if he wanted any, for we feared
                  particularly to go into his presence when he had been some time alone. </p>
               <p>"And how isn't that nowt comed in fro' th' field be this time? What is he about?
                  girt idle seeght!" demanded the old man, looking round for Heathcliff. </p>
               <p>"I'll call him," I replied. "He's in the barn, I've no doubt." </p>
               <pb n="83"/>
               <p>I went and called, but got no answer. On returning, I whispered to Catherine that
                  he had heard a good part of what she said, I was sure, and told how I saw him quit
                  the kitchen just as she complained of her brother's conduct regarding him. She
                  jumped up in a fine fright, flung Hareton on to the settle, and ran to seek for
                  her friend herself, not taking leisure to consider why she was so flurried, or how
                  her talk would have affected him. She was absent such a while that Joseph proposed
                  we should wait no longer. He cunningly conjectured they were staying away in order
                  to avoid hearing his protracted blessing. They were "ill eneugh for ony fahl
                  manners," he affirmed. And on their behalf he added that night a special prayer to
                  the usual quarter of an hour's supplication before meat, and would have tacked
                  another to the end of the grace, had not his young mistress broken in upon him
                  with a hurried command that he must run down the road, and wherever Heathcliff had
                  rambled, find and make him re-enter directly. </p>
               <p>"I want to speak to him, and I must before I go upstairs," she said. "And the gate
                  is open. He is somewhere out of hearing, for he would not reply, though I shouted
                  at the top of the fold as loud as I could." </p>
               <p>Joseph objected at first. She was too much in earnest, however, to suffer
                  contradiction; and at last he placed his hat on his head and walked grumbling
                  forth. Meantime, Catherine paced up and down the floor, exclaiming, -- </p>
               <p>"I wonder where he is -- I wonder where he can be. What did I say, Nelly? I've
                  forgotten. Was he vexed at my bad humour this afternoon? Dear! tell me what I've
                  said to grieve him. I do wish he'd come. I do wish he would." </p>
               <p>"What a noise for nothing!" I cried, though rather uneasy myself. "What a trifle
                  scares you! It's surely no great cause of alarm that Heathcliff should take a
                  moonlight saunter on the moors, or even lie too sulky to speak to us in the
                  hay-loft. I'll engage he's lurking there. See if I don't ferret him out!" </p>
               <pb n="84"/>
               <p>I departed to renew my search. Its result was disappointment, and Joseph's quest
                  ended in the same. </p>
               <p>"Yon lad gets war un war!" observed he on re-entering. "He's left th' yate at t'
                  full swing, and miss's pony has trodden dahn two rigs o' corn, and plottered
                  through, raight o'er into t' meadow! Hahsomdiver, t' maister 'ull play t' devil
                  to-morn, and he'll do weel. He's patience itsseln wi' sich careless, offald
                  craters -- patience itsseln he is! Bud he'll not be soa allus -- yah's see, all on
                  ye! Yah munn't drive him out of his heead for nowt!" </p>
               <p>"Have you found Heathcliff, you ass?" interrupted Catherine. "Have you been
                  looking for him, as I ordered?" </p>
               <p>"Aw sud more likker look for th' horse," he replied. "It 'ud be to more sense. Bud
                  I can look for norther horse nur man of a neeght loike this -- as black as t'
                  chimbley; und Heathcliff's noan t' chap to coom at my whistle. Happen he'll be
                  less hard o' hearing wi' ye!" </p>
               <p>It was a very dark evening for summer. The clouds appeared inclined to thunder,
                  and I said we had better all sit down; the approaching rain would be certain to
                  bring him home without further trouble. However, Catherine would not be persuaded
                  into tranquillity. She kept wandering to and fro, from the gate to the door, in a
                  state of agitation which permitted no repose, and at length took up a permanent
                  situation on one side of the wall, near the road, where, heedless of my
                  expostulations and the growling thunder, and the great drops that began to plash
                  around her, she remained, calling at intervals, and then listening, and then
                  crying outright. She beat Hareton, or any child, at a good passionate fit of
                  crying. </p>
               <p>About midnight, while we still sat up, the storm came rattling over the Heights in
                  full fury. There was a violent wind, as well as thunder, and either one or the
                  other split a tree off at the corner of the building; a huge bough fell across the
                  roof, and knocked down a portion of the east chimney stack, sending a clatter of
                  stones and soot into the kitchen fire. We thought a bolt had fallen in the middle
                  of us, and Joseph swung on to his knees, beseeching the Lord to remember the <pb
                     n="85"/>patriarchs Noah and Lot, and, as in former times, spare the righteous,
                  though He smote the ungodly. I felt some sentiment that it must be a judgment on
                  us also. The Jonah, in my mind, was Mr. Earnshaw; and I shook the handle of his
                  den, that I might ascertain if he were yet living. He replied audibly enough in a
                  fashion which made my companion vociferate, more clamorously than before, that a
                  wide distinction might be drawn between saints like himself and sinners like his
                  master. But the uproar passed away in twenty minutes, leaving us all unharmed,
                  excepting Cathy, who got thoroughly drenched for her obstinacy in refusing to take
                  shelter, and standing bonnetless and shawl-less to catch as much water as she
                  could with her hair and clothes. She came in and lay down on the settle, all
                  soaked as she was, turning her face to the back and putting her hands before it. </p>
               <p>"Well, miss!" I exclaimed, touching her shoulder; "you are not bent on getting
                  your death, are you? Do you know what o'clock it is? Half-past twelve. Come, come
                  to bed! There's no use waiting longer on that foolish boy. He'll be gone to
                  Gimmerton, and he'll stay there now. He guesses we shouldn't wake for him till
                  this late hour -- at least he guesses that only Mr. Hindley would be up; and he'd
                  rather avoid having the door opened by the master." </p>
               <p>"Nay, nay; he's noan at Gimmerton," said Joseph. "I's niver wonder but he's at t'
                  bothom of a bog-hoile. This visitation worn't for nowt, and I wod hev ye to look
                  out, miss; yah muh be t' next. Thank Hivin for all! All warks togither for gooid
                  to them as is chozzen, and piked out fro' th' rubbidge. Yah knaw whet t' Scripture
                  ses." And he began quoting several texts, referring us to chapters and verses
                  where we might find them. </p>
               <p>I, having vainly begged the wilful girl to rise and remove her wet things, left
                  him preaching and her shivering, and betook myself to bed with little Hareton, who
                  slept as fast as if every one had been sleeping round him. I heard Joseph read on
                  a while afterwards; then I distinguished his slow step on the ladder, and then I
                  dropped asleep. </p>
               <p>Coming down somewhat later than usual, I saw, by the sunbeams <pb n="86"/>piercing
                  the chinks of the shutters, Miss Catherine still seated near the fireplace. The
                  house door was ajar too; light entered from its unclosed windows. Hindley had come
                  out, and stood on the kitchen hearth, haggard and drowsy. </p>
               <p>"What ails you, Cathy?" he was saying when I entered; "you look as dismal as a
                  drowned whelp. Why are you so damp and pale, child?" </p>
               <p>"I've been wet!" she answered reluctantly, "and I'm cold; that's all." </p>
               <p>"Oh, she is naughty!" I cried, perceiving the master to be tolerably sober. "She
                  got steeped in the shower of yesterday evening, and there she has sat the night
                  through, and I couldn't prevail on her to stir." </p>
               <p>Mr. Earnshaw stared at us in surprise. "The night through!" he repeated. "What
                  kept her up? Not fear of the thunder, surely? That was over hours since." </p>
               <p>Neither of us wished to mention Heathcliff's absence as long as we could conceal
                  it, so I replied I didn't know how she took it into her head to sit up, and she
                  said nothing. The morning was fresh and cool. I threw back the lattice, and
                  presently the room filled with sweet scents from the garden; but Catherine called
                  peevishly to me, "Ellen, shut the window. I'm starving!" And her teeth chattered
                  as she shrank closer to the almost extinguished embers. </p>
               <p>"She's ill," said Hindley, taking her wrist; "I suppose that's the reason she
                  would not go to bed. Damn it! I don't want to be troubled with more sickness here.
                  What took you into the rain?" </p>
               <p>"Running after t' lads as usuald!" croaked Joseph, catching an opportunity, from
                  our hesitation, to thrust in his evil tongue. "If I war yah, maister, I'd just
                  slam t' boards i' their faces all on 'em, gentle and simple. Never a day ut yah're
                  off, but yon cat o' Linton comes sneaking hither; and Miss Nelly -- shoo's a fine

                  he's out at t'other, and then wer grand lady goes a-coorting of her side! It's
                  bonny behaviour, lurking amang t' fields after twelve o' t' night wi' that fahl,
                  flaysome divil of a gipsy, <pb n="87"/>Heathcliff! They think I'm blind, but I'm
                  noan -- nowt ut t' soart! I seed young Linton boath coming and going, and I seed
                  yah" (directing his discourse to me), "yah gooid fur nowt, slattenly witch, nip up
                  and bolt into th' house, t' minute yah heard t' maister's horse fit clatter up t'
                  road." </p>
               <p>"Silence, eavesdropper!" cried Catherine; "none of your insolence before me! --
                  Edgar Linton came yesterday by chance, Hindley, and it was I who told him to be
                  off, because I knew you would not like to have met him as you were." </p>
               <p>"You lie, Cathy, no doubt," answered her brother, "and you are a confounded
                  simpleton! But never mind Linton at present; tell me -- were you not with
                  Heathcliff last night? Speak the truth, now. You need not be afraid of harming
                  him. Though I hate him as much as ever, he did me a good turn a short time since
                  that will make my conscience tender of breaking his neck. To prevent it, I shall
                  send him about his business this very morning; and after he's gone, I'd advise you
                  all to look sharp. I shall only have the more humour for you." </p>
               <p>"I never saw Heathcliff last night," answered Catherine, beginning to sob
                  bitterly, "and if you do turn him out of doors, I'll go with him. But perhaps
                  you'll never have an opportunity; perhaps he's gone." Here she burst into
                  uncontrollable grief, and the remainder of her words were inarticulate. </p>
               <p>Hindley lavished on her a torrent of scornful abuse, and bade her get to her room
                  immediately, or she shouldn't cry for nothing. I obliged her to obey; and I shall
                  never forget what a scene she acted when we reached her chamber -- it terrified
                  me. I thought she was going mad, and I begged Joseph to run for the doctor. It
                  proved the commencement of delirium. Mr. Kenneth, as soon as he saw her,
                  pronounced her dangerously ill. She had a fever. He bled her, and he told me to
                  let her live on whey and water-gruel, and take care she did not throw herself
                  downstairs or out of the window; and then he left, for he had enough to do in the
                  parish, where two or three miles was the ordinary distance between cottage and
                  cottage. </p>
               <pb n="88"/>
               <p>Though I cannot say I made a gentle nurse, and Joseph and the master were no
                  better, and though our patient was as wearisome and headstrong as a patient could
                  be, she weathered it through. Old Mrs. Linton paid us several visits, to be sure,
                  and set things to rights, and scolded and ordered us all; and when Catherine was
                  convalescent she insisted on conveying her to Thrushcross Grange, for which
                  deliverance we were very grateful; but the poor dame had reason to repent of her
                  kindness. She and her husband both took the fever, and died within a few days of
                  each other. </p>
               <p>Our young lady returned to us, saucier and more passionate and haughtier than
                  ever. Heathcliff had never been heard of since the evening of the thunderstorm;
                  and one day I had the misfortune, when she had provoked me exceedingly, to lay the
                  blame of his disappearance on her -- where indeed it belonged, as she well knew.
                  From that period, for several months, she ceased to hold any communication with
                  me, save in the relation of a mere servant. Joseph fell under a ban also. He would
                  speak his mind, and lecture her all the same as if she were a little girl; and she
                  esteemed herself a woman, and our mistress, and thought that her recent illness
                  gave her a claim to be treated with consideration. Then the doctor had said that
                  she would not bear crossing much -- she ought to have her own way; and it was
                  nothing less than murder in her eyes for any one to presume to stand up and
                  contradict her. From Mr. Earnshaw and his companions she kept aloof; and tutored
                  by Kenneth, and serious threats of a fit that often attended her rages, her
                  brother allowed her whatever she pleased to demand, and generally avoided
                  aggravating her fiery temper. He was rather too indulgent in humouring her
                  caprices -- not from affection, but from pride. He wished earnestly to see her
                  bring honour to the family by an alliance with the Lintons; and as long as she let
                  him alone she might trample on us like slaves, for aught he cared. Edgar Linton,
                  as multitudes have been before, and will be after him, was infatuated, and
                  believed himself the happiest man alive <pb n="89"/> on the day he led her to
                  Gimmerton Chapel, three years subsequent to his father's death. </p>
               <p>Much against my inclination, I was persuaded to leave Wuthering Heights and
                  accompany her here. Little Hareton was nearly five years old, and I had just begun
                  to teach him his letters. We made a sad parting, but Catherine's tears were more
                  powerful than ours. When I refused to go, and when she found her entreaties did
                  not move me, she went lamenting to her husband and brother. The former offered me
                  munificent wages; the latter ordered me to pack up. He wanted no women in the
                  house, he said, now that there was no mistress; and as to Hareton, the curate
                  should take him in hand by-and-by. And so I had but one choice left -- to do as I
                  was ordered. I told the master he got rid of all decent people only to ride to
                  ruin a little faster. I kissed Hareton, said good-bye, and since then he has been
                  a stranger; and it's very queer to think it, but I've no doubt he has completely
                  forgotten all about Ellen Dean, and that he was ever more than all the world to
                  her, and she to him. </p>

               <p>At this point of the housekeeper's story she chanced to glance towards the
                  timepiece over the chimney, and was in amazement on seeing the minute-hand measure
                  half-past one. She would not hear of staying a second longer -- in truth, I felt
                  rather disposed to defer the sequel of her narrative myself. And now that she is
                  vanished to her rest, and I have meditated for another hour or two, I shall summon
                  courage to go also, in spite of aching laziness of head and limbs. </p>

               <p>A charming introduction to a hermit's life! Four weeks' torture, tossing and
                  sickness ! Oh, these bleak winds and bitter, northern skies, and impassable roads,
                  and dilatory country surgeons! And, oh, this dearth of the human physiognomy, and,
                  worse than all, the terrible intimation of Kenneth that I need not expect to be
                  out of doors till spring!</p>
               <p>Mr. Heathcliff has just honoured me with a call. About seven days ago he sent me a
                  brace of grouse -- the last of the season. Scoundrel ! He is not altogether
                  guiltless in this illness of mine; and that I had a great mind to tell him. But,
                  alas! how could I offend a man who was charitable enough to sit at my bedside a
                  good hour, and talk on some other subject than pills and draughts, blisters and
                  leeches ?</p>
               <p>This is quite an easy interval. I am too weak to read, yet I feel as if I could
                  enjoy something interesting. Why not have up Mrs. Dean to finish her tale ? I can
                  recollect its chief incidents, as far as she had gone. Yes, I remember her hero
                  had run off, and never been heard of for three years: and the heroine was married.
                  I'll ring; she'll be delighted to find me capable of talking cheerfully.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dean came.</p>
               <p>"It wants twenty minutes, sir, to taking the medicine," she commenced. </p>
               <p>Away, away with it!" I replied; "I desire to have -- </p>
               <p>"The doctor says you must drop the powders." </p>
               <p>"With all my heart! Don't interrupt me. Come and take your seat here. Keep your
                  fingers from that bitter phalanx of vials. Draw your knitting out of your pocket
                  -- that will do; now continue the history of Mr. Heathcliff, from where you left
                  off to the present day. Did he finish his education on the Continent, and come
                  back a gentleman? or did he get a sizer's place at college, or escape to America,
                  and earn honours by drawing blood from <pb n="91"/>his foster-country, or make a
                  fortune more promptly on the English highways?" </p>
               <p>"He may have done a little in all these vocations, Mr. Lockwood, but I couldn't
                  give my word for any. I stated before that I didn't know how he gained his money,
                  neither am I aware of the means he took to raise his mind from the savage
                  ignorance into which it was sunk; but, with your leave, I'll proceed in my own
                  fashion, if you think it will amuse and not weary you. Are you feeling better this
                  morning?" </p>
               <p>"Much." </p>
               <p>"That's good news. -- I got Miss Catherine and myself to Thrushcross Grange, and,
                  to my agreeable disappointment, she behaved infinitely better than I dared to
                  expect. She seemed almost over-fond of Mr. Linton, and even to his sister she
                  showed plenty of affection. They were both very attentive to her comfort,
                  certainly. It was not the thorn bending to the honeysuckles, but the honeysuckles
                  embracing the thorn. There were no mutual concessions -- one stood erect and the
                  others yielded; and who can be ill-natured and bad-tempered when they encounter
                  neither opposition nor indifference? I observed that Mr. Edgar had a deep-rooted
                  fear of ruffling her humour. He concealed it from her; but if ever he heard me
                  answer sharply, or saw any other servant grow cloudy at some imperious order of
                  hers, he would show his trouble by a frown of displeasure that never darkened on
                  his own account. He many a time spoke sternly to me about my pertness, and averred
                  that the stab of a knife could not inflict a worse pang than he suffered at seeing
                  his lady vexed. Not to grieve a kind master, I learned to be less touchy; and for
                  the space of half a year the gunpowder lay as harmless as sand, because no fire
                  came near to explode it. Catherine had seasons of gloom and silence now and then;
                  they were respected with sympathizing silence by her husband, who ascribed them to
                  an alteration in her constitution, produced by her perilous illness, <pb n="92"
                  />as she was never subject to depression of spirits before. The return of sunshine
                  was welcomed by answering sunshine from him. I believe I may assert that they were
                  really in possession of deep and growing happiness. </p>
               <p>It ended. Well, we must be for ourselves in the long run; the mild and generous
                  are only more justly selfish than the domineering, and it ended when circumstances
                  caused each to feel that the one's interest was not the chief consideration in the
                  other's thoughts. On a mellow evening in September I was coming from the garden
                  with a heavy basket of apples which I had been gathering. It had got dusk, and the
                  moon looked over the high wall of the court, causing undefined shadows to lurk in
                  the corners of the numerous projecting portions of the building. I set my burden
                  on the house steps by the kitchen door, and lingered to rest, and drew in a few
                  more breaths of the soft, sweet air. My eyes were on the moon, and my back to the
                  entrance, when I heard a voice behind me say, -- </p>
               <p>"Nelly, is that you?" </p>
               <p>It was a deep voice, and foreign in tone, yet there was something in the manner of
                  pronouncing my name which made it sound familiar. I turned about to discover who
                  spoke, fearfully; for the doors were shut, and I had seen nobody on approaching
                  the steps. Something stirred in the porch; and moving nearer, I distinguished a
                  tall man dressed in dark clothes, with dark face and hair. He leant against the
                  side, and held his fingers on the latch, as if intending to open for himself. "Who
                  can it be?" I thought. "Mr. Earnshaw? Oh no! The voice has no resemblance to his." </p>
               <p>"I have waited here an hour," he resumed, while I continued staring; "and the
                  whole of that time all round has been as still as death. I dared not enter. You do
                  not know me? Look, I'm not a stranger!" </p>
               <p>A ray fell on his features; the cheeks were sallow and half covered with black
                  whiskers, the brows lowering, the eyes deep-set and singular. I remembered the
                  eyes. </p>
               <pb n="93"/>
               <p>"What!" I cried, uncertain whether to regard him as a worldly visitor, and I
                  raised my hands in amazement. "What! you come back? Is it really you? Is it?" </p>
               <p>"Yes, Heathcliff," he replied, glancing from me up to the windows, which reflected
                  a score of glittering moons, but showed no lights from within. "Are they at home?
                  Where is she? Nelly, you are not glad. You needn't be so disturbed. Is she here?
                  Speak! I want to have one word with her -- your mistress. Go, and say some person
                  from Gimmerton desires to see her." </p>
               <p>"How will she take it?" I exclaimed. "What will she do? The surprise bewilders me.
                  It will put her out of her head. And you are Heathcliff, but altered! Nay, there's
                  no comprehending it. Have you been for a soldier?" </p>
               <p>"Go and carry my message," he interrupted impatiently. "I'm in hell till you do!" </p>
               <p>He lifted the latch, and I entered; but when I got to the parlour where Mr. and
                  Mrs. Linton were, I could not persuade myself to proceed. At length I resolved on
                  making an excuse to ask if they would have the candles lighted, and I opened the
                  door. </p>
               <p>They sat together in a window whose lattice lay back against the wall, and
                  displayed, beyond the garden trees and the wild green park, the valley of
                  Gimmerton, with a long line of mist winding nearly to its top (for very soon after
                  you pass the chapel, as you may have noticed, the sough that runs from the marshes
                  joins a beck which follows the bend of the glen). Wuthering Heights rose above
                  this silvery vapour, but our old house was invisible; it rather dips down on the
                  other side. Both the room and its occupants, and the scene they gazed on, looked
                  wondrously peaceful. I shrank reluctantly from performing my errand, and was
                  actually going away leaving it unsaid, after having put my question about the
                  candles, when a sense of my folly compelled me to return and mutter. "A person
                  from Gimmerton wishes to see you, ma'am." </p>
               <p>"What does he want?" asked Mrs. Linton. </p>
               <p>"I did not question him," I answered. </p>
               <pb n="94"/>
               <p>"Well, close the curtains, Nelly," she said, "and bring up tea. I'll be back again
                  directly." </p>
               <p>She quitted the apartment. Mr. Edgar inquired carelessly who it was. </p>
               <p>"Some one mistress does not expect," I replied. "That Heathcliff -- you recollect
                  him, sir -- who used to live at Mr. Earnshaw's." </p>
               <p>"What! The gipsy -- the ploughboy?" he cried. "Why did you not say so to
                  Catherine?" </p>
               <p>"Hush! you must not call him by those names, master," I said. "She'd be sadly
                  grieved to hear you. She was nearly heartbroken when he ran off. I guess his
                  return will make a jubilee to her." </p>
               <p>Mr. Linton walked to a window on the other side of the room that overlooked the
                  court. He unfastened it and leant out. I suppose they were below, for he exclaimed
                  quickly, "Don't stand there, love! Bring the person in, if it be any one
                  particular." Ere long I heard the click of the latch, and Catherine flew upstairs,
                  breathless and wild, too excited to show gladness; indeed, by her face, you would
                  rather have surmised an awful calamity. </p>
               <p>"O Edgar, Edgar!" she panted, flinging her arms round his neck. "O Edgar darling!
                  Heathcliff's come back -- he is!" And she tightened her embrace to a squeeze. </p>
               <p>"Well, well," cried her husband crossly, "don't strangle me for that. He never
                  struck me as such a marvellous treasure. There is no need to be frantic." </p>
               <p>"I know you didn't like him," she answered, repressing a little the intensity of
                  her delight. "Yet, for my sake, you must be friends now. Shall I tell him to come
                  up?" </p>
               <p>"Here?" he said -- "into the parlour?" </p>
               <p>"Where else?" she asked. </p>
               <p>He looked vexed, and suggested the kitchen as a more suitable place for him. Mrs.
                  Linton eyed him with a droll expression -- half angry, half laughing, at his
                  fastidiousness. </p>
               <pb n="95"/>
               <p>"No," she added, after a while; "I cannot sit in the kitchen. -- Set two tables
                  here, Ellen -- one for your master and Miss Isabella, being gentry; the other for
                  Heathcliff and myself, being of the lower orders. -- Will that please you, dear?
                  Or must I have a fire lighted elsewhere? If so, give directions. I'll run down and
                  secure my guest. I'm afraid the joy is too great to be real!" </p>
               <p>She was about to dart off again, but Edgar arrested her. </p>
               <p>"You bid him step up," he said, addressing me, "and, Catherine, try to be glad
                  without being absurd. The whole household need not witness the sight of your
                  welcoming a runaway servant as a brother." </p>
               <p>I descended and found Heathcliff waiting under the porch, evidently anticipating
                  an invitation to enter. He followed my guidance without waste of words, and I
                  ushered him into the presence of the master and mistress, whose flushed cheeks
                  betrayed signs of warm talking. But the lady's glowed with another feeling when
                  her friend appeared at the door. She sprang forward, took both his hands, and led
                  him to Linton; and then she seized Linton's reluctant fingers and crushed them
                  into his. Now fully revealed by the fire and candlelight, I was amazed more than
                  ever to behold the transformation of Heathcliff. He had grown a tall, athletic,
                  well-formed man, beside whom my master seemed quite slender and youth-like. His
                  upright carriage suggested the idea of his having been in the army. His
                  countenance was much older in expression and decision of feature than Mr.
                  Linton's; it looked intelligent, and retained no marks of former degradation. A
                  half-civilized ferocity lurked yet in the depressed brows and eyes full of black
                  fire, but it was subdued, and his manner was even dignified -- quite divested of
                  roughness, though too stern for grace. My master's surprise equalled or exceeded
                  mine. He remained for a minute at a loss how to address the ploughboy, as he had
                  called him. Heathcliff dropped his slight hand, and stood looking at him coolly
                  till he chose to speak. </p>
               <p>"Sit down, sir," he said at length. "Mrs. Linton, recalling old times, would have
                  me give you a cordial reception; and, of course, I am gratified when anything
                  occurs to please her." </p>
               <pb n="96"/>
               <p>"And I also," answered Heathcliff, "especially if it be anything in which I have a
                  part. I shall stay an hour or two willingly." </p>
               <p>He took a seat opposite Catherine, who kept her gaze fixed on him as if she feared
                  he would vanish were she to remove it. He did not raise his to her often -- a
                  quick glance now and then sufficed; but it flashed back, each time more
                  confidently, the undisguised delight he drank from hers. They were too much
                  absorbed in their mutual joy to suffer embarrassment. Not so Mr. Edgar. He grew
                  pale with pure annoyance -- a feeling that reached its climax when his lady rose,
                  and stepping across the rug, seized Heathcliff's hands again, and laughed like one
                  beside herself. </p>
               <p>"I shall think it a dream to-morrow!" she cried. "I shall not be able to believe
                  that I have seen, and touched, and spoken to you once more. And yet, cruel
                  Heathcliff! you don't deserve this welcome. To be absent and silent for three
                  years, and never to think of me!" </p>
               <p>"A little more than you have thought of me," he murmured. "I heard of your
                  marriage, Cathy, not long since; and while waiting in the yard below I meditated
                  this plan -- just to have one glimpse of your face, a stare of surprise, perhaps,
                  and pretended pleasure; afterwards settle my score with Hindley; and then prevent
                  the law by doing execution on myself. Your welcome has put these ideas out of my
                  mind; but beware of meeting me with another aspect next time! Nay, you'll not
                  drive me off again. You were really sorry for me, were you? Well, there was cause.
                  I've fought through a bitter life since I last heard your voice; and you must
                  forgive me, for I struggled only for you!" </p>
               <p>"Catherine, unless we are to have cold tea, please to come to the table,"
                  interrupted Linton, striving to preserve his ordinary tone, and a due measure of
                  politeness. "Mr. Heathcliff will have a long walk, wherever he may lodge to-night,
                  and I'm thirsty." </p>
               <p>She took her post before the urn; and Miss Isabella came, summoned by the bell;
                  then having handed their chairs forward, I left the room. <pb n="97"/>The meal
                  hardly endured ten minutes. Catherine's cup was never filled. She could neither
                  eat nor drink. Edgar had made a slop in his saucer, and scarcely swallowed a
                  mouthful. Their guest did not protract his stay that evening above an hour longer.
                  I asked, as he departed, if he went to Gimmerton? </p>
               <p>"No; to Wuthering Heights," he answered. "Mr. Earnshaw invited me when I called
                  this morning." </p>
               <p>Mr. Earnshaw invited him! and he called on Mr. Earnshaw! I pondered this sentence
                  painfully after he was gone. Is he turning out a bit of a hypocrite, and coming
                  into the country to work mischief under a cloak? I mused. I had a presentiment in
                  the bottom of my heart that he had better have remained away. </p>
               <p>About the middle of the night I was wakened from my first nap by Mrs. Linton
                  gliding into my chamber, taking a seat on my bedside, and pulling me by the hair
                  to rouse me. </p>
               <p>"I cannot rest, Ellen," she said, by way of apology. "And I want some living
                  creature to keep me company in my happiness. Edgar is sulky because I'm glad of a
                  thing that does not interest him. He refuses to open his mouth, except to utter
                  pettish, silly speeches; and he affirmed I was cruel and selfish for wishing to
                  talk when he was so sick and sleepy. He always contrives to be sick at the least
                  cross! I gave a few sentences of commendation to Heathcliff, and he, either for a
                  headache or a pang of envy, began to cry; so I got up and left him." </p>
               <p>"What use is it praising Heathcliff to him?" I answered. "As lads they had an
                  aversion to each other, and Heathcliff would hate just as much to hear him
                  praised; it's human nature. Let Mr. Linton alone about him, unless you would like
                  an open quarrel between them." </p>
               <p>"But does it not show great weakness?" pursued she. "I'm not envious. I never feel
                  hurt at the brightness of Isabella's yellow hair and the whiteness of her skin, at
                  her dainty elegance and the fondness all the family exhibit for her. Even you,
                  Nelly, if we have a dispute sometimes, you back Isabella at once; and I yield like
                  a foolish mother. I call her a darling, and flatter her into a good temper. It
                  pleases her brother to see us cordial, and that pleases me. But they are very much
                  alike. They are spoiled <pb n="98"/>children, and fancy the world was made for
                  their accommodation; and though I humour both, I think a smart chastisement might
                  improve them, all the same." </p>
               <p>"You're mistaken, Mrs. Linton," said I. "They humour you. I know what there would
                  be to do if they did not. You can well afford to indulge their passing whims as
                  long as their business is to anticipate all your desires. You may, however, fall
                  out at last over something of equal consequence to both sides; and then those you
                  term weak are very capable of being as obstinate as you." </p>
               <p>"And then we shall fight to the death, shan't we, Nelly?" she returned, laughing.
                  "No; I tell you I have such faith in Linton's love that I believe I might kill
                  him, and he wouldn't wish to retaliate." </p>
               <p>I advised her to value him the more for his affection. </p>
               <p>"I do," she answered; "but he needn't resort to whining for trifles. It is
                  childish; and instead of melting into tears because I said that Heathcliff was now
                  worthy of any one's regard, and it would honour the first gentleman in the country
                  to be his friend, he ought to have said it for me, and been delighted from
                  sympathy. He must get accustomed to him, and he may as well like him. Considering
                  how Heathcliff has reason to object to him, I'm sure he behaved excellently." </p>
               <p>"What do you think of his going to Wuthering Heights?" I inquired. "He is reformed
                  in every respect, apparently -- quite a Christian -- offering the right hand of
                  fellowship to his enemies all around!" </p>
               <p>"He explained it," she replied. "I wonder as much as you. He said he called to
                  gather information concerning me from you, supposing you resided there still; and
                  Joseph told Hindley, who came out and fell to questioning him of what he had been
                  doing, and how he had been living, and finally desired him to walk in. There were
                  some persons sitting at cards. Heathcliff joined them. My brother lost some money
                  to him; and finding him plentifully supplied, he requested that he would come
                  again in the evening, to which he consented. Hindley is too reckless to <pb n="99"
                  />select his acquaintance prudently. He doesn't trouble himself to reflect on the
                  causes he might have for mistrusting one whom he has basely injured. But
                  Heathcliff affirms his principal reason for resuming a connection with his ancient
                  persecutor is a wish to install himself in quarters at walking distance from the
                  Grange, and an attachment to the house where we lived together, and likewise a
                  hope that I shall have more opportunities of seeing him there than I could have if
                  he settled in Gimmerton. He means to offer liberal payment for permission to lodge
                  at the Heights; and doubtless my brother's covetousness will prompt him to accept
                  the terms. He was always greedy, though what he grasps with one hand he flings
                  away with the other." </p>
               <p>"It's a nice place for a young man to fix his dwelling in!" said I. Have you no
                  fear of the consequences, Mrs. Linton?" </p>
               <p>"None for my friend," she replied. "His strong head will keep him from danger; a
                  little for Hindley, but he can't be made morally worse than he is; and I stand
                  between him and bodily harm. The event of this evening reconciled me to God and
                  humanity! I had risen in angry rebellion against providence. Oh, I've endured
                  very, very bitter misery, Nelly! If that creature knew how bitter, he'd be ashamed
                  to cloud its removal with idle petulance. It was kindness for him which induced me
                  to bear it alone. Had I expressed the agony I frequently felt, he would have been
                  taught to long for its alleviation as ardently as I. However, it's over, and I'll
                  take no revenge on his folly. I can afford to suffer anything hereafter. Should
                  the meanest thing alive slap me on the cheek, I'd not only turn the other, but I'd
                  ask pardon for provoking it; and as a proof I'll go make my peace with Edgar
                  instantly. Good-night! I'm an angel!" </p>
               <p>In this self-complacent conviction she departed; and the success of her fulfilled
                  resolution was obvious on the morrow. Mr. Linton had not only abjured his
                  peevishness (though his spirits seemed still subdued by Catherine's exuberance of
                  vivacity), but he ventured no objection to her taking Isabella with her to
                  Wuthering Heights in the afternoon; and she rewarded him with <pb n="100"/>such a
                  summer of sweetness and affection in return as made the house a paradise for
                  several days, both master and servants profiting from the perpetual sunshine. </p>
               <p>Heathcliff -- Mr. Heathcliff, I should say in future -- used the liberty of
                  visiting at Thrushcross Grange cautiously, at first. He seemed estimating how far
                  its owner would bear his intrusion. Catherine, also, deemed it judicious to
                  moderate her expressions of pleasure in receiving him; and he gradually
                  established his right to be expected. He retained a great deal of the reserve for
                  which his boyhood was remarkable; and that served to repress all startling
                  demonstrations of feeling. My master's uneasiness experienced a lull, and further
                  circumstances diverted it into another channel for a space. </p>
               <p>His new source of trouble sprang from the not-anticipated misfortune of Isabella
                  Linton evincing a sudden and irresistible attraction towards the tolerated guest.
                  She was at that time a charming young lady of eighteen, infantile in manners,
                  though possessed of keen wit, keen feelings, and a keen temper, too, if irritated.
                  Her brother, who loved her tenderly, was appalled at this fantastic preference.
                  Leaving aside the degradation of an alliance with a nameless man, and the possible
                  fact that his property, in default of heirs, male, might pass into such a one's
                  power, he had sense to comprehend Heathcliff's disposition -- to know that, though
                  his exterior was altered, his mind was unchangeable and unchanged. And he dreaded
                  that mind. It revolted him. He shrank forebodingly from the idea of committing
                  Isabella to its keeping. He would have recoiled still more had he been aware that
                  her attachment rose unsolicited, and was bestowed where it awakened no
                  reciprocation of sentiment, for the minute he discovered its existence he laid the
                  blame on Heathcliff's deliberate designing. </p>
               <p>We had all remarked, during some time, that Miss Linton fretted, and pined over
                  something. She grew cross and wearisome, snapping at and teasing Catherine
                  continually, at the imminent risk of exhausting her limited patience. We excused
                  her, to a <pb n="101"/>certain extent, on the plea of ill-health. She was
                  dwindling and fading before our eyes. But one day, when she had been peculiarly
                  wayward, rejecting her breakfast, complaining that the servants did not do what
                  she told them; that the mistress would allow her to be nothing in the house, and
                  Edgar neglected her; that she had caught a cold with the doors being left open,
                  and we let the parlour fire go out on purpose to vex her, with a hundred yet more
                  frivolous accusations, Mrs. Linton peremptorily insisted that she should get to
                  bed, and having scolded her heartily, threatened to send for the doctor. Mention
                  of Kenneth caused her to exclaim instantly that her health was perfect, and it was
                  only Catherine's harshness which made her unhappy. </p>
               <p>"How can you say I am harsh, you naughty fondling?" cried the mistress, amazed at
                  the unreasonable assertion. "You are surely losing your reason. When have I been
                  harsh, tell me?" </p>
               <p>"Yesterday," sobbed Isabella, "and now!" </p>
               <p>"Yesterday!" said her sister-in-law. "On what occasion?" </p>
               <p>"In our walk along the moor. You told me to ramble where I pleased, while you
                  sauntered on with Mr. Heathcliff!" </p>
               <p>"And that's your notion of harshness?" said Catherine, laughing. "It was no hint
                  that your company was superfluous. We didn't care whether you kept with us or not.
                  I merely thought Heathcliff's talk would have nothing entertaining for your ears." </p>
               <p>"Oh no," wept the young lady; "you wished me away because you knew I liked to be
                  there!" </p>
               <p>"Is she sane?" asked Mrs. Linton, appealing to me. "I'll repeat our conversation,
                  word for word, Isabella; and you point out any charm it could have had for you." </p>
               <p>"I don't mind the conversation," she answered. "I wanted to be with -- " </p>
               <p>"Well?" said Catherine, perceiving her hesitate to complete the sentence. </p>
               <p>"With him; and I won't be always sent off!" she continued, <pb n="102"/>kindling
                  up. "You are a dog in the manger, Cathy, and desire no one to be loved but
                  yourself!" </p>
               <p>"You are an impertinent little monkey!" exclaimed Mrs. Linton, in surprise. "But
                  I'll not believe this idiocy. It is impossible that you can covet the admiration
                  of Heathcliff -- that you consider him an agreeable person! I hope I have
                  misunderstood you, Isabella?" </p>
               <p>"No, you have not," said the infatuated girl. "I love him more than ever you loved
                  Edgar; and he might love me, if you would let him!" </p>
               <p>"I wouldn't be you for a kingdom, then!" Catherine declared emphatically; and she
                  seemed to speak sincerely. -- "Nelly, help me to convince her of her madness. Tell
                  her what Heathcliff is -- an unreclaimed creature, without refinement, without
                  cultivation, an arid wilderness of furze and whinstone. I'd as soon put that
                  little canary into the park on a winter's day, as recommend you to bestow your
                  heart on him. It is deplorable ignorance of his character, child, and nothing
                  else, which makes that dream enter your head. Pray don't imagine that he conceals
                  depths of benevolence and affection beneath a stern exterior. He's not a rough
                  diamond, a pearl-containing oyster of a rustic. He's a fierce, pitiless, wolfish
                  man. I never say to him, 'Let this or that enemy alone, because it would be
                  ungenerous or cruel to harm them.' I say, 'Let them alone, because I should hate
                  them to be wronged.' And he'd crush you like a sparrow's egg, Isabella, if he
                  found you a troublesome charge. I know he couldn't love a Linton; and yet he'd be
                  quite capable of marrying your fortune and expectations. Avarice is growing with
                  him a besetting sin. There's my picture; and I'm his friend -- so much so, that
                  had he thought seriously to catch you, I should perhaps have held my tongue, and
                  let you fall into his trap." </p>
               <p>Miss Linton regarded her sister-in-law with indignation. </p>
               <p>"For shame! for shame!" she repeated angrily; "you are worse than twenty foes, you
                  poisonous friend!" </p>
               <p>"Ah! you won't believe me, then?" said Catherine. "You think I speak from wicked
                  selfishness?" </p>
               <pb n="103"/>
               <p>"I'm certain you do," retorted Isabella; "and I shudder at you!" </p>
               <p>"Good!" cried the other. "Try for yourself, if that be your spirit. I have done,
                  and yield the argument to your saucy insolence." </p>
               <p>"And I must suffer for her egotism!" she sobbed, as Mrs. Linton left the room.
                  "All, all is against me. She has blighted my single consolation. But she uttered
                  falsehoods, didn't she? Mr. Heathcliff is not a fiend. He has an honourable soul,
                  and a true one, or how could he remember her?" </p>
               <p>"Banish him from your thoughts, miss," I said. "He's a bird of bad omen -- no mate
                  for you. Mrs. Linton spoke strongly, and yet I can't contradict her. She is better
                  acquainted with his heart than I, or any one besides; and she never would
                  represent him as worse than he is. Honest people don't hide their deeds. How has
                  he been living? How has he got rich? Why is he staying at Wuthering Heights, the
                  house of a man whom he abhors? They say Mr. Earnshaw is worse and worse since he
                  came. They sit up all night together continually, and Hindley has been borrowing
                  money on his land, and does nothing but play and drink. I heard only a week ago --
                  it was Joseph who told me -- I met him at Gimmerton. 'Nelly,' he said, 'we's hae a
                  crowner's 'quest enow, at ahr folks. One on 'em's a'most getten his finger cut off
                  wi' hauding t'other fro' stickin hisseln loike a cawlf. That's maister, yah knaw,
                  'at's soa up o' going tuh t' grand 'sizes. He's noan feared o' t' bench o' judges,
                  norther Paul, nur Peter, nur John, nur Matthew, nor noan on 'em, not he. He fair
                  likes -- he langs to set his brazened face agean 'em. And yon bonny lad
                  Heathcliff, yah mind, he's a rare un! He can girn a laugh as well's onybody at a
                  raight divil's jest. Does he niver say nowt of his fine living amang us, when he
                  goes to t' Grange? This is t' way on't. Up at sundown; dice, brandy, cloised
                  shutters, un can'le-light till next day at noon; then, t' fooil gangs banning un
                  raving to his cham'er, makking dacent fowks dig thur fingers i' thur lugs fur
                  varry shame; un the knave, why he can caint his brass, <pb n="104"/>un ate, un
                  sleep, un off to his neighbour's to gossip wi' t' wife. I' course, he tells Dame
                  Catherine how her fathur's goold runs into his pocket, and her fathur's son
                  gallops down t' broad road, while he flees afore to oppen t' pikes!' Now, Miss
                  Linton, Joseph is an old rascal, but no liar; and if his account of Heathcliff's
                  conduct be true, you would never think of desiring such a husband, would you?" </p>
               <p>"You are leagued with the rest, Ellen!" she replied. "I'll not listen to your
                  slanders. What malevolence you must have to wish to convince me that there is no
                  happiness in the world!" </p>
               <p>Whether she would have got over this fancy if left to herself, or persevered in
                  nursing it perpetually, I cannot say. She had little time to reflect. The day
                  after, there was a justice meeting at the next town. My master was obliged to
                  attend; and Mr. Heathcliff, aware of his absence, called rather earlier than
                  usual. Catherine and Isabella were sitting in the library, on hostile terms, but
                  silent -- the latter alarmed at her recent indiscretion, and the disclosure she
                  had made of her secret feelings in a transient fit of passion; the former, on
                  mature consideration, really offended with her companion, and if she laughed again
                  at her pertness, inclined to make it no laughing matter to her. She did laugh as
                  she saw Heathcliff pass the window. I was sweeping the hearth, and I noticed a
                  mischievous smile on her lips. Isabella, absorbed in her meditations, or a book,
                  remained till the door opened; and it was too late to attempt an escape, which she
                  would gladly have done had it been practicable. </p>
               <p>"Come in; that's right!" exclaimed the mistress gaily, pulling a chair to the
                  fire. "Here are two people sadly in need of a third to thaw the ice between them;
                  and you are the very one we should both of us choose. Heathcliff, I'm proud to
                  show you, at last, somebody that dotes on you more than myself. I expect you to
                  feel flattered. Nay, it's not Nelly; don't look at her! My poor little
                  sister-in-law is breaking her heart by mere contemplation of your physical and
                  moral beauty. It lies in your own power to be Edgar's brother. -- No, no,
                  Isabella; you shan't run off," she continued, arresting, with feigned playfulness,
                  the confounded girl, who had risen indignantly. -- "We were quarrelling like cats
                     <pb n="105"/> about you, Heathcliff, and I was fairly beaten in protestations
                  of devotion and admiration; and, moreover, I was informed that if I would but have
                  the manners to stand aside, my rival, as she will have herself to be, would shoot
                  a shaft into your soul that would fix you for ever, and send my image into eternal
                  oblivion!" </p>
               <p>"Catherine!" said Isabella, calling up her dignity, and disdaining to struggle
                  from the tight grasp that held her, "I'd thank you to adhere to the truth, and not
                  slander me, even in joke. -- Mr. Heathcliff, be kind enough to bid this friend of
                  yours release me. She forgets that you and I are not intimate acquaintances; and
                  what amuses her is painful to me beyond expression." </p>
               <p>"As the guest answered nothing, but took his seat, and looked thoroughly
                  indifferent what sentiments she cherished concerning him, she turned and whispered
                  an earnest appeal for liberty to her tormentor. </p>
               <p>"By no means!" cried Mrs. Linton in answer. "I won't be named a dog in the manger
                  again. You shall stay. -- Now, then, Heathcliff, why don't you evince satisfaction
                  at my pleasant news? Isabella swears that the love Edgar has for me is nothing to
                  that she entertains for you. I'm sure she made some speech of the kind -- did she
                  not, Ellen? And she has fasted ever since the day before yesterday's walk, from
                  sorrow and rage that I dispatched her out of your society under the idea of its
                  being unacceptable." </p>
               <p>"I think you belie her," said Heathcliff, twisting his chair to face them. "She
                  wishes to be out of my society now, at any rate." </p>
               <p>And he stared hard at the object of discourse, as one might do at a strange,
                  repulsive animal -- a centipede from the Indies, for instance, which curiosity
                  leads one to examine in spite of the aversion it raises. The poor thing couldn't
                  bear that. She grew white and red in rapid succession, and, while tears beaded her
                  lashes, bent the strength of her small fingers to loosen the firm clutch of
                  Catherine; and perceiving that as fast as she raised one finger off her arm
                  another closed down, and she could not remove the whole together, she began to
                  make use of her nails; and their sharpness presently ornamented the detainer's
                  with crescents of red. </p>
               <p>"There's a tigress!" exclaimed Mrs. Linton, setting her free, <pb n="106"/>and
                  shaking her hand with pain. "Begone, for God's sake, and hide your vixen face! How
                  foolish to reveal those talons to him! Can't you fancy the conclusions he'll draw?
                  -- Look, Heathcliff! they are instruments that will do execution; you must beware
                  of your eyes." </p>
               <p>"I'd wrench them off her fingers if they ever menaced me," he answered brutally,
                  when the door had closed after her. "But what did you mean by teasing the creature
                  in that manner, Cathy? You were not speaking the truth, were you?" </p>
               <p>"I assure you I was," she returned. "She has been dying for your sake several
                  weeks, and raving about you this morning, and pouring forth a deluge of abuse,
                  because I represented your failings in a plain light, for the purpose of
                  mitigating her adoration. But don't notice it further. I wished to punish her
                  sauciness -- that's all. I like her too well, my dear Heathcliff, to let you
                  absolutely seize and devour her up." </p>
               <p>"And I like her too ill to attempt it," said he, "except in a very ghoulish
                  fashion. You'd hear of odd things if I lived alone with that mawkish, waxen face.
                  The most ordinary would be painting on its white the colours of the rainbow, and
                  turning the blue eyes black, every day or two. They detestably resemble Linton's." </p>
               <p>"Delectably!" observed Catherine. "They are dove's eyes -- angel's!" </p>
               <p>"She's her brother's heir, is she not?" he asked, after a brief silence. </p>
               <p>"I should be sorry to think so," returned his companion. "Half a dozen nephews
                  shall erase her title please Heaven! Abstract your mind from the subject at
                  present. You are too prone to covet your neighbour's goods. Remember this
                  neighbour's goods are mine." </p>
               <p>"If they were mine, they would be none the less that," said Heathcliff; "but
                  though Isabella Linton may be silly, she is scarcely mad; and, in short, we'll
                  dismiss the matter, as you advise." </p>
               <p>From their tongues they did dismiss it; and Catherine, probably, <pb n="107"/>from
                  her thoughts. The other, I felt certain, recalled it often in the course of the
                  evening. I saw him smile to himself -- grin rather -- and lapse into ominous
                  musing whenever Mrs. Linton had occasion to be absent from the apartment. </p>
               <p>I determined to watch his movements. My heart invariably cleaved to the master's,
                  in preference to Catherine's side -- with reason, I imagined, for he was kind, and
                  trustful, and honourable; and she -- she could not be called the opposite, yet she
                  seemed to allow herself such wide latitude that I had little faith in her
                  principles, and still less sympathy for her feelings. I wanted something to happen
                  which might have the effect of freeing both Wuthering Heights and the Grange of
                  Mr. Heathcliff quietly, leaving us as we had been prior to his advent. His visits
                  were a continual nightmare to me, and, I suspected, to my master also. His abode
                  at the Heights was an oppression past explaining. I felt that God had forsaken the
                  stray sheep there to its own wicked wanderings, and an evil beast prowled between
                  it and the fold, waiting his time to spring and destroy. </p>

               <pb n="108"/>
               <p>Sometimes, while meditating on these things in solitude, I've got up in a sudden
                  terror, and put on my bonnet to go see how all was at the farm; I've persuaded my
                  conscience that it was a duty to warn him how people talked regarding his ways;
                  and then I've recollected his confirmed bad habits, and, hopeless of benefiting
                  him, have flinched from re-entering the dismal house, doubting if I could bear to
                  be taken at my word.</p>
               <p>One time, I passed the old gate, going out of my way, on a journey to Gimmerton.
                  It was about the period that my narrative has reached -- a bright, frosty
                  afternoon; the ground bare, and the road hard and dry.</p>
               <p>I came to a stone where the highway branches off on to the moor at your left hand;
                  a rough sand-pillar, with the letters W. H. cut on its north side, on the east,
                  G., and on the south-west, T. G. It serves as guide-post to the Grange, and
                  Heights, and village.</p>
               <p>The sun shone yellow on its grey head, reminding me of summer; and I cannot say
                  why, but all at once, a gush of child's sensations flowed into my heart. Hindley
                  and I held it a favourite spot twenty years before.</p>
               <p>I gazed long at the weather-worn block; and, stooping down, perceived a hole near
                  the bottom still full of snail-shells and pebbles which we were fond of storing
                  there with more perish-able things -- and, as fresh as reality, it appeared that I
                  beheld my early playmate seated on the withered turf, his dark, square head bent
                  forward, and his little hand scooping out the earth with a piece of slate.</p>
               <p>"Poor Hindley!" I exclaimed involuntarily. </p>
               <p> I started. My bodily eye was cheated into a momentary belief that the child
                  lifted its face and stared straight into mine! It vanished in a twinkling; but
                  immediately I felt an irresistible yearning to be at the Heights. Superstition
                  urged me to comply <pb n="109"/>with this impulse. Supposing he should be dead, I
                  thought, or should die soon! -- supposing it were a sign of death! </p>
               <p>The nearer I got to the house the more agitated I grew; and on catching sight of
                  it I trembled every limb. The apparition had outstripped me. It stood looking
                  through the gate. That was my first idea on observing an elf-locked, brown-eyed
                  boy setting his ruddy countenance against the bars. Further reflection suggested
                  this must be Hareton, my Hareton, not altered greatly since I left him, ten months
                  since. </p>
               <p>"God bless thee, darling!" I cried, forgetting instantaneously my foolish fears.
                  "Hareton, it's Nelly -- Nelly, thy nurse." </p>
               <p>He retreated out of arm's length, and picked up a large flint. </p>
               <p>"I am come to see thy father, Hareton," I added, guessing from the action that
                  Nelly, if she lived in his memory at all, was not recognized as one with me. </p>
               <p>He raised his missile to hurl it. I commenced a soothing speech, but could not
                  stay his hand. The stone struck my bonnet; and then ensued, from the stammering
                  lips of the little fellow, a string of curses, which, whether he comprehended them
                  or not, were delivered with practised emphasis, and distorted his baby features
                  into a shocking expression of malignity. You may be certain this grieved more than
                  angered me. Fit to cry, I took an orange from my pocket, and offered it to
                  propitiate him. He hesitated, and then snatched it from my hold, as if he fancied
                  I only intended to tempt and disappoint him. I showed another, keeping it out of
                  his reach. </p>
               <p>"Who has taught you those fine words, my bairn?" I inquired -- "the curate?" </p>
               <p>"Damn the curate, and thee! Gie me that," he replied. </p>
               <p>"Tell us where you got your lessons, and you shall have it," said I. "Who's your
                  master?" </p>
               <p>"Devil daddy," was his answer. </p>
               <p>"And what do you learn from daddy?" I continued. </p>
               <p>He jumped at the fruit. I raised it higher. "What does he teach you?" I asked. </p>
               <pb n="110"/>
               <p>"Naught," said he, "but to keep out of his gait. Daddy cannot bide me, because I
                  swear at him." </p>
               <p>"Ah! and the devil teaches you to swear at daddy?" I observed. </p>
               <p>"Ay -- nay," he drawled. </p>
               <p>"Who, then?" </p>
               <p>"Heathcliff." </p>
               <p>I asked if he liked Mr. Heathcliff. </p>
               <p>"Ay!" he answered again. </p>
               <p>Desiring to have his reasons for liking him, I could only gather the sentences, "I
                  known't. He pays dad back what he gies to me; he curses daddy for cursing me. He
                  says I mun do as I will." </p>
               <p>"And the curate does not teach you to read and write then?" I pursued. </p>
               <p>"No, I was told the curate should have his -- teeth dashed down his -- throat if
                  he stepped over the threshold. Heathcliff had promised that!" </p>
               <p>I put the orange in his hand, and bade him tell his father that a woman called
                  Nelly Dean was waiting to speak with him by the garden gate. He went up the walk,
                  and entered the house; but instead of Hindley, Heathcliff appeared on the door
                  stones; and I turned directly and ran down the road as hard as ever I could race,
                  making no halt till I gained the guide-post, and feeling as scared as if I had
                  raised a goblin. This is not much connected with Miss Isabella's affair, except
                  that it urged me to resolve further on mounting vigilant guard, and doing my
                  utmost to check the spread of such bad influence at the Grange, even though I
                  should wake a domestic storm by thwarting Mrs. Linton's pleasure. </p>
               <p>The next time Heathcliff came, my young lady chanced to be feeding some pigeons in
                  the court. She had never spoken a word to her sister-in-law for three days; but
                  she had likewise dropped her fretful complaining, and we found it a great comfort.
                  Heathcliff had not the habit of bestowing a single unnecessary <pb n="111"
                  />civility on Miss Linton, I knew. Now, as soon as he beheld her, his first
                  precaution was to take a sweeping survey of the house-front. I was standing by the
                  kitchen window, but I drew out of sight. He then stepped across the pavement to
                  her, and said something. She seemed embarrassed and desirous of getting away; to
                  prevent it, he laid his hand on her arm. She averted her face. He apparently put
                  some question which she had no mind to answer. There was another rapid glance at
                  the house; and supposing himself unseen, the scoundrel had the impudence to
                  embrace her. </p>
               <p>"Judas! traitor!" I ejaculated. "You are a hypocrite, too, are you -- a deliberate
                  deceiver?" </p>
               <p>"Who is, Nelly?" said Catherine's voice at my elbow. I had been over-intent on
                  watching the pair outside to mark her entrance. </p>
               <p>"Your worthless friend!" I answered warmly -- "the sneaking rascal yonder. Ah, he
                  has caught a glimpse of us; he is coming in! I wonder will he have the heart to
                  find a plausible excuse for making love to miss, when he told you he hated her?" </p>
               <p>Mrs. Linton saw Isabella tear herself free, and run into the garden; and a minute
                  after Heathcliff opened the door. I couldn't withhold giving some loose to my
                  indignation; but Catherine angrily insisted on silence, and threatened to order me
                  out of the kitchen, if I dared to be so presumptuous as to put in my insolent
                  tongue. </p>
               <p>"To hear you, people might think you were the mistress!" she cried. "You want
                  setting down in your right place! -- Heathcliff, what are you about, raising this
                  stir? I said you must let Isabella alone! I beg you will, unless you are tired of
                  being received here, and wish Linton to draw the bolts against you!" </p>
               <p>"God forbid that he should try!" answered the black villain. I detested him just
                  then. "God keep him meek and patient! Every day I grow madder after sending him to
                  heaven!" </p>
               <p>"Hush!" said Catherine, shutting the inner door. "Don't vex me. Why have you
                  disregarded my request? Did she come across you on purpose?" </p>
               <pb n="112"/>
               <p>"What is it to you?" he growled. "I have a right to kiss her, if she chooses; and
                  you have no right to object. I am not your husband; you needn't be jealous of me." </p>
               <p>"I'm not jealous of you," replied the mistress -- "I'm jealous for you. Clear your
                  face; you shan't scowl at me! If you like Isabella, you shall marry her. But do
                  you like her? Tell the truth, Heathcliff. There, you won't answer. I'm certain you
                  don't." </p>
               <p>"And would Mr. Linton approve of his sister marrying that man?" I inquired. </p>
               <p>"Mr. Linton should approve," returned my lady decisively. </p>
               <p>"He might spare himself the trouble," said Heathcliff; "I could do as well without
                  his approbation. And as to you, Catherine, I have a mind to speak a few words now,
                  while we are at it. I want you to be aware that I know you have treated me
                  infernally -- infernally! Do you hear? And if you flatter yourself that I don't
                  perceive it, you are a fool; and if you think I can be consoled by sweet words,
                  you are an idiot; and if you fancy I'll suffer unrevenged, I'll convince you of
                  the contrary in a very little while. Meantime, thank you for telling me your
                  sister-in-law's secret. I swear I'll make the most of it. And stand you aside." </p>
               <p>"What new phase of his character is this?" exclaimed Mrs. Linton, in amazement.
                  "I've treated you infernally, and you'll take your revenge! How will you take it,
                  ungrateful brute? How have I treated you infernally?" </p>
               <p>"I seek no revenge on you," replied Heathcliff, less vehemently. "That's not the
                  plan. The tyrant grinds down his slaves, and they don't turn against him; they
                  crush those beneath them. You are welcome to torture me to death for your
                  amusement, only allow me to amuse myself a little in the same style, and refrain
                  from insult as much as you are able. Having levelled my palace, don't erect a
                  hovel and complacently admire your own charity in giving me that for a home. lf I
                  imagined you really wished me to marry Isabel, I'd cut my throat!" </p>
               <p>"Oh, the evil is that I am not jealous, is it?" cried Catherine. "Well, I won't
                  repeat my offer of a wife. It is as bad as offering Satan a lost soul. Your bliss
                  lies, like his, in inflicting misery. You prove it. Edgar is restored from the
                  ill-temper he gave way <pb n="113"/>to at your coming. I begin to be secure and
                  tranquil; and you, restless to know us at peace, appear resolved on exciting a
                  quarrel. Quarrel with Edgar, if you please, Heathcliff, and deceive his sister.
                  You'll hit on exactly the most efficient method of revenging yourself on me." </p>
               <p>The conversation ceased. Mrs. Linton sat down by the fire, flushed and gloomy. The
                  spirit which served her was growing intractable; she could neither lay nor control
                  it. He stood on the hearth with folded arms, brooding on his evil thoughts; and in
                  this position I left them to seek the master, who was wondering what kept
                  Catherine below so long. </p>
               <p>"Ellen," said he, when I entered, "have you seen your mistress?" </p>
               <p>"Yes; she's in the kitchen, sir," I answered. "She's sadly put out by Mr.
                  Heathcliff's behaviour; and, indeed, I do think it's time to arrange his visits on
                  another footing. There's harm in being too soft, and now it's come to this -- "
                  And I related the scene in the court, and, as near as I dared, the whole
                  subsequent dispute. I fancied it could not be very prejudicial to Mrs. Linton,
                  unless she made it so afterwards by assuming the defensive for her guest. Edgar
                  Linton had difficulty in hearing me to the close. His first words revealed that he
                  did not clear his wife of blame. </p>
               <p>"This is insufferable!" he exclaimed. "It is disgraceful that she should own him
                  for a friend, and force his company on me! Call me two men out of the hall, Ellen.
                  Catherine shall linger no longer to argue with the low ruffian. I have humoured
                  her enough." </p>
               <p>He descended, and bidding the servants wait in the passage, went, followed by me,
                  to the kitchen. Its occupants had recommenced their angry discussion. Mrs. Linton,
                  at least, was scolding with renewed vigour. Heathcliff had moved to the window,
                  and hung his head, somewhat cowed by her violent rating apparently. He saw the
                  master first, and made a hasty motion that she should be silent; which she obeyed
                  abruptly, on discovering the reason of his intimation. </p>
               <p>"How is this?" said Linton, addressing her. "What notion of <pb n="114"/>propriety
                  must you have to remain here, after the language which has been held to you by
                  that blackguard? I suppose, because it is his ordinary talk, you think nothing of
                  it. You are habituated to his baseness, and, perhaps, imagine I can get used to it
                  too." </p>
               <p>"Have you been listening at the door, Edgar?" asked the mistress, in a tone
                  particularly calculated to provoke her husband, implying both carelessness and
                  contempt of his irritation. Heathcliff, who had raised his eyes at the former
                  speech, gave a sneering laugh at the latter -- on purpose, it seemed, to draw Mr.
                  Linton's attention to him. He succeeded; but Edgar did not mean to entertain him
                  with any high flights of passion. </p>
               <p>"I have been so far forbearing with you, sir," he said quietly -- "not that I was
                  ignorant of your miserable, degraded character, but I felt you were only partly
                  responsible for that; and Catherine wishing to keep up your acquaintance, I
                  acquiesced -- foolishly. Your presence is a moral poison that would contaminate
                  the most virtuous. For that cause, and to prevent worse consequences, I shall deny
                  you hereafter admission into this house, and give notice now that I require your
                  instant departure. Three minutes' delay will render it involuntary and
                  ignominious." </p>
               <p>Heathcliff measured the height and breadth of the speaker with an eye full of
                  derision. </p>
               <p>"Cathy, this lamb of yours threatens like a bull!" he said. "It is in danger of
                  splitting its skull against my knuckles. -- By God, Mr. Linton, I'm mortally sorry
                  that you are not worth knocking down!" </p>
               <p>My master glanced towards the passage, and signed me to fetch the men. He had no
                  intention of hazarding a personal encounter. I obeyed the hint; but Mrs. Linton,
                  suspecting something, followed; and when I attempted to call them, she pulled me
                  back, slammed the door to, and locked it. </p>
               <p>"Fair means!" she said, in answer to her husband's look of angry surprise. "If you
                  have not courage to attack him, make an apology, or allow yourself to be beaten.
                  It will correct you of <pb n="115"/>feigning more valour than you possess. No,
                  I'll swallow the key before you shall get it! I'm delightfully rewarded for my
                  kindness to each! After constant indulgence of one's weak nature, and the other's
                  bad one, I earn for thanks two samples of blind ingratitude, stupid to absurdity!
                  Edgar, I was defending you and yours; and I wish Heathcliff may flog you sick for
                  daring to think an evil thought of me!" </p>
               <p>It did not need the medium of a flogging to produce that effect on the master. He
                  tried to wrest the key from Catherine's grasp, and for safety she flung it into
                  the hottest part of the fire; whereupon Mr. Edgar was taken with a nervous
                  trembling, and his countenance grew deadly pale. For his life he could not avert
                  that excess of emotion; mingled anguish and humiliation overcame him completely.
                  He leant on the back of a chair, and covered his face. </p>
               <p>"O heavens! In old days this would win you knighthood!" exclaimed Mrs. Linton. "We
                  are vanquished! we are vanquished! Heathcliff would as soon lift a finger at you
                  as a king would march his army against a colony of mice. Cheer up; you shan't be
                  hurt! Your type is not a lamb; it's a sucking leveret." </p>
               <p>"I wish you joy of the milk-blooded coward, Cathy!" said her friend. "I compliment
                  you on your taste. And that is the slavering, shivering thing you preferred to me!
                  I would not strike him with my fist, but I'd kick him with my foot, and experience
                  considerable satisfaction. Is he weeping, or is he going to faint for fear?" </p>
               <p>The fellow approached and gave the chair on which Linton rested a push. He'd
                  better have kept his distance. My master quickly sprang erect, and struck him full
                  on the throat a blow that would have levelled a slighter man. It took his breath
                  for a minute; and while he choked, Mr. Linton walked out by the back door into the
                  yard, and from thence to the front entrance. </p>
               <p>"There! you've done with coming here," cried Catherine. "Get away, now. He'll
                  return with a brace of pistols and half a dozen assistants. If he did overhear us,
                  of course he'd never <pb n="116"/>forgive you. You've played me an ill turn,
                  Heathcliff. But go -- make haste! I'd rather see Edgar at bay than you." </p>
               <p>"Do you suppose I'm going with that blow burning in my gullet?" he thundered. "By
                  hell, no! I'll crush his ribs in like a rotten hazel-nut before I cross the
                  threshold! If I don't floor him now, I shall murder him some time; so, as you
                  value his existence, let me get at him!" </p>
               <p>"He is not coming," I interposed, framing a bit of a lie. "There's the coachman
                  and the two gardeners. You'll surely not wait to be thrust into the road by them!
                  Each has a bludgeon; and master will very likely be watching from the parlour
                  windows, to see that they fulfil his orders." </p>
               <p>The gardeners and coachman were there, but Linton was with them. They had already
                  entered the court. Heathcliff, on second thoughts, resolved to avoid a struggle
                  against the three underlings. He seized the poker, smashed the lock from the inner
                  door, and made his escape as they tramped in. </p>
               <p>Mrs. Linton, who was very much excited, bade me accompany her upstairs. She did
                  not know my share in contributing to the disturbance, and I was anxious to keep
                  her in ignorance. </p>
               <p>"I'm nearly distracted, Nelly!" she exclaimed, throwing herself on the sofa. "A
                  thousand smiths' hammers are beating in my head! Tell Isabella to shun me; this
                  uproar is owing to her; and should she or any one else aggravate my anger at
                  present, I shall get wild. And, Nelly, say to Edgar, if you see him again
                  to-night, that I'm in danger of being seriously ill. I wish it may prove true. He
                  has startled and distressed me shockingly. I want to frighten him. Besides, he
                  might come and begin a string of abuse or complainings. I'm certain I should
                  recriminate, and God knows where we should end! Will you do so, my good Nelly? You
                  are aware that I am no way blamable in this matter. What possessed him to turn
                  listener? Heathcliff's talk was outrageous after you left us; but I could soon
                  have diverted him from Isabella, and the rest meant nothing. Now all is dashed
                  wrong, by the fool's craving to hear evil of self that haunts some people like a
                  demon. Had Edgar never gathered our conversation, he would <pb n="117"/>never have
                  been the worse for it. Really, when he opened on me in that unreasonable tone of
                  displeasure after I had scolded Heathcliff till I was hoarse for him, I did not
                  care hardly what they did to each other -- especially as I felt that, however the
                  scene closed, we should all be driven asunder for nobody knows how long! Well, if
                  I cannot keep Heathcliff for my friend -- if Edgar will be mean and jealous --
                  I'll try to break their hearts by breaking my own. That will be a prompt way of
                  finishing all, when I am pushed to extremity. But it's a deed to be reserved for a
                  forlorn hope; I'd not take Linton by surprise with it. To this point he has been
                  discreet in dreading to provoke me. You must represent the peril of quitting that
                  policy, and remind him of my passionate temper, verging, when kindled, on frenzy.
                  I wish you could dismiss that apathy out of that countenance, and look rather more
                  anxious about me." </p>
               <p>The stolidity with which I received these instructions was, no doubt, rather
                  exasperating, for they were delivered in perfect sincerity; but I believed a
                  person who could plan the turning of her fits of passion to account beforehand
                  might, by exerting her will, manage to control herself tolerably, even while under
                  their influence; and I did not wish to "frighten" her husband, as she said, and
                  multiply his annoyances for the purpose of serving her selfishness. Therefore I
                  said nothing when I met the master coming towards the parlour; but I took the
                  liberty of turning back to listen whether they would resume their quarrel
                  together. He began to speak first. </p>
               <p>"Remain where you are, Catherine," he said, without any anger in his voice, but
                  with much sorrowful despondency. "I shall not stay. I am neither come to wrangle
                  nor be reconciled; but I wish just to learn whether, after this evening's events,
                  you intend to continue your intimacy with -- " </p>
               <p>"Oh, for mercy's sake," interrupted the mistress, stamping her foot -- "for
                  mercy's sake, let us hear no more of it now! Your cold blood cannot be worked into
                  a fever. Your veins are full of ice-water; but mine are boiling, and the sight of
                  such chillness makes them dance." </p>
               <pb n="118"/>
               <p>"To get rid of me, answer my question," persevered Mr. Linton. "You must answer
                  it, and that violence does not alarm me. I have found that you can be as stoical
                  as any one, when you please. Will you give up Heathcliff hereafter, or will you
                  give up me? It is impossible for you to be my friend and his at the same time; and
                  I absolutely require to know which you choose." </p>
               <p>"I require to be let alone!" exclaimed Catherine furiously. "I demand it! Don't
                  you see I can scarcely stand? Edgar, you -- you leave me!" </p>
               <p>She rang the bell till it broke with a twang. I entered leisurely. It was enough
                  to try the temper of a saint, such senseless, wicked rages! There she lay dashing
                  her head against the arm of the sofa, and grinding her teeth, so that you might
                  fancy she would crash them to splinters! Mr. Linton stood looking at her in sudden
                  compunction and fear. He told me to fetch some water. She had no breath for
                  speaking. I brought a glass full; and as she would not drink, I sprinkled it on
                  her face. In a few seconds she stretched herself out stiff, and turned up her
                  eyes, while her cheeks, at once blanched and livid, assumed the aspect of death.
                  Linton looked terrified. </p>
               <p>"There is nothing in the world the matter," I whispered. I did not want him to
                  yield, though I could not help being afraid in my heart. </p>
               <p>"She has blood on her lips!" he said, shuddering. </p>
               <p>"Never mind!" I answered tartly. And I told him how she had resolved, previous to
                  his coming, on exhibiting a fit of frenzy. I incautiously gave the account aloud,
                  and she heard me, for she started up, her hair flying over her shoulders, her eyes
                  flashing, the muscles of her neck and arms standing out preternaturally. I made up
                  my mind for broken bones at least; but she only glared about her for an instant,
                  and then rushed from the room. The master directed me to follow. I did, to her
                  chamber door. She hindered me from going farther by securing it against me. </p>
               <pb n="119"/>
               <p>As she never offered to descend to breakfast next morning, I went to ask whether
                  she would have some carried up. "No!" she replied peremptorily. The same question
                  was repeated at dinner and tea, and again on the morrow after, and received the
                  same answer. Mr. Linton, on his part, spent his time in the library, and did not
                  inquire concerning his wife's occupations. Isabella and he had had an hour's
                  interview, during which he tried to elicit from her some sentiment of proper
                  horror for Heathcliff's advances; but he could make nothing of her evasive
                  replies, and was obliged to close the examination unsatisfactorily, adding,
                  however, a solemn warning that if she were so insane as to encourage that
                  worthless suitor, it would dissolve all bonds of relationship between herself and
                  him. </p>

               <p>While Miss Linton moped about the park and garden, always silent, and almost
                  always in tears; and her brother shut himself up among books that he never opened
                  -- wearying, I guessed, with a continual vague expectation that Catherine,
                  repenting her conduct, would come of her own accord to ask pardon, and seek a
                  reconciliation; and she fasted pertinaciously under the idea, probably, that at
                  every meal, Edgar was ready to choke for her absence, and pride alone held him
                  from running to cast himself at her feet; I went about my household duties,
                  convinced that the Grange had but one sensible soul in its walls, and that lodged
                  in my body.</p>
               <p>I wasted no condolences on miss, nor any expostulations on my mistress, nor did I
                  pay attention to the sighs of my master, who yearned to hear his lady's name,
                  since he might not hear her voice.</p>
               <p>I determined they should come about as they pleased for me; and though it was a
                  tiresomely slow process, I began to rejoice at length in a faint dawn of its
                  progress, as I thought at first.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Linton, on the third day, unbarred her door; and having finished the water in
                  her pitcher and decanter, desired a renewed supply, and a basin of gruel, for she
                  believed she was dying. That I set down as a speech meant for Edgar's ears; I
                  believed no such thing, so I kept it to myself, and brought her some tea and dry
                  toast.</p>
               <p>She ate and drank eagerly; and sank back on her pillow again, clenching her hands
                  and groaning.</p>
               <p>"Oh, I will die," she exclaimed, "since no one cares anything about me. I wish I
                  had not taken that."</p>
               <p>Then a good while after I heard her murmur,</p>
               <p>"No, I'll not die -- he'd be glad -- he does not love me at all -- he would never
                  miss me!" </p>
               <pb n="121"/>
               <p>"Did you want anything, ma'am?" I inquired, still preserving my external
                  composure, in spite of her ghastly countenance and strange, exaggerated manner. </p>
               <p>"What is that apathetic being doing?" she demanded, pushing the thick entangled
                  locks from her wasted face. "Has he fallen into a lethargy, or is he dead?"</p>
               <p>"Neither," replied I, "if you mean Mr. Linton. He's tolerably well, I think,
                  though his studies occupy him rather more than they ought. He is continually among
                  his books, since he has no other society." </p>
               <p>I should not have spoken so if I had known her true condition, but I could not get
                  rid of the notion that she acted a part of her disorder. </p>
               <p>"Among his books!" she cried, confounded. "And I dying -- I on the brink of the
                  grave! My God! does he know how I'm altered?" continued she, staring at her
                  reflection in a mirror hanging against the opposite wall. "Is that Catherine
                  Linton? He imagines me in a pet -- in play, perhaps. Cannot you inform him that it
                  is frightful earnest? Nelly, if it be not too late, as soon as I learn how he
                  feels I'll choose between these two -- either to starve at once (that would be no
                  punishment unless he had a heart), or to recover, and leave the country. Are you
                  speaking the truth about him now? Take care. Is he actually so utterly indifferent
                  for my life?" </p>
               <p>"Why, ma'am," I answered, "the master has no idea of your being deranged; and, of
                  course, he does not fear that you will let yourself die of hunger." </p>
               <p>"You think not? Cannot you tell him I will?" she returned. "Persuade him; speak of
                  your own mind; say you are certain I will!" </p>
               <p>"No, you forget, Mrs. Linton," I suggested, "that you have eaten some food with a
                  relish this evening, and tomorrow you will perceive its good effects." </p>
               <p>"If I were only sure it would kill him," she interrupted, "I'd kill myself
                  directly! These three awful nights I've never closed my lids; and oh, I've been
                  tormented! I've been haunted, <pb n="122"/>Nelly! But I begin to fancy you don't
                  like me. How strange! I thought, though everybody hated and despised each other,
                  they could not avoid loving me. And they have all turned to enemies in a few
                  hours. They have, I'm positive -- the people here. How dreary to meet death,
                  surrounded by their cold faces! Isabella, terrified and repelled, afraid to enter
                  the room; it would be so dreadful to watch Catherine go! And Edgar standing
                  solemnly by to see it over; then offering prayers of thanks to God for restoring
                  peace to his house, and going back to his books! What in the name of all that
                  feels has he to do with books when I am dying?" </p>
               <p>She could not bear the notion which I had put into her head of Mr. Linton's
                  philosophical resignation. Tossing about, she increased her feverish bewilderment
                  to madness, and tore the pillow with her teeth; then raising herself up, all
                  burning, desired that I would open the window. We were in the middle of winter,
                  the wind blew strong from the north-east, and I objected. Both the expressions
                  flitting over her face and the changes of her moods began to alarm me terribly,
                  and brought to my recollection her former illness, and the doctor's injunction
                  that she should not be crossed. A minute previously she was violent; now,
                  supported on one arm, and not noticing my refusal to obey her, she seemed to find
                  childish diversion in pulling the feathers from the rents she had just made, and
                  ranging them on the sheet according to their different species. Her mind had
                  strayed to other associations. </p>
               <p>"That's a turkey's," she murmured to herself, "and this is a wild duck's, and this
                  is a pigeon's. Ah, they put pigeons' feathers in the pillows; no wonder I couldn't
                  die! Let me take care to throw it on the floor when I lie down. And here is a
                  moor-cock's; and this -- I should know it among a thousand -- it's a lapwing's.
                  Bonny bird, wheeling over our heads in the middle of the moor. It wanted to get to
                  its nest, for the clouds had touched the swells, and it felt rain coming. This
                  feather was picked up from the heath; the bird was not shot. We saw its nest in
                  the winter, full of little skeletons. Heathcliff set a trap over it, and the old
                     <pb n="123"/>ones dare not come. I made him promise he'd never shoot a lap-wing
                  after that, and he didn't. Yes, here are more! Did he shoot my lapwings, Nelly?
                  Are they red, any of them? Let me look." </p>
               <p>"Give over with that baby-work!" I interrupted, dragging the pillow away, and
                  turning the holes towards the mattress, for she was removing its contents by
                  handfuls. "Lie down and shut your eyes; you're wandering. There's a mess! The down
                  is flying about like snow." </p>
               <p>I went here and there collecting it. </p>
               <p>"I see in you, Nelly," she continued dreamily, "an aged woman. You have gray hair
                  and bent shoulders. This bed is the fairy cave under Peniston Crag, and you are
                  gathering elf-bolts to hurt our heifers, pretending, while I am near, that they
                  are only locks of wool. That's what you'll come to fifty years hence. I know you
                  are not so now. I'm not wandering; you're mistaken, or else I should believe you
                  really were that withered hag, and I should think I was under Peniston Crag; and
                  I'm conscious it's night, and there are two candles on the table making the black
                  press shine like jet." </p>
               <p>"The black press? Where is that?" I asked. "You are talking in your sleep!" </p>
               <p>"It's against the wall, as it always is," she replied. "It does appear odd. I see
                  a face in it!" </p>
               <p>"There's no press in the room, and never was," said I, resuming my seat, and
                  looping up the curtain, that I might watch her. </p>
               <p>"Don't you see that face?" she inquired, gazing earnestly at the mirror. </p>
               <p>And say what I could, I was incapable of making her comprehend it to be her own;
                  so I rose and covered it with a shawl. </p>
               <p>"It's behind there still!" she pursued anxiously. "And it stirred. Who is it? I
                  hope it will not come out when you are gone! O Nelly, the room is haunted! I'm
                  afraid of being alone!" </p>
               <p>I took her hand in mine, and bade her be composed, for a succession of shudders
                  convulsed her frame, and she would keep straining her gaze towards the glass. </p>
               <pb n="124"/>
               <p>"There's nobody here!" I insisted. "It was yourself Mrs. Linton. You knew it a
                  while since." </p>
               <p>"Myself!" she gasped; "and the clock is striking twelve! It's true, then; that's
                  dreadful!" </p>
               <p>Her fingers clutched the clothes, and gathered them over her eyes. I attempted to
                  steal to the door, with an intention of calling her husband; but I was summoned
                  back by a piercing shriek. The shawl had dropped from the frame. </p>
               <p>"Why, what is the matter?" cried I. "Who is coward now? Wake up! That is the glass
                  -- the mirror, Mrs. Linton; and you see yourself in it; and there am I too, by
                  your side." </p>
               <p>Trembling and bewildered, she held me fast, but the horror gradually passed from
                  her countenance. Its paleness gave place to a glow of shame. </p>
               <p>"Oh dear! I thought I was at home," she sighed -- "I thought I was lying in my
                  chamber at Wuthering Heights. Because I'm weak, my brain got confused, and I
                  screamed unconsciously. Don't say anything, but stay with me. I dread sleeping. My
                  dreams appall me." </p>
               <p>"A sound sleep would do you good, ma'am," I answered; "and I hope this suffering
                  will prevent your trying starving again." </p>
               <p>"Oh, if I were but in my own bed in the old house!" she went on bitterly, wringing
                  her hands. "And that wind sounding in the firs by the lattice. Do let me feel it
                  -- it comes straight down the moor -- do let me have one breath!" </p>
               <p>To pacify her, I held the casement ajar a few seconds. A cold blast rushed
                  through. I closed it, and returned to my post. She lay still now, her face bathed
                  in tears. Exhaustion of body had entirely subdued her spirit. Our fiery Catherine
                  was no better than a wailing child. </p>
               <p>"How long is it since I shut myself in here?" she asked, suddenly reviving. </p>
               <p>"It was Monday evening," I replied; "and this is Thursday night, or rather Friday
                  morning, at present." </p>
               <p>"What! of the same week?" she exclaimed. "Only that brief time?" </p>
               <pb n="125"/>
               <p>"Long enough to live on nothing but cold water and ill-temper," observed I. </p>
               <p>"Well, it seems a weary number of hours," she muttered doubtfully. "It must be
                  more. I remember being in the parlour after they had quarrelled, and Edgar being
                  cruelly provoking, and me running into this room desperate. As soon as ever I had
                  barred the door, utter blackness overwhelmed me, and I fell on the floor. I
                  couldn't explain to Edgar how certain I felt of having a fit, or going raging mad,
                  if he persisted in teasing me. I had no command of tongue or brain, and he did not
                  guess my agony perhaps; it barely left me sense to try to escape from him and his
                  voice. Before I recovered sufficiently to see and hear, it began to be dawn; and,
                  Nelly, I'll tell you what I thought, and what has kept recurring and recurring
                  till I feared for my reason. I thought as I lay there, with my head against that
                  table leg, and my eyes dimly discerning the gray square of the window, that I was
                  enclosed in the oak-panelled bed at home; and my heart ached with some great grief
                  which, just waking, I could not recollect. I pondered, and worried myself to
                  discover what it could be; and, most strangely, the whole last seven years of my
                  life grew a blank! I did not recall that they had been at all. I was a child; my
                  father was just buried, and my misery arose from the separation that Hindley had
                  ordered between me and Heathcliff. I was laid alone, for the first time; and
                  rousing from a dismal doze, after a night of weeping, I lifted my hand to push the
                  panels aside. It struck the table-top! I swept it along the carpet; and then
                  memory burst in. My late anguish was swallowed in a paroxysm of despair. I cannot
                  say why I felt so wildly wretched. It must have been temporary derangement, for
                  there is scarcely cause. But, supposing at twelve years old I had been wrenched
                  from the Heights, and every early association, and my all in all, as Heathcliff
                  was at that time, and been converted at a stroke into Mrs. Linton, the lady of
                  Thrushcross Grange, and the wife of a stranger, an exile and outcast thenceforth
                  from what had been my world -- you may fancy a glimpse of the abyss where I
                  grovelled! Shake your head as you will, Nelly, you have helped to unsettle me! You
                  should have spoken to Edgar -- indeed you <pb n="126"/>should -- and compelled him
                  to leave me quiet! Oh, I'm burning! I wish I were out of doors! I wish I were a
                  girl again, half savage and hardy and free, and laughing at injuries, not
                  maddening under them! Why am I so changed? Why does my blood rush into a hell of
                  tumult at a few words? I'm sure I should be myself were I once among the heather
                  on those hills. Open the window again wide -- fasten it open! Quick! Why don't you
                  move?" </p>
               <p>"Because I won't give you your death of cold," I answered. </p>
               <p>"You won't give me a chance of life, you mean," she said sullenly. "However, I'm
                  not helpless yet. I'll open it myself." </p>
               <p>And sliding from the bed before I could hinder her, she crossed the room, walking
                  very uncertainly, threw it back, and bent out, careless of the frosty air that cut
                  about her shoulders as keen as a knife. I entreated, and finally attempted to
                  force her to retire. But I soon found her delirious strength much surpassed mine
                  (she was delirious, I became convinced by her subsequent actions and ravings).
                  There was no moon, and everything beneath lay in misty darkness. Not a light
                  gleamed from any house, far or near -- all had been extinguished long ago; and
                  those at Wuthering Heights were never visible -- still she asserted she caught
                  their shining. </p>
               <p>"Look!" she cried eagerly; "that's my room with the candle in it, and the tree
                  swaying before it; and the other candle is in Joseph's garret. Joseph sits up
                  late, doesn't he? He's waiting till I come home, that he may lock the gate. Well,
                  he'll wait a while yet. It's a rough journey, and a sad heart to travel it; and we
                  must pass by Gimmerton Kirk to go that journey! We've braved its ghosts often
                  together, and dared each other to stand among the graves and ask them to come.
                  But, Heathcliff, if I dare you now, will you venture? If you do, I'll keep you.
                  I'll not lie there by myself. They may bury me twelve feet deep, and throw the
                  church down over me, but I won't rest till you are with me. I never will!" </p>
               <p>She paused, and resumed with a strange smile. "He's considering; he'd rather I'd
                  come to him! Find a way, then -- not <pb n="127"/>through that kirkyard. You are
                  slow! Be content; you always followed me!" </p>
               <p>Perceiving it vain to argue against her insanity, I was planning how I could reach
                  something to wrap about her, without quitting my hold of herself (for I could not
                  trust her alone by the gaping lattice), when, to my consternation, I heard the
                  rattle of the door-handle, and Mr. Linton entered. He had only then come from the
                  library, and in passing through the lobby had noticed our talking, and been
                  attracted by curiosity, or fear, to examine what it signified, at that late hour. </p>
               <p>"O sir!" I cried, checking the exclamation risen to his lips at the sight which
                  met him, and the bleak atmosphere of the chamber, "my poor mistress is ill, and
                  she quite masters me. I cannot manage her at all. Pray, come and persuade her to
                  go to bed. Forget your anger, for she's hard to guide any way but her own." </p>
               <p>"Catherine ill?" he said, hastening to us. "Shut the window, Ellen! -- Catherine!
                  why -- " </p>
               <p>He was silent. The haggardness of Mrs. Linton's appearance smote him speechless,
                  and he could only glance from her to me in horrified astonishment. </p>
               <p>"She's been fretting here," I continued, "and eating scarcely anything, and never
                  complaining. She would admit none of us till this evening, and so we couldn't
                  inform you of her state, as we were not aware of it ourselves; but it is nothing." </p>
               <p>I felt I uttered my explanations awkwardly. The master frowned. "It is nothing, is
                  it, Ellen Dean?" he said sternly. "You shall account more clearly for keeping me
                  ignorant of this!" And he took his wife in his arms, and looked at her with
                  anguish. </p>
               <p>At first she gave him no glance of recognition; he was invisible to her abstracted
                  gaze. The delirium was not fixed, however; having weaned her eyes from
                  contemplating the outer darkness, by degrees she centred her attention on him, and
                  discovered who it was that held her. </p>
               <p>"Ah! you are come, are you, Edgar Linton?" she said, with <pb n="128"/>angry
                  animation. "You are one of those things that are ever found when least wanted, and
                  when you are wanted, never! I suppose we shall have plenty of lamentations now --
                  I see we shall; but they can't keep me from my narrow home out yonder -- my
                  resting-place, where I'm bound before spring is over! There it is -- not among the
                  Lintons, mind, under the chapel-roof, but in the open air, with a head-stone; and
                  you may please yourself whether you go to them or come to me!" </p>
               <p>"Catherine, what have you done?" commenced the master. "Am I nothing to you any
                  more? Do you love that wretch Heath -- " </p>
               <p>"Hush!" cried Mrs. Linton -- "hush, this moment! You mention that name, and I end
                  the matter instantly by a spring from the window! What you touch at present you
                  may have; but my soul will be on that hill-top before you lay hands on me again. I
                  don't want you, Edgar. I'm past wanting you. Return to your books. I'm glad you
                  possess a consolation, for all you had in me is gone." </p>
               <p>"Her mind wanders, sir," I interposed -- "she has been talking nonsense the whole
                  evening; but let her have quiet and proper attendance, and she'll rally. Hereafter
                  we must be cautious how we vex her." </p>
               <p>"I desire no further advice from you," answered Mr. Linton. "You knew your
                  mistress's nature, and you encouraged me to harass her. And not to give me one
                  hint of how she has been these three days! It was heartless! Months of sickness
                  could not cause such a change!" </p>
               <p>I began to defend myself, thinking it too bad to be blamed for another's wicked
                  waywardness. "I knew Mrs. Linton's nature to be headstrong and domineering," cried
                  I, "but I didn't know that you wished to foster her fierce temper. I didn't know
                  that, to humour her, I should wink at Mr. Heathcliff. I performed the duty of a
                  faithful servant in telling you, and I have got a faithful servant's wages! Well,
                  it will teach me to be careful next time. Next time you may gather intelligence
                  for yourself." </p>
               <pb n="129"/>
               <p>"The next time you bring a tale to me you shall quit my service, Ellen Dean," he
                  replied. </p>
               <p>"You'd rather hear nothing about it, I suppose, then, Mr. Linton?" said I.
                  "Heathcliff has your permission to come a-courting to miss, and to drop in at
                  every opportunity your absence offers, on purpose to poison the mistress against
                  you?" </p>
               <p>Confused as Catherine was, her wits were alert at applying our conversation. </p>
               <p>"Ah! Nelly has played traitor!" she exclaimed passionately -- "Nelly is my hidden
                  enemy! You witch! So you do seek elf-bolts to hurt us! Let me go, and I'll make
                  her rue! I'll make her howl a recantation!" </p>
               <p>A maniac's fury kindled under her brows. She struggled desperately to disengage
                  herself from Linton's arms. I felt no inclination to tarry the event; and
                  resolving to seek medical aid on my own responsibility, I quitted the chamber. </p>
               <p>In passing the garden to reach the road, at a place where a bridle hook is driven
                  into the wall, I saw something white moved irregularly, evidently by another agent
                  than the wind. Notwithstanding my hurry, I stayed to examine it, lest ever after I
                  should have the conviction impressed on my imagination that it was a creature of
                  the other world. My surprise and perplexity were great on discovering, by touch
                  more than vision, Miss Isabella's springer, Fanny, suspended by a handkerchief,and
                  nearly at its last gasp. I quickly released the animal, and lifted it into the
                  garden. I had seen it follow its mistress upstairs when she went to bed, and
                  wondered much how it could have got out there, and what mischievous person had
                  treated it so. While untying the knot round the hook, it seemed to me that I
                  repeatedly caught the beat of horses' feet galloping at some distance; but there
                  were such a number of things to occupy my reflections that I hardly gave the
                  circumstance a thought, though it was a strange sound in that place at two o'clock
                  in the morning. </p>
               <pb n="130"/>
               <p>Mr. Kenneth was fortunately just issuing from his house to see a patient in the
                  village as I came up the street, and my account of Catherine Linton's malady
                  induced him to accompany me back immediately. He was a plain, rough man; and he
                  made no scruple to speak his doubts of her surviving this second attack, unless
                  she were more submissive to his directions than she had shown herself before. </p>
               <p>"Nelly Dean," said he, "I can't help fancying there's an extra cause for this.
                  What has there been to do at the Grange? We've odd reports up here. A stout,
                  hearty lass like Catherine does not fall ill for a trifle; and that sort of people
                  should not, either. It's hard work bringing them through fevers and such things.
                  How did it begin?" </p>
               <p>"The master will inform you," I answered; "but you are acquainted with the
                  Earnshaws' violent dispositions, and Mrs. Linton caps them all. I may say this; it
                  commenced in a quarrel. She was struck during a tempest of passion with a kind of
                  fit. That's her account, at least, for she flew off in the height of it, and
                  locked herself up. Afterwards she refused to eat, and now she alternately raves
                  and remains in a half dream, knowing those about her, but having her mind filled
                  with all sorts of strange ideas and illusions." </p>
               <p>"Mr. Linton will be sorry?" observed Kenneth interrogatively. </p>
               <p>"Sorry? He'll break his heart should anything happen!" I replied. "Don't alarm him
                  more than necessary." </p>
               <p>"Well, I told him to beware," said my companion; "and he must bide the
                  consequences of neglecting my warning. Hasn't he been intimate with Mr. Heathcliff
                  lately?" </p>
               <p>"Heathcliff frequently visits at the Grange," answered I, "though more on the
                  strength of the mistress having known him when a boy than because the master likes
                  his company. At present he's discharged from the trouble of calling, owing to some
                  presumptuous aspirations after Miss Linton which he manifested. I hardly think
                  he'll be taken in again." </p>
               <p>"And does Miss Linton turn a cold shoulder on him?" was the doctor's next
                  question. </p>
               <pb n="131"/>
               <p>"I'm not in her confidence," returned I, reluctant to continue the subject. </p>
               <p>"No; she's a sly one," he remarked, shaking his head. "She keeps her own counsel.
                  But she's a real little fool. I have it from good authority that last night (and a
                  pretty night it was) she and Heathcliff were walking in the plantation at the back
                  of your house above two hours; and he pressed her not to go in again, but just
                  mount his horse and away with him. My informant said she could only put him off by
                  pledging her word of honour to be prepared on their first meeting after that. When
                  it was to be, he didn't hear; but you urge Mr. Linton to look sharp." </p>
               <p>This news filled me with fresh fears. I outstripped Kenneth, and ran most of the
                  way back. The little dog was yelping in the garden yet. I spared a minute to open
                  the gate for it, but instead of going to the house door, it coursed up and down
                  snuffing the grass, and would have escaped to the road had I not seized and
                  conveyed it in with me. On ascending to Isabella's room my suspicions were
                  confirmed. It was empty. Had I been a few hours sooner, Mrs. Linton's illness
                  might have arrested her rash step. But what could be done now? There was a bare
                  possibility of overtaking them if pursued instantly. I could not pursue them,
                  however; and I dare not rouse the family, and fill the place with confusion --
                  still less unfold the business to my master, absorbed as he was in his present
                  calamity, and having no heart to spare for a second grief. I saw nothing for it
                  but to hold my tongue, and suffer matters to take their course; and Kenneth being
                  arrived, I went with a badly composed countenance to announce him. Catherine lay
                  in a troubled sleep. Her husband had succeeded in soothing the excess of frenzy.
                  He now hung over her pillow, watching every shade and every change of her
                  painfully expressive features. </p>
               <p>The doctor, on examining the case for himself, spoke hopefully to him of its
                  having a favourable termination, if we could only preserve around her perfect and
                  constant tranquillity. To me he signified the threatening danger was not so much
                  death, as permanent alienation of intellect. </p>
               <pb n="132"/>
               <p>I did not close my eyes that night, nor did Mr. Linton -- indeed, we never went to
                  bed; and the servants were all up long before the usual hour, moving through the
                  house with stealthy tread, and exchanging whispers as they encountered each other
                  in their vocations. Every one was active but Miss Isabella; and they began to
                  remark how sound she slept. Her brother, too, asked if she had risen, and seemed
                  impatient for her presence, and hurt that she showed so little anxiety for her
                  sister-in-law. I trembled lest he should send me to call her; but I was spared the
                  pain of being the first proclaimant of her flight. One of the maids, a thoughtless
                  girl, who had been on an early errand to Gimmerton, came panting upstairs, open
                  mouthed, and dashed into the chamber, crying, -- </p>
               <p>"Oh dear, dear! What mun we have next? Master, master, our young lady -- "</p>
               <p>"Hold your noise!" cried I hastily, enraged at her clamorous manner. </p>
               <p>"Speak lower, Mary. What is the matter?" said Mr. Linton. "What ails your young
                  lady?" </p>
               <p>"She's gone, she's gone! Yon Heathcliff's run off wi' her!" gasped the girl. </p>
               <p>"That is not true!" exclaimed Linton, rising in agitation. "It cannot be. How has
                  the idea entered your head? -- Ellen Dean, go and seek her. It is incredible. It
                  cannot be." </p>
               <p>As he spoke he took the servant to the door, and then repeated his demand to know
                  her reasons for such an assertion. </p>
               <p>"Why, I met on the road a lad that fetches milk here," she stammered, "and he
                  asked whether we weren't in trouble at the Grange. I thought he meant for missis's
                  sickness, so I answered yes. Then says he, 'There's somebody gone after 'em, I
                  guess?' I stared. He saw I knew nought about it, and he told how a gentleman and
                  lady had stopped to have a horse's shoe fastened at a blacksmith's shop, two miles
                  out of Gimmerton, not very long after midnight; and how the blacksmith's lass had
                  got up to spy who they were. She knew them both directly. And she noticed the man
                  -- Heathcliff it was, she felt certain; nob'dy could <pb n="133"/>mistake him,
                  besides -- put a sovereign in her father's hand for payment. The lady had a cloak
                  about her face; but having desired a sup of water, while she drank it fell back,
                  and she saw her very plain. Heathcliff held both bridles as they rode on, and they
                  set their faces from the village, and went as fast as the rough roads would let
                  them. The lass said nothing to her father, but she told it all over Gimmerton this
                  morning." </p>
               <p>I ran and peeped, for form's sake, into Isabella's room, confirming, when I
                  returned, the servant's statement. Mr. Linton had resumed his seat by the bed. On
                  my re-entrance he raised his eyes, read the meaning of my blank aspect, and
                  dropped them without giving an order or uttering a word. </p>
               <p>"Are we to try any measures for overtaking and bringing her back?" I inquired.
                  "How should we do?" </p>
               <p>"She went of her own accord," answered the master; "she had a right to go if she
                  pleased. Trouble me no more about her. Hereafter she is only my sister in name
                  ...not because I disown her, but because she has disowned me." </p>
               <p>And that was all he said on the subject. He did not make a single inquiry further,
                  or mention her in any way, except directing me to send what property she had in
                  the house to her fresh home, wherever it was, when I knew it. </p>

               <p>For two months the fugitives remained absent; in those two months, Mrs. Linton
                  encountered and conquered the worst shock of what was denominated a brain fever.
                  No mother could have nursed an only child more devotedly than Edgar tended her.
                  Day and night he was watching, and patiently enduring all the annoyances that
                  irritable nerves and a shaken reason could inflict: and, though Kenneth remarked
                  that what he saved from the grave would only recompense his care by forming the
                  source of constant future anxiety -- in fact, that his health and strength were
                  being sacrificed to preserve a mere ruin of humanity -- he knew no limits in
                  gratitude and joy, when Catherine's life was declared out of danger; and hour
                  after hour he would sit beside her, tracing the gradual return to bodily health,
                  and flattering his too sanguine hopes with the illusion that her mind would settle
                  back to its right balance also, and she would soon be entirely her former
                  self.</p>
               <p>The first time she left her chamber, was at the commencement of the following
                  March. Mr. Linton had put on her pillow, in the morning, a handful of golden
                  crocuses; her eye, long stranger to any gleam of pleasure, caught them in waking,
                  and shone delighted as she gathered them eagerly together.</p>
               <p>"These are the earliest flowers at the Heights!" she exclaimed. "They remind me of
                  soft thaw winds, and warm sunshine, and nearly melted snow -- Edgar, is there not
                  a south wind, and is not the snow almost gone ?"</p>
               <p>"The snow is quite gone down here, darling," replied her husband, "and I only see
                  two white spots on the whole range of moors. The sky is blue, and the larks are
                  singing, and the becks and brooks are all brim full. Catherine, last spring at
                  this time I was longing to have you under this roof; now I wish you were a mile or
                  two up those hills; the air blows so sweetly, I feel that it would cure you." </p>
               <pb n="135"/>
               <p>"I shall never be there but once more," said the invalid; "and then you'll leave
                  me, and I shall remain for ever. Next spring you'll long again to have me under
                  this roof, and you'll look back and think you were happy to-day." </p>
               <p>Linton lavished on her the kindest caresses, and tried to cheer her by the fondest
                  words; but, vaguely regarding the flowers, she let the tears collect on her lashes
                  and stream down her cheeks unheeding. We knew she was really better, and therefore
                  decided that long confinement to a single place produced much of this despondency,
                  and it might be partially removed by a change of scene. The master told me to
                  light a fire in the many-weeks-deserted parlour, and to set an easy-chair in the
                  sunshine by the window; and then he brought her down, and she sat a long while
                  enjoying the genial heat, and, as we expected, revived by the objects round her,
                  which, though familiar, were free from the dreary associations investing her hated
                  sick chamber. By evening she seemed greatly exhausted, yet no arguments could
                  persuade her to return to that apartment; and I had to arrange the parlour sofa
                  for her bed, till another room could be prepared. To obviate the fatigue of
                  mounting and descending the stairs, we fitted up this, where you lie at present,
                  on the same floor with the parlour; and she was soon strong enough to move from
                  one to the other, leaning on Edgar's arm. Ah, I thought myself she might recover,
                  so waited on as she was. And there was double cause to desire it, for on her
                  existence depended that of another; we cherished the hope that in a little while
                  Mr. Linton's heart would be gladdened, and his lands secured from a stranger's
                  gripe, by the birth of an heir. </p>
               <p>I should mention that Isabella sent to her brother, some six weeks from her
                  departure, a short note announcing her marriage with Heathcliff. It appeared dry
                  and cold, but at the bottom was dotted in with pencil an obscure apology, and an
                  entreaty for kind remembrance and reconciliation, if her proceeding had offended
                  him, asserting that she could not help it then, and, being done, she had now no
                  power to repeal it. <pb n="136"/>Linton did not reply to this, I believe; and in a
                  fortnight more I got a long letter which I considered odd, coming from the pen of
                  a bride just out of the honeymoon. I'll read it, for I keep it yet. Any relic of
                  the dead is precious if they were valued living. </p>
               <div type="epistle">

                  <p>DEAR ELLEN, it begins, I came last night to Wuthering Heights, and heard for
                     the first time that Catherine has been, and is yet, very ill. I must not write
                     to her, I suppose, and my brother is either too angry or too distressed to
                     answer what I sent him. Still, I must write to somebody, and the only choice
                     left me is you. </p>
                  <p>Inform Edgar that I'd give the world to see his face again -- that my heart
                     returned to Thrushcross Grange in twenty-four hours after I left it, and is
                     there at this moment, full of warm feelings for him and Catherine. I can't
                     follow it, though (those words are underlined); they need not expect me; and
                     they may draw what conclusions they please, taking care, however, to lay
                     nothing at the door of my weak will or deficient affection. </p>
                  <p>The remainder of the letter is for yourself alone. I want to ask you two
                     questions; the first is -- How did you contrive to preserve the common
                     sympathies of human nature when you resided here? I cannot recognize any
                     sentiment which those around share with me. </p>
                  <p>The second question I have great interest in; it is this -- Is Mr. Heathcliff a
                     man? If so, is he mad? And if not, is he a devil? I shan't tell my reasons for
                     making this inquiry, but I beseech you to explain, if you can, what I have
                     married -- that is, when you call to see me; and you must call, Ellen, very
                     soon. Don't write, but come, and bring me something from Edgar. </p>
                  <p>Now you shall hear how I have been received in my new home, as I am led to
                     imagine the Heights will be. It is to amuse myself that I dwell on such
                     subjects as the lack of external comforts; they never occupy my thoughts,
                     except at the moment when I miss them. I should laugh and dance for joy if I
                     found their absence <pb n="137"/> was the total of my miseries, and the rest
                     was an unnatural dream. </p>
                  <p>The sun set behind the Grange as we turned on to the moors: by that I judged it
                     to be six o'clock; and my companion halted half an hour to inspect the park and
                     the gardens, and probably the place itself, as well as he could; so it was dark
                     when we dismounted in the paved yard of the farmhouse, and your old
                     fellow-servant Joseph issued out to receive us by the light of a dip candle. He
                     did it with a courtesy that redounded to his credit. His first act was to
                     elevate his torch to a level with my face, squint malignantly, project his
                     under lip, and turn away. Then he took the two horses and led them into the
                     stables, reappearing for the purpose of locking the outer gate, as if we lived
                     in an ancient castle. </p>
                  <p>Heathcliff stayed to speak to him, and I entered the kitchen -- a dingy, untidy
                     hole. I dare say you would not know it, it is so changed since it was in your
                     charge. By the fire stood a ruffianly child, strong in limb and dirty in garb,
                     with a look of Catherine in his eyes and about his mouth. </p>
                  <p>"This is Edgar's legal nephew," I reflected -- "mine in a manner. I must shake
                     hands, and -- yes -- I must kiss him. It is right to establish a good
                     understanding at the beginning." </p>
                  <p>I approached, and attempting to take his chubby fist, said, -- </p>
                  <p>"How do you do, my dear?" </p>
                  <p>He replied in a jargon I did not comprehend. </p>
                  <p>"Shall you and I be friends, Hareton?" was my next essay at conversation. </p>
                  <p>An oath, and a threat to set Throttler on me if I did not "frame off," rewarded
                     my perseverance. </p>
                  <p>"Hey, Throttler, lad!" whispered the little wretch, rousing a half-bred
                     bull-dog from its lair in a corner. "Now, wilt thou be ganging?" he asked
                     authoritatively.</p>
                  <p>Love for my life urged a compliance. I stepped over the threshold to wait till
                     the others should enter. Mr. Heathcliff was nowhere visible, and Joseph, whom I
                     followed to the stables and <pb n="138"/>requested to accompany me in, after
                     staring and muttering to himself, screwed up his nose and replied, -- </p>
                  <p>"Mim! mim! mim! Did iver Christian body hear aught like it? Minching un
                     munching! How can I tell whet ye say?" </p>
                  <p>"I say I wish you to come with me into the house!" I cried, thinking him deaf,
                     yet highly disgusted at his rudeness. </p>
                  <p>"Nor nuh me. I getten summut else to do," he answered, and continued his work,
                     moving his lantern jaws meanwhile, and surveying my dress and countenance (the
                     former a great deal too fine, but the latter, I'm sure, as sad as he could
                     desire) with sovereign contempt. </p>
                  <p>I walked round the yard and through a wicket to another door, at which I took
                     the liberty of knocking, in hopes some more civil servant might show himself.
                     After a short suspense it was opened by a tall, gaunt man, without neckerchief,
                     and otherwise extremely slovenly; his features were lost in masses of shaggy
                     hair that hung on his shoulders, and his eyes, too, were like a ghostly
                     Catherine's with all their beauty annihilated. </p>
                  <p>"What's your business here?" he demanded grimly. "Who are you?" </p>
                  <p>"My name was Isabella Linton," I replied. "You've seen me before, sir. I'm
                     lately married to Mr. Heathcliff, and he has brought me here -- I suppose by
                     your permission." </p>
                  <p>"Is he come back, then?" asked the hermit, glaring like a hungry wolf, </p>
                  <p>"Yes, we came just now," I said; "but he left me by the kitchen door, and when
                     I would have gone in your little boy played sentinel over the place, and
                     frightened me off by the help of a bull-dog." </p>
                  <p>"It's well the hellish villain has kept his word!" growled my future host,
                     searching the darkness beyond me in expectation of discovering Heathcliff; and
                     then he indulged in a soliloquy of execrations, and threats of what he would
                     have done had the "fiend" deceived him. </p>
                  <p>I repented having tried this second entrance, and was almost <pb n="139"
                     />inclined to slip away before he finished cursing; but ere I could execute
                     that intention he ordered me in, and shut and refastened the door. There was a
                     great fire, and that was all the light in the huge apartment, whose floor had
                     grown a uniform gray, and the once brilliant pewter dishes, which used to
                     attract my gaze when I was a girl, partook of a similar obscurity, created by
                     tarnish and dust. I inquired whether I might call the maid, and be conducted to
                     a bedroom. Mr. Earnshaw vouchsafed no answer. He walked up and down, with his
                     hands in his pockets, apparently quite forgetting my presence; and his
                     abstraction was evidently so deep, and his whole aspect so misanthropical, that
                     I shrank from disturbing him again. </p>
                  <p>You'll not be surprised, Ellen, at my feeling particularly cheerless, seated in
                     worse than solitude on that inhospitable hearth, and remembering that four
                     miles distant lay my delightful home, containing the only people I loved on
                     earth; and there might as well be the Atlantic to part us, instead of those
                     four miles. I could not overpass them. I questioned with myself -- Where must I
                     turn for comfort? and (mind you don't tell Edgar or Catherine) above every
                     sorrow beside, this rose pre-eminent -- despair at finding nobody who could or
                     would be my ally against Heathcliff. I had sought shelter at Wuthering Heights
                     almost gladly, because I was secured by that arrangement from living alone with
                     him; but he knew the people we were coming amongst, and he did not fear their
                     intermeddling. </p>
                  <p>I sat and thought a doleful time. The clock struck eight, and nine, and still
                     my companion paced to and fro, his head bent on his breast, and perfectly
                     silent, unless a groan or a bitter ejaculation forced itself out at intervals.
                     I listened to detect a woman's voice in the house, and filled the interim with
                     wild regrets and dismal anticipations, which at last spoke audibly in
                     irrepressible sighing and weeping. I was not aware how openly I grieved, till
                     Earnshaw halted opposite, in his measured walk, and gave me a stare of
                     newly-awakened <pb n="140"/> surprise. Taking advantage of his recovered
                     attention, I exclaimed, -- </p>
                  <p>"I'm tired with my journey, and I want to go to bed! Where is the maidservant?
                     Direct me to her, as she won't come to me." </p>
                  <p>"We have none," he answered. "You must wait on yourself." </p>
                  <p>"Where must I sleep, then?" I sobbed. I was beyond regarding self-respect,
                     weighed down by fatigue and wretchedness. </p>
                  <p>"Joseph will show you Heathcliff's chamber," said he. "Open that door; he's in
                     there." </p>
                  <p>I was going to obey, but he suddenly arrested me, and added in the strangest
                     tone, -- </p>
                  <p>"Be so good as to turn your lock and draw your bolt; don't omit it!" </p>
                  <p>"Well!" I said; "but why, Mr. Earnshaw?" I did not relish the notion of
                     deliberately fastening myself in with Heathcliff. </p>
                  <p>"Look here!" he replied, pulling from his waistcoat a curiously constructed
                     pistol, having a double-edged spring knife attached to the barrel. "That's a
                     great tempter to a desperate man, is it not? I cannot resist going up with this
                     every night and trying his door. If once I find it open, he's done for! I do it
                     invariably, even though the minute before I have been recalling a hundred
                     reasons that should make me refrain. It is some devil that urges me to thwart
                     my own schemes by killing him. You fight against that devil for love as long as
                     you may; when the time comes, not all the angels in heaven shall save him!" </p>
                  <p>I surveyed the weapon inquisitively. A hideous notion struck me. How powerful I
                     should be, possessing such an instrument! I took it from his hand and touched
                     the blade. He looked astonished at the expression my face assumed during a
                     brief second; it was not horror -- it was covetousness. He snatched the pistol
                     back jealously, shut the knife, and returned it to its concealment. </p>
                  <p>"I don't care if you tell him," said he. "Put him on his guard, and watch for
                     him. You know the terms we are on, I see. His danger does not shock you." </p>
                  <p>"What has Heathcliff done to you?" I asked. "In what has he <pb n="141"
                     />wronged you, to warrant this appalling hatred? Wouldn't it be wiser to bid
                     him quit the house?" </p>
                  <p>"No!" thundered Earnshaw. "Should he offer to leave me, he's a dead man.
                     Persuade him to attempt it, and you are a murderess. Am I to lose all without a
                     chance of retrieval? Is Hareton to be a beggar? Oh, damnation! I will have it
                     back, and I'll have his gold too, and then his blood, and hell shall have his
                     soul! It will be ten times blacker with that guest than ever it was before!" </p>
                  <p>You've acquainted me, Ellen, with your old master's habits. He is clearly on
                     the verge of madness. He was so last night at least. I shuddered to be near
                     him, and thought on the servant's ill-bred moroseness as comparatively
                     agreeable. He now recommenced his moody walk, and I raised the latch and
                     escaped into the kitchen. Joseph was bending over the fire, peering into a
                     large pan that swung above it, and a wooden bowl of oatmeal stood on the settle
                     close by. The contents of the pan began to boil, and he turned to plunge his
                     hand into the bowl. I conjectured that this preparation was probably for our
                     supper, and being hungry, I resolved it should be eatable; so, crying out
                     sharply, "I'll make the porridge!" I removed the vessel out of his reach, and
                     proceeded to take off my hat and riding-habit. </p>
                  <p>"Mr. Earnshaw," I continued, "directs me to wait on myself. I will. I'm not
                     going to act the lady among you, for fear I should starve." </p>
                  <p>"Gooid Lord!" he muttered, sitting down and stroking his ribbed stockings from
                     the knee to the ankle. "If there's to be fresh ortherings, just when I getten
                     used to two maisters, if I mun hev a mistress set o'er my heead, it's like time
                     to be flitting. I niver did think to see t' day that I mud lave th' owld place,
                     but I doubt it's nigh at hand!"</p>
                  <p>This lamentation drew no notice from me. I went briskly to work, sighing to
                     remember a period when it would have been all merry fun, but compelled speedily
                     to drive off the remembrance. It racked me to recall past happiness and the
                     greater peril there was of conjuring up its apparition, the quicker the thible
                     ran <pb n="142"/> round, and the faster the handfuls of meal fell into the
                     water. Joseph beheld my style of cookery with growing indignation. </p>
                  <p>"Thear!" he ejaculated. "Hareton, thou willn't sup thy porridge to-neeght;
                     they'll be naught but lumps as big as my neive. Thear, agean! I'd fling in bowl
                     un all, if I wer ye! There, pale t' guilp off, un then ye'll hae done wi't.
                     Bang, bang. It's a mercy t' bothom isn't deaved out!" </p>
                  <p>It was rather a rough mess, I own, when poured into the basins. Four had been
                     provided, and a gallon pitcher of new milk was brought from the dairy, which
                     Hareton seized and commenced drinking and spilling from the expansive lip. I
                     expostulated, and desired that he should have his in a mug, affirming that I
                     could not taste the liquid treated so dirtily. The old cynic chose to be vastly
                     offended at this nicety, assuring me repeatedly that "the barn was every bit as
                     good" as I, "and every bit as wollsome," and wondering how I could fashion to
                     be so conceited. Meanwhile the infant ruffian continued sucking, and glowered
                     up at me defyingly as he slavered into the jug. </p>
                  <p>"I shall have my supper in another room," I said. "Have you no place you call a
                     parlour?" </p>
                  <p>"Parlour!" he echoed sneeringly -- "parlour! Nay, we've noa parlours. If yah
                     dunnut loike wer company, there's maister's; un if yah dunnut loike maister,
                     there's us." </p>
                  <p>"Then I shall go upstairs," I answered. "Show me a chamber." </p>
                  <p>I put my basin on a tray, and went myself to fetch some more milk. With great
                     grumblings the fellow rose and preceded me in my ascent. We mounted to the
                     garrets. He opened a door now and then to look into the apartments we passed. </p>
                  <p>"Here's a rahm," he said at last, flinging back a cranky board on hinges. "It's
                     weel eneugh to ate a few porridge in. There's a pack o' corn i' t' corner,
                     thear, meeterly clane. If ye're feared o' muckying yer grand silk cloes, spread
                     yer hankerchir o' to' top on't." </p>
                  <p>The "rahm" was a kind of lumber-hole smelling strong of malt <pb n="143"/>and
                     grain, various sacks of which articles were piled around, leaving a wide, bare
                     space in the middle. </p>
                  <p>"Why, man!" I exclaimed, facing him angrily, "this is not a place to sleep in.
                     I wish to see my bedroom." </p>
                  <p>"Bedrume!" he repeated, in a tone of mockery. "Yah's see all t'bedrumes thear
                     is. Yon's mine." </p>
                  <p>He pointed into the second garret, only differing from the first in being more
                     naked about the walls, and having a large, low, curtainless bed with an
                     indigo-coloured quilt at one end. </p>
                  <p>"What do I want with yours?" I retorted. "I suppose Mr. Heathcliff does not
                     lodge at the top of the house, does he?" </p>
                  <p>"Oh, it's Maister Hathecliff's ye're wanting?" cried he, as if making a new
                     discovery. "Couldn't ye ha' said soa, at onst? Un then I mud ha' telled ye,
                     baht all this wark, that that's just one ye cannut see. He allas keeps it
                     locked, un nob'dy iver mells on't but hisseln." </p>
                  <p>"You've a nice house, Joseph," I could not refrain from observing, "and
                     pleasant inmates; and I think the concentrated essence of all the madness in
                     the world took up its abode in my brain the day I linked my fate with theirs!
                     However, that is not to the present purpose. There are other rooms. For
                     Heaven's sake be quick, and let me settle somewhere!" </p>
                  <p>He made no reply to this adjuration, only plodding doggedly down the wooden
                     steps, and halting before an apartment which, from that halt and the superior
                     quality of its furniture, I conjectured to be the best one. There was a carpet
                     -- a good one -- but the pattern was obliterated by dust; a fireplace hung with
                     cut paper, dropping to pieces; a handsome oak bedstead with ample crimson
                     curtains of rather expensive material and modern make, but they had evidently
                     experienced rough usage -- the valances hung in festoons, wrenched from their
                     rings, and the iron rod supporting them was bent in an arc on one side, causing
                     the drapery to trail upon the floor. The chairs were also damaged, many of them
                     severely, and deep indentations deformed the panels of the walls. <pb n="144"
                     />I was endeavouring to gather resolution for entering and taking possession,
                     when my fool of a guide announced, "This here is t' maister's." My supper by
                     this time was cold, my appetite gone, and my patience exhausted. I insisted on
                     being provided instantly with a place of refuge and means of repose. </p>
                  <p>"Whear the divil?" began the religious elder. "The Lord bless us! The Lord
                     forgie us! Whear the hell wold ye gang, ye marred, wearisome nowt? Ye've seen
                     all but Hareton's bit of a cham'er. There's not another hoile to lig down in i'
                     th' hahse!" </p>
                  <p>I was so vexed, I flung my tray and its contents on the ground, and then seated
                     myself at the stairs-head, hid my face in my hands, and cried. </p>
                  <p>"Ech! ech!" exclaimed Joseph. "Weel done, Miss Cathy! weel done, Miss Cathy!
                     Hahsiver, t' maister sall just tum'le o'er them brocken pots, un then we's hear
                     summut -- we's hear how it's to be. Gooid-for-naught madling! ye desarve pining
                     fro' this to Churstmas, flinging t' precious gifts o' God under fooit i' yer
                     flaysome rages! But I'm mista'eif ye show yer sperrit lang. Will Hathecliff
                     bide sich bonny ways, think ye? I nobbut wish he may catch ye i' that plisky. I
                     nobbut wish he may." </p>
                  <p>And so he went on scolding to his den beneath, taking the candle with him, and
                     I remained in the dark. The period of reflection succeeding this silly action
                     compelled me to admit the necessity of smothering my pride and choking my
                     wrath, and bestirring myself to remove its effects. An unexpected aid presently
                     appeared in the shape of Throttler, whom I now recognized as a son of our old
                     Skulker. It had spent its whelphood at the Grange, and was given by my father
                     to Mr. Hindley. I fancy it knew me. It pushed its nose against mine by way of
                     salute, and then hastened to devour the porridge, while I groped from step to
                     step, collecting the shattered earthenware, and drying the spatters of milk
                     from the banister with my pocket-handkerchief. Our labours were scarcely over
                     when I heard Earnshaw's tread in the passage. My assistant tucked in his tail
                     and pressed to the <pb n="145"/>wall. I stole into the nearest doorway. The
                     dog's endeavour to avoid him was unsuccessful, as I guessed by a scutter
                     downstairs, and a prolonged, piteous yelping. I had better luck. He passed on,
                     entered his chamber, and shut the door. Directly after, Joseph came up with
                     Hareton, to put him to bed. I had found shelter in Hareton's room, and the old
                     man, on seeing me, said, -- </p>
                  <p>"They's rahm for boath ye un yer pride now, I sud think, i' the hahse. It's
                     empty; ye may hev it all to yer-seln, un Him as allas maks a third i' sich ill
                     company!" </p>
                  <p>Gladly did I take advantage of this intimation, and the minute I flung myself
                     into a chair by the fire I nodded and slept. My slumber was deep and sweet,
                     though over far too soon. Mr. Heathcliff awoke me. He had just come in, and
                     demanded, in his loving manner, what I was doing there. I told him the cause of
                     my staying up so late -- that he had the key of our room in his pocket. The
                     adjective our gave mortal offence. He swore it was not, nor ever should be
                     mine, and he'd -- But I'll not repeat his language, nor describe his habitual
                     conduct. He is ingenious and unresting in seeking to gain my abhorrence. I
                     sometimes wonder at him with an intensity that deadens my fear; yet I assure
                     you a tiger or a venomous serpent could not rouse terror in me equal to that
                     which he wakens. He told me of Catherine's illness, and accused my brother of
                     causing it, promising that I should be Edgar's proxy in suffering till he could
                     get hold of him. </p>
                  <p>I do hate him -- I am wretched -- I have been a fool Beware of uttering one
                     breath of this to any one at the Grange. I shall expect you every day. Don't
                     disappoint me. </p>

               <p>As soon as I had perused this epistle, I went to the master, and informed him that
                  his sister had arrived at the Heights, and sent me a letter expressing her sorrow
                  for Mrs. Linton's situation, and her ardent desire to see him; with a wish that he
                  would transmit to her, as early as possible, some token of forgiveness by me.</p>
               <p>"Forgiveness?" said Linton. "I have nothing to forgive her, Ellen -- you may call
                  at Wuthering Heights this afternoon, if you like, and say that I am not angry, but
                  I'm sorry to have lost her: especially as I can never think she'll be happy. It is
                  out of the question my going to see her, however; we are eternally divided; and
                  should she really wish to oblige me, let her persuade the villain she has married
                  to leave the country."</p>
               <p>"And you won't write her a little note, sir ?" I asked, imploringly.</p>
               <p>"No," he answered. "It is needless. My communication with Heathcliff's family
                  shall be as sparing as his with mine. It shall not exist!"</p>
               <p>Mr. Edgar's coldness depressed me exceedingly; and all the way from the Grange I
                  puzzled my brains how to put more heart into what he said, when I repeated it; and
                  how to soften his refusal of even a few lines to console Isabella.</p>
               <p>I dare say she had been on the watch for me since morning: I saw her looking
                  through the lattice, as I came up the garden causeway, and I nodded to her; but
                  she drew back as if afraid of being observed.</p>
               <p>I entered without knocking. There never was such a dreary, dismal scene as the
                  formerly cheerful house presented. I must confess that if I had been in the young
                  lady's place I would, at least, have swept the hearth and wiped the tables with a
                  duster. But she already partook of the pervading spirit of neglect which
                  encompassed her. Her pretty face was wan and listless, her hair <pb n="147"
                  />uncurled -- some locks hanging lankly down, and some carelessly twisted round
                  her head. Probably she had not touched her dress since yester evening. Hindley was
                  not there. Mr. Heathcliff sat at a table, turning over some papers in his
                  pocket-book; but he rose when I appeared, asked me how I did, quite friendly, and
                  offered me a chair. He was the only thing there that seemed decent, and I thought
                  he never looked better. So much had circumstances altered their positions that he
                  would certainly have struck a stranger as a born and bred gentleman, and his wife
                  as a thorough little slattern! She came forward eagerly to greet me, and held out
                  one hand to take the expected letter. I shook my head. She wouldn't understand the
                  hint, but followed me to a sideboard where I went to lay my bonnet, and importuned
                  me in a whisper to give her directly what I had brought. Heathcliff guessed the
                  meaning of her manoeuvres, and said, -- </p>
               <p>"If you have got anything for Isabella -- as no doubt you have, Nelly -- give it
                  to her. You needn't make a secret of it. We have no secrets between us." </p>
               <p>"Oh, I have nothing," I replied, thinking it best to speak the truth at once. "My
                  master bade me tell his sister that she must not expect either a letter or a visit
                  from him at present. He sends his love, ma'am, and his wishes for your happiness,
                  and his pardon for the grief you have occasioned; but he thinks that after this
                  time his household and the household here should drop intercommunication, as
                  nothing could come of keeping it up." </p>
               <p>Mrs. Heathcliff's lip quivered slightly, and she returned to her seat in the
                  window. Her husband took his stand on the hearthstone near me, and began to put
                  questions concerning Catherine. I told him as much as I thought proper of her
                  illness, and he extorted from me, by cross-examination, most of the facts
                  connected with its origin. I blamed her, as she deserved, for bringing it all on
                  herself, and ended by hoping that he would follow Mr. Linton's example, <pb
                     n="148"/>and avoid future interference with his family, for good or evil. </p>
               <p>"Mrs. Linton is now just recovering," I said. "She'll never be like she was, but
                  her life is spared; and if you really have a regard for her, you'll shun crossing
                  her way again -- nay, you'll move out of this country entirely; and that you may
                  not regret it, I'll inform you Catherine Linton is as different now from your old
                  friend Catherine Earnshaw as that young lady is different from me. Her appearance
                  is changed greatly, her character much more so; and the person who is compelled,
                  of necessity, to be her companion will only sustain his affection hereafter by the
                  remembrance of what she once was, by common humanity, and a sense of duty." </p>
               <p>"That is quite possible," remarked Heathcliff, forcing himself to seem calm --
                  "quite possible that your master should have nothing but common humanity and a
                  sense of duty to fall back upon. But do you imagine that I shall leave Catherine
                  to his duty and humanity? and can you compare my feelings respecting Catherine to
                  his? Before you leave this house, I must exact a promise from you that you'll get
                  me an interview with her. Consent or refuse, I will see her! What do you say?" </p>
               <p>"I say, Mr. Heathcliff," I replied, "you must not. You never shall, through my
                  means. Another encounter between you and the master would kill her altogether." </p>
               <p>"With your aid that may be avoided," he continued; "and should there be danger of
                  such an event -- should he be the cause of adding a single trouble more to her
                  existence -- why, I think I shall be justified in going to extremes. I wish you
                  had sincerity enough to tell me whether Catherine would suffer greatly from his
                  loss; the fear that she would restrains me. And there you see the distinction
                  between our feelings: had he been in my place, and I in his, though I hated him
                  with a hatred that turned my life to gall, I never would have raised a hand
                  against him. You may look incredulous if you please. I never would have banished
                  him from her society as long as she desired his. The moment her regard ceased, I
                  would have torn his heart out and drunk his blood! But till then -- if you <pb
                     n="149"/>don't believe me you don't know me -- till then I would have died by
                  inches before I touched a single hair of his head!" </p>
               <p>"And yet," I interrupted, "you have no scruples in completely ruining all hopes of
                  her perfect restoration by thrusting yourself into her remembrance now, when she
                  has nearly forgotten you, and involving her in a new tumult of discord and
                  distress." </p>
               <p>"You suppose she has nearly forgotten me?" he said. "O Nelly, you know she has
                  not! You know as well as I do that for every thought she spends on Linton, she
                  spends a thousand on me! At a most miserable period of my life I had a notion of
                  the kind. It haunted me on my return to the neighbourhood last summer; but only
                  her own assurance could make me admit the horrible idea again. And then Linton
                  would be nothing, nor Hindley, nor all the dreams that ever I dreamt. Two words
                  would comprehend my future -- death and hell; existence, after losing her, would
                  be hell. Yet I was a fool to fancy for a moment that she valued Edgar Linton's
                  attachment more than mine. If he loved with all the powers of his puny being, he
                  couldn't love as much in eighty years as I could in a day. And Catherine has a
                  heart as deep as I have; the sea could be as readily contained in that
                  horse-trough as her whole affection be monopolized by him! Tush! He is scarcely a
                  degree dearer to her than her dog or her horse. It is not in him to be loved like
                  me. How can she love in him what he has not?" </p>
               <p>"Catherine and Edgar are as fond of each other as any two people can be," cried
                  Isabella with sudden vivacity. "No one has a right to talk in that manner, and I
                  won't hear my brother depreciated in silence!" </p>
               <p>"Your brother is wondrous fond of you too, isn't he?" observed Heathcliff
                  scornfully. "He turns you adrift on the world with surprising alacrity." </p>
               <p>"He is not aware of what I suffer," she replied. "I didn't tell him that." </p>
               <pb n="150"/>
               <p>"You have been telling him something, then. You have written, have you?" </p>
               <p>"To say that I was married, I did write; you saw the note." </p>
               <p>"And nothing since?" </p>
               <p>"No." </p>
               <p>"My young lady is looking sadly the worse for her change of condition," I
                  remarked. "Somebody's love comes short in her case obviously. Whose, I may guess,
                  but perhaps I shouldn't say." </p>
               <p>"I should guess it was her own," said Heathcliff. She degenerates into a mere
                  slut. She is tired of trying to please me uncommonly early. You'd hardly credit
                  it, but the very morrow of our wedding she was weeping to go home. However, she'll
                  suit this house so much the better for not being overnice, and I'll take care she
                  does not disgrace me by rambling abroad." </p>
               <p>"Well, sir," returned I, "I hope you'll consider that Mrs. Heathcliff is
                  accustomed to be looked after and waited on, and that she has been brought up like
                  an only daughter, whom every one was ready to serve. You must let her have a maid
                  to keep things tidy about her, and you must treat her kindly. Whatever be your
                  notion of Mr. Edgar, you cannot doubt that she has a capacity for strong
                  attachments, or she wouldn't have abandoned the elegances, and comforts, and
                  friends of her former home to fix contentedly in such a wilderness as this with
                  you." </p>
               <p>"She abandoned them under a delusion," he answered, "picturing in me a hero of
                  romance, and expecting unlimited indulgences from my chivalrous devotion. I can
                  hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature, so obstinately has she
                  persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my character, and acting on the false
                  impressions she cherished. But at last I think she begins to know me. I don't
                  perceive the silly smiles and grimaces that provoked me at first, and the
                  senseless incapability of discerning that I was in earnest when I gave her my
                  opinion of her infatuation and herself. It was a marvellous effort of perspicacity
                  to discover that I did not love her. I believed, at one time, no lessons could
                  teach her that. And yet it is poorly learned, for this morning she announced, as a
                  piece of appalling intelligence, that I had actually <pb n="151"/>succeeded in
                  making her hate me -- a positive labour of Hercules, I assure you! If it be
                  achieved, I have cause to return thanks. -- Can I trust your assertion, Isabella?
                  Are you sure you hate me? If I let you alone for half a day, won't you come
                  sighing and wheedling to me again? -- I dare say she would rather I had seemed all
                  tenderness before you; it wounds her vanity to have the truth exposed. But I don't
                  care who knows that the passion was wholly on one side; and I never told her a lie
                  about it. She cannot accuse me of showing one bit of deceitful softness. The first
                  thing she saw me do on coming out of the Grange was to hang up her little dog, and
                  when she pleaded for it, the first words I uttered were a wish that I had the
                  hanging of every being belonging to her, except one. Possibly she took that
                  exception for herself. But no brutality disgusted her. I suppose she has an innate
                  admiration of it, if only her precious person were secure from injury. Now, was it
                  not the depth of absurdity, of genuine idiocy, for that pitiful, slavish,
                  mean-minded brach to dream that I could love her? Tell your master, Nelly, that I
                  never, in all my life, met with such an abject thing as she is. She even disgraces
                  the name of Linton; and I've sometimes relented, from pure lack of invention, in
                  my experiments on what she could endure and still creep shamefully cringing back.
                  But tell him also to set his fraternal and magisterial heart at ease; that I keep
                  strictly within the limits of the law. I have avoided, up to this period, giving
                  her the slightest right to claim a separation; and, what's more, she'd thank
                  nobody for dividing us. If she desired to go, she might; the nuisance of her
                  presence outweighs the gratification to be derived from tormenting her." </p>
               <p>"Mr. Heathcliff," said I, "this is the talk of a madman. Your wife, most likely,
                  is convinced you are mad, and for that reason she has borne with you hitherto; but
                  now that you say she may go, she'll doubtless avail herself of the permission. --
                  You are not so bewitched, ma'am, are you, as to remain with him of your own
                  accord?" </p>
               <p>"Take care, Ellen!" answered Isabella, her eyes sparkling irefully. There was no
                  misdoubting, by their expression, the full <pb n="152"/>success of her partner's
                  endeavours to make himself detested. "Don't put faith in a single word he speaks.
                  He's a lying fiend -- a monster, and not a human being! I've been told I might
                  leave him before, and I've made the attempt, but I dare not repeat it. Only,
                  Ellen, promise you'll not mention a syllable of his infamous conversation to my
                  brother or Catherine. Whatever he may pretend, he wishes to provoke Edgar to
                  desperation. He says he has married me on purpose to obtain power over him; and he
                  shan't obtain it. I'll die first! I just hope -- I pray -- that he may forget his
                  diabolical prudence and kill me! The single pleasure I can imagine is to die or to
                  see him dead!" </p>
               <p>"There -- that will do for the present!" said Heathcliff. -- "If you are called
                  upon in a court of law you'll remember her language, Nelly. And take a good look
                  at that countenance; she's near the point which would suit me -- No; you're not
                  fit to be your own guardian, Isabella, now; and I, being your legal protector,
                  must retain you in my custody, however distasteful the obligation may be. Go
                  upstairs; I have something to say to Ellen Dean in private. That's not the way.
                  Upstairs, I tell you! Why, this is the road upstairs, child." </p>
               <p>He seized and thrust her from the room, and returned muttering, -- </p>
               <p>"I have no pity! I have no pity! The more the worms writhe, the more I yearn to
                  crush out their entrails! It is a moral teething; and I grind with greater energy
                  in proportion to the increase of pain." </p>
               <p>"Do you understand what the word pity means?" I said, hastening to resume my
                  bonnet. "Did you ever feel a touch of it in your life?" </p>
               <p>"Put that down!" he interrupted, perceiving my intention to depart. "You are not
                  going yet. Come here now, Nelly. I must either persuade or compel you to aid me in
                  fulfilling my determination to see Catherine, and that without delay. I swear that
                  I meditate no harm. I don't desire to cause any disturbance, or to exasperate or
                  insult Mr. Linton. I only wish to hear from herself how she is, and why she has
                  been ill, and to ask if anything that I could do would be of use to her. Last
                  night I was in the <pb n="153"/>Grange garden six hours, and I'll return there
                  to-night; and every night I'll haunt the place, and every day, till I find an
                  opportunity of entering. If Edgar Linton meets me I shall not hesitate to knock
                  him down, and give him enough to assure his quiescence while I stay. If his
                  servants oppose me I shall threaten them off with these pistols. But wouldn't it
                  be better to prevent my coming in contact with them or their master? And you could
                  do it so easily. I'd warn you when I came, and then you might let me in
                  unobserved, as soon as she was alone, and watch till I departed, your conscience
                  quite calm. You would be hindering mischief." </p>
               <p>I protested against playing that treacherous part in my employer's house, and,
                  besides, I urged the cruelty and selfishness of his destroying Mrs. Linton's
                  tranquillity for his satisfaction. "The commonest occurrence startles her
                  painfully," I said. "She's all nerves, and she couldn't bear the surprise, I'm
                  positive. Don't persist, sir, or else I shall be obliged to inform my master of
                  your designs, and he'll take measures to secure his house and its inmates from any
                  such unwarrantable intrusions!" </p>
               <p>"In that case, I'll take measures to secure you, woman," exclaimed Heathcliff.
                  "You shall not leave Wuthering Heights till to-morrow morning. It is a foolish
                  story to assert that Catherine could not bear to see me; and as to surprising her,
                  I don't desire it. You must prepare her; ask her if I may come. You say she never
                  mentions my name, and that I am never mentioned to her. To whom should she mention
                  me if I am a forbidden topic in the house? She thinks you are all spies for her
                  husband. Oh, I've no doubt she's in hell among you! I guess by her silence, as
                  much as anything, what she feels. You say she is often restless and
                  anxious-looking. Is that a proof of tranquillity? You talk of her mind being
                  unsettled. How the devil could it be otherwise in her frightful isolation? And
                  that insipid, paltry creature attending her former duty and humanity, from pity
                  and charity! He might as well plant an oak in a flower-pot, and expect it to
                  thrive, as imagine he can restore her to vigour in the soil of his shallow cares!
                  Let us settle it at once. Will you stay here, and am I to fight my way to
                  Catherine over Linton and his footman? or will <pb n="154"/> you be my friend, as
                  you have been hitherto, and do what I request? Decide, because there is no reason
                  for my lingering another minute if you persist in your stubborn ill-nature." </p>
               <p>Well, Mr. Lockwood, I argued and complained, and flatly refused him fifty times;
                  but in the long run he forced me to an agreement. I engaged to carry a letter from
                  him to my mistress; and should she consent, I promised to let him have
                  intelligence of Linton's next absence from home, when he might come, and get in as
                  he was able. I wouldn't be there, and my fellow-servants should be equally out of
                  the way. Was it right or wrong? I fear it was wrong, though expedient. I thought I
                  prevented another explosion by my compliance, and I thought, too, it might create
                  a favourable crisis in Catherine's mental illness. And then I remembered Mr.
                  Edgar's stern rebuke of my carrying tales, and I tried to smooth away all
                  disquietude on the subject by affirming, with frequent iteration, that that
                  betrayal of trust, if it merited so harsh an appellation, should be the last.
                  Notwithstanding, my journey homeward was sadder than my journey thither, and many
                  misgivings I had ere I could prevail on myself to put the missive into Mrs.
                  Linton's hand. </p>
               <p>But here is Kenneth. I'll go down and tell him how much better you are. My history
                  is dree, as we say, and will serve to while away another morning. </p>

               <p>Dree and dreary, I reflected, as the good woman descended to receive the doctor,
                  and not exactly of the kind which I should have chosen to amuse me. But never
                  mind. I'll extract wholesome medicines from Mrs. Dean's bitter herbs; and firstly,
                  let me beware the fascination that lurks in Catherine Heathcliff's brilliant eyes.
                  I should be in a curious taking if I surrendered my heart to that young person,
                  and the daughter turned out a second edition of the mother! </p>

               <p>Another week over -- and I am so many days nearer health, and spring ! I have now
                  heard all my neighbour's history, at different sittings, as the housekeeper could
                  spare time from more important occupations. I'll continue it in her own words,
                  only a little condensed. She is, on the whole, a very fair narrator and I don't
                  think I could improve her style.</p>
               <pb n="II.2" facs="II.10.png"/>
               <p>In the evening, she said, the evening of my visit to the Heights, I knew, as well
                  as if I saw him, that Mr. Heathcliff was about the place; and I shunned going out,
                  because I still carried his letter in my pocket, and didn't want to be threatened,
                  or teased any more.</p>
               <p>I had made up my mind not to give it till my master went somewhere, as I could not
                  guess how its receipt would affect Catherine. The consequence was, that it did not
                  reach her before the lapse of three days. The fourth was Sunday, and I brought it
                  into her room, after the family were gone to church.</p>
               <p>There was a man servant left to keep the house with me, and we generally made a
                  practice of locking the doors during the hours of service; but on that occasion
                  the weather was so warm and pleasant that I set them wide open, and, to fulfil my
                  engagement, as I knew who would be coming, I told my companion that the mistress
                  wished very much for some oranges, and he must run over to the village<pb n="II.3"
                     facs="II.11.png"/> and get a few, to be paid for on the morrow. He departed,
                  and I went upstairs.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Linton sat in a loose, white dress, with a light shawl over her shoulders, in
                  the recess of the open window as usual. Her thick, long hair had been partly
                  removed at the beginning of her illness, and now she wore it simply combed in its
                  natural tresses over her temples and neck. Her appearance was altered, as I had
                  told Heathcliff; but when she was calm there seemed unearthly beauty in the
                  change.</p>
               <p>The flash of her eyes had been succeeded by a dreamy and melancholy softness; they
                  no longer gave the impression of looking at the objects around her; they appeared
                  always to gaze beyond, and far beyond -- you would have said out of this world.
                  Then the paleness of her face -- its haggard aspect having vanished as she
                  recovered flesh -- and the peculiar expression arising from her mental state,
                  though painfully suggestive of their causes, added to <pb n="II.4"
                     facs="II.12.png"/>the touching interest which she awakened, and -- invariably
                  to me, I know, and to any person who saw her, I should think -- refuted more
                  tangible proofs of convalescence, and stamped her as one doomed to decay. </p>
               <p>A book lay spread on the sill before her, and the scarcely perceptible wind
                  fluttered its leaves at intervals. I believe Linton had laid it there, for she
                  never endeavoured to divert herself with reading or occupation of any kind, and he
                  would spend many an hour in trying to entice her attention to some subject which
                  had formerly been her amusement. She was conscious of his aim, and in her better
                  moods endured his efforts placidly, only showing their uselessness by now and then
                  suppressing a wearied sigh, and checking him at last with the saddest of smiles
                  and kisses. At other times she would turn petulantly away, and hide her face in
                  her hands, or even push him off angrily; and then he took care to let her alone,
                  for he was certain of doing no good. </p>
               <pb n="II.5" facs="II.13.png"/>
               <p>Gimmerton chapel bells were still ringing, and the full, mellow flow of the beck
                  in the valley came soothingly on the ear. It was a sweet substitute for the yet
                  absent murmur of the summer foliage which drowned that music about the Grange when
                  the trees were in leaf. At Wuthering Heights it always sounded on quiet days
                  following a great thaw or a season of steady rain. And of Wuthering Heights
                  Catherine was thinking as she listened -- that is, if she thought or listened at
                  all; but she had the vague, distant look I mentioned before, which expressed no
                  recognition of material things either by ear or eye. </p>
               <p>"There's a letter for you, Mrs. Linton," I said, gently inserting it in one hand
                  that rested on her knee. "You must read it immediately, because it wants an
                  answer. Shall I break the seal?" "Yes," she answered, without altering the
                  direction of her eyes. I opened it; it was very short. <pb n="II.6"
                     facs="II.14.png"/>"Now," I continued, "read it." She drew away her hand, and
                  let it fall. I replaced it in her lap, and stood waiting till it should please her
                  to glance down; but that movement was so long delayed that at last I resumed -- </p>
               <p>"Must I read it, ma'am? It is from Mr. Heathcliff." </p>
               <p>There was a start and a troubled gleam of recollection, and a struggle to arrange
                  her ideas. She lifted the letter, and seemed to peruse it, and when she came to
                  the signature she sighed; yet still I found she had not gathered its import, for,
                  upon my desiring to hear her reply, she merely pointed to the name and gazed at me
                  with mournful and questioning eagerness. </p>
               <p>"Well, he wishes to see you," said I, guessing her need of an interpreter. "He's
                  in the garden by this time, and impatient to know what answer I shall bring." </p>
               <p>As I spoke I observed a large dog lying on <pb n="II.7" facs="II.15.png"/>the
                  sunny grass beneath raise its ears as if about to bark, and then, smoothing them
                  back, announce, by a wag of the tail, that some one approached whom it did not
                  consider a stranger. Mrs. Linton bent forward and listened breathlessly. The
                  minute after a step traversed the hall. The open house was too tempting for
                  Heathcliff to resist walking in. Most likely he supposed that I was inclined to
                  shirk my promise, and so resolved to trust to his own audacity.</p>
               <p>With straining eagerness Catherine gazed towards the entrance of her chamber. He
                  did not hit the right room directly. She motioned me to admit him, but he found it
                  out ere I could reach the door, and in a stride or two was at her side, and had
                  her grasped in his arms. </p>
               <p>He neither spoke nor loosed his hold for some five minutes, during which period he
                  bestowed more kisses than ever he gave in his <pb n="II.8" facs="II.16.png"/>life
                  before, I dare say; but then my mistress had kissed him first, and I plainly saw
                  that he could hardly bear, for downright agony, to look into her face. The same
                  conviction had stricken him as me, from the instant he beheld her, that there was
                  no prospect of ultimate recovery there; she was fated, sure to die. </p>
               <p>"O Cathy! O my life! how can I bear it?" was the first sentence he uttered, in a
                  tone that did not seek to disguise his despair. And now he stared at her so
                  earnestly that I thought the very intensity of his gaze would bring tears into his
                  eyes; but they burned with anguish -- they did not melt. </p>
               <p>"What now?" said Catherine, leaning back and returning his look with a suddenly
                  clouded brow. Her humour was a mere vane for constantly varying caprices. "You and
                  Edgar have broken my heart, Heathcliff! And you both come to bewail the deed to
                  me, as if you were the people to be pitied! I shall not pity you, not I. You have
                  killed me -- and <pb n="II.9" facs="II.17.png"/>thriven on it, I think. How strong
                  you are! How many years do you mean to live after I am gone?" </p>
               <p>Heathcliff had knelt on one knee to embrace her. He attempted to rise, but she
                  seized his hair and kept him down. </p>
               <p>"I wish I could hold you," she continued bitterly, "till we were both dead! I
                  shouldn't care what you suffered. I care nothing for your sufferings. Why
                  shouldn't you suffer? I do! Will you forget me? Will you be happy when I am in the
                  earth? Will you say twenty years hence, 'That's the grave of Catherine Earnshaw. I
                  loved her long ago, and was wretched to lose her; but it is past. I've loved many
                  others since. My children are dearer to me than she was, and at death I shall not
                  rejoice that I am going to her; I shall be sorry that I must leave them.' Will you
                  say so, Heathcliff?" </p>
               <p>"Don't torture me till I'm as mad as your-<pb n="II.10" facs="II.18.png"/>self,"
                  cried he, wrenching his head free and grinding his teeth. </p>
               <p>The two, to a cool spectator, made a strange and fearful picture. Well might
                  Catherine deem that heaven would be a land of exile to her, unless with her mortal
                  body she cast away her moral character also. Her present countenance had a wild
                  vindictiveness in its white cheek, and a bloodless lip and a scintillating eye;
                  and she retained in her closed fingers a portion of the locks she had been
                  grasping. As to her companion, while raising himself with one hand, he had taken
                  her arm with the other, and so inadequate was his stock of gentleness to the
                  requirements of her condition that on his letting go I saw four distinct
                  impressions left blue in the colourless skin. </p>
               <p>"Are you possessed with a devil," he pursued savagely, "to talk in that manner to
                  me when you are dying? Do you reflect that all those words will be branded in my
                  memory, <pb n="II.11" facs="II.19.png"/>and eating deeper eternally after you have
                  left me? You know you lie to say I have killed you; and, Catherine, you know that
                  I could as soon forget you as my existence! Is it not sufficient for your infernal
                  selfishness that, while you are at peace, I shall writhe in the torments of hell?" </p>
               <p>"I shall not be at peace," moaned Catherine, recalled to a sense of physical
                  weakness by the violent, unequal throbbing of her heart, which beat visibly and
                  audibly under this excess of agitation. She said nothing further till the paroxysm
                  was over, then she continued more kindly, -- </p>
               <p>"I'm not wishing you greater torment than I have, Heathcliff. I only wish us never
                  to be parted; and should a word of mine distress you hereafter, think I feel the
                  same distress underground, and for my own sake forgive me! Come here and kneel
                  down again. You never harmed me in your life. Nay, if you nurse anger, that will
                  be worse to remember <pb n="II.12" facs="II.20.png"/>than my harsh words. Won't
                  you come here again? Do!" </p>
               <p>Heathcliff went to the back of her chair and leant over, but not so far as to let
                  her see his face, which was livid with emotion. She bent round to look at him. He
                  would not permit it. Turning abruptly, he walked to the fireplace, where he stood,
                  silent, with his back towards us. Mrs. Linton's glance followed him suspiciously.
                  Every movement woke a new sentiment in her. After a pause and a prolonged gaze she
                  resumed, addressing me in accents of indignant disappointment, -- </p>
               <p>"Oh, you see, Nelly, he would not relent a moment to keep me out of the grave!
                  That is how I'm loved! Well, never mind. That is not my Heathcliff. I shall love
                  mine yet, and take him with me; he's in my soul. And," added she musingly, "the
                  thing that irks me most is this shattered prison, after all. I'm tired of being
                  enclosed here. I'm <pb n="II.13" facs="II.21.png"/>wearying to escape into that
                  glorious world, and to be always there -- not seeing it dimly through tears, and
                  yearning for it through the walls of an aching heart, but really with it and in
                  it. Nelly, you think you are better and more fortunate than I, in full health and
                  strength. You are sorry for me. Very soon that will be altered. I shall be sorry
                  for you. I shall be incomparably beyond and above you all. I wonder he won't be
                  near me!" she went on to herself. "I thought he wished it -- Heathcliff dear, you
                  should not be sullen now. Do come to me, Heathcliff." </p>
               <p>In her eagerness she rose and supported herself on the arm of the chair. At that
                  earnest appeal he turned to her, looking absolutely desperate. His eyes, wide and
                  wet, at last flashed fiercely on her; his breast heaved convulsively. An instant
                  they held asunder, and then how they met I hardly saw, but Catherine made a
                  spring, and he caught her, and they were locked in an embrace from <pb n="II.14"
                     facs="II.22.png"/>which I thought my mistress would never be released alive --
                  in fact, to my eyes, she seemed directly insensible. He flung himself into the
                  nearest seat, and on my approaching hurriedly to ascertain if she had fainted, he
                  gnashed at me and foamed like a mad dog, and gathered her to him with greedy
                  jealousy. I did not feel as if I were in the company of a creature of my own
                  species. It appeared that he would not understand, though I spoke to him, so I
                  stood off and held my tongue in great perplexity. </p>
               <p>A movement of Catherine's relieved me a little presently. She put up her hand to
                  clasp his neck, and bring her cheek to his as he held her; while he, in return,
                  covering her with frantic caresses, said wildly, -- </p>
               <p>"You teach me now how cruel you've been -- cruel and false. Why did you despise
                  me? Why did you betray your own heart, Cathy? I have not one word of comfort. You
                  deserve this. You have killed yourself. Yes, you <pb n="II.15" facs="II.23.png"
                  />may kiss me, and cry, and wring out my kisses and tears; they'll blight you --
                  they'll damn you. You loved me; then what right had you to leave me? What right --
                  answer me -- for the poor fancy you felt for Linton? Because misery, and
                  degradation, and death, and nothing that God or Satan could inflict would have
                  parted us, you, of your own will, did it. I have not broken your heart -- you have
                  broken it; and in breaking it you have broken mine. So much the worse for me that
                  I am strong. Do I want to live? What kind of living will it be when you -- O God!
                  would you like to live with your soul in the grave?" </p>
               <p>"Let me alone! let me alone!" sobbed Catherine. "If I've done wrong, I'm dying for
                  it. It is enough! You left me too; but I won't upbraid you. I forgive you. Forgive
                  me." </p>
               <p>"It is hard to forgive, and to look at those eyes, and feel those wasted hands,"
                  he an<pb n="II.16" facs="II.24.png"/>swered. "Kiss me again, and don't let me see
                  your eyes. I forgive what you have done to me. I love my murderer -- but yours!
                  How can I?" </p>
               <p>They were silent -- their faces hid against each other, and washed by each other's
                  tears. At least, I suppose the weeping was on both sides, as it seemed Heathcliff
                  could weep on a great occasion like this. </p>
               <p>I grew very uncomfortable, meanwhile, for the afternoon wore fast away, the man
                  whom I had sent off returned from his errand, and I could distinguish by the shine
                  of the western sun up the valley a concourse thickening outside Gimmerton chapel
                  porch. </p>
               <p>"Service is over," I announced. "My master will be here in half an hour." </p>
               <p>Heathcliff groaned a curse, and strained Catherine closer. She never moved. </p>
               <p>Ere long I perceived a group of the servants passing up the road towards the
                  kitchen wing. Mr. Linton was not far behind. He opened the <pb n="II.17"
                     facs="II.25.png"/>gate himself, and sauntered slowly up, probably e njoying the
                  lovely afternoon, that breathed as soft as summer. </p>
               <p>"Now he is here!" I exclaimed. "For Heaven's sake hurry down! You'll not meet any
                  one on the front stairs. Do be quick, and stay among the trees till he is fairly
                  in." </p>
               <p>"I must go, Cathy," said Heathcliff, seeking to extricate himself from his
                  companion's arms. "But if I live I'll see you again before you are asleep. I won't
                  stray five yards from your window." </p>
               <p>"You must not go!" she answered, holding him as firmly as her strength allowed.
                  "You shall not, I tell you." </p>
               <p>"For one hour," he pleaded earnestly. </p>
               <p>"Not for one minute," she replied. </p>
               <p>"I must; Linton will be up immediately," persisted the alarmed intruder. </p>
               <p>He would have risen and unfixed her fingers by the act; she clung fast, gasping.
                  There was mad resolution in her face. </p>
               <pb n="II.18" facs="II.26.png"/>
               <p>"No!" she shrieked. "Oh, don't, don't go! It is the last time! Edgar will not hurt
                  us. Heathcliff, I shall die! I shall die!" </p>
               <p>"Damn the fool! There he is!" cried Heathcliff, sinking back into his seat. "Hush,
                  my darling! Hush, hush, Catherine! I'll stay. If he shot me so, I'd expire with a
                  blessing on my lips." </p>
               <p>And there they were fast again. I heard my master mounting the stairs. The cold
                  sweat ran from my forehead; I was horrified. </p>
               <p>"Are you going to listen to her ravings?" I said passionately. "She does not know
                  what she says. Will you ruin her because she has not wit to help herself? Get up!
                  You could be free instantly. That is the most diabolical deed that ever you did.
                  We are all done for -- master, mistress, and servant." </p>
               <p>I wrung my hands and cried out, and Mr. Linton hastened his step at the noise. In
                  the midst of my agitation I was sincerely glad to <pb n="II.19" facs="II.27.png"
                  />observe that Catherine's arms had fallen relaxed, and her head hung down. </p>
               <p>"She's fainted or dead," I thought; "so much the better. Far better that she
                  should be dead than lingering a burden and a misery-maker to all about her."</p>
               <p>Edgar sprang to his unbidden guest, blanched with astonishment and rage. What he
                  meant to do I cannot tell. However, the other stopped all demonstrations at once
                  by placing the lifeless-looking form in his arms. </p>
               <p>"Look there!" he said. "Unless you be a fiend, help her first; then you shall
                  speak to me!" </p>
               <p>He walked into the parlour and sat down. Mr. Linton summoned me, and with great
                  difficulty, and after resorting to many means, we managed to restore her to
                  sensation; but she was all bewildered. She sighed and moaned, and knew nobody.
                  Edgar, in his anxiety for her, forgot her hated friend. I did not. I went at the
                  earliest opportunity and <pb n="II.20" facs="II.28.png"/>besought him to depart,
                  affirming that Catherine was better, and he should hear from me in the morning how
                  she passed the night. </p>
               <p>"I shall not refuse to go out of doors," he answered, "but I shall stay in the
                  garden; and, Nelly, mind you keep your word to-morrow. I shall be under those
                  larch trees. Mind! or I pay another visit, whether Linton be in or not." </p>
               <p>He sent a rapid glance through the half-open door of the chamber, and,
                  ascertaining that what I stated was apparently true, delivered the house of his
                  luckless presence. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="2.2">
               <head>Chapter 2.2</head>
               <pb n="II.21" facs="II.29.png"/>
               <p>About twelve o'clock, that night, was born the Catherine you saw at Wuthering
                  Heights, a puny, seven months' child; and two hours after the mother died, having
                  never recovered sufficient consciousness to miss Heathcliff, or know Edgar.</p>
               <p>The latter's distraction at his bereavement is a subject too painful to be dwelt
                  on; its after effects showed how deep the sorrow sunk.</p>
               <p>A great addition, in my eyes, was his-being left without an heir. I bemoaned that,
                  as I <pb n="II.22" facs="II.30.png"/>gazed on the feeble orphan; and I mentally
                  abused old Linton for, what was only natural partiality, the securing his estate
                  to his own daughter, instead of his son's.</p>
               <p>An unwelcomed infant it was, poor thing ! It might have wailed out of life, and
                  nobody cared a morsel, during those first hours of existence. We redeemed the
                  neglect afterwards; but its beginning was as friendless as its end is likely to
                  be.</p>
               <p>Next morning -- bright and cheerful out of doors -- stole softened in through the
                  blinds of the silent room, and suffused the couch and its occupant with a mellow,
                  tender glow.</p>
               <p>Edgar Linton had his head laid on the pillow, and his eyes shut. His young and
                  fair features were almost as death-like as those of the form beside him, and
                  almost as fixed; but his was the hush of exhausted anguish, and hers of perfect
                  peace. Her brow smooth, her lids closed, her lips wearing the expression of a
                  smile, no angel in heaven could be more <pb n="II.23" facs="II.31.png"/>beautiful
                  than she appeared; and I partook of the infinite calm in which she lay. My mind
                  was never in a holier frame than while I gazed on that untroubled image of Divine
                  rest. I instinctively echoed the words she had uttered, a few hours before.
                  "Incomparably beyond and above us all ! Whether still on earth or now in Heaven,
                  her spirit is at home with God!"</p>
               <p>I don't know if it be a peculiarity in me, but I am seldom otherwise than happy
                  while watching in the chamber of death, should no frenzied or despairing mourner
                  share the duty with me. I see a repose that neither earth nor hell can break, and
                  I feel an assurance of the endless and shadowless hereafter -- the eternity they
                  have entered -- where life is boundless in its duration, and love in its sympathy,
                  and joy in its fullness. I noticed on that occasion how much selfishness there is
                  even in a love like Mr. Linton's, when he so regretted Catherine's blessed
                  release!</p>
               <pb n="II.24" facs="II.32.png"/>
               <p>To be sure, one might have doubted, after the wayward and impatient existence she
                  had led, whether she merited a haven of peace at last. One might doubt in seasons
                  of cold reflection, but not then, in the presence of her corpse. It asserted its
                  own tranquillity, which seemed a pledge of equal quiet to its former inhabitants. </p>
               <p>Do you believe such people are happy in the other world, sir? I'd give a great
                  deal to know. </p>
               <p>I declined answering Mrs. Dean's question, which struck me as something heterodox.
                  She proceeded, -- </p>
               <p>Retracing the course of Catherine Linton, I fear we have no right to think she is;
                  but we'll leave her with her Maker. </p>
               <p>The master looked asleep, and I ventured soon after sunrise to quit the room and
                  steal out to the pure refreshing air. The servants thought me gone to shake off
                  the drowsiness of my protracted watch; in reality, my chief <pb n="II.25"
                     facs="II.33.png"/> motive was seeing Mr.Heathcliff. If he had remained among
                  the larches all night he would have heard nothing of the stir at the Grange --
                  unless, perhaps, he might catch the gallop of the messenger going to Gimmerton. If
                  he had come nearer he would probably be aware, from the lights flitting to and
                  fro, and the opening and shutting of the outer doors, that all was not right
                  within. I wished yet feared to find him. I felt the terrible news must be told,
                  and I longed to get it over; but how to do it I did not know. He was there -- at
                  least a few yards farther in the park -- leant against an old ash tree, his hat
                  off, and his hair soaked with the dew that had gathered on the budded branches,
                  and fell pattering round him. He had been standing a long time in that position,
                  for I saw a pair of ousels passing and repassing scarcely three feet from him,
                  busy in building their nest, and regarding his proximity no more than that <pb
                     n="II.26" facs="II.34.png"/>of a piece of timber. They flew off at my approach,
                  and he raised his eyes and spoke. </p>
               <p>"She's dead!" he said. "I've not waited for you to learn that. Put your
                  handkerchief away; don't snivel before me. Damn you all! she wants none of your
                  tears!" </p>
               <p>I was weeping as much for him as her; we do sometimes pity creatures that have
                  none of the feeling either for themselves or others. When I first looked into his
                  face, I perceived that he had got intelligence of the catastrophe; and a foolish
                  notion struck me that his heart was quelled, and he prayed, because his lips
                  moved, and his gaze was bent on the ground. </p>
               <p>"Yes, she's dead!" I answered, checking my sobs and drying my cheeks -- "gone to
                  heaven, I hope, where we may, every one, join her, if we take due warning and
                  leave our evil ways to follow good!" </p>
               <p>"Did she take due warning, then?" asked Heathcliff, attempting a sneer. "Did she
                  die <pb n="II.27" facs="II.35.png"/>like a saint? Come, give me a true history of
                  the event. How did -- " </p>
               <p>He endeavoured to pronounce the name, but could not manage it; and compressing his
                  mouth he held a silent combat with his inward agony, defying, meanwhile, my
                  sympathy with an unflinching ferocious stare. "How did she die?" he resumed at
                  last, fain, notwithstanding his hardihood, to have a support behind him; for,
                  after the struggle, he trembled, in spite of himself, to his very finger-ends. </p>
               <p>"Poor wretch!" I thought, "you have a heart and nerves the same as your brother
                  men! Why should you be anxious to conceal them? Your pride cannot blind God. You
                  tempt Him to wring them till He forces a cry of humiliation." </p>
               <p>"Quietly as a lamb!" I answered aloud. "She drew a sigh, and stretched herself,
                  like a child reviving, and sinking again to sleep; <pb n="II.28" facs="II.36.png"
                  /> and five minutes after I felt one little pulse at her heart, and nothing more!" </p>
               <p>"And -- did she ever mention me?" he asked, hesitating, as if he dreaded the
                  answer to his question would introduce details that he could not bear to hear. </p>
               <p>"Her senses never returned. She recognized nobody from the time you left her," I
                  said. "She lies with a sweet smile on her face, and her latest ideas wandered back
                  to pleasant early days. Her life closed in a gentle dream. May she wake as kindly
                  in the other world!" </p>
               <p>"May she wake in torment!" he cried with frightful vehemence, stamping his foot
                  and groaning in a sudden paroxysm of ungovernable passion. "Why, she's a liar to
                  the end. Where is she? Not there -- not in heaven -- not perished -- where? -- Oh!
                  you said you cared nothing for my sufferings! And I pray one prayer -- I repeat it
                  till my tongue stiffens -- Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest as long as I am
                  living! You said I killed you -- <pb n="II.29" facs="II.37.png"/>haunt me, then!
                  The murdered do haunt their murderers, I believe. I know that ghosts have wandered
                  on earth. Be with me always -- take any form -- drive me mad -- only do not leave
                  me in this abyss, where I cannot find you! O God! it is unutterable! I cannot live
                  without my life! I cannot live without my soul!" </p>
               <p>He dashed his head against the knotted trunk, and, lifting up his eyes, howled --
                  not like a man, but like a savage beast being goaded to death with knives and
                  spears. I observed several splashes of blood about the bark of the tree, and his
                  hand and forehead were both stained; probably the scene I witnessed was a
                  repetition of others acted during the night. It hardly moved my compassion -- it
                  appalled me; still I felt reluctant to quit him so. But the moment he recollected
                  himself enough to notice me watching, he thundered a command for me to go, and I
                  obeyed. He was beyond my skill to quiet or console. </p>
               <pb n="II.30" facs="II.38.png"/>
               <p>Mrs. Linton's funeral was appointed to take place on the Friday following her
                  decease, and till then her coffin remained uncovered and strewn with flowers and
                  scented leaves in the great drawing-room. Linton spent his days and nights there,
                  a sleepless guardian; and -- a circumstance concealed from all but me --
                  Heathcliff spent his nights, at least, outside, equally a stranger to repose. I
                  held no communication with him. Still, I was conscious of his design to enter, if
                  he could; and on the Tuesday, a little after dark, when my master, from sheer
                  fatigue, had been compelled to retire a couple of hours, I went and opened one of
                  the windows, moved by his perseverance to give him a chance of bestowing on the
                  faded image of his idol one final adieu. He did not omit to avail himself of the
                  opportunity, cautiously and briefly -- too cautiously to betray his presence by
                  the slightest noise. Indeed, I shouldn't have discovered that <pb n="II.31"
                     facs="II.39.png"/>he had been there, except for the disarrangement of the
                  drapery about the corpse's face, and for observing on the floor a curl of light
                  hair fastened with a silver thread, which, on examination, I ascertained to have
                  been taken from a locket hung round Catherine's neck. Heathcliff had opened the
                  trinket and cast out its contents, replacing them by a black lock of his own. I
                  twisted the two, and enclosed them together. </p>
               <p>Mr. Earnshaw was, of course, invited to attend the remains of his sister to the
                  grave. He sent no excuse, but he never came; so that, besides her husband, the
                  mourners were wholly composed of tenants and servants. Isabella was not asked. </p>
               <p>The place of Catherine's interment, to the surprise of the villagers, was neither
                  in the chapel under the carved monument of the Lintons, nor yet by the tombs of
                  her own relations outside. It was dug on a green slope in a corner of the
                  kirkyard, where the <pb n="II.32" facs="II.40.png"/>wall is so low that heath and
                  bilberry plants have climbed over it from the moor, and peat mould almost buries
                  it. Her husband lies in the same spot now, and they have each a simple headstone
                  above, and a plain gray block at their feet, to mark the graves. </p>

               <pb n="II.33" facs="II.41.png"/>
               <p>That Friday made the last of our fine days, for a month. In the evening, the
                  weather broke; the wind shifted from south to north-east, and brought rain first,
                  and then sleet and snow.</p>
               <p>On the morrow one could hardly imagine that there had been three weeks of summer:
                  the primroses and crocuses were hidden under wintry drifts: the larks were silent,
                  the young leaves of the early trees smitten and blackened -- And dreary, and
                  chill, and dismal that mor<pb n="II.34" facs="II.42.png"/>row did creep over ! My
                  master kept his room -- I took possession of the lonely parlour, converting it
                  into a nursery; and there I was sitting, with the moaning doll of a child laid on
                  my knee, rocking it to and fro, and watching, meanwhile, the still driving flakes
                  build up the uncurtained window, when the door opened, and some person entered,
                  out of breath and laughing !</p>
               <p>My anger was greater than my astonishment for a minute; I supposed it one of the
                  maids, and I cried,</p>
               <p>"Have done ! How dare you show your giddiness here ? What would Mr. Linton say if
                  he heard you ?"</p>
               <p>"Excuse me!" answered a familiar voice, "but I know Edgar is in bed, and I cannot
                  stop myself."</p>
               <p>With that, the speaker came forward to the fire, panting and holding her hand to
                  her side.</p>
               <p>"I have run the whole way from Wuthering Heights!" she continued, after a pause.
                     'Ex<pb n="II.35" facs="II.43.png"/>cept where I've flown -- I couldn't count
                  the number of falls I've had -- Oh, I'm aching all over! Don't be alarmed -- There
                  shall be an explanation as soon as I can give it -- only just have the goodness to
                  step out and order the carriage to take me on to Gimmerton, and tell a servant to
                  seek up a few clothes in my wardrobe."</p>
               <p>The intruder was Mrs. Heathcliff -- she certainly seemed in no laughing
                  predicament: her hair streamed on her shoulders, dripping with snow and water; she
                  was dressed in the girlish dress she commonly wore, befitting her age more than
                  her position -- a low frock with short sleeves, and nothing on either head or
                  neck. The frock was of light silk, and clung to her with wet, and her feet were
                  protected merely by thin slippers; add to this a deep cut under one ear, which
                  only the cold prevented from bleeding profusely, a white face scratched and
                  bruised, and a frame hardly able to support itself, through fatigue, and you <pb
                     n="II.36" facs="II.44.png"/>may fancy my first fright was not much allayed when
                  I had had leisure to examine her. </p>
               <p>"My dear young lady," I exclaimed, "I'll stir nowhere, and hear nothing, till you
                  have removed every article of your clothes, and put on dry things; and certainly
                  you shall not go to Gimmerton to-night, so it is needless to order the carriage." </p>
               <p>"Certainly I shall," she said -- "walking or riding. Yet I've no objection to
                  dress myself decently. And -- Ah, see how it flows down my neck now! The fire does
                  make it smart." </p>
               <p>She insisted on my fulfilling her directions before she would let me touch her;
                  and not till after the coachman had been instructed to get ready, and a maid set
                  to pack up some necessary attire, did I obtain her consent for binding the wound,
                  and helping to change her garments. </p>
               <p>"Now, Ellen," she said, when my task was finished and she was seated in an
                  easy-chair on the hearth, with a cup of tea before her,<pb n="II.37"
                     facs="II.45.png"/> "you sit down opposite me, and put poor Catherine's baby
                  away. I don't like to see it. You mustn't think I care little for Catherine
                  because I behaved so foolishly on entering. I've cried, too, bitterly -- yes, more
                  than any one else has reason to cry. We parted unreconciled, you remember, and I
                  shan't forgive myself. But, for all that, I was not going to sympathize with him
                  -- the brute beast! Oh, give me the poker! This is the last thing of his I have
                  about me." She slipped the gold ring from her third finger, and threw it on the
                  floor. "I'll smash it!" she continued, striking it with childish spite, "and then
                  I'll burn it!" And she took and dropped the misused article among the coals.
                  "There! he shall buy another if he gets me back again. He'd be capable of coming
                  to seek me, to tease Edgar. I dare not stay, lest that notion should possess his
                  wicked head! And besides, Edgar has not been kind, has he? And I won't come suing
                  for his assistance, nor will I bring him into <pb n="II.37" facs="II.46.png"/>more
                  trouble. Necessity compelled me to seek shelter here, though, if I had not learned
                  he was out of the way, I'd have halted at the kitchen, washed my face, warmed
                  myself, got you to bring what I wanted, and departed again to anywhere out of the
                  reach of my accursed -- off that incarnate goblin! Ah, he was in such a fury! If
                  he had caught me! It's a pity Earnshaw is not his match in strength. I wouldn't
                  have run till I'd seen him all but demolished, had Hindley been able to do it." </p>
               <p>"Well, don't talk so fast, miss," I interrupted; "you'll disorder the handkerchief
                  I have tied round your face, and make the cut bleed again. Drink your tea, and
                  take breath, and give over laughing; laughter is sadly out of place under this
                  roof, and in your condition!" </p>
               <p>"An undeniable truth," she replied. "Listen to that child! It maintains a constant
                  wail. Send it out of my hearing for an hour; I shan't stay any longer." </p>
               <pb n="II.39" facs="II.47.png"/>
               <p>I rang the bell and committed it to a servant's care, and then I inquired what had
                  urged her to escape from Wuthering Heights in such an unlikely plight, and where
                  she meant to go, as she refused remaining with us. </p>
               <p>"I ought and I wish to remain," answered she -- "to cheer Edgar and take care of
                  the baby, for two things, and because the Grange is my right home. But I tell you
                  he wouldn't let me. Do you think he could bear to see me grow fat and merry, could
                  bear to think that we were tranquil, and not resolve on poisoning our comfort?
                  Now, I have the satisfaction of being sure that he detests me to the point of its
                  annoying him seriously to have me within earshot or eyesight. I notice, when I
                  enter his presence, the muscles of his countenance are involuntarily distorted
                  into an expression of hatred, partly arising from his knowledge of the good causes
                  I have <pb n="II.40" facs="II.48.png"/>to feel that sentiment for him, and partly
                  from original aversion. It is strong enough to make me feel pretty certain that he
                  would not chase me over England supposing I contrived a clear escape, and
                  therefore I must get quite away. I've recovered from my first desire to be killed
                  by him; I'd rather he'd kill himself! He has extinguished my love effectually, and
                  so I'm at my ease. I can recollect yet how I loved him, and can dimly imagine that
                  I could still be loving him, if -- no, no! Even if he had doted on me, the
                  devilish nature would have revealed its existence somehow. Catherine had an
                  awfully perverted taste to esteem him so dearly, knowing him so well. Monster!
                  Would that he could be blotted out of creation and out of my memory!" </p>
               <p>"Hush, hush! He's a human being," I said. "Be more charitable. There are worse men
                  than he is yet." </p>
               <p>"He's not a human being," she retorted, <pb n="II.41" facs="II.49.png"/>"and he
                  has no claim on my charity. I gave him my heart, and he took and pinched it to
                  death, and flung it back to me. People feel with their hearts, Ellen; and since he
                  has destroyed mine, I have not power to feel for him, and I would not, though he
                  groaned from this to his dying day, and wept tears of blood for Catherine! No,
                  indeed, indeed, I wouldn't!" And here Isabella began to cry; but, immediately
                  dashing the water from her lashes, she recommenced. "You asked, what has driven me
                  to flight at last? I was compelled to attempt it, because I had succeeded in
                  rousing his rage a pitch above his malignity. Pulling out the nerves with red-hot
                  pincers requires more coolness than knocking on the head. He was worked up to
                  forget the fiendish prudence he boasted of, and proceeded to murderous violence. I
                  experienced pleasure in being able to exasperate him; the sense of pleasure woke
                  my instinct of self-preservation, so I fairly broke <pb n="II.42" facs="II.50.png"
                  />free; and if ever I come into his hands again, he is welcome to a signal
                  revenge. </p>
               <p>"Yesterday, you know, Mr. Earnshaw should have been at the funeral. He kept
                  himself sober for the purpose, tolerably sober -- not going to bed mad at six
                  o'clock and getting up drunk at twelve. Consequently he rose, in suicidal low
                  spirits, as fit for the church as for a dance; and instead, he sat down by the
                  fire and swallowed gin or brandy by tumblerfuls. </p>

               <p>"Heathcliff -- I shudder to name him! -- has been a stranger in the house from
                  last Sunday till to-day. Whether the angels have fed him, or his kin beneath, I
                  cannot tell; but he has not eaten a meal with us for nearly a week. He has just
                  come home at dawn, and gone upstairs to his chamber, locking himself in -- as if
                  anybody dreamt of coveting his company! There he has continued, praying like a
                  Methodist -- only the deity he implored is senseless dust and ashes; and God, when
                  addressed, was <pb n="II.43" facs="II.51.png"/>curiously confounded with his own
                  black father! After concluding these precious orisons -- and they lasted generally
                  till he grew hoarse and his voice was strangled in his throat -- he would be off
                  again, always straight down to the Grange! I wonder Edgar did not send for a
                  constable, and give him into custody. For me, grieved as I was about Catherine, it
                  was impossible to avoid regarding this season of deliverance from degrading
                  oppression as a holiday. </p>
               <p>"I recovered spirits sufficient to hear Joseph's eternal lectures without weeping,
                  and to move up and down the house less with the foot of a frightened thief than
                  formerly. You wouldn't think that I should cry at anything Joseph could say; but
                  he and Hareton are detestable companions. I'd rather sit with Hindley, and hear
                  his awful talk, than with 't' little maister' and his stanch supporter, that
                  odious old man! When Heathcliff is in, I'm often obliged to <pb n="II.44"
                     facs="II.52.png"/>seek the kitchen and their society, or starve among the damp
                  uninhabited chambers. When he is not, as was the case this week, I establish a
                  table and chair at one corner of the house fire, and never mind how Mr. Earnshaw
                  may occupy himself; and he does not interfere with my arrangements. He is quieter
                  now than he used to be, if no one provokes him -- more sullen and depressed and
                  less furious. Joseph affirms he's sure he's an altered man, that the Lord has
                  touched his heart, and he is saved 'so as by fire.' I'm puzzled to detect signs of
                  the favourable change; but it is not my business. </p>
               <p>"Yester-evening I sat in my nook reading some old books till late on towards
                  twelve. It seemed so dismal to go upstairs, with the wild snow blowing outside,
                  and my thoughts continually reverting to the kirkyard and the new-made grave. I
                  dared hardly lift my eyes from the page before me, that melancholy scene so
                  instantly usurped its place. <pb n="II.45" facs="II.53.png"/>Hindley sat opposite,
                  his head leant on his hand, perhaps meditating on the same subject. He had ceased
                  drinking at a point below irrationality, and had neither stirred nor spoken during
                  two or three hours. There was no sound through the house but the moaning wind,
                  which shook the windows every now and then, the faint crackling of the coals, and
                  the click of my snuffers as I removed at intervals the long wick of the candle.
                  Hareton and Joseph were probably fast asleep in bed. It was very, very sad; and
                  while I read I sighed, for it seemed as if all joy had vanished from the world,
                  never to be restored. </p>
               <p>"The doleful silence was broken at length by the sound of the kitchen latch.
                  Heathcliff had returned from his watch earlier than usual, owing, I suppose, to
                  the sudden storm. That entrance was fastened, and we heard him coming round to get
                  in by the other. I rose with an irrepressible expression of what I felt on my
                  lips, which induced my companion, <pb n="II.46" facs="II.54.png"/>who had been
                  staring towards the door, to turn and look at me. </p>
               <p>" 'I'll keep him out five minutes,' he exclaimed. 'You won't object?' </p>
               <p>" 'No; you may keep him out the whole night for me,' I answered. 'Do; put the key
                  in the lock, and draw the bolts.' </p>
               <p>"Earnshaw accomplished this ere his guest reached the front. He then came and
                  brought his chair to the other side of my table, leaning over it, and searching in
                  my eyes for a sympathy with the burning hate that gleamed from his. As he both
                  looked and felt like an assassin, he couldn't exactly find that; but he discovered
                  enough to encourage him to speak. </p>
               <p>" 'You and I,' he said, 'have each a great debt to settle with the man out yonder.
                  If we were neither of us cowards, we might combine to discharge it. Are you as
                  soft as your brother? Are you willing to endure to the last, and not once attempt
                  a repayment?' </p>
               <p>" 'I'm weary of enduring now,' I replied, <pb n="II.47" facs="II.55.png"/>'and I'd
                  be glad of a retaliation that wouldn't recoil on myself; but treachery and
                  violence are spears pointed at both ends. They wound those who resort to them
                  worse than their enemies.' </p>
               <p>" 'Treachery and violence are a just return for treachery and violence!' cried
                  Hindley. 'Mrs. Heathcliff, I'll ask you to do nothing but sit still and be dumb.
                  Tell me now, can you? I'm sure you would have as much pleasure as I in witnessing
                  the conclusion of the fiend's existence. He'll be your death unless you overreach
                  him; and he'll be my ruin. Damn the hellish villain! He knocks at the door as if
                  he were master here already! Promise to hold your tongue, and before that clock
                  strikes -- it wants three minutes of one -- you're a free woman!' </p>
               <p>"He took the implements which I described to you in my letter from his breast, and
                  would have turned down the candle. I snatched it away, however, and seized his
                  arm. </p>
               <pb n="II.48" facs="II.56.png"/>
               <p>" 'I'll not hold my tongue,' I said; 'you mustn't touch him. Let the door remain
                  shut, and be quiet.' </p>
               <p>" 'No! I've formed my resolution, and by God I'll execute it!' cried the desperate
                  being. 'I'll do you a kindness in spite of yourself, and Hareton justice! And you
                  needn't trouble your head to screen me; Catherine is gone. Nobody alive would
                  regret me, or be ashamed, though I cut my throat this minute; and it's time to
                  make an end!' </p>
               <p>"I might as well have struggled with a bear or reasoned with a lunatic. The only
                  resource left me was to run to a lattice and warn his intended victim of the fate
                  which awaited him. </p>
               <p>" 'You'd better seek shelter somewhere else to-night,' I exclaimed, in rather a
                  triumphant tone. 'Mr. Earnshaw has a mind to shoot you, if you resist in
                  endeavouring to enter.' </p>
               <p>" 'You'd better open the door, you -- ,' be answered, addressing me by some
                  elegant term that I don't care to repeat. </p>
               <pb n="II.49" facs="II.57.png"/>
               <p>" 'I shall not meddle in the matter,' I retorted again. 'Come in and get shot, if
                  you please. I've done my duty.' </p>
               <p>"With that I shut the window and returned to my place by the fire, having too
                  small a stock of hypocrisy at my command to pretend any anxiety for the danger
                  that menaced him. Earnshaw swore passionately at me, affirming that I loved the
                  villain yet, and calling me all sorts of names for the base spirit I evinced. And
                  I, in my secret heart (and conscience never reproached me), thought what a
                  blessing it would be for him should Heathcliff put him out of misery; and what a
                  blessing for me should he send Heathcliff to his right abode! As I sat nursing
                  these reflections, the casement behind me was banged on to the floor by a blow
                  from the latter individual, and his black countenance looked blightingly through.
                  The stanchions stood too close to suffer his shoulders to follow, and I smiled,
                  exulting in my fancied security. His hair and <pb n="II.50" facs="II.58.png"
                  />clothes were whitened with snow, and his sharp cannibal teeth, revealed by cold
                  and wrath, gleamed through the dark. </p>
               <p>" 'Isabella, let me in, or I'll make you repent!' he 'girned,' as Joseph calls it. </p>
               <p>" 'I cannot commit murder,' I replied. 'Mr. Hindley stands sentinel with a knife
                  and loaded pistol.' </p>
               <p>" 'Let me in by the kitchen door,' he said. </p>
               <p>" 'Hindley will be there before me,' I answered; 'and that's a poor love of yours
                  that cannot bear a shower of snow! We were left at peace in our beds as long as
                  the summer moon shone, but the moment a blast of winter returns, you must run for
                  shelter! Heathcliff, if I were you, I'd go stretch myself over her grave and die
                  like a faithful dog. The world is surely not worth living in now, is it? You had
                  distinctly impressed on me the idea that Catherine was the whole joy of your life.
                  I can't imagine how you think of surviving her loss.' </p>
               <pb n="II.51" facs="II.59.png"/>
               <p>" 'He's there, is he?' exclaimed my companion, rushing to the gap. 'If I can get
                  my arm out I can hit him!' </p>
               <p>"I'm afraid, Ellen, you'll set me down as really wicked; but you don't know all,
                  so don't judge. I wouldn't have aided or abetted an attempt on even his life for
                  anything. Wish that he were dead, I must; and therefore I was fearfully
                  disappointed, and unnerved by terror for the consequences of my taunting speech,
                  when he flung himself on Earnshaw's weapon and wrenched it from his grasp. </p>
               <p>"The charge exploded, and the knife, in springing back, closed into its owner's
                  wrist. Heathcliff pulled it away by main force, slitting up the flesh as it passed
                  on, and thrust it dripping into his pocket. He then took a stone, struck down the
                  division between two windows, and sprang in. His adversary had fallen senseless
                  with excessive pain and the flow of blood that gushed from an artery or a large
                  vein. <pb n="II.52" facs="II.60.png"/>The ruffian kicked and trampled on him, and
                  dashed his head repeatedly against the flags, holding me with one hand meantime to
                  prevent me summoning Joseph. He exerted preter-human self-denial in abstaining
                  from finishing him completely; but getting out of breath he finally desisted, and
                  dragged the apparently inanimate body on to the settle. There he tore off the
                  sleeve of Earnshaw's coat, and bound up the wound with brutal roughness, spitting
                  and cursing during the operation as energetically as he had kicked before. Being
                  at liberty, I lost no time in seeking the old servant, who, having gathered by
                  degrees the purport of my hasty tale, hurried below, gasping as he descended the
                  steps two at once. </p>
               <p>" 'What is ther to do now -- what is ther to do now?' </p>
               <p>" 'There's this to do,' thundered Heathcliff, <pb n="II.53" facs="II.61.png"
                  />'that your master's mad; and should he last another month, I'll have him to an
                  asylum. And how the devil did you come to fasten me out, you toothless hound?
                  Don't stand muttering and mumbling there. Come, I'm not going to nurse him. Wash
                  that stuff away; and mind the sparks of your candle -- it is more than half
                  brandy.' </p>
               <p>" 'And so ye've been murthering on him!' exclaimed Joseph, lifting his hands and
                  eyes in horror. 'If iver I seed a seeght loike this! May the Lord -- ' </p>
               <p>"Heathcliff gave him a push on to his knees in the middle of the blood, and flung
                  a towel to him; but instead of proceeding to dry it up, he joined his hands and
                  began a prayer, which excited my laughter from its odd phraseology. I was in the
                  condition of mind to be shocked at nothing; in fact, I was as reckless as some
                  malefactors show themselves at the foot of the gallows. </p>
               <p>" 'Oh, I forgot you,' said the tyrant. 'You <pb n="II.54" facs="II.62.png"/>shall
                  do that. Down with you! And you conspire with him against me, do you, viper?
                  There, that is work fit for you!" </p>
               <p>"He shook me till my teeth rattled, and pitched me beside Joseph, who steadily
                  concluded his supplications, and then rose, vowing he would set off for the Grange
                  directly. Mr. Linton was a magistrate, and though he had fifty wives dead, he
                  should inquire into this. He was so obstinate in his resolution that Heathcliff
                  deemed it expedient to compel from my lips a recapitulation of what had taken
                  place, standing over me, heaving with malevolence, as I reluctantly delivered the
                  account in answer to his questions. It required a great deal of labour to satisfy
                  the old man that Heathcliff was not the aggressor, especially with my hardly-wrung
                  replies. However, Mr. Earnshaw soon convinced him that he was alive still. Joseph
                  hastened to administer a dose of spirits, and by their succour his <pb n="II.55"
                     facs="II.63.png"/>master presently regained motion and consciousness.
                  Heathcliff, aware that his opponent was ignorant of the treatment received while
                  insensible, called him deliriously intoxicated, and said he should not notice his
                  atrocious conduct further, but advised him to get to bed. To my joy, he left us,
                  after giving this judicious counsel, and Hindley stretched himself on the
                  hearth-stone. I departed to my own room, marvelling that I had escaped so easily. </p>
               <p>"This morning when I came down, about half an hour before noon, Mr. Earnshaw was
                  sitting by the fire deadly sick. His evil genius, almost as gaunt and ghastly,
                  leant against the chimney. Neither appeared inclined to dine; and, having waited
                  till all was cold on the table, I commenced alone. Nothing hindered me from eating
                  heartily, and I experienced a certain sense of satisfaction and superiority as, at
                  intervals, I cast a <pb n="II.56" facs="II.64.png"/>look towards my silent
                  companions, and felt the comfort of a quiet conscience within me. After I had
                  done, I ventured on the unusual liberty of drawing near the fire, going round
                  Earnshaw's seat, and kneeling in the corner beside him. </p>
               <p>"Heathcliff did not glance my way, and I gazed up, and contemplated his features
                  almost as confidently as if they had been turned to stone. His forehead, that I
                  once thought so manly, and that I now think so diabolical, was shaded with a heavy
                  cloud; his basilisk eyes were nearly quenched by sleeplessness, and weeping,
                  perhaps, for the lashes were wet then; his lips devoid of their ferocious sneer,
                  and sealed in an expression of unspeakable sadness. Had it been another, I would
                  have covered my face in the presence of such grief. In his case, I was gratified;
                  and, ignoble as it seems to insult a fallen enemy, I couldn't miss this chance of
                  sticking in a dart. His weakness <pb n="II.57" facs="II.65.png"/>was the only time
                  when I could taste the delight of paying wrong for wrong." </p>
               <p>"Fie, fie, miss!" I interrupted. "One might suppose you had never opened a Bible
                  in your life. If God afflict your enemies, surely that ought to suffice you. It is
                  both mean and presumptuous to add your torture to His." </p>
               <p>"In general I'll allow that it would be, Ellen," she continued; "but what misery
                  laid on Heathcliff could content me, unless I have a hand in it? I'd rather he
                  suffered less, if I might cause his sufferings, and he might know that I was the
                  cause. Oh, I owe him so much! On only one condition can I hope to forgive him. It
                  is, if I may take an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, for every wrench of
                  agony return a wrench, reduce him to my level; as he was the first to injure, make
                  him the first to implore pardon; and then -- why, then, Ellen, I might show you
                  some generosity. But it is utterly impossible I can <pb n="II.58" facs="II.66.png"
                  />ever be revenged, and therefore I cannot forgive him. Hindley wanted some water,
                  and I handed him a glass, and asked him how he was. </p>
               <p>" 'Not as ill as I wish,' he replied. 'But leaving out my arm, every inch of me is
                  as sore as if I had been fighting with a legion of imps.' </p>
               <p>" 'Yes, no wonder,' was my next remark. 'Catherine used to boast that she stood
                  between you and bodily harm. She meant that certain persons would not hurt you for
                  fear of offending her. It's well people don't really rise from their grave, or
                  last night she might have witnessed a repulsive scene! Are not you bruised and cut
                  over your chest and shoulders?' </p>

               <p>" 'I can't say,' he answered; 'but what do you mean? Did he dare to strike me when
                  I was down?' </p>
               <p>" 'He trampled on and kicked you, and dashed you on the ground,' I whispered. 'And
                  his mouth watered to tear you with his <pb n="II.59" facs="II.67.png"/>teeth,
                  because he's only half man -- not so much -- and the rest fiend.' </p>
               <p>"Mr. Earnshaw looked up, like me, to the countenance of our mutual foe, who,
                  absorbed in his anguish, seemed insensible to anything around him. The longer he
                  stood, the plainer his reflections revealed their blackness through his features. </p>
               <p>" 'Oh, if God would but give me strength to strangle him in my last agony, I'd go
                  to hell with joy,' groaned the impatient man, writhing to rise, and sinking back
                  in despair, convinced of his inadequacy for the struggle. </p>
               <p>" 'Nay, it's enough that he has murdered one of you,' I observed aloud. 'At the
                  Grange, every one knows your sister would have been living now had it not been for
                  Mr. Heathcliff. After all, it is preferable to be hated than loved by him. When I
                  recollect how happy we were, how happy Catherine was before he came, I'm fit to
                  curse the day.' </p>
               <p>"Most likely Heathcliff noticed more the <pb n="II.60" facs="II.68.png"/>truth of
                  what was said than the spirit of the person who said it. His attention was roused,
                  I saw, for his eyes rained down tears among the ashes, and he drew his breath in
                  suffocating sighs. I stared full at him, and laughed scornfully. The clouded
                  windows of hell flashed a moment towards me; the fiend which usually looked out,
                  however, was so dimmed and drowned that I did not fear to hazard another sound of
                  derision. </p>
               <pb n="II.61" facs="II.69.png"/>
               <p>" 'Get up, and begone out of my sight,' said the mourner. </p>
               <p>"I guessed he uttered those words, at least, though his voice was hardly
                  intelligible. </p>
               <p>" 'I beg your pardon,' I replied. 'But I loved Catherine too; and her brother
                  requires attendance, which, for her sake, I shall supply. Now that she's dead, I
                  see her in Hindley. Hindley has exactly her eyes, if you had not tried to gouge
                  them out, and made them black and red; and her -- ' </p>
               <p>" 'Get up, wretched idiot, before I stamp you to death!' he cried, making a
                  movement that caused me to make one also. </p>
               <p>" 'But, then,' I continued, holding myself ready to flee, 'if poor Catherine had
                  trusted you, and assumed the ridiculous, contemptible, degrading title of Mrs.
                  Heathcliff, she would soon have presented a similar picture. She wouldn't have
                  borne your abominable behaviour quietly. Her detestation and disgust must have
                  found voice.' </p>
               <p>"The back of the settle and Earnshaw's person interposed between me and him; so
                  instead of endeavouring to reach me, he snatched a dinner knife from the table and
                  flung it at my head. It struck beneath my ear, and stopped the sentence I was
                  uttering; but, pulling it out, I sprang to the door and delivered another, which I
                  hope went a little deeper than his missile. The last glimpse I caught of him was a
                  furious rush on his part, checked by the embrace <pb n="II.62" facs="II.70.png"
                  />of his host; and both fell locked together on the hearth. In my flight through
                  the kitchen I bade Joseph speed to his master. I knocked over Hareton, who was
                  hanging a litter of puppies from a chair-back in the doorway; and, blest as a soul
                  escaped from purgatory, I bounded, leaped, and flew down the steep road; then,
                  quitting its windings, shot direct across the moor, rolling over banks, and wading
                  through marshes, precipitating myself, in fact, towards the beacon light of the
                  Grange. And far rather would I be condemned to a perpetual dwelling in the
                  infernal regions than, even for one night, abide beneath the roof of Wuthering
                  Heights again." </p>
               <p>Isabella ceased speaking, and took a drink of tea; then she rose, and bidding me
                  put on her bonnet and a great shawl I had brought, and turning a deaf ear to my
                  entreaties for her to remain another hour, she stepped on to a chair, kissed
                  Edgar's and Catherine's por<pb n="II.63" facs="II.71.png"/>traits, bestowed a
                  similar salute on me, and descended to the carriage, accompanied by Fanny, who
                  yelped wild with joy at recovering her mistress. She was driven away, never to
                  revisit this neighbourhood; but a regular correspondence was established between
                  her and my master when things were more settled. I believe her new abode was in
                  the south, near London; there she had a son born, a few months subsequent to her
                  escape. He was christened Linton, and, from the first, she reported him to be an
                  ailing, peevish creature. </p>
               <p>Mr. Heathcliff, meeting me one day in the village, inquired where she lived. I
                  refused to tell. He remarked that it was not of any moment, only she must beware
                  of coming to her brother. She should not be with him, if he had to keep her
                  himself. Though I would give no information, he discovered, through some of the
                  other servants, both her place of residence and the existence of the child. Still
                  he didn't molest her, for <pb n="II.64" facs="II.72.png"/>which forbearance she
                  might thank his aversion, I suppose. He often asked about the infant, when he saw
                  me; and on hearing its name, smiled grimly, and observed -- </p>
               <p>"They wish me to hate it too, do they?" </p>
               <p>"I don't think they wish you to know anything about it," I answered. </p>
               <p>"But I'll have it," he said, "when I want it. They may reckon on that." </p>
               <p>Fortunately its mother died before the time arrived, some thirteen years after the
                  decease of Catherine, when Linton was twelve or a little more. </p>
               <p>On the day succeeding Isabella's unexpected visit, I had no opportunity of
                  speaking to my master. He shunned conversation, and was fit for discussing
                  nothing. When I could get him to listen, I saw it pleased him that his sister had
                  left her husband, whom he abhorred with an intensity which the mildness of his
                  nature would scarcely seem to allow. So deep and <pb n="II.65" facs="II.73.png"
                  />sensitive was his aversion that he refrained from going anywhere where he was
                  likely to see or hear of Heathcliff. Grief and that together transformed him into
                  a complete hermit. He threw up his office of magistrate, ceased even to attend
                  church, avoided the village on all occasions, and spent a life of entire seclusion
                  within the limits of his park and grounds, only varied by solitary rambles on the
                  moors and visits to the grave of his wife, mostly at evening, or early morning
                  before other wanderers were abroad. But he was too good to be thoroughly unhappy
                  long. He didn't pray for Catherine's soul to haunt him. Time brought resignation
                  and a melancholy sweeter than common joy. He recalled her memory with ardent,
                  tender love, and hopeful aspiring to the better world, where he doubted not she
                  was gone. </p>
               <p>And he had earthly consolation and affections also. For a few days, I said, he
                  seemed <pb n="II.66" facs="II.74.png"/>regardless of the puny successor to the
                  departed; that coldness melted as fast as snow in April, and ere the tiny thing
                  could stammer a word or totter a step, it wielded a despot's sceptre in his heart.
                  It was named Catherine; but he never called it the name in full, as he had never
                  called the first Catherine short, probably because Heathcliff had a habit of doing
                  so. The little one was always Cathy; it formed to him a distinction from the
                  mother, and yet a connection with her; and his attachment sprang from its relation
                  to her far more than from its being his own. </p>
               <p>I used to draw a comparison between him and Hindley Earnshaw, and perplex myself
                  to explain satisfactorily why their conduct was so opposite in similar
                  circumstances. They had both been fond husbands, and were both attached to their
                  children; and I could not see how they shouldn't both have taken the same road,
                  for good or evil. But, I thought in my <pb n="II.67" facs="II.75.png"/>mind,
                  Hindley, with apparently the stronger head, has shown himself sadly the worse and
                  the weaker man. When his ship struck, the captain abandoned his post; and the
                  crew, instead of trying to save her, rushed into riot and confusion, leaving no
                  hope for their luckless vessel. Linton, on the contrary, displayed the true
                  courage of a loyal and faithful soul. He trusted God, and God comforted him. One
                  hoped, and the other despaired. They chose their own lots, and were righteously
                  doomed to endure them. But you'll not want to hear my moralizing, Mr. Lockwood;
                  you'll judge as well as I can all these things. At least, you'll think you will,
                  and that's the same. The end of Earnshaw was what might have been expected; it
                  followed fast on his sister's; there were scarcely six months between them. We at
                  the Grange never got a very succinct account of his state preceding it; all that I
                  did learn was on occasion of going to aid in <pb n="II.68" facs="II.76.png"/>the
                  preparations for the funeral. Mr. Kenneth came to announce the event to my master. </p>
               <p>"Well, Nelly," said he, riding into the yard one morning, too early not to alarm
                  me with an instant presentiment of bad news, "it's yours and my turn to go into
                  mourning at present. Who's given us the slip now, do you think?" </p>
               <p>"Who?" I asked in a flurry. </p>
               <p>"Why, guess," he returned, dismounting, and slinging his bridle on a hook by the
                  door. "And nip up the corner of your apron. I'm certain you'll need it."</p>
               <p>"Not Mr. Heathcliff, surely?" I exclaimed. </p>
               <p>"What! would you have tears for him?" said the doctor. "No, Heathcliff's a tough
                  young fellow; he looks blooming to-day. I've just seen him. He's rapidly regaining
                  flesh since he lost his better half." </p>
               <p>"Who is it, then, Mr. Kenneth?" I repeated impatiently. </p>
               <p>"Hindley Earnshaw -- your old friend Hind<pb n="II.69" facs="II.77.png"/>ley," he
                  replied, "and my wicked gossip, though he's been too wild for me this long while.
                  There! I said we should draw water. But cheer up. He died true to his character --
                  drunk as a lord. Poor lad! I'm sorry, too. One can't help missing an old
                  companion, though he had the worst tricks with him that ever man imagined, and has
                  done me many a rascally turn. He's barely twenty-seven, it seems; that's your own
                  age. Who would have thought you were born in one year?" </p>
               <p>I confess this blow was greater to me than the shock of Mrs. Linton's death.
                  Ancient associations lingered round my heart. I sat down in the porch and wept as
                  for a blood relation, desiring Mr. Kenneth to get another servant to introduce him
                  to the master. I could not hinder myself from pondering on the question, "Had he
                  had fair play?" Whatever I did, that idea would bother me. It was so tiresomely
                  pertinacious that I resolved on requesting leave to go to Wuthering Heights <pb
                     n="II.70" facs="II.78.png"/>and assist in the last duties to the dead. Mr.
                  Linton was extremely reluctant to consent, but I pleaded eloquently for the
                  friendless condition in which he lay, and I said my old master and foster-brother
                  had a claim on my services as strong as his own. Besides, I reminded him that the
                  child Hareton was his wife's nephew, and, in the absence of nearer kin, he ought
                  to act as its guardian; and he ought to and must inquire how the property was
                  left, and look over the concerns of his brother-in-law. He was unfit for attending
                  to such matters then, but he bade me speak to his lawyer, and at length permitted
                  me to go. His lawyer had been Earnshaw's also. I called at the village, and asked
                  him to accompany me. He shook his head, and advised that Heathcliff should be let
                  alone, affirming, if the truth were known, Hareton would be found little else than
                  a beggar. </p>
               <p>"His father died in debt," he said; "the <pb n="II.71" facs="II.79.png"/>whole
                  property is mortgaged, and the sole chance for the natural heir is to allow him an
                  opportunity of creating some interest in the creditor's heart, that he may be
                  inclined to deal leniently towards him." </p>
               <p>When I reached the Heights, I explained that I had come to see everything carried
                  on decently; and Joseph, who appeared in sufficient distress, expressed
                  satisfaction at my presence. Mr. Heathcliff said he did not perceive that I was
                  wanted; but I might stay and order the arrangements for the funeral, if I chose. </p>
               <p>"Correctly," he remarked, "that fool's body should be buried at the cross-roads,
                  without ceremony of any kind. I happened to leave him ten minutes yesterday
                  afternoon, and in that interval he fastened the two doors of the house against me,
                  and he has spent the night in drinking himself to death deliberately! We broke in
                  this morning, for we heard him snorting like a horse; and there he was, laid over
                  the settle; flaying and scalping would not <pb n="II.72" facs="II.80.png"/>have
                  wakened him. I sent for Kenneth, and he came, but not till the beast had changed
                  into carrion. He was both dead and cold and stark; and so you'll allow it was
                  useless making more stir about him." </p>
               <p>The old servant confirmed this statement, but muttered, -- </p>
               <p>"I'd rayther he'd goan hisseln for t' doctor! I sud ha' taentent o' t' maister
                  better nor him; and he warn't deead when I left, naught o' t' soart!" </p>
               <p>I insisted on the funeral being respectable. Mr. Heathcliff said I might have my
                  own way there too; only, he desired me to remember that the money for the whole
                  affair came out of his pocket. He maintained a hard, careless deportment,
                  indicative of neither joy nor sorrow; if anything, it expressed a flinty
                  gratification at a piece of difficult work successfully executed. I observed once,
                  indeed, something like exultation in his aspect; it was just when the <pb
                     n="II.73" facs="II.81.png"/>people were bearing the coffin from the house. He
                  had the hypocrisy to represent a mourner; and previous to following with Hareton,
                  he lifted the unfortunate child on to the table, and muttered, with peculiar
                  gusto, "Now, my bonny lad, you are mine! And we'll see if one tree won't grow as
                  crooked as another, with the same wind to twist it!" The unsuspecting thing was
                  pleased at this speech. He played with Heathcliff's whiskers, and stroked his
                  cheek; but I divined its meaning, and observed tartly, "That boy must go back with
                  me to Thrushcross Grange, sir. There is nothing in the world less yours than he
                  is." </p>
               <p>"Does Linton say so?" he demanded. </p>
               <p>"Of course; he has ordered me to take him," I replied. </p>
               <p>"Well," said the scoundrel, "we'll not argue the subject now; but I have a fancy
                  to try my hand at rearing a young one, so inti<pb n="II.74" facs="II.82.png"/>mate
                  to your master that I must supply the place of this with my own, if he attempt to
                  remove it. I don't engage to let Hareton go undisputed, but I'll be pretty sure to
                  make the other come! Remember to tell him." </p>
               <p>This hint was enough to bind our hands. I repeated its substance on my return; and
                  Edgar Linton, little interested at the commencement, spoke no more of interfering.
                  I'm not aware that he could have done it to any purpose, had he been ever so
                  willing. </p>
               <p>The guest was now the master of Wuthering Heights. He held firm possession, and
                  proved to the attorney -- who, in his turn, proved it to Mr. Linton -- that
                  Earnshaw had mortgaged every yard of land he owned for cash to supply his mania
                  for gaming; and he, Heathcliff, was the mortgagee. In that manner Hareton, who
                  should now be the first gentleman in the neighbourhood, was reduced to a state of
                  complete dependence <pb n="II.75" facs="II.83.png"/>on his father's inveterate
                  enemy, and lives in his own house as a servant, deprived of the advantage of
                  wages, quite unable to right himself, because of his friendlessness and his
                  ignorance that he has been wronged. </p>

               <p>The twelve years, continued Mrs. Dean, following that dismal period, were the
                  happiest of my life: my greatest troubles, in their passage, rose from our little
                  lady's trifling illnesses, which she had to experience in common with all
                  children, rich and poor. </p>
               <p>For the rest, after the first six months, she grew like a larch; and could walk
                  and talk too, in her own way, before the heath blossomed a second time over Mrs.
                  Linton's dust. </p>
               <p>She was the most winning thing that ever <pb n="II.77" facs="II.85.png"/>brought
                  sunshine into a desolate house -- a real beauty in face -- with the Earnshaws'
                  handsome dark eyes, but the Lintons' fair skin, and small features, and yellow
                  curling hair. Her spirit was high, though not rough, and qualified by a heart
                  sensitive and lively to excess in its affections. That capacity for intense
                  attachments reminded me of her mother; still she did not resemble her; for she
                  could be soft and mild as a dove, and she had a gentle voice, and pensive
                  expression: her anger was never furious; her love never fierce; it was deep and
                  tender. </p>
               <p>However, it must be acknowledged, she had faults to foil her gifts. A propensity
                  to be saucy was one; and a perverse will that indulged children invariably
                  acquire, whether they be good tempered or cross. If a servant chanced to vex her,
                  it was always: "I shall tell papa!" And if he reproved her, even by a look, you
                  would have thought it a heart-<pb n="II.78" facs="II.86.png"/>breaking business: I
                  don't believe he ever did speak a harsh word to her. </p>
               <p>He took her education entirely on himself, and made it an amusement: fortunately,
                  curiosity and a quick intellect urged her into an apt scholar; she learnt rapidly
                  and eagerly, and did honour to his teaching. </p>
               <p>Till she reached the age of thirteen, she had not once been beyond the range of
                  the park by herself. Mr. Linton would take her with him a mile or so outside, on
                  rare occasions; but he trusted her to no one else. Gimmerton was an unsubstantial
                  name in her ears; the chapel the only building she had approached or entered,
                  except her own home. Wuthering Heights and Mr. Heathcliff did not exist for her.
                  She was a perfect recluse, and, apparently, perfectly contented. Sometimes,
                  indeed, while surveying the country from her nursery window, she would observe, -- </p>
               <p>"Ellen, how long will it be before I can <pb n="II.79" facs="II.87.png"/>walk to
                  the top of those hills? I wonder what lies on the other side. Is it the sea?" </p>
               <p>"No, Miss Cathy," I would answer; "it is hills again, just like these." </p>
               <p>"And what are those golden rocks like when you stand under them?" she once
                  asked.</p>
               <p>The abrupt descent of Peniston Crags particularly attracted her notice, especially
                  when the setting sun shone on it and the topmost heights, and the whole extent of
                  landscape besides lay in shadow. I explained that they were bare masses of stone,
                  with hardly enough earth in their clefts to nourish a stunted tree. </p>
               <p>"And why are they bright so long after it is evening here?" she pursued. </p>
               <p>"Because they are a great deal higher up than we are," replied I; "you could not
                  climb them -- they are too high and steep. In winter the frost is always there
                  before it comes to us; and deep into summer I have found snow under that black
                  hollow on the north-east side." </p>
               <pb n="II.80" facs="II.88.png"/>
               <p>"Oh, you have been on them!" she cried gleefully. "Then I can go, too, when I am a
                  woman. Has papa been, Ellen?" </p>
               <p>"Papa would tell you, miss," I answered hastily, "that they are not worth the
                  trouble of visiting. The moors, where you ramble with him, are much nicer; and
                  Thrushcross Park is the finest place in the world." </p>
               <p>"But I know the park, and I don't know those," she murmured to herself. "And I
                  should delight to look round me from the brow of that tallest point. My little
                  pony Minny shall take me some time." </p>
               <p>One of the maids mentioning the Fairy Cave quite turned her head with a desire to
                  fulfil this project. She teased Mr. Linton about it, and he promised she should
                  have the journey when she got older. But Miss Catherine measured her age by
                  months, and, "Now, am I old enough to go to Peniston Crags?" was the constant
                  question in her mouth. <pb n="II.81" facs="II.89.png"/>The road thither wound
                  close by Wuthering Heights. Edgar had not the heart to pass it, so she received as
                  constantly the answer, "Not yet, love; not yet." </p>
               <p>I said Mrs. Heathcliff lived above a dozen years after quitting her husband. Her
                  family were of a delicate constitution. She and Edgar both lacked the ruddy health
                  that you will generally meet in these parts. What her last illness was I am not
                  certain. I conjecture they died of the same thing -- a kind of fever, slow at its
                  commencement, but incurable, and rapidly consuming life towards the close. She
                  wrote to inform her brother of the probable conclusion of a four months'
                  indisposition under which she had suffered, and entreated him to come to her, if
                  possible, for she had much to settle, and she wished to bid him adieu, and deliver
                  Linton safely into his hands. Her hope was, that Linton might be left with him, as
                  he had been with her. His father, she would fain convince herself, had no desire
                  to <pb n="II.82" facs="II.90.png"/>assume the burden of his maintenance or
                  education. My master hesitated not a moment in complying with her request.
                  Reluctant as he was to leave home at ordinary calls, he flew to answer this,
                  commending Catherine to my peculiar vigilance, in his absence, with reiterated
                  orders that she must not wander out of the park, even under my escort. He did not
                  calculate on her going unaccompanied. </p>
               <p>He was away three weeks. The first day or two my charge sat in a corner of the
                  library, too sad for either reading or playing. In that quiet state she caused me
                  little trouble; but it was succeeded by an interval of impatient fretful
                  weariness; and being too busy and too old then to run up and down amusing her, I
                  hit on a method by which she might entertain herself. I used to send her on her
                  travels round the grounds, now onfoot and now on a pony, indulging her with a
                  patient audience of all <pb n="II.83" facs="II.91.png"/>her real and imaginary
                  adventures, when she returned. </p>
               <p>The summer shone in full prime, and she took such a taste for this solitary
                  rambling that she often contrived to remain out from breakfast till tea; and then
                  the evenings were spent in recounting her fanciful tales. I did not fear her
                  breaking bounds, because the gates were generally locked, and I thought she would
                  scarcely venture forth alone, if they had stood wide open. Unluckily, my
                  confidence proved misplaced. Catherine came to me one morning at eight o'clock,
                  and said she was that day an Arabian merchant, going to cross the desert with his
                  caravan, and I must give her plenty of provision for herself and beasts -- a horse
                  and three camels, personated by a large hound and a couple of pointers. I got
                  together good store of dainties, and slung them in a basket on one side of the
                  saddle; and she sprang up as gay as a fairy, shel<pb n="II.84" facs="II.92.png"
                  />tered by her wide-brimmed hat and gauze veil from the July sun, and trotted off
                  with a merry laugh, mocking my cautious counsel to avoid galloping and come back
                  early. The naughty thing never made her appearance at tea. One traveller, the
                  hound, being an old dog and fond of its ease, returned; but neither Cathy, nor the
                  pony, nor the two pointers were visible in any direction. I dispatched emissaries
                  down this path and that path, and at last went wandering in search of her myself.
                  There was a labourer working at a fence round a plantation, on the borders of the
                  grounds. I inquired of him if he had seen our young lady. </p>
               <p>"I saw her at morn," he replied. "She would have me to cut her a hazel switch, and
                  then she leapt her Galloway over the hedge yonder, where it is lowest, and
                  galloped out of sight." </p>
               <p>You may guess how I felt at hearing this <pb n="II.85" facs="II.93.png"/>news. It
                  struck me directly she must have started for Peniston Crags. "What will become of
                  her?" I ejaculated, pushing through a gap which the man was repairing, and making
                  straight to the highroad. I walked as if for a wager, mile after mile, till a turn
                  brought >me in view of the Heights; but no Catherine could I detect far or near.
                  The Crags lie about a mile and a half beyond Mr. Heathcliff's place, and that is
                  four from the Grange, so I began to fear night would fall ere I could reach them.
                  "And what if she should have slipped in clambering among them," I reflected, "and
                  been killed or broken some of her bones?" My suspense was truly painful; and at
                  first it gave me delightful relief to observe, in hurrying by the farmhouse,
                  Charlie, the fiercest of the pointers, lying under a window, with swelled head and
                  bleeding ear. I opened the wicket and ran to the door, knocking vehemently for
                  admittance. A <pb n="II.86" facs="II.94.png"/>woman whom I knew, and who formerly
                  lived at Gimmerton, answered. She had been servant there since the death of Mr.
                  Earnshaw. </p>
               <p>"Ah," said she, "you are come a-seeking your little mistress! Don't be frightened.
                  She's here safe; but I'm glad it isn't the master." </p>
               <p>"He is not at home, then, is he?" I panted, quite breathless with quick walking
                  and alarm. </p>
               <p>"No, no," she replied; "both he and Joseph are off, and I think they won't return
                  this hour or more. Step in and rest you a bit." </p>
               <p>I entered, and beheld my stray lamb seated on the hearth, rocking herself in a
                  little chair that had been her mother's when a child. Her hat was hung against the
                  wall, and she seemed perfectly at home, laughing and chattering, in the best
                  spirits imaginable, to Hareton -- now a great, strong lad of eighteen -- who
                  stared at her with considerable curiosity and astonishment, comprehending precious
                  little of the fluent succession of remarks and questions which her tongue never
                  ceased pouring forth. </p>
               <pb n="II.87" facs="II.95.png"/>
               <p>"Very well, miss!" I exclaimed, concealing my joy under an angry countenance.
                  "This is your last ride till papa comes back. I'll not trust you over the
                  threshold again, you naughty, naughty girl!" </p>
               <p>"Aha, Ellen!" she cried gaily, jumping up and running to my <pb n="193"/>side. "I
                  shall have a pretty story to tell tonight. And so you've found me out. Have you
                  ever been here in your life before?" </p>
               <p>"Put that hat on, and home at once," said I. "I'm dreadfully grieved at you, Miss
                  Cathy; you've done extremely wrong. It's no use pouting and crying; that won't
                  repay the trouble I've had, scouring the country after you. To think how Mr.
                  Linton charged me to keep you in; and you stealing off so! It shows you are a
                  cunning little fox, and nobody will put faith in you any more." </p>
               <p>"What have I done?" sobbed she, instantly checked. "Papa charged me nothing. He'll
                     <pb n="II.88" facs="II.96.png"/>not scold me, Ellen; he's never cross like
                  you." </p>
               <p>"Come, come!" I repeated. "I'll tie the ribbon. Now, let us have no petulance. Oh,
                  for shame! You thirteen years old, and such a baby!" </p>
               <p>This exclamation was caused by her pushing the hat from her head, and retreating
                  to the chimney out of my reach. </p>
               <p>"Nay," said the servant; "don't be hard on the bonny lass, Mrs. Dean. We made her
                  stop. She'd fain have ridden forwards, afeard you should be uneasy. Hareton
                  offered to go with her, and I thought he should. It's a wild road over the hills." </p>
               <p>Hareton, during the discussion, stood with his hands in his pockets, too awkward
                  to speak, though he looked as if he did not relish my intrusion. </p>
               <p>"How long am I to wait?" I continued, disregarding the woman's interference. "It
                     <pb n="II.89" facs="II.97.png"/>will be dark in ten minutes. -- Where is the
                  pony, Miss Cathy? And where is Phoenix? I shall leave you, unless you be quick; so
                  please yourself." </p>
               <p>"The pony is in the yard," she replied, "and Phoenix is shut in there. He's
                  bitten, and so is Charlie. I was going to tell you all about it; but you are in a
                  bad temper, and don't deserve to hear." </p>
               <p>I picked up her hat, and approached to reinstate it; but perceiving that the
                  people of the house took her part, she commenced capering round the room; and on
                  my giving chase, ran like a mouse over and under and behind the furniture,
                  rendering it ridiculous for me to pursue. <pb n="194"/>Hareton and the woman
                  laughed, and she joined them, and waxed more impertinent still, till I cried, in
                  great irritation, -- </p>
               <p>"Well, Miss Cathy, if you were aware whose house this is, you'd be glad enough to
                  get out." </p>
               <pb n="II.90" facs="II.98.png"/>
               <p>"It's your father's, isn't it?" said she, turning to Hareton. </p>
               <p>"Nay," he replied, looking down, and blushing bashfully. </p>
               <p>He could not stand a steady gaze from her eyes, though they were just his own. </p>
               <p>"Whose, then -- your master's?" she asked. </p>
               <p>He coloured deeper, with a different feeling, muttered an oath, and turned away. </p>
               <p>"Who is his master?" continued the tiresome girl, appealing to me. "He talked
                  about 'our house,' and 'our folk.' I thought he had been the owner's son. And he
                  never said miss. He should have done, shouldn't he, if he's a servant?"</p>
               <p>Hareton grew black as a thunder-cloud at this childish speech. I silently shook my
                  questioner, and at last succeeded in equipping her for departure. </p>
               <p>"Now, get my horse," she said, addressing her unknown kinsman as she would one of
                  the stable-boys at the Grange. "And you may <pb n="II.91" facs="II.99.png"/>come
                  with me. I want to see where the goblin-hunter rises in the marsh, and to hear
                  about the fairishes, as you call them. But make haste! What's the matter? Get my
                  horse, I say." </p>
               <p>"I'll see thee damned before I be thy servant!" growled the lad. </p>
               <p>"You'll see me what?" asked Catherine in surprise. </p>
               <p>"Damned, thou saucy witch!" he replied. </p>
               <p>"There, Miss Cathy, you see you have got into pretty company," I interposed. "Nice
                  words to be used to a young lady! Pray don't begin to dispute with him. Come, let
                  us seek for Minny ourselves, and begone." </p>
               <p>"But, Ellen," cried she, staring, fixed in astonishment, "how dare he speak so to
                  me? Mustn't he be made to do as I ask him? -- You wicked creature, I shall tell
                  papa what you said. Now, then!" </p>
               <p>Hareton did not appear to feel this threat, so the tears sprang into her eyes with
                     indig<pb n="II.92" facs="II.100.png"/>nation. "You bring the pony," she
                  exclaimed, turning to the woman, "and let my dog free this moment!" </p>

               <p>"Softly, miss," answered she addressed; "you'll lose nothing by being civil.
                  Though Mr. Hareton there be not the master's son, he's your cousin; and I was
                  never hired to serve you." </p>
               <p>"He my cousin!" cried Cathy, with a scornful laugh. </p>
               <p>"Yes, indeed," responded her reprover. </p>
               <p>"O Ellen! don't let them say such things," she pursued, in great trouble. "Papa is
                  gone to fetch my cousin from London. My cousin is a gentleman's son. That my -- "
                  She stopped, and wept outright, upset at the bare notion of relationship with such
                  a clown. </p>
               <p>"Hush, hush!" I whispered; "people can have many cousins, and of all sorts, Miss
                  Cathy, without being any the worse for it; only they needn't keep their company,
                  if they be disagreeable and bad." </p>
               <pb n="II.93" facs="II.101.png"/>
               <p>"He's not -- he's not my cousin, Ellen!" she went on, gathering fresh grief from
                  reflection, and flinging herself into my arms for refuge from the idea. </p>
               <p>I was much vexed at her and the servant for their mutual revelations, having no
                  doubt of Linton's approaching arrival, communicated by the former, being reported
                  to Mr. Heathcliff, and feeling as confident that Catherine's first thought on her
                  father's return would be to seek an explanation of the latter's assertion
                  concerning her rude-bred kindred. Hareton, recovering from his disgust at being
                  taken for a servant, seemed moved by her distress; and having fetched the pony
                  round to the door, he took, to propitiate her, a fine crooked-legged terrier-whelp
                  from the kennel, and putting it into her hand bade her whist, for he meant nought.
                  Pausing in her lamentations, she surveyed him a glance of awe and horror, then
                  burst forth anew. </p>
               <pb n="II.94" facs="II.102.png"/>
               <p>I could scarcely refrain from smiling at this antipathy to the poor fellow, who
                  was a well-made, athletic youth, good-looking in features, and stout and healthy,
                  but attired in garments befitting his daily occupations of working on the farm and
                  lounging among the moors after rabbits and game. Still, I thought I could detect
                  in his physiognomy a mind owning better qualities than his father ever possessed
                  -- good things lost amid a wilderness of weeds, to be sure, whose rankness far
                  over-topped their neglected growth; yet, notwithstanding, evidence of a wealthy
                  soil, that might yield luxuriant crops under other and favourable circumstances.
                  Mr. Heathcliff, I believe, had not treated him physically ill -- thanks to his
                  fearless nature, which offered no temptation to that course of oppression. He had
                  none of the timid susceptibility that would have given zest to ill-treatment, in
                  Heathcliff's judgment. He appeared to have bent his malevolence on making him a
                  brute. He was never taught to <pb n="II.95" facs="II.103.png"/>read or write,
                  never rebuked for any bad habit which did not annoy his keeper, never led a single
                  step towards virtue or guarded by a single precept against vice. And from what I
                  heard, Joseph contributed much to his deterioration by a narrow-minded partiality
                  which prompted him to flatter and pet him, as a boy, because he was the head of
                  the old family. And as he had been in the habit of accusing Catherine Earnshaw and
                  Heathcliff, when children, of putting the master past his patience, and compelling
                  him to seek solace in drink by what he termed their "offalld ways," so at present
                  he laid the whole burden of Hareton's faults on the shoulders of the usurper of
                  his property. If the lad swore, he wouldn't correct him, nor however culpably he
                  behaved. It gave Joseph satisfaction, apparently, to watch him go the worst
                  lengths. He allowed that the lad was ruined, that his soul was abandoned to
                     perdi<pb n="II.96" facs="II.104.png"/>tion; but then he reflected that
                  Heathcliff must answer for it. Hareton's blood would be required at his hands; and
                  there lay immense consolation in that thought. Joseph had instilled into him a
                  pride of name and of his lineage. He would, had he dared, have fostered hate
                  between him and the present owner of the Heights; but his dread of that owner
                  amounted to superstition, and he confined his feelings regarding him to muttered
                  innuendoes and private comminations. I don't pretend to be intimately acquainted
                  with the mode of living customary in those days at Wuthering Heights. I only speak
                  from hearsay, for I saw little. The villagers affirmed Mr. Heathcliff was near,
                  and a cruel hard landlord to his tenants; but the house inside had regained its
                  ancient aspect of comfort under female management, and the scenes of riot common
                  in Hindley's time were not <pb n="II.97" facs="II.105.png"/>now enacted within its
                  walls. The master was too gloomy to seek companionship with any people, good or
                  bad; and he is yet. </p>
               <p>This, however, is not making progress with my story. Miss Cathy rejected the
                  peace-offering of the terrier, and demanded her own dogs, Charlie and Phoenix.
                  They came limping, and hanging their heads; and we set out for home, sadly out of
                  sorts, every one of us. I could not wring from my little lady how she had spent
                  the day, except that, as I supposed, the goal of her pilgrimage was Peniston
                  Crags; and she arrived without adventure to the gate of the farmhouse, when
                  Hareton happened to issue forth, attended by some canine followers, who attacked
                  her train. They had a smart battle before their owners could separate them; that
                  formed an introduction. Catherine told Hareton who she was, and where she was
                  going, and asked him to show her the way, finally beguiling him to accompany her.
                     <pb n="II.98" facs="II.106.png"/>He opened the mysteries of the Fairy Cave and
                  twenty other queer places. But, being in disgrace, I was not favoured with a
                  description of the interesting objects she saw. I could gather, however, that her
                  guide had been a favourite till she hurt his feelings by addressing him as a
                  servant, and Heathcliff's housekeeper hurt hers by calling him her cousin. Then
                  the language he had held to her rankled in her heart; she who was always "love,"
                  and "darling," and "queen," and "angel," with everybody at the Grange, to be
                  insulted so shockingly by a stranger! She did not comprehend it; and hard work I
                  had to obtain a promise that she would not lay the grievance before her father. I
                  explained how he objected to the whole household at the Heights, and how sorry he
                  would be to find she had been there; but I insisted most on the fact that if she
                  revealed my negligence of his orders, he would per<pb n="II.99" facs="II.107.png"
                  />haps be so angry that I should have to leave; and Cathy couldn't bear that
                  prospect. She pledged her word, and kept it, for my sake. After all, she was a
                  sweet little girl. </p>

               <p>A letter, edged with black, announced the day of my master's return. Isabella was
                  dead; and he wrote to bid me get mourning for his daughter, and arrange a room,
                  and other accommodations, for his youthful nephew. </p>
               <p>Catherine ran wild with joy at the idea of welcoming her father back: and indulged
                  most sanguine anticipations of the innumerable excellencies of her "real" cousin. </p>
               <p>The evening of their expected arrival came. Since early morning, she had been
                  busy, or<pb n="II.101" facs="II.109.png"/>dering her own small affairs; and now,
                  attired in her new black frock -- poor thing! her aunt's death impressed her with
                  no definite sorrow -- she obliged me, by constant worrying, to walk with her down
                  through the grounds to meet them. </p>
               <p>"Linton is just six months younger than I am," she chattered, as we strolled
                  leisurely over the swells and hollows of mossy turf, under shadow of the trees.
                  "How delightful it will be to have him for a playfellow ! Aunt Isabella sent papa
                  a beautiful lock of his hair; it was lighter than mine -- more flaxen, and quite
                  as fine. I have it carefully preserved in a little glass box; and I've often
                  thought what pleasure it would be to see its owner -- Oh! I am happy -- and papa,
                  dear, dear papa! Come, Ellen, let us run! come run !" </p>
               <p>She ran, and returned and ran again, many times before my sober footsteps reached
                  the gate, and then she seated herself on the grassy bank beside the path, and
                  tried to wait pa<pb n="II.102" facs="II.110.png"/>tiently; but that was
                  impossible; she couldn't be still a minute. "How long they are!" she exclaimed.
                  "Ah, I see some dust on the road -- they are coming! No! When will they be here?
                  May we not go a little way -- half a mile, Ellen, only just half a mile ? Do say
                  yes, to that clump of birches at the turn !" </p>
               <p>I refused staunchly: and, at length, her suspense was ended: the travelling
                  carriage rolled in sight. </p>

               <p>Miss Cathy shrieked and stretched out her arms, as soon as she caught her father's
                  face looking from the window. He descended, nearly as eager as herself; and a
                  considerable interval elapsed ere they had a thought to spare for any but
                  themselves. While they exchanged caresses, I took a peep in to see after Linton.
                  He was asleep in a corner, wrapped in a warm, fur-lined cloak, as if it had been
                  winter -- a pale, delicate, effeminate boy, who might have been <pb n="II.103"
                     facs="II.111.png"/>taken for my master's younger brother, so strong was the
                  resemblance; but there was a sickly peevishness in his aspect that Edgar Linton
                  never had. The latter saw me looking; and having shaken hands, advised me to close
                  the door and leave him undisturbed, for the journey had fatigued him. Cathy would
                  fain have taken one glance, but her father told her to come, and they walked
                  together up the park, while I hastened before to prepare the servants. </p>
               <p>"Now, darling," said Mr. Linton, addressing his daughter, as they halted at the
                  bottom of the front steps, "your cousin is not so strong or so merry as you are,
                  and he has lost his mother, remember, a very short time since; therefore, don't
                  expect him to play and run about with you directly. And don't harass him much by
                  talking. Let him be quiet this evening, at least, will you?" </p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, papa," answered Catherine; <pb n="II.104" facs="II.112.png"/>"but I do
                  want to see him, and he hasn't once looked out." </p>
               <p>The carriage stopped, and the sleeper being roused was lifted to the ground by his
                  uncle.</p>
               <p>"This is your cousin Cathy, Linton," he said, putting their little hands together.
                  "She's fond of you already; and mind you don't grieve her by crying to-night. Try
                  to be cheerful now; the travelling is at an end, and you have nothing to do but
                  rest and amuse yourself as you please." </p>
               <p>"Let me go to bed, then," answered the boy, shrinking from Catherine's salute; and
                  he put up his fingers to remove incipient tears. </p>
               <p>"Come, come, there's a good child," I whispered, leading him in. "You'll make her
                  weep too. See how sorry she is for you!" </p>
               <p>I do not know whether it was sorrow for him, but his cousin put on as sad a
                  countenance as himself, and returned to her father. <pb n="II.105"
                     facs="II.113.png"/>All three entered, and mounted to the library, where tea was
                  laid ready. I proceeded to remove Linton's cap and mantle, and placed him on a
                  chair by the table; but he was no sooner seated than he began to cry afresh. My
                  master inquired what was the matter. </p>
               <p>"I can't sit on a chair," sobbed the boy. </p>
               <p>"Go to the sofa, then, and Ellen shall bring you some tea," answered his uncle
                  patiently. </p>
               <p>He had been greatly tried during the journey, I felt convinced, by his fretful
                  ailing charge. Linton slowly trailed himself off, and lay down. Cathy carried a
                  foot-stool and her cup to his side. At first she sat silent; but that could not
                  last. She had resolved to make a pet of her little cousin, as she would have him
                  to be; and she commenced stroking his curls, and kissing his cheek, and offering
                  him tea in her saucer, like a baby. This pleased him, for he <pb n="II.106"
                     facs="II.114.png"/>was not much better. He dried his eyes, and lightened into a
                  faint smile. </p>
               <p>"Oh, he'll do very well," said the master to me, after watching them a minute --
                  "very well, if we can keep him, Ellen. The company of a child of his own age will
                  instil new spirit into him soon, and by wishing for strength he'll gain it." </p>
               <p>"Ay, if we can keep him!" I mused to myself, and sore misgivings came over me that
                  there was slight hope of that. And then, I thought, however will that weakling
                  live at Wuthering Heights? Between his father and Hareton, what playmates and
                  instructors they'll be! Our doubts were presently decided -- even earlier than I
                  expected. I had just taken the children upstairs, after tea was finished, and seen
                  Linton asleep -- he would not suffer me to leave him till that was the case; I had
                  come down, and was standing by the table in the hall, lighting a bedroom candle
                  for Mr. Edgar, <pb n="II.107" facs="II.115.png"/>when a maid stepped out of the
                  kitchen and informed me that Mr. Heathcliff's servant Joseph was at the door, and
                  wished to speak with the master. </p>
               <p>"I shall ask him what he wants first," I said, in considerable trepidation. "A
                  very unlikely hour to be troubling people, and the instant they have returned from
                  a long journey. I don't think the master can see him." </p>
               <p>Joseph had advanced through the kitchen as I uttered these words, and now
                  presented himself in the hall. He was donned in his Sunday garments, with his most
                  sanctimonious and sourest face; and, holding his hat in one hand and his stick in
                  the other, he proceeded to clean his shoes on the mat. </p>
               <p>"Good-evening, Joseph," I said coldly. "What business brings you here to-night?" </p>
               <p>"It's Maister Linton I mun spake to," he answered, waving me disdainfully aside. </p>
               <p>"Mr. Linton is going to bed; unless you have something particular to say, I'm sure
                  he <pb n="II.108" facs="II.116.png"/>won't hear it now," I continued. "You had
                  better sit down in there, and entrust your message to me." </p>
               <p>"Which is his rahm?" pursued the fellow, surveying the range of closed doors. </p>
               <p>I perceived he was bent on refusing my mediation, so very reluctantly I went up to
                  the library, and announced the unseasonable visitor, advising that he should be
                  dismissed till next day. Mr. Linton had no time to empower me to do so, for Joseph
                  mounted close at my heels, and pushing into the apartment, planted himself at the
                  far side of the table, with his two fists clapped on the head of his stick, and
                  began in an elevated tone, as if anticipating opposition, -- </p>
               <p>"Hathecliff has sent me for his lad, and I munn't goa back 'bout him." </p>
               <p>Edgar Linton was silent a minute; an expression of exceeding sorrow overcast his
                  features. He would have pitied the child on his own account; but recalling
                  Isabella's hopes <pb n="II.109" facs="II.117.png"/>and fears, and anxious wishes
                  for her son, and her commendations of him to his care, he grieved bitterly at the
                  prospect of yielding him up, and searched in his heart how it might be avoided. No
                  plan offered itself. The very exhibition of any desire to keep him would have
                  rendered the claimant more peremptory. There was nothing left but to resign him.
                  However, he was not going to rouse him from his sleep. </p>
               <p>"Tell Mr. Heathcliff," he answered calmly, "that his son shall come to Wuthering
                  Heights to-morrow. He is in bed, and too tired to go the distance now. You may
                  also tell him that the mother of Linton desired him to remain under my
                  guardianship; and at present his health is very precarious." </p>
               <p>"Noa!" said Joseph, giving a thud with his prop on the floor, and assuming an
                  authoritative air; "noa! that means naught. Hathecliff maks noa 'count o' t'
                  mother, nor ye norther, but he'll hev his lad, und I mun tak him; soa now ye
                  knaw!" </p>
               <pb n="II.110" facs="II.118.png"/>
               <p>"You shall not to-night!" answered Linton decisively. </p>
               <p>"Walk downstairs at once, and repeat to your master what I have said. -- Ellen,
                  show him down. -- Go!" </p>
               <p>And aiding the indignant elder with a lift by the arm, he rid the room of him, and
                  closed the door. </p>
               <p>"Varrah weell!" shouted Joseph, as he slowly drew off. "To-morn, he's come
                  hisseln; and thrust him out, if ye darr!" </p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="2.6">
               <head>Chapter 2.6</head>
               <pb n="II.111" facs="II.119.png"/>
               <p>To obviate the danger of this threat being fulfilled, Mr. Linton commissioned me
                  to take the boy home early, on Catherine's pony, and, said he -- </p>
               <p>"As we shall now have no influence over his destiny, good or bad, you must say
                  nothing of where he is gone to my daughter; she cannot associate with him
                  hereafter; and it is better for her to remain in ignorance of his proximity, lest
                  she should be restless, and anxious to visit the Heights -- merely tell her, <pb
                     n="II.112" facs="II.120.png"/>his father sent for him suddenly, and he has been
                  obliged to leave us."</p>
               <p>Linton was very reluctant to be roused from his bed at five o'clock, and
                  astonished to be informed that he must prepare for further travelling: but I
                  softened off the matter by stating that he was going to spend some time with his
                  father, Mr. Heathcliff, who wished to see him so much, he did not like to defer
                  the pleasure till he should recover from his late journey.</p>
               <p>"My father?" he cried, in strange perplexity. "Mamma never told me I had a father.
                  Where does he live ? I'd rather stay with uncle."</p>
               <p>"He lives a little distance from the Grange," I replied, "just beyond those hills
                  -- not so far but you may walk over here, when you get hearty. And you should be
                  glad to go home, and to see him. You must try to love him, as you did your mother,
                  and then he will love you."</p>
               <pb n="II.113" facs="II.121.png"/>
               <p>"But why have I not heard of him before?" asked Linton; "why didn't mamma and he
                  live together, as other people do ?"</p>
               <p>"He had business to keep him in the north," I answered; "and your mother's health
                  required her to reside in the south."</p>
               <p>"And why didn't mamma speak to me about him ?" persevered the child. "She often
                  talked of uncle, and I learnt to love him long ago. How am I to love papa? I don't
                  know him."</p>
               <p>"Oh, all children love their parents," I said. "Your mother, <pb n="205"/>perhaps,
                  thought you would want to be with him if she mentioned him often to you. Let us
                  make haste. An early ride on such a beautiful morning is much preferable to an
                  hour's more sleep." </p>
               <p>"Is she to go with us," he demanded -- "the little girl I saw yesterday?" </p>
               <p>"Not now," replied I. </p>
               <p>"Is uncle?" he continued. </p>
               <pb n="II.114" facs="II.122.png"/>
               <p>"No; I shall be your companion there," I said. </p>
               <p>Linton sank back on his pillow and fell into a brown study. </p>
               <p>"I won't go without uncle," he cried at length. "I can't tell where you mean to
                  take me." </p>
               <p>I attempted to persuade him of the naughtiness of showing reluctance to meet his
                  father. Still he obstinately resisted any progress towards dressing, and I had to
                  call for my master's assistance in coaxing him out of bed. The poor thing was
                  finally got off, with several delusive assurances that his absence should be
                  short, that Mr. Edgar and Cathy would visit him, and other promises, equally
                  ill-founded, which I invented and reiterated at intervals throughout the way. The
                  pure heather-scented air, the bright sunshine, and the gentle canter of Minny
                  relieved his despondency after a while. He began to put questions concerning his
                  new home <pb n="II.115" facs="II.123.png"/>and its inhabitants with greater
                  interest and liveliness. </p>
               <p>"Is Wuthering Heights as pleasant a place as Thrushcross Grange?" he inquired,
                  turning to take a last glance into the valley, whence a light mist mounted and
                  formed a fleecy cloud on the skirts of the blue. </p>
               <p>"It is not so buried in trees," I replied, "and it is not quite so large, but you
                  can see the country beautifully all round, and the air is healthier for you --
                  fresher and dryer. You will perhaps think the building old and dark at first,
                  though it is a respectable house -- the next best in the neighbourhood. And you
                  will have such nice rambles on the moors. Hareton Earnshaw -- that is Miss Cathy's
                  other cousin, and so yours in a manner -- will show you all the sweetest spots;
                  and you can bring a book in fine weather, and make a green hollow your study; and
                  now and then your uncle may join you in a walk. He does frequently walk out on the
                  hills." </p>
               <pb n="II.116" facs="II.124.png"/>
               <p>"And what is my father like?" he asked. "Is he as young and handsome as uncle?" </p>
               <p>"He's as young," said I; "but he has black hair and eyes, and looks sterner, and
                  he is taller and bigger altogether. He'll not seem to you so gentle and kind at
                  first, perhaps, because it is not his way; still, mind you be frank and cordial
                  with him; and naturally he'll be fonder of you than any uncle, for you are his
                  own." </p>
               <p>"Black hair and eyes!" mused Linton. "I can't fancy him. Then I am not like him,
                  am I?" </p>
               <p>"Not much," I answered; not a morsel, I thought, surveying with regret the white
                  complexion and slim frame of my companion, and his large languid eyes -- his
                  mother's eyes, save that, unless a morbid touchiness kindled them a moment, they
                  had not a vestige of her sparkling spirit. </p>
               <p>"How strange that he should never come to see mamma and me" he murmured. "Has he
                     <pb n="II.117" facs="II.125.png"/>ever seen me? If he has, I must have been a
                  baby. I remember not a single thing about him." </p>
               <p>"Why, Master Linton," said I, "three hundred miles is a great distance; and ten
                  years seem very different in length to a grown-up person compared with what they
                  do to you. It is probable Mr. Heathcliff proposed going from summer to summer, but
                  never found a convenient opportunity; and now it is too late. Don't trouble him
                  with questions on the subject; it will disturb him for no good." </p>
               <p>The boy was fully occupied with his own cogitations for the remainder of the ride,
                  till we halted before the farmhouse garden gate. I watched to catch his
                  impressions in his countenance. He surveyed the carved front and low-browed
                  lattices, the straggling gooseberry bushes and crooked firs, with solemn
                  intentness, and then shook his head. His private feelings entirely disapproved of
                  the exterior of <pb n="II.118" facs="II.126.png"/>his new abode. But he had sense
                  to postpone complaining. There might be compensation within. Before he dismounted
                  I went and opened the door. It was half-past six; the family had just finished
                  breakfast; the servant was clearing and wiping down the table. Joseph stood by his
                  master's chair, telling some tale concerning a lame horse, and Hareton was
                  preparing for the hay-field.</p>
               <p>"Hullo, Nelly!" said Mr. Heathcliff when he saw me. "I feared I should have to
                  come down and fetch my property myself. You've brought it, have you? Let us see
                  what we can make of it. </p>
               <p>He got up and strode to the door. Hareton and Joseph followed in gaping curiosity.
                  Poor Linton ran a frightened eye over the faces of the three. </p>
               <p>"Sure-ly," said Joseph, after a grave inspection, "he's swopped wi' ye, maister,
                  an' yon's his lass!" <pb n="II.119" facs="II.127.png"/>Heathcliff, having stared
                  his son into an ague of confusion, uttered a scornful laugh. </p>
               <p>"God! what a beauty! what a lovely, charming thing" he exclaimed. "Haven't they
                  reared it on snails and sour milk, Nelly? Oh, damn my soul! but that's worse than
                  I expected, and the devil knows I was not sanguine!" </p>
               <p>I bade the trembling and bewildered child get down and enter. He did not
                  thoroughly comprehend the meaning of his father's speech, or whether it were
                  intended for him; indeed, he was not yet certain that the grim, sneering stranger
                  was his father. But he clung to me with growing trepidation; and on Mr.
                  Heathcliff's taking a seat and bidding him "come hither," he hid his face on my
                  shoulder and wept. </p>
               <p>"Tut, tut!" said Heathcliff, stretching out a hand and dragging him roughly
                  between his knees, and then holding up his head by the chin. "None of that
                  nonsense! We're not <pb n="II.120" facs="II.128.png"/>going to hurt thee, Linton.
                  Isn't that thy name? Thou art thy mother's child entirely! Where is my share in
                  thee, puling chicken?" </p>
               <p>He took off the boy's cap and pushed back his thick flaxen curls, felt his slender
                  arms and his small fingers, during which examination Linton ceased crying, and
                  lifted his great blue eyes to inspect the inspector. </p>
               <p>"Do you know me?" asked Heathcliff, having satisfied himself that the limbs were
                  all equally frail and feeble. </p>

               <p>"No," said Linton, with a gaze of vacant fear. </p>
               <p>"You've heard of me, I dare say?" </p>
               <p>"No," he replied again. </p>
               <p>"No! What a shame of your mother, never to waken your filial regard for me! You
                  are my son, then, I'll tell you; and your mother was a wicked slut to leave you in
                  ignorance of the sort of father you possessed. Now, don't wince and colour up.
                  Though it is something to see you have not white blood. Be a <pb n="II.121"
                     facs="II.129.png"/>good lad, and I'll do for you. -- Nelly, if you be tired,
                  you may sit down; if not, get home again. I guess you'll report what you hear and
                  see to the cipher at the Grange; and this thing won't be settled while you linger
                  about it." </p>
               <p>"Well," replied I, "I hope you'll be kind to the boy, Mr. Heathcliff, or you'll
                  not keep him long; and he's all you have akin in the wide world that you will ever
                  know, remember." </p>
               <p>"I'll be very kind to him, you needn't fear," he said, laughing. "Only nobody else
                  must be kind to him. I'm jealous of monopolizing his affection. And to begin my
                  kindness, Joseph, bring the lad some breakfast. -- Hareton, you infernal calf,
                  begone to your work -- Yes, Nell," he added, when they had departed, "my son is
                  prospective owner of your place, and I should not wish him to die till I was
                  certain of being his successor. Besides, he's mine, and I want the triumph of
                  seeing <pb n="II.122" facs="II.130.png"/>my descendant fairly lord of their
                  estates -- my child hiring their children to till their father's lands for wages.
                  That is the sole consideration which can make me endure the whelp. I despise him
                  for himself, and hate him for the memories he revives. But that consideration is
                  sufficient. He's safe with me, and shall be tended as carefully as your master
                  tends his own. I have a room up-stairs furnished for him in handsome style. I've
                  engaged a tutor also to come three times a week, from twenty miles distance, to
                  teach him what he pleases to learn. I've ordered Hareton to obey him; and, in
                  fact, I've arranged everything with a view to preserve the superior and the
                  gentleman in him, above his associates. I do regret, however, that he so little
                  deserves the trouble. If I wished any blessing in the world, it was to find him a
                  worthy object of pride; and I'm bitterly disappointed with the whey-faced whining
                  wretch!" </p>
               <pb n="II.123" facs="II.131.png"/>
               <p>While he was speaking, Joseph returned bearing a basin of milk-porridge, and
                  placed it before Linton, who stirred round the homely mess with a look of
                  aversion, and affirmed he could not eat it. I saw the old man-servant shared
                  largely in his master's scorn of the child, though he was compelled to retain the
                  sentiment in his heart, because Heathcliff plainly meant his underlings to hold
                  him in honour. </p>
               <p>"Cannot ate it?" repeated he, peering in Linton's face, and subduing his voice to
                  a whisper, for fear of being overheard. "But Maister Hareton nivir ate naught
                  else, when he wer a little un; and what wer gooid eneugh for him's gooid eneugh
                  for ye, I's rayther think." </p>
               <p>"I shan't eat it!" answered Linton snappishly. "Take it away." Joseph snatched up
                  the food indignantly, and brought it to us. </p>
               <pb n="II.124" facs="II.132.png"/>
               <p>"Is there aught ails th' victuals?" he asked, thrusting the tray under
                  Heathcliff's nose. </p>
               <p>"What should ail them?" he said. </p>
               <p>"Wah!" answered Joseph, "yon dainty chap says he cannut ate 'em. But I guess it's
                  raight. His mother wer just soa; we wer a'most too mucky to sow t' corn for
                  makking her breead." </p>
               <p>"Don't mention his mother to me," said the master angrily. "Get him something that
                  he can eat, that's all. -- What is his usual food, Nelly?" </p>
               <p>I suggested boiled milk or tea; and the housekeeper received instructions to
                  prepare some. Come, I reflected, his father's selfishness may contribute to his
                  comfort. He perceives his delicate constitution, and the necessity of treating him
                  tolerably. I'll console Mr. Edgar by acquainting him with the turn Heathcliff's
                  humour has taken. Having no excuse for lingering longer, I <pb n="II.125"
                     facs="II.133.png"/>slipped out, while Linton was engaged in timidly rebuffing
                  the advances of a friendly sheep-dog. But he was too much on the alert to be
                  cheated. As I closed the door, I heard a cry, and a frantic repetition of the
                  words, -- </p>

               <p>"Don't leave me! I'll not stay here! I'll not stay here" </p>
               <p>Then the latch was raised and fell. They did not suffer him to come forth. I
                  mounted Minny, and urged her to a trot; and so my brief guardianship ended. </p>

               <pb n="II.126" facs="II.134.png"/>
               <p>We had sad work with little Cathy that day: she rose in high glee, eager to join
                  her cousin; and such passionate tears and lamentations followed the news of his
                  departure, that Edgar himself was obliged to sooth her, by affirming he should
                  come back soon; he added, however, "if I can get him;" and there were no hopes of
                  that.</p>
               <p>This promise poorly pacified her; but time was more potent; and though still, at
                  intervals, she inquired of her father when Linton <pb n="II.127" facs="II.135.png"
                  />would return, before she did see him again, his features had waxed so dim in her
                  memory that she did not recognise him.</p>
               <p>When I chanced to encounter the housekeeper of Wuthering Heights, in paying
                  business-visits to Gimmerton, I used to ask how the young master got on; for he
                  lived almost as secluded as Catherine herself, and was never to be seen. I could
                  gather from her that he continued in weak health, and was a tiresome inmate. She
                  said Mr. Heathcliff seemed to dislike him ever longer and worse, though he took
                  some trouble to conceal it. He had an antipathy to the sound of his voice, and
                  could not do at all with his sitting in the same room with him many minutes
                  together.</p>
               <p>There seldom passed much talk between them; Linton learnt his lessons and spent
                  his evenings in a small apartment they called the parlour; or else lay in bed all
                  day; for he was constantly getting coughs, and colds, and aches, and pains of some
                  sort.</p>
               <pb n="II.128" facs="II.136.png"/>
               <p>"And I never knew such a faint-hearted creature," added the woman; "nor one so
                  careful of hisseln. He <hi rend="italic">will</hi> go on, if I leave the window
                  open, a bit late in the evening. Oh ! it's killing, a breath of night air! And he
                  must have a fire in the middle of summer; and Joseph's 'bacca pipe is poison; and
                  he must always have sweets and dainties, and always milk, milk for ever -- heeding
                  naught how the rest of us are pinched in winter -- and there he'll sit, wrapped in
                  his furred cloak in his chair by the fire, and some toast and water or other slop
                  on the hob to sip at; and if Hareton, for pity, comes to amuse him -- Hareton is
                  not bad-natured, though he's rough -- they're sure to part, one swearing and the
                  other crying. I believe the master would relish Earnshaw's thrashing him to a
                  mummy, if he were not his son; and I'm certain he would be fit to turn him out of
                  doors if he knew half the nursing he gives hisseln. But then he won't go into
                  danger of temptation.<pb n="II.129" facs="II.137.png"/> He never enters the
                  parlour, and should Linton show those ways in the house where he is, he sends him
                  upstairs directly." </p>
               <p>I divined from this account that utter lack of sympathy had rendered young
                  Heathcliff selfish and disagreeable, if he were not so originally; and my interest
                  in him consequently decayed, though still I was moved with a sense of grief at his
                  lot, and a wish that he had been left with us. Mr. Edgar encouraged me to gain
                  information. He thought a great deal about him, I fancy, and would have run some
                  risk to see him; and he told me once to ask the housekeeper whether he ever came
                  into the village. She said he had only been twice, on horseback, accompanying his
                  father, and both times he pretended to be quite knocked up for three or four days
                  afterwards. That housekeeper left, if I recollect rightly, two years after he
                  came, and another, whom I <pb n="II.130" facs="II.138.png"/>did not know, was her
                  successor. She lives there still. </p>
               <p>Time wore on at the Grange in its former pleasant way till Miss Cathy reached
                  sixteen. On the anniversary of her birth we never manifested any signs of
                  rejoicing, because it was also the anniversary of my late mistress's death. Her
                  father invariably spent that day alone in the library, and walked at dusk as far
                  as Gimmerton kirkyard, where he would frequently prolong his stay beyond midnight.
                  Therefore Catherine was thrown on her own resources for amusement. This 20th of
                  March was a beautiful spring day, and when her father had retired, my young lady
                  came down dressed for going out, and said she asked to have a ramble on the edge
                  of the moor with me. Mr. Linton had given her leave, if we went only a short
                  distance and were back within the hour. </p>
               <p>"So make haste, Ellen!" she cried. "I <pb n="II.131" facs="II.139.png"/>know where
                  I wish to go -- where a colony of moor game are settled. I want to see whether
                  they have made their nests yet." </p>
               <p>"That must be a good distance up," I answered. </p>
               <p>"They don't breed on the edge of the moor." </p>
               <p>"No, it's not," she said. "I've gone very near with papa." </p>
               <p>I put on my bonnet and sallied out, thinking nothing more of the matter. She
                  bounded before me, and returned to my side, and was off again like a young
                  grey-hound; and at first I found plenty of entertainment in listening to the larks
                  singing far and near, and enjoying the sweet, warm sunshine, and watching her, my
                  pet and my delight, with her golden ringlets flying loose behind, and her bright
                  cheek, as soft and pure in its bloom as a wild rose, and her eyes radiant with
                  cloudless pleasure. She was a happy creature, and an angel, in those days. It's a
                  pity she could not be content. </p>
               <pb n="II.132" facs="II.140.png"/>
               <p>"Well," said I, "where are your moor-game, Miss Cathy? We should be at them. The
                  Grange park fence is a great way off now." </p>
               <p>"Oh, a little farther -- only a little farther, Ellen," was her answer
                  continually. "Climb to that hillock, pass that bank, and by the time you reach the
                  other side I shall have raised the birds." </p>
               <p>But there were so many hillocks and banks to climb and pass that at length I began
                  to be weary, and told her we must halt and retrace our steps. I shouted to her, as
                  she had outstripped me a long way. She either did not hear or did not regard, for
                  she still sprang on, and I was compelled to follow. Finally she dived into a
                  hollow, and before I came in sight of her again she was two miles nearer Wuthering
                  Heights than her own home; and I beheld a couple of persons arrest her, one of
                  whom I felt convinced was Mr. Heathcliff himself. </p>
               <pb n="II.133" facs="II.141.png"/>
               <p>Cathy had been caught in the fact of plundering, or at least hunting out the nests
                  of the grouse. The Heights were Heathcliff's land, and he was reproving the
                  poacher. </p>
               <p>"I've neither taken any nor found any," she said, as I toiled to them, expanding
                  her hands in corroboration of the statement. "I didn't mean to take them; but papa
                  told me there were quantities up here, and I wished to see the eggs." </p>
               <p>Heathcliff glanced at me with an all-meaning smile, expressing his acquaintance
                  with the party, and, consequently, his malevolence towards it, and demanded who
                  "papa" was. </p>
               <p>"Mr. Linton of Thrushcross Grange," she replied. </p>
               <p>"I thought you did not know me, or you wouldn't have spoken in that way." </p>
               <p>"You suppose papa is highly esteemed and respected, then?" he said sarcastically. </p>
               <p>"And what are you?" inquired Catherine, <pb n="II.134" facs="II.142.png"/>gazing
                  curiously on the speaker. "That man I've seen before. Is he your son?" </p>
               <p>She pointed to Hareton, the other individual, who had gained nothing but increased
                  bulk and strength by the addition of two years to his age; he seemed as awkward
                  and rough as ever. </p>
               <p>"Miss Cathy," I interrupted, "it will be three hours instead of one that we are
                  out presently. We really must go back." </p>
               <p>"No, that man is not my son," answered Heathcliff, pushing me aside. "But I have
                  one, and you have seen him before too; and though your nurse is in a hurry, I
                  think both you and she would be the better for a little rest. Will you just turn
                  this nab of heath and walk into my house? You'll get home earlier for the ease,
                  and you shall receive a kind welcome." </p>
               <p>I whispered Catherine that she mustn't on any account accede to the proposal. It
                  was entirely out of the question. </p>
               <pb n="II.135" facs="II.143.png"/>
               <p>"Why?" she asked aloud. "I'm tired of running, and the ground is dewy. I can't sit
                  here. Let us go, Ellen. Besides, he says I have seen his son. He's mistaken, I
                  think; but I guess where he lives -- at the farmhouse I visited in coming from
                  Peniston Crags. Don't you?" </p>
               <p>"I do -- Come, Nelly, hold your tongue; it will be a treat for her to look in on
                  us. -- Hareton, get forwards with the lass. -- You shall walk with me, Nelly."</p>
               <p>"No, she's not going to any such place," I cried, struggling to release my arm,
                  which he had seized; but she was almost at the door-stones already, scampering
                  round the brow at full speed. Her appointed companion did not pretend to escort
                  her; he shied off by the roadside and vanished. </p>
               <p>"Mr. Heathcliff, it's very wrong," I continued. "You know you mean no good. And
                  there she'll see Linton, and all will be told as <pb n="II.136" facs="II.144.png"
                  />soon as ever we return; and I shall have the blame." </p>
               <p>"I want her to see Linton," he answered. "He's looking better these few days. It's
                  not often he's fit to be seen. And we'll soon persuade her to keep the visit
                  secret. Where is the harm of it?" </p>
               <p>"The harm of it is that her father would hate me if he found I suffered her to
                  enter your house; and I am convinced you have a bad design in encouraging her to
                  do so," I replied. </p>
               <p>"My design is as honest as possible. I'll inform you of its whole scope," he said
                  -- "that the two cousins may fall in love, and get married. I'm acting generously
                  to your master. His young chit has no expectations, and should she second my
                  wishes, she'll be provided for at once as joint successor with Linton." </p>
               <p>"If Linton died," I answered, "and his <pb n="II.137" facs="II.145.png"/>life is
                  quite uncertain, Catherine would be the heir." </p>
               <p>"No, she would not," he said. "There is no clause in the will to secure it so. His
                  property would go to me. But to prevent disputes I desire their union, and am
                  resolved to bring it about." </p>
               <p>"And I am resolved she shall never approach your house with me again," I returned,
                  as we reached the gate, where Miss Cathy waited our coming. </p>
               <p>Heathcliff bade me be quiet, and preceding us up the path, hastened to open the
                  door. My young lady gave him several looks, as if she could not exactly make up
                  her mind what to think of him; but now he smiled when he met her eye, and softened
                  his voice in addressing her; and I was foolish enough to imagine the memory of her
                  mother might disarm him from desiring her injury. Linton stood on the hearth. He
                  had been out walking in the fields, for his cap was on, <pb n="II.138"
                     facs="II.146.png"/>and he was calling to Joseph to bring him dry shoes. He had
                  grown tall of his age, still wanting some months of sixteen. His features were
                  pretty yet, and his eye and complexion brighter than I remembered them, though
                  with merely temporary lustre borrowed from the salubrious air and genial sun. </p>
               <p>"Now, who is that?" asked Mr. Heathcliff, turning to Cathy. "Can you tell?" </p>
               <p>"Your son?" she said, having doubtfully surveyed first one and then the other. </p>
               <p>"Yes, yes," answered he. "But is this the only time you have beheld him? Think!
                  Ah! you have a short memory. -- Linton, don't you recall your cousin that you used
                  to tease us so with wishing to see?" </p>
               <p>"What, Linton!" cried Cathy, kindling into joyful surprise at the name. "Is that
                  little Linton? He's taller than I am! -- Are you Linton?" </p>
               <p>The youth stepped forward and acknow<pb n="II.139" facs="II.147.png"/>ledged
                  himself. She kissed him fervently, and they gazed with wonder at the change time
                  had wrought in the appearance of each. Catherine had reached her full height; her
                  figure was both plump and slender, elastic as steel, and her whole aspect
                  sparkling with health and spirits. Linton's looks and movements were very languid,
                  and his form extremely slight; but there was a grace in his manner that mitigated
                  these defects, and rendered him not unpleasing. After exchanging numerous marks of
                  fondness with him, his cousin went to Mr. Heathcliff, who lingered by the door,
                  dividing his attention between the objects inside and those that lay without --
                  pretending, that is, to observe the latter, and really noting the former alone. </p>
               <p>"And you are my uncle, then!" she cried, reaching up to salute him. "I thought I
                  liked you, though you were cross at first. Why don't you visit at the Grange with
                  Linton? <pb n="II.140" facs="II.148.png"/>To live all these years such close
                  neighbours, and never see us, is odd. What have you done so for?" </p>
               <p>"I visited it once or twice too often before you were born," he answered. "There
                  -- damn it! If you have any kisses to spare, give them to Linton -- they are
                  thrown away on me." </p>
               <p>"Naughty Ellen!" exclaimed Catherine, flying to attack me next with her lavish
                  caresses. "Wicked Ellen, to try to hinder me <pb n="217"/>from entering! But I'll
                  take this walk every morning in future -- may I, uncle? -- and sometimes bring
                  papa. Won't you be glad to see us?" </p>
               <p>"Of course!" replied the uncle, with a hardly suppressed grimace, resulting from
                  his deep aversion to both the proposed visitors. "But stay," he continued, turning
                  towards the young lady. "Now I think of it, I'd better tell you. Mr. Linton has a
                  prejudice against me. We quarrelled at one time of our lives <pb n="II.141"
                     facs="II.149.png"/>with unchristian ferocity, and if you mention coming here to
                  him he'll put a veto on your visits altogether. Therefore you must not mention it,
                  unless you be careless of seeing your cousin hereafter. You may come if you will,
                  but you must not mention it," </p>
               <p>"Why did you quarrel?" asked Catherine, considerably crestfallen. </p>
               <p>"He thought me too poor to wed his sister," answered Heathcliff, "and was grieved
                  that I got her. His pride was hurt, and he'll never forgive it." </p>
               <p>"That's wrong!" said the young lady. "Some time I'll tell him so. But Linton and I
                  have no share in your quarrel. I'll not come here then; he shall come to the
                  Grange." </p>
               <p>"It will be too far for me," murmured her cousin; "to walk four miles would kill
                  me. No, come here, Miss Catherine, now and then -- not every morning, but once or
                  twice a week." </p>
               <p>The father launched towards his son a glance of bitter contempt. </p>
               <pb n="II.142" facs="II.150.png"/>
               <p>"I am afraid, Nelly, I shall lose my labour," he muttered to me. "Miss Catherine,
                  as the ninny calls her, will discover his value, and send him to the devil. Now,
                  if it had been Hareton! Do you know that, twenty times a day, I covet Hareton,
                  with all his degradation? I'd have loved the lad had he been some one else. But I
                  think he's safe from her love. I'll pit him against that paltry creature, unless
                  it bestir itself briskly. We calculate it will scarcely last till it is eighteen.
                  Oh, confound the vapid thing! He's absorbed in drying his feet, and never looks at
                  her. -- Linton!" </p>
               <p>"Yes, father," answered the boy. </p>
               <p>"Have you nothing to show your cousin anywhere about -- not <pb n="218"/> a
                  weasel's nest? Take her into the garden before you change your shoes, and into the
                  stable to see your horse." </p>
               <p>"Wouldn't you rather sit here?" asked Linton, addressing Cathy in a tone which
                  expressed reluctance to move again. </p>
               <pb n="II.143" facs="II.151.png"/>
               <p>"I don't know," she replied, casting a longing look to the door, and evidently
                  eager to be active. He kept his seat, and shrank closer to the fire. Heathcliff
                  rose and went into the kitchen, and from thence to the yard, calling out for
                  Hareton. Hareton responded, and presently the two re-entered. The young man had
                  been washing himself, as was visible by the glow on his cheeks and his wetted
                  hair. </p>
               <p>"Oh, I'll ask you, uncle," cried Miss Cathy, recollecting the housekeeper's
                  assertion. "That is not my cousin, is he?" </p>
               <p>"'Yes," he replied -- "your mother's nephew. Don't you like him?" Catherine looked
                  queer. </p>
               <p>"Is he not a handsome lad?" he continued. The uncivil little thing stood on
                  tiptoe, and whispered a sentence in Heathcliff's ear. He laughed. Hareton
                  darkened. I perceived <pb n="II.144" facs="II.152.png"/>he was very sensitive to
                  suspected slights, and had obviously a dim notion of his inferiority. But his
                  master or guardian chased the frown by exclaiming, -- </p>
               <p/>
               <p>"You'll be the favourite among us, Hareton! She says you are a -- What was it?
                  Well, something very flattering. Here! you go with her round the farm. And behave
                  like a gentleman, mind! Don't use any bad words; and don't stare when the young
                  lady is not looking at you, and be ready to hide your face when she is; and when
                  you speak, say your words slowly, and keep your hands out of your pockets. Be off,
                  and entertain her as nicely as you can." </p>
               <p>He watched the couple walking past the window. Earnshaw had his countenance
                  completely averted from his companion. He seemed studying the familiar landscape
                  with a stranger's and an artist's interest. </p>

               <p>Catherine took a sly look at him, expressing small admiration. She then turned her
                     atten<pb n="II.145" facs="II.153.png"/>tion to seeking out objects of amusement
                  for herself, and tripped merrily on, lilting a tune to supply the lack of
                  conversation. </p>
               <p>"I've tied his tongue," observed Heathcliff. "He'll not venture a single syllable
                  all the time! Nelly, you recollect me at his age -- nay, some years younger. Did I
                  ever look so stupid -- so 'gaumless,' as Joseph calls it?" </p>
               <p>"Worse," I replied, "because more sullen with it." </p>
               <p>"I've a pleasure in him," he continued, reflecting aloud. "He has satisfied my
                  expectations. If he were a born fool I should not enjoy it half so much. But he's
                  no fool; and I can sympathize with all his feelings, having felt them myself. I
                  know what he suffers now, for instance, exactly. It is merely a beginning of what
                  he shall suffer, though. And he'll never be able to emerge from his bathos of
                  coarseness and ignorance. I've got him faster than his scoundrel of a father
                  secured me, and <pb n="II.146" facs="II.154.png"/>lower, for he takes a pride in
                  his brutishness. I've taught him to scorn everything extra-animal as silly and
                  weak. Don't you think Hindley would be proud of his son if he could see him --
                  almost as proud as I am of mine? But there's this difference; one is gold put to
                  the use of paving-stones, and the other is tin polished to ape a service of
                  silver. Mine has nothing valuable about it, yet I shall have the merit of making
                  it go as far as such poor stuff can go. His had first-rate qualities, and they are
                  lost, rendered worse than unavailing. I have nothing to regret; he would have more
                  than any but me are aware of. And the best of it is, Hareton is damnably fond of
                  me! You'll own that I've outmatched Hindley there. If the dead villain could rise
                  from his grave to abuse me for his offspring's wrongs, I should have the fun of
                  seeing the said offspring fight him back again, indignant that he should dare to
                  rail at the one friend he has in the world." </p>
               <pb n="II.147" facs="II.155.png"/>
               <p>Heathcliff chuckled a fiendish laugh at the idea. I made no reply, because I saw
                  that he expected none. Meantime our young companion, who sat too removed from us
                  to hear what was said, began to evince symptoms of uneasiness, <pb n="220"
                  />probably repenting that he had denied himself the treat of Catherine's society
                  for fear of a little fatigue. His father remarked the restless glances wandering
                  to the window, and the hand irresolutely extended towards his cap. </p>
               <p>"Get up, you idle boy!" he exclaimed, with assumed heartiness. "Away after them!
                  They are just at the corner, by the stand of hives." </p>
               <p>Linton gathered his energies, and left the hearth. The lattice was open, and as he
                  stepped out I heard Cathy inquiring of her unsociable attendant what was that
                  inscription over the door? Hareton stared up, and scratched his head like a true
                  clown. </p>
               <pb n="II.148" facs="II.156.png"/>
               <p>"It's some damnable writing," he answered. "I cannot read it." </p>
               <p>"Can't read it?" cried Catherine. "I can read it; it's English. But I want to know
                  why it is there." </p>
               <p>Linton giggled -- the first appearance of mirth he had exhibited. </p>
               <p>"He does not know his letters," he said to his cousin. </p>
               <p>"Could you believe in the existence of such a colossal dunce?" </p>
               <p>"Is he all as he should be?" asked Miss Cathy seriously, "or is he simple -- not
                  right? I've questioned him twice now, and each time he looked so stupid I think he
                  does not understand me. I can hardly understand him, I'm sure." </p>
               <p>Linton repeated his laugh, and glanced at Hareton tauntingly, who certainly did
                  not seem quite clear of comprehension at that moment. </p>
               <p>"There's nothing the matter but laziness -- is there, Earnshaw?" he said. "My
                  cousin <pb n="II.149" facs="II.157.png"/>fancies you are an idiot. There you
                  experience the consequence of scorning 'book-larning,' as you would say. -- Have
                  you noticed, Catherine, his frightful Yorkshire pronunciation?" </p>
               <p>"Why, where the devil is the use on't?" growled Hareton, more ready in answering
                  his daily companion. He was about to enlarge further, but the two youngsters broke
                  into a noisy fit of merriment, my giddy miss being delighted to discover that she
                  might turn his strange talk to matter of amusement. </p>
               <p>"Where is the use of the devil in that sentence?" tittered Linton. "Papa told you
                  not to say any bad words, and you can't open your mouth without one. Do try to
                  behave like a gentleman -- now do!" </p>
               <p>"If thou weren't more a lass than a lad, I'd fell thee this minute, I would,
                  pitiful lath of a crater!" retorted the angry boor, retreating, while his face
                  burned with mingled rage and <pb n="II.150" facs="II.158.png"/>mortification, for
                  he was conscious of being insulted, and embarrassed how to resent it. </p>
               <p>Mr. Heathcliff having overheard the conversation as well as I, smiled when he saw
                  him go, but immediately afterwards cast a look of singular aversion on the
                  flippant pair, who remained chattering in the doorway, the boy finding animation
                  enough while discussing Hareton's faults and deficiencies and relating anecdotes
                  of his goings-on, and the girl relishing his pert and spiteful sayings, without
                  considering the ill-nature they evinced. I began to dislike more than to
                  compassionate Linton, and to excuse his father, in some measure, for holding him
                  cheap. </p>
               <p>We stayed till afternoon -- I could not tear Miss Cathy away sooner; but happily
                  my master had not quitted his apartment, and remained ignorant of our prolonged
                  absence. As we walked home I would fain have enlightened my charge on the
                  characters of the <pb n="II.151" facs="II.159.png"/>people we had quitted, but she
                  got it into her head that I was prejudiced against them. </p>
               <p>"Aha!" she cried, "you take papa's side, Ellen. You are partial, I know, or else
                  you wouldn't have cheated me so many years into the notion that Linton lived a
                  long way from here. I'm really extremely angry, only I'm so pleased I can't show
                  it. But you must hold your tongue about my uncle. He's my uncle, remember, and
                  I'll scold papa for quarrelling with him." </p>
               <p>And so she ran on, till I relinquished the endeavour to convince her of her
                  mistake. She did not mention the visit that night, because she did not see Mr.
                  Linton. Next day it all came out, sadly to my chagrin. And still I was not
                  altogether sorry. I thought the burden of directing and warning would be more
                  efficiently borne by him than me. But he was too timid in giving satisfactory
                  reasons for his wish that she should shun connection with the household of the
                  Heights, and Catherine liked <pb n="II.152" facs="II.160.png"/>good reasons for
                  every restraint that harassed her petted will. </p>
               <p>"Papa!" she exclaimed, after the morning's salutations, "guess whom I saw
                  yesterday in my walk on the moors. Ah, papa, you started! You've not done right,
                  have you, now? I saw -- But listen, and you shall hear how I found you out, and
                  Ellen, who is in league with you, and yet pretended to pity me so when I kept
                  hoping, and was always disappointed about Linton's coming back." </p>
               <p>She gave a faithful account of her excursion and its consequences; and my master,
                  though he cast more than one reproachful look at me, said nothing till she had
                  concluded. Then he drew her to him, and asked if she knew why he had concealed
                  Linton's near neighbourhood from her. Could she think it was to deny her a
                  pleasure that she might harmlessly enjoy? </p>
               <p>"It was because you disliked Mr. Heathcliff," she answered. </p>
               <pb n="II.153" facs="II.161.png"/>
               <p>"Then you believe I care more for my own feelings than yours, Cathy?" he said.
                  "No, it was not because I disliked Mr. Heathcliff, but because Mr. Heathcliff
                  dislikes me, and is a most diabolical man, delighting to wrong and ruin those he
                  hates, if they give him the slightest opportunity. I knew that you could not keep
                  up an acquaintance with your cousin without being brought into contact with him,
                  and I knew he would detest you on my account; so for your own good, and nothing
                  else, I took precautions that you should not see Linton again. I meant to explain
                  this some time as you grew older, and I'm sorry I delayed it." </p>
               <p>"But Mr. Heathcliff was quite cordial, papa," observed Catherine, not at all
                  convinced; "and he didn't object to our seeing each other. He said I might come to
                  his house when I pleased, only I must not tell you, because you had quarrelled
                  with him, and would not forgive him for marrying Aunt Isabella. And <pb n="II.154"
                     facs="II.162.png"/>you won't. you are the one to be blamed. He is willing to
                  let us be friends -- at least, Linton and I -- and you are not." </p>
               <p>My master, perceiving that she would not take his word for her uncle-in-law's evil
                  disposition, gave a hasty sketch of his conduct to Isabella, and the manner in
                  which Wuthering Heights became his property. He could not bear to discourse long
                  upon the topic, for though he spoke little of it, he still felt the same horror
                  and detestation of his ancient enemy that had occupied his heart ever since Mrs.
                  Linton's death. "She might have been living yet if it had not been for him!" was
                  his constant bitter reflection; and in his eyes Heathcliff seemed a murderer. Miss
                  Cathy -- conversant with no bad deeds except her own slight acts of disobedience,
                  injustice, and passion, arising from hot temper and thoughtlessness, and repented
                  of on the day they were committed -- was amazed at the blackness of spirit that
                  could brood on and co<pb n="II.155" facs="II.163.png"/>ver revenge for years, and
                  deliberately prosecute its plans without a visitation of remorse. She appeared so
                  deeply impressed and shocked at this new view of human nature, excluded from all
                  her studies and all her ideas till now, that Mr. Edgar deemed it unnecessary to
                  pursue the subject. He merely added, -- </p>
               <p>"You will know hereafter, darling, why I wish you to avoid his house and family.
                  Now return to your old employments and amusements, and think no more about them." </p>
               <p>Catherine kissed her father and sat down quietly to her lessons for a couple of
                  hours, according to custom; then she accompanied him into the grounds, and the
                  whole day passed as usual. But in the evening, when she had retired to her room,
                  and I went to help her to undress, I found her crying on her knees by the bedside. </p>
               <p>"Oh, fie, silly child!" I exclaimed. "If you had any real griefs you'd be ashamed
                  to waste a tear on this little contrariety. You never <pb n="II.156"
                     facs="II.164.png"/>had one shadow of substantial sorrow, Miss Catherine.
                  Suppose, for a minute, that master and I were dead, and you were by yourself in
                  the world; how would you feel then? Compare the present occasion with such an
                  affliction as that, and be thankful for the friends you have, instead of coveting
                  more." </p>
               <p>"I'm not crying for myself, Ellen," she answered -- "it's for him. He expected to
                  see me again to-morrow, and there he'll be so disappointed; and he'll wait for me,
                  and I shan't come." </p>
               <p>"Nonsense!" said I. "Do you imagine he has thought as much of you as you have of
                  him? Hasn't he Hareton for a companion? Not one in a hundred would weep at losing
                  a relation they had just seen twice, for two afternoons. Linton will conjecture
                  how it is, and trouble himself no further about you." </p>
               <p>"But may I not write a note to tell him why I cannot come," she asked, rising to
                  her feet, "and just send those books I promised <pb n="II.157" facs="II.165.png"
                  />to lend him? His books are not as nice as mine, and he wanted to have them
                  extremely when I told him how interesting they were. May I not, Ellen?" </p>
               <p>"No, indeed! no, indeed!" replied I, with decision. </p>
               <p>"Then he would write to you, and there'd never be an end of it. No, Miss
                  Catherine, the acquaintance must be dropped entirely; so papa expects, and I shall
                  see that it is done." </p>
               <p>"But how can one little note -- " she recommenced, putting on an imploring
                  countenance. </p>
               <p>"Silence!" I interrupted. "We'll not begin with your little notes. Get into bed." </p>
               <p>She threw at me a very naughty look -- so naughty that I would not kiss her
                  good-night at first. I covered her up and shut her door in great displeasure, but
                  repenting half-way, I returned softly, and lo! there was miss standing at the
                  table with a bit of blank paper before her and a pencil in her hand, which <pb
                     n="II.158" facs="II.166.png"/>she guiltily slipped out of sight on my entrance. </p>
               <p>"You'll get nobody to take that, Catherine," I said, "if you write it; and at
                  present I shall put out your candle." </p>
               <p>I set the extinguisher on the flame, receiving as I did so a slap on my hand, and
                  a petulant "Cross thing!" I then quitted her again, and she drew the bolt in one
                  of her worst, most peevish humours. The letter was finished and forwarded to its
                  destination by a milk-fetcher who came from the village; but that I did not learn
                  till some time afterwards. Weeks passed on, and Cathy recovered her temper, though
                  she grew wondrous fond of stealing off to corners by herself; and often, if I came
                  near her suddenly while reading, she would start and bend over the book, evidently
                  desirous to hide it, and I detected edges of loose paper sticking out beyond the
                     leaves.<pb n="II.159" facs="II.167.png"/> She also got a trick of coming down
                  early in the morning and lingering about the kitchen, as if she were expecting the
                  arrival of something; and she had a small drawer in a cabinet in the library which
                  she would trifle over for hours, and whose key she took special care to remove
                  when she left it. </p>
               <p>One day, as she inspected this drawer, I observed that the playthings and trinkets
                  which recently formed its contents were transmuted into bits of folded paper. My
                  curiosity and suspicions were aroused. I determined to take a peep at her
                  mysterious treasures; so at night, as soon as she and my master were safe
                  upstairs, I searched and readily found among my house-keys one that would fit the
                  lock. Having opened, I emptied the whole contents into my apron, and took them
                  with me to examine at leisure in my own chamber. Though I could not but suspect, I
                  was still surprised to discover that they were a mass of <pb n="II.160"
                     facs="II.168.png"/>correspondence -- daily, almost, it must have been -- from
                  Linton Heathcliff, answers to documents forwarded by her. The earlier dated were
                  embarrassed and short; gradually, however, they expanded into copious
                  love-letters, foolish, as the age of the writer rendered natural, yet with touches
                  here and there which I thought were borrowed from a more experienced source. Some
                  of them struck me as singularly odd compounds of ardour and flatness, commencing
                  in strong feeling, and concluding in the affected, wordy style that a schoolboy
                  might use to a fancied, incorporeal sweetheart. Whether they satisfied Cathy I
                  don't know, but they appeared very worthless trash to me. After turning over as
                  many as I thought proper, I tied them in a handkerchief and set them aside,
                  relocking the vacant drawer. </p>
               <p>Following her habit, my young lady descended early, and visited the kitchen. I
                  watched her go to the door on the arrival <pb n="II.161" facs="II.169.png"/>of a
                  certain little boy, and while the dairy-maid filled his can, she tucked something
                  into his jacket pocket, and plucked something out. I went round by the garden and
                  laid wait for the messenger, who fought valorously to defend his trust, and we
                  spilt the milk between us; but I succeeded in abstracting the epistle, and
                  threatening serious consequences if he did not look sharp home, I remained under
                  the wall and perused Miss Cathy's affectionate composition. It was more simple and
                  more eloquent than her cousin's -- very pretty and very silly. I shook my head,
                  and went meditating into the house. The day being wet, she could not divert
                  herself with rambling about the park, so, at the conclusion of her morning
                  studies, she resorted to the solace of the drawer. Her father sat reading at the
                  table, and I, on purpose, had sought a bit of work in some unripped fringes of the
                  window curtain, keeping my eye steadily fixed on her proceedings. <pb n="II.162"
                     facs="II.170.png"/>Never did any bird flying back to a plundered nest which it
                  had left brimful of chirping young ones express more complete despair in its
                  anguished cries and flutterings than she by her single "Oh!" and the change that
                  transfigured her late happy countenance. Mr. Linton looked up. </p>
               <p>"What is the matter, love? Have you hurt yourself?" he said. </p>
               <p>His tone and look assured her he had not been the discoverer of the hoard. </p>
               <p>"No, papa," she gasped -- "Ellen! Ellen! come upstairs! I'm sick!" </p>
               <p>I obeyed her summons, and accompanied her out. </p>
               <p>"O Ellen, you have got them!" she commenced immediately, dropping on her knees,
                  when we were enclosed alone. "Oh, give them to me, and I'll never, never do so
                  again! Don't tell papa. You have not told papa, Ellen? Say you have not. I've been
                  exceedingly naughty, but I won't do it any more!" </p>
               <pb n="II.163" facs="II.171.png"/>
               <p>With a grave severity in my manner I bade her stand up. </p>
               <p>"So," I exclaimed, "Miss Catherine, you are tolerably far on, it seems; you may
                  well be ashamed of them. A fine bundle of trash you study in your leisure hours,
                  to be sure. Why, it's good enough to be printed. And what do you suppose the
                  master will think when I display it before him? I haven't shown it yet, but you
                  needn't imagine I shall keep your ridiculous secrets. For shame! And you must have
                  led the way in writing such absurdities. He would not have thought of beginning,
                  I'm certain." </p>
               <p>"I didn't! I didn't!" sobbed Cathy, fit to break her heart. "I didn't once think
                  of loving him till -- " </p>
               <p>"Loving!" cried I, as scornfully as I could utter the word. "Loving! Did anybody
                  ever hear the like? I might just as well talk of loving the miller who comes once
                  a year to buy our corn. Pretty loving, indeed! And both <pb n="II.164"
                     facs="II.172.png"/>times together you have seen Linton hardly four hours in
                  your life! Now here is the babyish trash. I'm going with it to the library, and
                  we'll see what your father says to such loving." </p>
               <p>She sprang at her precious epistles, but I held them above my head; and then she
                  poured out further frantic entreaties that I would burn them -- do anything rather
                  than show them. And being really fully as much inclined to laugh as scold -- for I
                  esteemed it all girlish vanity -- I at length relented in a measure, and asked, -- </p>
               <p>"If I consent to burn them, will you promise faithfully neither to send nor
                  receive a letter again, nor a book (for I perceive you have sent him books), nor
                  locks of hair, nor rings, nor playthings?" </p>
               <p>"We don't send playthings!" cried Catherine, her pride overcoming her shame. </p>
               <p>"Nor anything at all then, my lady," I said. "Unless you will, here I go." </p>
               <pb n="II.165" facs="II.173.png"/>
               <p>"I promise, Ellen!" she cried, catching my dress.</p>
               <p>"Oh, put them in the fire! -- do, do!" But when I proceeded to open a place with
                  the poker the sacrifice was too painful to be borne. She earnestly supplicated
                  that I would spare her one or two. </p>
               <p>"One or two, Ellen, to keep for Linton's sake!" I unknotted the handkerchief, and
                  commenced dropping them in from an angle, and the flame curled up the chimney. </p>
               <p>"I will have one, you cruel wretch," she screamed, darting her <pb n="228"/>hand
                  into the fire and drawing forth some half-consumed fragments, at the expense of
                  her fingers. </p>
               <p>"Very well; and I will have some to exhibit to papa!" I answered, shaking back the
                  rest into the bundle, and turning anew to the door. </p>
               <p>She emptied her blackened pieces into the flames, and motioned me to finish the
                  immolation. It was done. I stirred up the ashes, and <pb n="II.166"
                     facs="II.174.png"/>interred them under a shovelful of coals; and she mutely,
                  and with a sense of intense injury, retired to her private apartment. I descended
                  to tell my master that the young lady's qualm of sickness was almost gone, but I
                  judged it best for her to lie down a while. She wouldn't dine; but she reappeared
                  at tea, pale and red about the eyes, and marvellously subdued in outward aspect.
                  Next morning I answered the letter by a slip of paper inscribed, "Master
                  Heathcliff is requested to send no more notes to Miss Linton, as she will not
                  receive them." And thenceforth the little boy came with vacant pockets. </p>

               <p>Summer drew to an end, and early Autumn -- it was past Michaelmas, but the harvest
                  was late that year, and a few of our fields were still uncleared.</p>
               <p>Mr. Linton and his daughter would frequently walk out among the reapers: at the
                  carrying of the last sheaves, they stayed till dusk, and the evening happening to
                  be chill and damp, my master caught a bad cold that, settling obstinately on his
                  lungs, confined him <pb n="II.168" facs="II.176.png"/>indoors throughout the whole
                  of the winter, nearly without intermission.</p>
               <p>Poor Cathy, frightened from her little romance, had been considerably sadder and
                  duller since its abandonment: and her father insisted on her reading less, and
                  taking more exercise. She had his companionship no longer; I esteemed it a duty to
                  supply its lack, as much as possible, with mine; an inefficient substitute, for I
                  could only spare two or three hours, from my numerous diurnal occupations, to
                  follow her footsteps, and then, my society was obviously less desirable than
                  his.</p>
               <p>On an afternoon in October, or the beginning of November, a fresh watery
                  afternoon, when the turf and paths were rustling with moist, withered leaves, and
                  the cold, blue sky was half hidden by clouds -- dark grey streamers, rapidly
                  mounting from the west, and boding abundant rain -- I requested my young lady to
                  forego her ramble because I was certain of showers. She refused; and I unwill<pb
                     n="II.169" facs="II.177.png"/>ingly donned a cloak, and took my umbrella to
                  accompany her on a stroll to the bottom of the park; a formal walk which she
                  generally affected if low-spirited -- and that she invariably was when Mr. Edgar
                  had been worse than ordinary; a thing never known from his confession, but guessed
                  both by her and me from his increased silence, and the melancholy of his
                  countenance.</p>
               <p>She went sadly on; there was no running or bounding now, though the chill wind
                  might well have tempted her to race. And often, from the side of my eye, I could
                  detect her raising a hand and brushing something off her cheeks. I gazed round for
                  a means of diverting her thoughts. On one side of the road rose a high, rough
                  bank, where hazels and stunted oaks, with their roots half exposed, held uncertain
                  tenure. The soil was too loose for the latter, and strong winds had blown some
                  nearly horizontal. In summer Miss Catherine <pb n="II.170" facs="II.178.png"
                  />delighted to climb along these trunks, and sit in the branches, swinging twenty
                  feet above the ground; and I, pleased with her agility and her light, childish
                  heart, still considered it proper to scold every time I caught her at such an
                  elevation, but so that she knew there was no necessity for descending. From dinner
                  to tea she would lie in her breeze-rocked cradle, doing nothing except singing old
                  songs -- my nursery lore -- to herself, or watching the birds, joint tenants, feed
                  and entice their young ones to fly; or nestling with closed lids, half thinking,
                  half dreaming, happier than words can express. </p>
               <p>"Look, miss!" I exclaimed, pointing to a nook under the roots of one twisted tree;
                  "winter is not here yet. There's a little flower up yonder -- the last bud from
                  the multitude of bluebells that clouded those turf steps in July with a lilac
                  mist. Will you clamber up and pluck it to show to papa?" </p>
               <p>Cathy stared a long time at the lonely blos<pb n="II.171" facs="II.179.png"/>som
                  trembling in its earthy shelter, and replied at length, -- </p>
               <p>"No, I'll not touch it. But it looks melancholy, does it not, Ellen?" </p>
               <p>"Yes," I observed -- "about as starved and sackless as you. Your cheeks are
                  bloodless. Let us take hold of hands and run. You're so low I dare say I shall
                  keep up with you." </p>
               <p>"No," she repeated, and continued sauntering on, pausing at intervals to muse over
                  a bit of moss, or a tuft of blanched grass, or a fungus spreading its bright
                  orange among the heaps of brown foliage; and ever and anon her hand was lifted to
                  her averted face. </p>
               <p>"Catherine, why are you crying, love?" I asked, approaching and putting my arm
                  over her shoulder. "You mustn't cry because papa has a cold. Be thankful it is
                  nothing worse." </p>
               <p>She now put no further restraint on her tears; her breath was stifled by sobs. </p>
               <p>"Oh, it will be something worse!" she said. <pb n="II.172" facs="II.180.png"/>"And
                  what shall I do when papa and you leave me, and I am by myself? I can't forget
                  your words, Ellen; they are always in my ear. How life will be changed, how dreary
                  the world will be, when papa and you are dead!" </p>
               <p>"None can tell whether you won't die before us," I replied. "It's wrong to
                  anticipate evil. We'll hope there are years and years to come before any of us go.
                  Master is young, and I am strong and hardly forty-five. My mother lived till
                  eighty, a canty dame to the last. And suppose Mr. Linton were spared till he saw
                  sixty, that would be more years than you have counted, miss. And would it not be
                  foolish to mourn a calamity above twenty years beforehand?" </p>
               <p>"But Aunt Isabella was younger than papa," she remarked, gazing up with timid hope
                  to seek further consolation. </p>
               <p>"Aunt Isabella had not you and me to nurse her," I replied. "She wasn't as happy
                  as master; she hadn't as much to live <pb n="II.173" facs="II.181.png"/>for. All
                  you need do is to wait well on your father, and cheer him by letting him see you
                  cheerful, and avoid giving him anxiety on any subject. Mind that, Cathy. I'll not
                  disguise but you might kill him if you were wild and reckless, and cherished a
                  foolish, fanciful affection for the son of a person who would be glad to have him
                  in his grave, and allowed him to discover that you fretted over the separation he
                  has judged it expedient to make." </p>
               <p>"I fret about nothing on earth except papa's illness," answered my companion. "I
                  care for nothing in comparison with papa. And I'll never -- never -- oh, never,
                  while I have my senses, do an act or say a word to vex him. I love him better than
                  myself, Ellen, and I know it by this: I pray every night that I may live after
                  him, because I would rather be miserable than that he should be. That proves I
                  love him better than myself." </p>
               <p>"Good words," I replied. "But deeds must prove it also. And after he is well,
                     remem<pb n="II.174" facs="II.182.png"/>ber you don't forget resolutions formed
                  in the hour of fear." </p>

               <p>As we talked, we neared a door that opened on the road; and my young lady,
                  lightening into sunshine again, climbed up and seated herself on the top of the
                  wall, reaching over to gather some hips that bloomed scarlet on the summit
                  branches of the wild rose trees shadowing the highway side. The lower fruit had
                  disappeared, but only birds could touch the upper, except from Cathy's present
                  station. In stretching to pull them, her hat fell off, and as the door was locked
                  she proposed scrambling down to recover it. I bade her be cautious lest she got a
                  fall, and she nimbly disappeared. But the return was no such easy matter. The
                  stones were smooth and neatly cemented, and the rose bushes and blackberry
                  stragglers could yield no assistance in reascending. I, like a fool, didn't
                  recollect that till I heard her laughing and exclaiming, -- </p>
               <pb n="II.175" facs="II.183.png"/>
               <p>"Ellen, you'll have to fetch the key, or else I must run round to the porter's
                  lodge. I can't scale the ramparts on this side."</p>
               <p>"Stay where you are," I answered. "I have my bundle of keys in my pocket. Perhaps
                  I may manage to open it; if not, I'll go." Catherine amused herself with dancing
                  to and fro before the door, while I tried all the large keys in succession. I had
                  applied the last, and found that none would do. So, repeating my desire that she
                  would remain there, I was about to hurry home as fast as I could, when an
                  approaching sound arrested me. It was the trot of a horse. Cathy's dance stopped
                  also. </p>
               <p>"Who is that?" I whispered. </p>
               <p>"Ellen, I wish you could open the door," whispered back my companion anxiously. </p>
               <p>"Ho, Miss Linton!" cried a deep voice (the rider's); </p>
               <p>"I'm glad to meet you. Don't be in haste to enter, for I have an explanation to
                  ask and obtain." </p>
               <pb n="II.176" facs="II.184.png"/>
               <p>"I shan't speak to you, Mr. Heathcliff," answered Catherine. "Papa says you are a
                  wicked man, and you hate both him and me; and Ellen says the same." </p>
               <p>"That is nothing to the purpose," said Heathcliff. (He it was.) "I don't hate my
                  son, I suppose, and it is concerning him that I demand your attention. Yes, you
                  have cause to blush. Two or three months since were you not in the habit of
                  writing to Linton -- making love in play, eh? You deserved, both of you, flogging
                  for that -- you especially, the elder, and less sensitive, as it turns out. I've
                  got your letters, and if you give me any pertness I'll send them to your father. I
                  presume you grew weary of the amusement and dropped it, didn't you? Well, you
                  dropped Linton with it into a Slough of Despond. He was in earnest -- in love,
                  really. As true as I live, he's dying for you, breaking his heart at your
                  fickleness -- not figuratively, but actually. Though Hareton has made him a
                  standing jest <pb n="II.177" facs="II.185.png"/>for six weeks, and I have used
                  more serious measures, and attempted to frighten him out of his idiocy, he gets
                  worse daily; and he'll be under the sod before summer unless you restore him!" </p>
               <p>"How can you lie so glaringly to the poor child?" I called from the inside. "Pray
                  ride on! How can you deliberately get up such paltry falsehoods? -- Miss Cathy,
                  I'll knock the lock off with a stone. You won't believe that vile nonsense. You
                  can feel in yourself it is impossible that a person should die for love of a
                  stranger." </p>
               <p>"I was not aware there were eavesdroppers," mut-tered the detected villain.
                  "Worthy Mrs. Dean, I like you, but I don't like your double-dealing," he added
                  aloud. "How could you lie so glaringly as to affirm I hated the 'poor child,' and
                  invent bugbear stories to terrify her from my door-stones? Catherine Linton (the
                  very name warms me), my bonny lass, I shall be from home all this week; go and <pb
                     n="II.178" facs="II.186.png"/>see if I have not spoken truth; do -- there's a
                  darling! Just imagine your father in my place, and Linton in yours; then think how
                  you would value your careless lover if he refused to stir a step to comfort you
                  when your father himself entreated him; and don't, from pure stupidity, fall into
                  the same error. I swear, on my salvation, he's going to his grave, and none but
                  you can save him!" </p>
               <p>The lock gave way, and I issued out. </p>
               <p>"I swear Linton is dying," repeated Heathcliff, looking hard at me. "And grief and
                  disappointment are hastening his death. Nelly, if you won't let her go, you can
                  walk over yourself. But I shall not return till this time next week; and I think
                  your master himself would scarcely object to her visiting her cousin." </p>
               <p>"Come in," said I, taking Cathy by the arm and half forcing her to re-enter; for
                  she lingered, viewing with troubled eyes the features of the speaker, too stern to
                  express his inward deceit. </p>
               <pb n="II.179" facs="II.187.png"/>
               <p>He pushed his horse close, and bending down, observed, -- </p>
               <p>"Miss Catherine, I'll own to you that I have little patience with Linton; and
                  Hareton and Joseph have less. I'll own that he's with a harsh set. He pines for
                  kindness as well as love, and a kind word from you would be his best medicine.
                  Don't mind Mrs. Dean's cruel cautions, but be generous, and contrive to see him.
                  He dreams of you day and night, and cannot be persuaded that you don't hate him,
                  since you neither write nor call." </p>
               <p>I closed the door and rolled a stone to assist the loosened lock in holding it,
                  and spreading my umbrella, I drew my charge underneath, for the rain began to
                  drive through the moaning branches of the trees, and warned us to avoid delay. Our
                  hurry prevented any comment on the encounter with Heathcliff as we stretched
                  towards home, but I divined instinctively that Catherine's heart was clouded now
                  in double <pb n="II.180" facs="II.188.png"/>darkness. Her features were so sad
                  they did not seem hers. She evidently regarded what she had heard as every
                  syllable true. </p>
               <p>The master had retired to rest before we came in. Cathy stole to his room to
                  inquire how he was; he had fallen asleep. She returned, and asked me to sit with
                  her in the library. We took our tea together, and afterwards she lay down on the
                  rug, and told me not to talk, for she was weary. I got a book, and pretended to
                  read. As soon as she supposed me absorbed in my occupation she recommenced her
                  silent weeping; it appeared, at present, her favourite diversion. I suffered her
                  to enjoy it a while, then I expostulated, deriding and ridiculing all Mr.
                  Heathcliff's assertions about his son, as if I were certain she would coincide.
                  Alas! I hadn't skill to counteract the effect his account had produced; it was
                  just what he intended. </p>
               <p>"You may be right, Ellen," she answered, "but I shall never feel at ease till I
                  know. <pb n="II.181" facs="II.189.png"/>And I must tell Linton it is not my fault
                  that I don't write, and convince him that I shall not change." </p>
               <p>What use were anger and protestations against her silly credulity? We parted that
                  night hostile, but next day beheld me on the road to Wuthering Heights by the side
                  of my wilful young mistress's pony. I couldn't bear to witness her sorrow, to see
                  her pale dejected countenance and heavy eyes; and I yielded, in the faint hope
                  that Linton himself might prove, by his reception of us, how little of the tale
                  was founded on fact. </p>

               <pb n="II.182" facs="II.190.png"/>
               <p>The rainy night had ushered in a misty morning -- half frost, half drizzle -- and
                  temporary brooks crossed our path, gurgling from the uplands. My feet were
                  thoroughly wetted; I was cross and low, exactly the humour suited for making the
                  most of these disagreeable things. </p>
               <p>We entered the farm-house by the kitchen way to ascertain whether Mr. Heathcliff
                  were really absent; because I put slight faith in his own affirmation. </p>
               <pb n="II.183" facs="II.191.png"/>
               <p>Joseph seemed sitting in a sort of elysium alone, beside a roaring fire; a quart
                  of ale on the table near him, bristling with large pieces of toasted oat cake; and
                  his black, short pipe in his mouth. </p>
               <p>Catherine ran to the hearth to warm herself. I asked if the master were in? </p>
               <p>My question remained so long unanswered, that I thought the old man had grown
                  deaf, and repeated it louder. </p>
               <p>"Na -- ay!" he snarled, or rather screamed through his nose. "Na -- ay! yah muh
                  goa back whear yah coom frough." </p>
               <p>"Joseph," cried a peevish voice, simultaneously with me, from the inner room. "How
                  often am I to call you ? There are only a few red ashes now. Joseph! come this
                  moment." </p>
               <p>Vigorous puffs, and a resolute stare into the grate, declared he had no ear for
                  this appeal. The housekeeper and Hareton were invisible; one gone on an errand,
                  and the other at his <pb n="II.184" facs="II.192.png"/>work, probably. We knew
                  Linton's tones and entered. </p>
               <p>"Oh, I hope you'll die in a garret ! starved to death," said the boy, mistaking
                  our approach for that of his negligent attendant. </p>
               <p>He stopped, on observing his error; his cousin flew to him. </p>
               <p>"Is that you, Miss Linton ?" he said, raising his head from the arm of the great
                  chair in which he reclined. </p>
               <p>"No, don't kiss me; it takes my breath. Dear me! Papa said you would call,"
                  continued he, after recovering a little from Catherine's embrace, while she stood
                  by looking very contrite. "Will you shut the door, if you please? You left it
                  open; and those -- those detestable creatures won't bring coals to the fire. It's
                  so cold!" </p>
               <p>I stirred up the cinders, and fetched a scuttleful myself. The invalid complained
                  of being covered with ashes; but he had a tiresome cough, and looked feverish and
                  ill, so I did not rebuke his temper. </p>
               <pb n="II.185" facs="II.193.png"/>
               <p>"Well, Linton," murmured Catherine, when his corrugated brow relaxed, "are you
                  glad to see me? Can I do you any good?" </p>
               <p>"Why didn't you come before?" he asked. "You should have come, instead of writing.
                  It tired me dreadfully writing those long letters. I'd far rather have talked to
                  you. Now, I can neither bear to talk nor anything else. I wonder where Zillah is!
                  Will you" -- looking at me -- "step into the kitchen and see?" </p>
               <p>I had received no thanks for my other service, and being unwilling to run to and
                  fro at his behest, I replied, -- </p>
               <p>"Nobody is out there but Joseph." </p>
               <p>"I want to drink," he exclaimed fretfully, turning away. "Zillah is constantly
                  gadding off to Gimmerton since papa went; it's miserable! And I'm obliged to come
                  down here; they resolved never to hear me up-stairs." </p>
               <p>"Is your father attentive to you, Master <pb n="II.186" facs="II.194.png"
                  />Heathcliff?" I asked, perceiving Catherine to be checked in her friendly
                  advances. </p>
               <p>"Attentive? He makes them a little more attentive at least," he cried. "The
                  wretches! Do you know, Miss Linton, that brute Hareton laughs at me! I hate him!
                  Indeed, I hate them all! They are odious beings." </p>
               <p>Cathy began searching for some water; she lighted on a pitcher in the dresser,
                  filled a tumbler, and brought it. He bade her add a spoonful of wine from a bottle
                  on the table; and having swallowed a small portion, appeared more tranquil, and
                  said she was very kind. </p>
               <p>"And are you glad to see me?" asked she, reiterating her former question, and
                  pleased to detect the faint dawn of a smile. </p>
               <p>"Yes, I am. It's something new to hear a voice like yours!" he replied. "But I
                  have been vexed because you wouldn't come. And papa swore it was owing to me. He
                  called me a pitiful, shuffling, worthless thing, and said you <pb n="II.187"
                     facs="II.195.png"/>despised me, and if he had been in my place he would be more
                  the master of the Grange than your father by this time. But you don't despise me,
                  do you, Miss --" </p>
               <p>"I wish you would say Catherine, or Cathy," interrupted my young lady. "Despise
                  you? No! Next to papa and Ellen, I love you better than anybody living. I don't
                  love Mr. Heathcliff, though, and I dare not come when he returns. Will he stay
                  away many days?" </p>
               <p>"Not many," answered Linton; "but he goes on to the moors frequently since the
                  shooting season commenced, and you might spend an hour or two with me in his
                  absence. Do say you will. I think I should not be peevish with you. You'd not
                  provoke me, and you'd always be ready to help me, wouldn't you?" </p>
               <p>"Yes," said Catherine, stroking his long soft hair. "If I could only get papa's
                  consent I'd <pb n="II.188" facs="II.196.png"/>spend half my time with you. Pretty
                  Linton! I wish you were my brother." </p>
               <p>"And then you would like me as well as your father?" observed he more cheerfully.
                  "But papa says you would love me better than him and all the world if you were my
                  wife; so I'd rather you were that." </p>
               <p>"No, I should never love anybody better than papa," she returned gravely. "And
                  people hate their wives sometimes, but not their sisters and brothers; and if you
                  were the latter you would live with us, and papa would be as fond of you as he is
                  of me." </p>
               <p>Linton denied that people ever hated their wives, but Cathy affirmed they did, and
                  in her wisdom instanced his own father's aversion to her aunt. I endeavoured to
                  stop her thoughtless tongue. I couldn't succeed till everything she knew was out.
                  Master Heathcliff, much irritated, asserted her relation was false. </p>
               <pb n="II.189" facs="II.197.png"/>
               <p>"Papa told me, and papa does not tell falsehoods," she answered pertly. </p>
               <p>"My papa scorns yours!" cried Linton. "He calls him a sneaking fool." </p>
               <p>"Yours is a wicked man," retorted Catherine, "and you are very naughty to dare to
                  repeat what he says. He must be wicked to have made Aunt Isabella leave him as she
                  did." </p>
               <p>"She didn't leave him," said the boy. "You shan't contradict me." </p>
               <p>"She did," cried my young lady. </p>
               <p>"Well, I'll tell you something," said Linton. "Your mother hated your father. Now
                  then." </p>
               <p>"Oh!" exclaimed Catherine, too enraged to continue. </p>
               <p>"And she loved mine," added he. </p>
               <p>"You little liar! I hate you now!" she panted, and her face grew red with passion. </p>
               <p>"She did! she did!" sang Linton, sinking into the recess of his chair, and leaning
                  back <pb n="II.190" facs="II.198.png"/>his head to enjoy the agitation of the
                  other disputant, who stood behind. </p>
               <p>"Hush, Master Heathcliff!" I said. "That's your father's tale too, I suppose." </p>
               <p>"It isn't. You hold your tongue!" he answered. -- </p>
               <p>"She did! she did, Catherine! She did! she did!" Cathy, beside herself, gave the
                  chair a violent push, and caused him to fall against one arm. He was immediately
                  seized by a suffocating cough that soon ended his triumph. It lasted so long that
                  it frightened even me. As to his cousin, she wept with all her might, aghast at
                  the mischief she had done, though she said nothing. I held him till the fit
                  exhausted itself. Then he thrust me away, and leant his head down silently.
                  Catherine quelled her lamentations also, took a seat opposite, and looked solemnly
                  into the fire. </p>
               <p>"How do you feel now, Master Heathcliff?" I inquired, after waiting ten
                  minutes.</p>
               <pb n="II.191" facs="II.199.png"/>
               <p>"I wish she felt as I do," he replied -- "spiteful, cruel thing! Hareton never
                  touches me; he never struck me in his life. And <pb n="240"/>I was better to-day;
                  and there -- " His voice died in a whimper. </p>
               <p>"I didn't strike you!" muttered Cathy, chewing her lip to prevent another burst of
                  emotion. </p>
               <p>He sighed and moaned like one under great suffering, and kept it up for a quarter
                  of an hour, on purpose to distress his cousin, apparently, for whenever he caught
                  a stifled sob from her he put renewed pain and pathos into the inflections of his
                  voice. </p>
               <p>"I'm sorry I hurt you, Linton," she said at length, racked beyond endurance. "But
                  I couldn't have been hurt by that little push, and I had no idea that you could
                  either. You're not much, are you, Linton? Don't let me go home thinking I've done
                  you harm. Answer! Speak to me!" </p>
               <pb n="II.192" facs="II.200.png"/>
               <p>"I can't speak to you," he murmured. "You've hurt me so that I shall lie awake all
                  night choking with this cough. If you had it you'd know what it was; but you'll be
                  comfortably asleep while I'm in agony, and nobody near me. I wonder how you would
                  like to pass those fearful nights." And he began to wail aloud, for very pity of
                  himself. </p>
               <p>"Since you are in the habit of passing dreadful nights," I said, "it won't be miss
                  who spoils your ease; you'd be the same had she never come. However, she shall not
                  disturb you again; and perhaps you'll get quieter when we leave you." </p>
               <p>"Must I go?" asked Catherine dolefully, bending over him. "Do you want me to go,
                  Linton?" </p>
               <p>"You can't alter what you've done," he replied pettishly, shrinking from her,
                  "unless you alter it for the worse by teasing me into a fever." </p>
               <pb n="II.193" facs="II.201.png"/>
               <p>"Well, then, I must go?" she repeated. </p>
               <p>"Let me alone, at least," said he. "I can't bear your talking." </p>
               <p>She lingered, and resisted my persuasions to departure a tiresome while; but as he
                  neither looked up nor spoke, she finally made a movement to the door, and I
                  followed. We were recalled by a scream. Linton had slid from his seat on to the
                  hearth-stone, and lay writhing in the mere perverseness of an indulged plague of a
                  child, determined to be as grievous and harassing as it can. </p>
               <p>I thoroughly gauged his disposition from his behaviour, and saw at once it would
                  be folly to attempt humouring him. Not so my companion. She ran back in terror,
                  knelt down, and cried, and soothed, and entreated, till he grew quiet from lack of
                  breath, by no means from compunction at distressing her. </p>
               <p>"I shall lift him on to the settle," I said, "and he may roll about as he pleases.
                  We can't stop to watch him. I hope you are satis<pb n="II.194" facs="II.202.png"
                  />fied, Miss Cathy, that you are not the person to benefit him, and that his
                  condition of health is not occasioned by attachment to you. Now, then, there he
                  is! Come away. As soon as he knows there is nobody by to care for his nonsense,
                  he'll be glad to lie still." </p>
               <p>She placed a cushion under his head, and offered him some water. He rejected the
                  latter, and tossed uneasily on the former, as if it were a stone or a block of
                  wood. She tried to put it more comfortably. </p>
               <p>"I can't do with that," he said; "it's not high enough." </p>
               <p>Catherine brought another to lay above it. </p>
               <p>"That's too high," murmured the provoking thing. </p>
               <p>"How must I arrange it, then?" she asked despairingly. </p>
               <p>He twined himself up to her, as she half knelt by the settle, and converted her
                  shoulder into a support. </p>
               <p>"No, that won't do," I said. "You'll be <pb n="II.195" facs="II.203.png"/>content
                  with the cushion, Master Heathcliff. Miss has wasted too much time on you already;
                  we cannot remain five minutes longer." </p>
               <p>"Yes, yes; we can!" replied Cathy. "He's good and patient now. He's beginning to
                  think I shall have far greater misery than he will to-night if I believe he is the
                  worse for my visit, and then I dare not come again. -- Tell the truth about it,
                  Linton; for I mustn't come if I have hurt you." </p>
               <p>"You must come, to cure me," he answered. "You ought to come, because you have
                  hurt me; you know you have extremely. I was not as ill when you entered as I am at
                  present -- was I?" </p>
               <p>"But you've made yourself ill by crying and being in a passion." </p>
               <p>"I didn't do it all," said his cousin. "However, we'll be friends now. And you
                  want me -- you would wish to see me sometimes, really?" </p>
               <p>"I told you I did," he replied impatiently. <pb n="II.196" facs="II.204.png"/>"Sit
                  on the settle and let me lean on your knee. That's as mamma used to do, whole
                  afternoons together. Sit quite still and don't talk; but you may sing a song, if
                  you can sing, or you may say a nice long interesting ballad -- one of those you
                  promised to teach me -- or a story. I'd rather have a ballad, though. Begin." </p>
               <p>Catherine repeated the longest she could remember. The employment pleased both
                  mightily. Linton would have another, and after that another, notwithstanding my
                  strenuous objections; and so they went on until the clock struck twelve, and we
                  heard Hareton in the court, returning for his dinner. </p>
               <p>"And to-morrow, Catherine -- will you be here tomorrow?" asked young Heathcliff,
                  holding her frock as she rose reluctantly. </p>
               <p>"No," I answered, "nor next day neither." She, however, gave a different response
                  evidently, for his forehead cleared as she stooped and whispered in his ear. </p>
               <pb n="II.197" facs="II.205.png"/>
               <p>"You won't go to-morrow, recollect, miss," I commenced, when we were out of the
                  house. "You are not dreaming of it, are you?" </p>
               <p>She smiled. </p>
               <p>"Oh, I'll take good care," I continued. "I'll have that lock mended, and you can
                  escape by no way else." </p>
               <p>"I can get over the wall," she said, laughing. "The Grange is not a prison, Ellen,
                  and you are not my gaoler. And besides, I'm almost seventeen; I'm a woman. And I'm
                  certain Linton would recover quickly if he had me to look after him. I'm older
                  than he is, you know, and wiser -- less childish, am I not? And he'll soon do as I
                  direct him, with some slight coaxing. He's a pretty little darling when he's good.
                  I'd make such a pet of him if he were mine. We should never quarrel, should we,
                  after we were used to each other? Don't you like him, Ellen?" </p>
               <p>"Like him!" I exclaimed. "The worst<pb n="II.198" facs="II.206.png"/>-tempered bit
                  of a sickly slip that ever struggled into its teens. Happily, as Mr. Heathcliff
                  conjectured, he'll not win twenty. I doubt whether he'll see spring, indeed. And
                  small loss to his family whenever he drops off. And lucky it is for us that his
                  father took him: the kinder he was treated, the more tedious and selfish he'd be.
                  I'm glad you have no chance of having him for a husband, Miss Catherine." </p>
               <p>My companion waxed serious at hearing this speech. To speak of his death so
                  regardlessly wounded her feelings. </p>
               <p>"He's younger than I," she answered, after a protracted pause of meditation, "and
                  he ought to live the longest. He will -- he must live as long as I do. He's as
                  strong now as when he first came into the north; I'm positive of that. It's only a
                  cold that ails him -- the same as papa has. You say papa will get better, and why
                  shouldn't he?" </p>
               <pb n="II.199" facs="II.207.png"/>
               <p>"Well, well," I cried, "after all we needn't trouble ourselves; for listen, miss
                  -- and mind I'll keep my word; if you attempt going to Wuthering Heights again,
                  with or without me, I shall inform Mr. Linton; and unless he allow it, the
                  intimacy with your cousin must not be revived." </p>
               <p>"It has been revived," muttered Cathy sulkily. </p>
               <p>"Must not be continued, then," I said. </p>
               <p>"We'll see," was her reply; and she set off at a gallop, leaving me to toil in the
                  rear. </p>
               <p>We both reached home before our dinner-time; my master supposed we had been
                  wandering through the park, and therefore he demanded no explanation of our
                  absence. As soon as I entered I hastened to change my soaked shoes and stockings,
                  but sitting such a while at the Heights had done the mischief. On the succeeding
                  morning I was laid up, and during three weeks I remained incapacitated for
                  attending to my duties -- a calamity <pb n="II.200" facs="II.208.png"/>never
                  experienced prior to that period, and never, I am thankful to say, since. </p>
               <p>My little mistress behaved like an angel in coming to wait on me and cheer my
                  solitude. The confinement brought me exceedingly low -- it is wearisome to a
                  stirring, active body; but few have slighter reasons for complaint than I had. The
                  moment Catherine left Mr. Linton's room she appeared at my bedside. Her day was
                  divided between us; no amusement usurped a minute. She <pb n="244"/>neglected her
                  meals, her studies, and her play, and she was the fondest nurse that ever watched.
                  She must have had a warm heart, when she loved her father so, to give so much to
                  me. </p>
               <p>I said her days were divided between us; but the master retired early, and I
                  generally needed nothing after six o'clock; thus the evening was her own. </p>
               <p>Poor thing! I never considered what she did with herself after tea. And though
                  frequently, when she looked in to bid me good-<pb n="II.201" facs="II.209.png"
                  />night, I remarked a fresh colour in her cheeks and a pinkness over her slender
                  fingers, instead of fancying the hue borrowed from a cold ride across the moors, I
                  laid it to the charge of a hot fire in the library. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="2.10">
               <head>Chapter 2.10</head>
               <pb n="II.202" facs="II.210.png"/>
               <p>At the close of three weeks, I was able to quit my chamber, and move about the
                  house. And on the first occasion of my sitting up in the evening, I asked
                  Catherine to read to me, because my eyes were weak. We were in the library, the
                  master having gone to bed: she consented, rather unwillingly, I fancied; and
                  imagining my sort of books did not suit her, I bid her please herself in the
                  choice of what she perused.</p>
               <p>She selected one of her own favourites, and <pb n="II.203" facs="II.211.png"/>got
                  forward steadily about an hour; then came frequent questions.</p>
               <p>"Ellen, are not you tired ? Hadn't you better lie down now ? You'll be sick,
                  keeping up so long, Ellen."</p>
               <p>"No, no, dear, I'm not tired," I returned, continually. Perceiving me immovable,
                  she essayed another method of showing her dis-relish for her occupation. It
                  changed to yawning, and stretching, and -- </p>
               <p>"Ellen, I'm tired."</p>
               <p>"Give over then and talk," I answered.</p>
               <p>That was worse; she fretted and sighed, and looked at her watch till eight; and
                  finally went to her room, completely over-done with sleep, judging by her peevish,
                  heavy look, and the constant rubbing she inflicted on her eyes.</p>
               <p>The following night she seemed more impatient still; and on the third from
                  recovering my company, she complained of a head-ache, and left me.</p>
               <pb n="II.204" facs="II.212.png"/>
               <p>I thought her conduct odd; and having remained alone a long while, I resolved on
                  going and inquiring whether she were better, and asking her to come and lie on the
                  sofa, instead of upstairs, in the dark.</p>
               <p>No Catherine could I discover upstairs, and none below. The servants affirmed they
                  had not seen her. I listened at Mr. Edgar's <pb n="246"/> door; all was silence. I
                  returned to her apartment, extinguished my candle, and seated myself in the
                  window. </p>
               <p>The moon shone bright; a sprinkling of snow covered the ground, and I reflected
                  that she might possibly have taken it into her head to walk about the garden for
                  refreshment. I did detect a figure creeping along the inner fence of the park, but
                  it was not my young mistress. On its merging into the light I recognized one of
                  the grooms. He stood a considerable period, viewing the carriage-road through the
                  grounds, then started off at a brisk pace, as if he had detected some<pb
                     n="II.205" facs="II.213.png"/>thing, and reappeared presently leading miss's
                  pony; and there she was, just dismounted, and walking by its side. The man took
                  his charge stealthily across the grass towards the stable. Cathy entered by the
                  casement window of the drawing-room, and glided noiselessly up to where I awaited
                  her. She put the door gently to, slipped off her snowy shoes, untied her hat, and
                  was proceeding, unconscious of my espionage, to lay aside her mantle, when I
                  suddenly rose and revealed myself. The surprise petrified her an instant; she
                  uttered an inarticulate exclamation, and stood fixed. </p>
               <p>"My dear Miss Catherine," I began, too vividly impressed by her recent kindness to
                  break into a scold, "where have you been riding out at this hour? And why should
                  you try to deceive me by telling a tale? Where have you been? Speak!" </p>
               <pb n="II.206" facs="II.214.png"/>
               <p>"To the bottom of the park," she stammered. "I didn't tell a tale." </p>
               <p>"And nowhere else?" I demanded. </p>
               <p>"No," was the muttered reply. </p>
               <p>"O Catherine!" I cried sorrowfully. "You know you have been doing wrong, or you
                  wouldn't be driven to uttering an untruth to me. That does grieve me. I'd rather
                  be three months ill than hear you frame a deliberate lie." </p>
               <p>She sprang forward, and bursting into tears, threw her arms round my neck. </p>
               <p>"Well, Ellen, I'm so afraid of you being angry," she said. "Promise not to be
                  angry, and you shall know the very truth. I hate to hide it." </p>
               <p>We sat down in the window-seat. I assured her I would not scold, whatever her
                  secret might be, and I guessed it, of course; so she commenced, -- </p>
               <p>"I've been to Wuthering Heights, Ellen, <pb n="II.207" facs="II.215.png"/>and I've
                  never missed going a day since you fell ill, except thrice before and twice after
                  you left your room. I gave Michael books and pictures to prepare Minny every
                  evening, and to put her back in the stable. You mustn't scold him either, mind. I
                  was at the Heights by half-past six, and generally stayed till half-past eight,
                  and then galloped home. It was not to amuse myself that I went; I was often
                  wretched all the time. Now and then I was happy -- once in a week perhaps. At
                  first I expected there would be sad work persuading you to let me keep my word to
                  Linton, for I had engaged to call again next day when we quitted him; but as you
                  stayed upstairs on the morrow, I escaped that trouble. While Michael was
                  refastening the lock of the park door in the afternoon, I got possession of the
                  key, and told him how my cousin wished me to visit him, because he was sick and
                  couldn't come to the Grange, and how papa would ob<pb n="II.208" facs="II.216.png"
                  />ject to my going; and then I negotiated with him about the pony. He is fond of
                  reading, and he thinks of leaving soon to get married; so he offered, if I would
                  lend him books out of the library, to do what I wished; but I preferred giving him
                  my own, and that satisfied him better. </p>
               <p>"On my second visit Linton seemed in lively spirits, and Zillah (that is their
                  housekeeper) made us a clean room and a good fire, and told us that, as Joseph was
                  out at a prayer-meeting, and Hareton Earnshaw was off with his dogs -- robbing our
                  woods of pheasants, as I heard afterwards -- we might do what we liked. She
                  brought me some warm wine and gingerbread, and appeared exceedingly good-natured;
                  and Linton sat in the arm-chair, and I in the little rocking-chair on the
                  hearth-stone, and we laughed and talked so merrily, and found so much to say. We
                  planned where <pb n="II.209" facs="II.217.png"/>we would go, and what we would do
                  in summer. I needn't repeat that, because you would call it silly. </p>
               <p>"One time, however, we were near quarrelling. He said the pleasantest manner of
                  spending a hot July day was lying from morning till evening on a bank of heath in
                  the middle of the moors, with the bees humming dreamily about among the bloom, and
                  the larks singing high up overhead, and the blue sky and bright sun shining
                  steadily and cloudlessly. That was his most perfect idea of heaven's happiness.
                  Mine was rocking in a rustling green tree, with a west wind blowing, and bright
                  white clouds flitting rapidly above, and not only larks, but throstles, and
                  blackbirds, and linnets, and cuckoos pouring out music on every side, and the
                  moors seen at a distance, broken into cool, dusky dells, but close by great swells
                  of long grass undulating in waves to the breeze, and woods and sounding water, and
                  the whole world awake and <pb n="II.210" facs="II.218.png"/>wild with joy. He
                  wanted all to lie in an ecstasy of peace; I wanted all to sparkle and dance in a
                  glorious jubilee. I said his heaven would be only half alive, and he said mine
                  would be drunk; I said I should fall asleep in his, and he said he could not
                  breathe in mine, and began to grow very snappish. At last we agreed to try both,
                  as soon as the right weather came; and then we kissed each other and were friends. </p>
               <p>"After sitting still an hour, I looked at the great room with its smooth
                  uncarpeted floor, and thought how nice it would be to play in if we removed the
                  table; and I asked Linton to call Zillah in to help us, and we'd have a game at
                  blind-man's buff. She should try to catch us; you used to, you know, Ellen. He
                  wouldn't. There was no pleasure in it, he said. But he consented to play at ball
                  with me. We found two in a cupboard, among a heap of old toys, tops, and hoops,
                  and battledores, and shuttlecocks. One was marked C. and the other <pb n="II.211"
                     facs="II.219.png"/>H. I wished to have the C., because that stood for
                  Catherine, and the H. might be for Heathcliff, his name; but the bran came out of
                  H., and Linton didn't like it. I beat him constantly, and he got cross again, and
                  coughed, and returned to his chair. That night, though, he easily recovered his
                  good-humour. He was charmed with two or three pretty songs -- your songs, Ellen;
                  and when I was obliged to go he begged and entreated me to come the following
                  evening, and I promised. Minny and I went flying home as light as air, and I
                  dreamt of Wuthering Heights and my sweet darling cousin till morning. </p>
               <p>"On the morrow I was sad, partly because you were poorly, and partly that I wished
                  my father knew and approved of my excursions; but it was beautiful moon-light
                  after tea, and as I rode on the gloom cleared. I shall have another happy evening,
                  I <pb n="II.212" facs="II.220.png"/>thought to myself; and, what delights me more,
                  my pretty Linton will. I trotted up their garden, and was turning round to the
                  back, when that fellow Earnshaw met me, took my bridle, and bade me go in by the
                  front entrance. He patted Minny's neck, and said she was a bonny beast, and
                  appeared as if he wanted me to speak to him. I only told him to leave my horse
                  alone, or else it would kick him. He answered in his vulgar accent, 'It wouldn't
                  do mitch hurt if it did,' and surveyed its legs with a smile. I was half inclined
                  to make it try; however, he moved off to open the door, and as he raised the latch
                  he looked up to the inscription above, and said, with a stupid mixture of
                  awkwardness and elation, -- </p>
               <p>" 'Miss Catherine, I can read yon now.' </p>
               <p>" 'Wonderful!' I exclaimed. 'Pray let us hear you; you are grown clever.' </p>
               <pb n="II.213" facs="II.221.png"/>
               <p>"He spelt, and drawled over by syllables, the name, 'Hareton Earnshaw.'</p>
               <p>" 'And the figures?' I cried encouragingly, perceiving that he came to a dead
                  halt. </p>
               <p>" 'I cannot tell them yet,' he answered. </p>
               <p>" 'Oh, you dunce!' I said, laughing heartily at his failure. </p>
               <p>"The fool stared, with a grin hovering about his lips, and a scowl gathering over
                  his eyes, as if uncertain whether he might not join in my mirth -- whether it were
                  not pleasant familiarity, or what it really was, contempt. <pb n="250"/>I settled
                  his doubts by suddenly retrieving my gravity and desiring him to walk away, for I
                  came to see Linton, not him. He reddened -- I saw that by the moonlight -- dropped
                  his hand from the latch, and skulked off, a picture of mortified vanity. He
                  imagined himself to be as accomplished as Linton, I suppose, because he could
                  spell his own name, <pb n="II.214" facs="II.222.png"/>and was marvellously
                  discomfited that I didn't think the same." </p>
               <p>"Stop, Miss Catherine dear!" I interrupted. "I shall not scold, but I don't like
                  your conduct there. If you had remembered that Hareton was your cousin as much as
                  Master Heathcliff, you would have felt how improper it was to behave in that way.
                  At least, it was praiseworthy ambition for him to desire to be as accomplished as
                  Linton, and probably he did not learn merely to show off. You had made him ashamed
                  of his ignorance before, I have no doubt, and he wished to remedy it and please
                  you. To sneer at his imperfect attempt was very bad breeding. Had you been brought
                  up in his circumstances, would you be less rude? He was as quick and as
                  intelligent a child as ever you were, and I'm hurt that he should be despised now,
                  because that base Heathcliff has treated him so unjustly." </p>
               <p>"Well, Ellen, you won't cry about it, will <pb n="II.215" facs="II.223.png"/>you?"
                  she exclaimed, surprised at my earnestness. "But wait, and you shall hear if he
                  conned his A B C to please me, and if it were worth while being civil to the
                  brute. I entered. Linton was lying on the settle, and half got up to welcome me. </p>
               <p>" 'I'm ill to-night, Catherine, love,' he said; 'and you must have all the talk,
                  and let me listen. Come and sit by me. I was sure you wouldn't break your word,
                  and I'll make you promise again before you go.' </p>
               <p>"I knew now that I mustn't tease him, as he was ill; and I spoke softly, and put
                  no questions, and avoided irritating him in any way. I had brought some of my
                  nicest books for him. He asked me to read a little of one, and I was about to
                  comply, when Earnshaw burst the door open, having gathered venom with reflection.
                  He advanced direct to us, seized Linton by the arm, and swung him off the seat. </p>
               <p>" 'Get to thy own room!' he said, in a voice <pb n="II.216" facs="II.224.png"
                  />almost inarticulate with passion; and his face looked swelled and furious. 'Take
                  her there if she comes to see thee; thou shalln't keep me out of this. Begone wi'
                  ye both!' </p>
               <p>"He swore at us, and left Linton no time to answer, nearly throwing him into the
                  kitchen; and he clenched his fist as I followed, seemingly longing to knock me
                  down. I was afraid for a moment, and I let one volume fall; he kicked it after me,
                  and shut us out. I heard a malignant, crackly laugh by the fire, and turning,
                  beheld that odious Joseph standing rubbing his bony hands, and quivering. </p>
               <p>" 'I wer sure he'd sarve ye out! He's a grand lad! He's getten t' raight sperrit
                  in him! He knaws -- ay, he knaws as weel as I do -- who sud be t' maister yonder!
                  Ech, ech, ech! He made ye skift properly! Ech, ech, ech!' </p>
               <p>" 'Where must we go?' I asked of my cousin, disregarding the old wretch's mockery. </p>
               <pb n="II.217" facs="II.225.png"/>
               <p>"Linton was white and trembling. He was not pretty then, Ellen -- oh no! He looked
                  frightful, for his thin face and large eyes were wrought into an expression of
                  frantic, powerless fury. He grasped the handle of the door, and shook it; it was
                  fastened inside. </p>
               <p>" 'If you don't let me in I'll kill you! if you don't let me in I'll kill you!' he
                  rather shrieked than said. 'Devil! devil! I'll kill you! I'll kill you!' </p>
               <p>"Joseph uttered his croaking laugh again. </p>
               <p>" 'Thear, that's t' father!' he cried. 'That's father! We've allas summut o'
                  either side in us. Niver heed, Hareton, lad -- dunnut be 'feared -- he cannot get
                  at thee!' </p>
               <p>"I took hold of Linton's hands and tried to pull him away, but he shrieked so
                  shockingly that I dared not proceed. At last his cries were choked by a dreadful
                  fit of coughing. Blood gushed from his mouth, and he fell on the ground. </p>
               <pb n="II.218" facs="II.226.png"/>
               <p>I ran into the yard, sick with terror, and called for Zillah as loud as I could.
                  She soon heard me. She was milking the cows in a shed behind the barn, and
                  hurrying from her work she inquired what there was to do. I hadn't breath to
                  explain. Dragging her in, I looked about for Linton. Earnshaw had come out to
                  examine the mischief he had caused, and he was then conveying the poor thing
                  upstairs. Zillah and I ascended after him; but he stopped me at the top of the
                  steps, and said I shouldn't go in -- I must go home. I exclaimed that he had
                  killed Linton, and I would enter. Joseph locked the door, and declared I should do
                  'no sich stuff,' and asked me whether I were 'bahn to be as mad as him.' I stood
                  crying till the housekeeper reappeared. She affirmed he would be better in a bit,
                  but he couldn't do with that shrieking and din; and she took me and nearly carried
                  me into the house. </p>
               <pb n="II.219" facs="II.227.png"/>
               <p>"Ellen, I was ready to tear my hair off my head. I sobbed and wept so that my eyes
                  were almost blind; and the ruffian you have such sympathy with stood opposite,
                  presuming every now and then to bid me 'wisht,' and denying that it was his fault;
                  and finally, frightened by my assertions that I would tell papa, and that he
                  should be put in prison and hanged, he commenced blubbering himself, and hurried
                  out to hide his cowardly agitation. Still I was not rid of him. When at length
                  they compelled me to depart, and I had got some hundred yards off the premises, he
                  suddenly issued from the shadow of the roadside, and checked Minny and took hold
                  of me. </p>
               <p>" 'Miss Catherine, I'm ill grieved,' he began, 'but it's rayther too bad -- ' </p>
               <p>"I gave him a cut with my whip, thinking perhaps he would murder me. He let go,
                  thundering one of his horrid curses, and I galloped home more than half out of my
                  senses. </p>
               <pb n="II.220" facs="II.228.png"/>
               <p>"I didn't bid you good-night that evening, and I didn't go to Wuthering Heights
                  the next. I wished to go exceedingly, but I was strangely excited, and dreaded to
                  hear that Linton was dead, sometimes, and sometimes shuddered at the thought of
                  encountering Hareton. </p>
               <p>On the third day I took courage -- at least I couldn't bear longer suspense, and
                  stole off once more. I went at five o'clock, and walked, fancying I might manage
                  to creep into the house and up to Linton's room unobserved. However, the dogs gave
                  notice of my approach. Zillah received me, and saying 'the lad was mending
                  nicely,' showed me into a small, tidy, carpeted apartment, where, to my
                  inexpressible joy, I beheld Linton laid on a little sofa, reading one of my books.
                  But he would neither speak to me nor look at me through a whole hour, Ellen; he
                  has such an unhappy temper. And what quite confounded <pb n="II.221"
                     facs="II.229.png"/>me, when he did open his mouth it was to utter the falsehood
                  that I had occasioned the uproar, and Hareton was not to blame! Unable to reply,
                  except passionately, I got up and walked from the room. He sent after me a faint
                  'Catherine!' He did not reckon on being answered so. But I wouldn't turn back; and
                  the morrow was the second day on which I stayed at home, nearly determined to
                  visit him no more. But it was so miserable going to bed and getting up, and never
                  hearing anything about him, that my resolution melted into air before it was
                  properly formed. It had appeared wrong to take the journey once, now it seemed
                  wrong to refrain. Michael came to ask if he must saddle Minny; I said 'Yes,' and
                  considered myself doing a duty as she bore me over the hills. I was forced to pass
                  the front windows to get to the court; it was no use trying to conceal my
                  presence. </p>
               <pb n="II.222" facs="II.230.png"/>
               <p>" 'Young master is in the house,' said Zillah, as she saw me making for the
                  parlour. I went in. Earnshaw was there also, but he quitted the room directly.
                  Linton sat in the great armchair half asleep. Walking up to the fire, I began in a
                  serious tone, partly meaning it to be true, -- </p>
               <p>" 'As you don't like me, Linton, and as you think I come on purpose to hurt you,
                  and pretend that I do so every time, this is our last meeting. Let us say
                  good-bye; and tell Mr. Heathcliff that you have no wish to see me, and that he
                  mustn't invent any more falsehoods on the subject.' </p>
               <p>" 'Sit down and take your hat off, Catherine,' he answered. 'You are so much
                  happier than I am, you ought to be better. Papa talks enough of my defects and
                  shows enough scorn of me to make it natural I should doubt myself. I doubt whether
                  I am not altogether as worthless as he calls me frequently; and then I feel so
                  cross and bitter, I hate every<pb n="II.223" facs="II.231.png"/>body! I am
                  worthless, and bad in temper, and bad in spirit, almost always, and if you choose
                  you may say good-bye; you'll get rid of an annoyance. Only, Catherine, do me this
                  justice: believe that if I might be as sweet, and as kind, and as good as you are,
                  I would be -- as willingly, and more so, than as happy and as healthy. And believe
                  that your kindness has made me love you deeper than if I deserved your love; and
                  though I couldn't and cannot help showing my nature to you, I regret it and repent
                  it, and shall regret and repent it till I die!' </p>
               <p>"I felt he spoke the truth, and I felt I must forgive him; and though he should
                  quarrel the next moment, I must forgive him again. We were reconciled; but we
                  cried, both of us, the whole time I stayed -- not entirely for sorrow, yet I was
                  sorry Linton had that distorted nature. He'll never let his friends be at ease,
                  and he'll never be at ease himself. I have always gone to his little parlour <pb
                     n="II.224" facs="II.232.png"/>since that night, because his father returned the
                  day after. </p>
               <p>"About three times, I think, we have been merry and hopeful, as we were the first
                  evening; the rest of my visits were dreary and troubled -- now with his
                  selfishness and spite, and now with his sufferings; but I've learned to endure the
                  former with nearly as little resentment as the latter. Mr. Heathcliff purposely
                  avoids me; I have hardly seen him at all. Last Sunday, indeed, coming earlier than
                  usual, I heard him abusing poor Linton cruelly for his conduct of the night
                  before. I can't tell how he knew of it, unless he listened. Linton had certainly
                  behaved provokingly. However, it was the business of nobody but me, and I
                  interrupted Mr. Heathcliff's lecture by entering and telling him so. He burst into
                  a laugh, and went away, saying he was glad I took that view of the matter. Since
                  then I've told Linton he must whisper his bitter things. Now, Ellen, you have
                  heard all. I <pb n="II.225" facs="II.233.png"/>can't be prevented from going to
                  Wuthering Heights except by inflicting misery on two people; whereas, if you'll
                  only not tell papa, my going need disturb the tranquillity of none. You'll not
                  tell, will you? It will be very heartless if you do." </p>
               <p>"I'll make up my mind on that point by to-morrow, Miss Catherine," I replied. "It
                  requires some study; and so I'll leave you to your rest, and go think it over." </p>
               <p>I thought it over aloud, in my master's presence, walking straight from her room
                  to his, and relating the whole story, with the exception of her conversations with
                  her cousin, and any mention of Hareton. Mr. Linton was alarmed and distressed,
                  more than he would acknowledge to me. In the morning Catherine learned my betrayal
                  of her confidence, and she learned also that her secret visits were to end. In
                  vain she wept and writhed against the interdict, and implored her father to have
                     <pb n="II.226" facs="II.234.png"/>pity on Linton. All she got to comfort her
                  was a promise that he would write and give him leave to come to the Grange when he
                  pleased, but explaining that he must no longer expect to see Catherine at
                  Wuthering Heights. Perhaps, had he been aware of his nephew's disposition and
                  state of health, he would have seen fit to withhold even that slight consolation.

               <p>"These things happened last winter, sir," said Mrs. Dean; "hardly more than a year
                  ago. Last winter, I did not think, at another twelve months' end, I should be
                  amusing a stranger to the family with relating them! Yet, who knows how long
                  you'll be a stranger ? You're too young to rest always contented, living by
                  yourself; and I some way fancy, no one could see Catherine Linton, and not love
                  her. You smile; but why do you look so <pb n="II.228" facs="II.236.png"/>lively
                  and interested, when I talk about her -- and why have you asked me to hang her
                  picture over your fireplace? and why -- " </p>
               <p>"Stop, my good friend !" I cried. "It may be very possible that I should love her;
                  but would she love me ? I doubt it too much to venture my tranquillity by running
                  into temptation; and then my home is not here. I'm of the busy world, and to its
                  arms I must return. Go on. Was Catherine obedient to her father's commands ?" </p>
               <p>"She was," continued the housekeeper. "Her affection for him was still the chief
                  sentiment in her heart; and he spoke without anger; he spoke in the deep
                  tenderness of one about to leave his treasure amid perils and foes, where his
                  remembered words would be the only aid that he could bequeath to guide her. </p>
               <p>He said to me, a few days afterwards, </p>
               <p>"I wish my nephew would write, Ellen, or call. Tell me, sincerely, what you think
                  of <pb n="II.229" facs="II.237.png"/>him -- is he changed for the better, or is
                  there a prospect of improvement, as he grows a man ?" </p>
               <p>"He's very delicate, sir," I replied; "and scarcely likely to reach manhood; but
                  this I can say, he does not resemble his father; and if Miss Catherine had the
                  misfortune to marry him, he would not be beyond her control, unless she were
                  extremely and foolishly indulgent. However, master, you'll have plenty of time to
                  get acquainted with him, and see whether he would suit her -- it wants four years
                  and more to his being of age."</p>
               <p>Edgar sighed, and walking to the window, looked out towards Gimmerton Kirk. It was
                  a misty afternoon, but the February sun shone dimly, and we could just distinguish
                  the two fir-trees in the yard, and the sparely scattered gravestones. </p>
               <p>"I've prayed often," he half soliloquized, "for the approach of what is coming,
                  and now I begin to shrink and fear it. I thought <pb n="II.230" facs="II.238.png"
                  />the memory of the hour I came down that glen a bridegroom would be less sweet
                  than the anticipation that I was soon, in a few months, or possibly weeks, to be
                  carried up and laid in its lonely hollow. Ellen, I've been very happy with my
                  little Cathy; through winter nights and summer days she was a living hope at my
                  side. But I've been as happy musing by myself among those stones, under that old
                  church, lying through the long June evenings on the green mound of her mother's
                  grave, and wishing, yearning for the time when I might lie beneath it. What can I
                  do for Cathy? How must I quit her? I'd not care one moment for Linton being
                  Heathcliff's son, nor for his taking her from me, if he could console her for my
                  loss. I'd not care that Heathcliff gained his ends, and triumphed in robbing me of
                  my last blessing. But should Linton be unworthy -- only a feeble tool to his
                  father -- I cannot abandon her to him. And, hard though it be to crush her buoyant
                  spirit, <pb n="II.231" facs="II.239.png"/>I must persevere in making her sad while
                  I live, and leaving her solitary when I die. Darling! I'd rather resign her to
                  God, and lay her in the earth before me." </p>
               <p>"Resign her to God as it is, sir," I answered; "and if we should lose you -- which
                  may He forbid -- under His providence I'll stand her friend and counsellor to the
                  last. Miss Catherine is a good girl; I don't fear that she will go wilfully wrong;
                  and people who do their duty are always finally rewarded." </p>
               <p>Spring advanced, yet my master gathered no real strength, though he resumed his
                  walks in the grounds with his daughter. To her inexperienced notions this itself
                  was a sign of convalescence. And then his cheek was often flushed, and his eyes
                  were bright; she felt sure of his recovery. On her seventeenth birthday he did not
                  visit the churchyard. It was raining, and I observed, -- </p>
               <p>"You'll surely not go out to-night, sir?" <pb n="II.232" facs="II.240.png"/>He
                  answered, -- </p>
               <p>"No, I'll defer it this year a little longer." </p>
               <p>He wrote again to Linton, expressing his great desire to see him; and had the
                  invalid been presentable, I've no doubt his father would have permitted him to
                  come. As it was, being instructed, he returned an answer, intimating that Mr.
                  Heathcliff objected to his calling at the Grange; but his uncle's kind remembrance
                  delighted him, and he hoped to meet him sometimes in his rambles, and personally
                  to petition that his cousin and he might not remain long so utterly divided. </p>
               <p>That part of his letter was simple and probably his own. Heathcliff knew he could
                  plead eloquently for Catherine's company, then. </p>
               <p>"I do not ask," he said, "that she may visit here, but am I never to see her
                  because my father forbids me to go to her home, and you forbid her to come to
                  mine? Do, now and then, ride with her towards the Heights, and <pb n="II.233"
                     facs="II.241.png"/>let us exchange a few words in your presence. We have done
                  nothing to deserve this separation; and you are not angry with me -- you have no
                  reason to dislike me, you allow, yourself. Dear uncle, send me a kind note
                  to-morrow, and leave to join you anywhere you please, except at Thrushcross
                  Grange. I believe an interview would convince you that my father's character is
                  not mine. He affirms I am more your nephew than his son; and though I have faults
                  which render me unworthy of Catherine, she has excused them, and for her sake you
                  should also. You inquire after my health. It is better; but while I remain cut off
                  from all hope, and doomed to solitude or the society of those who never did and
                  never will like me, how can I be cheerful and well?" </p>
               <p>Edgar, though he felt for the boy, could not consent to grant his request, because
                  he could not accompany Catherine. <pb n="II.234" facs="II.242.png"/>He said in
                  summer perhaps they might meet. Meantime he wished him to continue writing at
                  intervals, and engaged to give him what advice and comfort he was able by letter,
                  being well aware of his hard position in his family. </p>
               <p>Linton complied, and had he been unrestrained, would probably have spoiled all by
                  filling his epistles with complaints and lamentations; but his father kept a sharp
                  watch over him, and of course insisted on every line that my master sent being
                  shown. So, instead of penning his peculiar personal sufferings and distresses, the
                  themes constantly uppermost in his thoughts, he harped on the cruel obligation of
                  being held asunder from his friend and love, and gently intimated that Mr. Linton
                  must allow an interview soon, or he should fear he was purposely deceiving him
                  with empty promises. </p>
               <p>Cathy was a powerful ally at home, and <pb n="II.235" facs="II.243.png"/>between
                  them they at length persuaded my master to acquiesce in their having a ride or a
                  walk together about once a week, under my guardianship, and on the moors nearest
                  the Grange -- for June found him still declining. Though he had set aside yearly a
                  portion of his income for my young lady's fortune, he had a natural desire that
                  she might retain -- or at least return in a short time to -- the house of her
                  ancestors; and he considered her only prospect of doing that was by a union with
                  his heir. He had no idea that the latter was failing almost as fast as himself,
                  nor had any one, I believe. No doctor visited the Heights, and no one saw Master
                  Heathcliff to make report of his condition among us. I, for my part, began to
                  fancy my forebodings were false, and that he must be actually rallying, when he
                  mentioned riding and walking on the moors, and seemed so earnest in pursuing his
                  object. I could not picture a father treating a <pb n="II.236" facs="II.244.png"
                  />dying child as tyrannically and wickedly as I afterwards learned Heathcliff had
                  treated him, to compel this apparent eagerness, his efforts redoubling the more
                  imminently his avaricious and unfeeling plans were threatened with defeat by
                  death. </p>

               <p>Summer was already past its prime, when Edgar reluctantly yielded his assent to
                  their entreaties, and Catherine and I set out on our first ride to join her

               <p>It was a close, sultry day; devoid of sunshine, hut with a sky too dappled and
                  hazy to threaten rain; and our place of meeting had been fixed at the guide-stone,
                  by the crossroads. On arriving there, however, a little herd-boy, despatched as a
                  messenger, told us that -- </p>
               <pb n="II.238" facs="II.246.png"/>
               <p>"Maister Linton wer just ut this side th' Heights: and he'd be mitch obleeged to
                  us to gang on a bit further." </p>
               <p>"Then Master Linton has forgot the first injunction of his uncle," I observed: "he
                  bid us keep on the Grange land, and here we are, off at once." </p>
               <p>"Well, we'll turn our horses' heads round, when we reach him," answered my
                  companion, "our excursion shall lie towards home." </p>
               <p>But when we reached him, and that was scarcely a quarter of a mile from his own
                  door, we found he had no horse, and we were forced to dismount, and leave ours to
                  graze. </p>
               <p>He lay on the heath, awaiting our approach, and did not rise till we came within a
                  few yards. Then, he walked so feebly, and looked so pale, that I immediately
                  exclaimed -- </p>
               <p>"Why, Master Heathcliff, you are not fit for enjoying a ramble, this morning. How
                  ill you do look!" </p>
               <p>Catherine surveyed him with grief and as<pb n="II.239" facs="II.247.png"
                  />tonishment; and changed the ejaculation of joy on her lips, to one of alarm; and
                  the congratulation on their long postponed meeting to an anxious inquiry, whether
                  he were worse than usual ? </p>
               <p>"No -- better -- better!" he panted, trembling, and retaining her hand as if he
                  needed its support, while his large blue eyes wandered timidly over her; the
                  hollowness round them transforming to haggard wildness the languid expression they
                  once possessed. </p>
               <p>"But you have been worse," persisted his cousin -- </p>
               <p>"worse than when I saw you last. You are thinner, and -- " </p>
               <p>"I'm tired," he interrupted hurriedly. "It is too hot for walking; let us rest
                  here. And in the morning I often feel sick. Papa says I grow so fast." </p>
               <p>Badly satisfied, Cathy sat down, and he reclined beside her. </p>
               <p>"This is something like your paradise," <pb n="II.240" facs="II.248.png"/>said
                  she, making an effort at cheerfulness. "You recollect the two days we agreed to
                  spend in the place and way each thought pleasantest? This is nearly yours, only
                  there are clouds; but then they are so soft and mellow, it is nicer than sunshine.
                  Next week, if you can, we'll ride down to the Grange Park and try mine." </p>
               <p>Linton did not appear to remember what she talked of, and he had evidently great
                  difficulty in sustaining any kind of conversation. His lack of interest in the
                  subjects she started, and his equal incapacity to contribute to her entertainment,
                  were so obvious that she could not conceal her disappointment. An indefinite
                  alteration had come over his whole person and manner. The pettishness that might
                  be caressed into fondness had yielded to a listless apathy; there was less of the
                  peevish temper of a child which frets and teases on purpose to be soothed, and
                  more of the self-absorbed mo<pb n="II.241" facs="II.249.png"/>roseness of a
                  confirmed invalid, repelling consolation, and ready to regard the good-humoured
                  mirth of others as an insult. Catherine perceived, as well as I did, that he held
                  it rather a punishment than a gratification to endure our company, and she made no
                  scruple of proposing, presently, to depart. That proposal unexpectedly roused
                  Linton from his lethargy, and threw him into a strange state of agitation. He
                  glanced fearfully towards the Heights, begging she would remain another half-hour
                  at least. </p>
               <p>"But I think," said Cathy, "you'd be more comfortable at home than sitting here;
                  and I cannot amuse you to-day, I see, by my tales, and songs, and chatter. You
                  have grown wiser than I in these six months; you have little taste for my
                  diversions now -- or else, if I could amuse you, I'd willingly stay." </p>
               <p>"Stay to rest yourself," he replied. "And, Catherine, don't think or say that I'm
                  very unwell. It is the heavy weather and heat that <pb n="II.242"
                     facs="II.250.png"/>make me dull; and I walked about, before you came, a great
                  deal for me. Tell uncle I'm in tolerable health, will you?" </p>
               <p>"I'll tell him that you say so, Linton. I couldn't affirm that you are," observed
                  my young lady, wondering at his pertinacious assertion of what was evidently an
                  untruth. </p>
               <p>"And be here again next Thursday," continued he, shunning her puzzled gaze. "And
                  give him my thanks for permitting you to come -- my best thanks, Catherine. And --
                  and if you did meet my father, and he asked you about me, don't lead him to
                  suppose that I've been extremely silent and stupid. Don't look sad and downcast,
                  as you are doing; he'll be angry." </p>
               <p>"I care nothing for his anger," exclaimed Cathy, imagining she would be its
                  object. </p>
               <p>"But I do," said her cousin, shuddering. "Don't provoke him against me, Catherine,
                  for he is very hard." </p>
               <p>"Is he severe to you, Master Heathcliff?" <pb n="II.243" facs="II.251.png"/>I
                  inquired. </p>
               <p>"Has he grown weary of indulgence, and passed from passive to active hatred?" </p>
               <p>Linton looked at me, but did not answer; and after keeping her seat by his side
                  another ten minutes, during which his head fell drowsily on his breast, and he
                  uttered nothing except suppressed moans of exhaustion or pain, Cathy began to seek
                  solace in looking for bilberries, and sharing the produce of her researches with
                  me. She did not offer them to him, for she saw further notice would only weary and
                  annoy. </p>
               <p>"Is it half an hour now, Ellen?" she whispered in my ear at last. "I can't tell
                  why we should stay. He's asleep, and papa will be wanting us back." </p>
               <p>"Well, we must not leave him asleep," I answered. </p>
               <p>"Wait till he wakes, and be patient. You were mighty eager to set off, but your
                  longing to see poor Linton has soon evaporated." </p>
               <pb n="II.244" facs="II.252.png"/>
               <p>"Why did he wish to see me?" returned Catherine. </p>
               <p>"In his crossest humours, formerly, I liked him better than I do in his present
                  curious mood. It's just as if it were a task he was compelled to perform -- this
                  interview -- for fear his father should scold him. But I'm hardly going to come to
                  give Mr. Heathcliff pleasure, whatever reason he may have for ordering Linton to
                  undergo this penance. And though I'm glad he's better in health, I'm sorry he's so
                  much less pleasant, and so much less affectionate to me." </p>
               <p>"You think he is better in health, then?" I said. </p>
               <p>"Yes," she answered, "because he always made such a great deal of his sufferings,
                  you know. He is not tolerably well, as he told me to tell papa; but he's better,
                  very likely." </p>
               <p>"There you differ with me, Miss Cathy," I remarked. </p>
               <p>"I should conjecture him to be far worse." </p>
               <p>Linton here started from his slumber in be<pb n="II.245" facs="II.253.png"
                  />wildered terror, and asked if any one had called his name. </p>
               <p>"No," said Catherine, "unless in dreams. I cannot conceive how you manage to doze
                  out of doors, in the morning." </p>
               <p>"I thought I heard my father," he gasped, glancing up to the frowning nab above
                  us. "You are sure nobody spoke?" </p>
               <p>"Quite sure," replied his cousin. "Only Ellen and I were disputing concerning your
                  health. Are you truly stronger, Linton, than when we separated in winter? If you
                  be, I'm certain one thing is not stronger -- your regard for me. Speak! Are you?" </p>
               <p>The tears gushed from Linton's eyes as he answered, </p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, I am!" And still under the spell of the imaginary voice, his gaze
                  wandered up and down to detect its owner. </p>
               <p>Cathy rose. "For to-day we must part," she said. </p>
               <pb n="II.246" facs="II.254.png"/>
               <p>"And I won't conceal that I have been sadly disappointed with our meeting, though
                  I'll mention it to nobody but you -- not that I stand in awe of Mr. Heathcliff." </p>
               <p>"Hush!" murmured Linton; "for God's sake, hush! He's coming." And he clung to
                  Catherine's arm, striving to detain her; but at that announcement she hastily
                  disengaged herself and whistled to Minny, who obeyed her like a dog. </p>
               <p>"I'll be here next Thursday," she cried, springing to the saddle. "Good-bye. --
                  Quick, Ellen!" And so we left him, scarcely conscious of our departure, so
                  absorbed was he in anticipating his father's approach. </p>
               <p>Before we reached home, Catherine's displeasure softened into a perplexed
                  sensation of pity and regret, largely blended with vague, uneasy doubts about
                  Linton's actual circumstances, physical and social, in which I partook, though I
                  counselled her not to say much, <pb n="II.247" facs="II.255.png"/>for a second
                  journey would make us better judges. My master requested an account of our
                  ongoings. His nephew's offering of thanks was duly delivered, Miss Cathy gently
                  touching on the rest. I also threw little light on his inquiries, for I hardly
                  knew what to hide and what to reveal. </p>

               <p>Seven days glided away, every one marking its course by the henceforth rapid
                  alteration of Edgar Linton's state. The havoc that months had previously wrought
                  was now emulated by the inroads of hours.</p>
               <p>Catherine, we would fain have deluded yet, but her own quick spirit refused to
                  delude her. It divined, in secret, and brooded on the dreadful probability,
                  gradually ripening into certainty.</p>
               <p>She had not the heart to mention her ride, <pb n="II.249" facs="II.257.png"/>when
                  Thursday came round; I mentioned it for her, and obtained permission to order her
                  out of doors; for the library, where her father stopped a short time daily -- the
                  brief period he could bear to sit up -- and his chamber, had become her whole
                  world. She grudged each moment that did not find her bending over his pillow, or
                  seated by his side. Her countenance grew wan with watching and sorrow, and my
                  master gladly dismissed her to what he flattered himself would be a happy change
                  of scene and society, drawing comfort from the hope that she would not now be left
                  entirely alone after his death.</p>
               <p>He had a fixed idea, I guessed by several observations he let fall, that as his
                  nephew resembled him in person, he would resemble him in mind; for Linton's
                  letters bore few or no indications of his defective character. And I through
                  pardonable weakness refrained from correcting the error; asking myself what good
                  there would be in disturbing his last mo<pb n="II.250" facs="II.258.png"/>ments
                  with information that he had neither power nor opportunity to turn to account.</p>
               <p>We deferred our excursion till the afternoon; a golden afternoon of August --
                  every breath from the hills so full of life, that it seemed whoever respired it,
                  though dying, might revive. Catherine's face was just like the landscape --
                  shadows and sunshine flitting over it in rapid succession; but the shadows rested
                  longer, and the sunshine was more transient; and her poor little heart reproached
                  itself for even that passing forgetfulness of its cares. </p>
               <p>We discerned Linton watching at the same spot he had selected before. My young
                  mistress alighted, and told me that, as she was resolved to stay a very little
                  while, I had better hold the pony and remain on horse-back; but I dissented. I
                  wouldn't risk losing sight of the charge committed to me a minute, so we climbed
                  the slope of heath together. Master Heathcliff received us with greater <pb
                     n="II.251" facs="II.259.png"/>animation on this occasion -- not the animation
                  of high spirits though, nor yet of joy; it looked more like fear. </p>
               <p>"It is late," he said, speaking short and with difficulty. "Is not your father
                  very ill? I thought you wouldn't come." </p>
               <p>"Why won't you be candid?" cried Catherine, swallowing her greeting. "Why cannot
                  you say at once you don't want me? It is strange, Linton, that for the second time
                  you have brought me here on purpose, apparently, to distress us both, and for no
                  reason besides." </p>
               <p>Linton shivered, and glanced at her, half supplicating, half ashamed; but his
                  cousin's patience was not sufficient to endure this enigmatical behaviour. </p>
               <p>"My father is very ill," she said; "and why am I called from his bedside? Why
                  didn't you send to absolve me from my promise when you wished I wouldn't keep it?
                  Come! I desire an explanation; playing and trifling are completely banished out of
                  my mind, and I <pb n="II.252" facs="II.260.png"/>can't dance attendance on your
                  affectations now!" </p>
               <p>"My affectations!" he murmured; "what are they? For Heaven's sake, Catherine,
                  don't look so angry! Despise me as much as you please. I am a worthless, cowardly
                  wretch -- I can't be scorned enough; but I'm too mean for your anger. Hate my
                  father, and spare me for contempt." </p>
               <p>"Nonsense!" cried Catherine in a passion. "Foolish, silly boy! And there! he
                  trembles, as if I were really going to touch him! You needn't bespeak contempt,
                  Linton; anybody will have it spontaneously at your service. Get off! I shall
                  return home. It is folly dragging you from the hearthstone, and pretending -- what
                  do we pretend? Let go my frock! If I pitied you for crying and looking so very
                  frightened, you should spurn such pity. -- Ellen, tell him how disgraceful this
                  conduct is. -- Rise, and don't degrade yourself into an abject reptile -- don't!" </p>
               <pb n="II.253" facs="II.261.png"/>
               <p>With streaming face and an expression of agony Linton had thrown his nerveless
                  frame along the ground. He seemed convulsed with exquisite terror. </p>
               <p>"Oh!" he sobbed, "I cannot bear it! Catherine, Catherine, I'm a traitor too, and I
                  dare not tell you! But leave me, and I shall be killed! Dear Catherine, my life is
                  in your hands; and you have said you loved me, and if you did, it wouldn't harm
                  you. You'll not go then, kind, sweet, good Catherine? And perhaps you will consent
                  -- and he'll let me die with you!" </p>
               <p>My young lady, on witnessing his intense anguish, stooped to raise him. The old
                  feeling of indulgent tenderness overcame her vexation, and she grew thoroughly
                  moved and alarmed. </p>
               <p>"Consent to what?" she asked. "To stay? Tell me the meaning of this strange talk,
                  and I will. You contradict your own words and distract me. Be calm and frank, and
                  confess <pb n="II.254" facs="II.262.png"/>at once all that weighs on your heart.
                  You wouldn't injure me, Linton, would you? You wouldn't let any enemy hurt me, if
                  you could prevent it? I'll believe you are a coward for yourself, but not a
                  cowardly betrayer of your best friend." </p>
               <p>"But my father threatened me," gasped the boy, clasping his attenuated fingers,
                  "and I dread him -- I dread him! I dare not tell!" </p>
               <p>"Oh, well," said Catherine, with scornful compassion, "keep your secret. I'm no
                  coward. Save yourself. I'm not afraid." </p>
               <p>Her magnanimity provoked his tears. He wept wildly, kissing her supporting hands,
                  and yet could not summon courage to speak out. I was cogitating what the mystery
                  might be, and determined Catherine should never suffer to benefit him or any one
                  else, by my goodwill, when, hearing a rustle among the ling, I looked up and saw
                  Mr. Heathcliff almost close upon us, descending the Heights. He <pb n="II.255"
                     facs="II.263.png"/>didn't cast a glance towards my companions, though they were
                  sufficiently near for Linton's sobs to be audible, but hailing me in the almost
                  hearty tone he assumed to none besides, and the sincerity of which I couldn't
                  avoid doubting, he said, -- </p>
               <p>"It is something to see you so near to my house, Nelly. How are you at the Grange?
                  Let us hear. The rumour goes," he added in a lower tone, "that Edgar Linton is on
                  his deathbed; perhaps they exaggerate his illness?" </p>
               <p>"No. My master is dying," I replied; "it is true enough. A sad thing it will be
                  for us all, but a blessing for him." </p>
               <p>"How long will he last, do you think?" he asked. </p>
               <p>"I don't know," I said. </p>
               <p>"Because," he continued, looking at the two young people, who were fixed under his
                  eye -- Linton appeared as if he could not ven<pb n="II.256" facs="II.264.png"
                  />ture to stir or raise his head, and Catherine could not move on his account --
                  "because that lad yonder seems determined to beat me, and I'd thank his uncle to
                  be quick and go before him. Hullo! has the whelp been playing that game long? I
                  did give him some lessons about snivelling. Is he pretty lively with Miss Linton
                  generally?" </p>
               <p>"Lively? No; he has shown the greatest distress," I answered. "To see him, I
                  should say that, instead of rambling with his sweetheart on the hills, he ought to
                  be in bed, under the hands of a doctor." </p>
               <p>"He shall be in a day or two," muttered Heathcliff. "But first -- Get up, Linton!
                  get up!" he shouted.</p>
               <p>"Don't grovel on the ground there. Up, this moment!" </p>
               <p>Linton had sunk prostrate again in another paroxysm of helpless fear, caused by
                  his father's glance towards him, I suppose; there was nothing else to produce such
                  humiliation. <pb n="II.257" facs="II.265.png"/>He made several efforts to obey,
                  but his little strength was annihilated for the time, and he fell back again with
                  a moan. </p>

               <p>Mr. Heathcliff advanced, and lifted him to lean against a ridge of turf. </p>
               <p>"Now," said he, with curbed ferocity, "I'm getting angry, and if you don't command
                  that paltry spirit of yours -- Damn you! get up directly!" </p>
               <p>"I will, father," he panted. "Only let me alone, or I shall faint. I've done as
                  you wished, I'm sure. Catherine will tell you that I -- that I -- have been
                  cheerful -- Ah! keep by me, Catherine. Give me your hand." </p>
               <p>"Take mine," said his father. "Stand on your feet. There now; she'll lend you her
                  arm. That's right; look at her. -- You would imagine I was the devil himself, Miss
                  Linton, to excite such horror. Be so kind as to walk home with him, will you? He
                  shudders if I touch him." </p>
               <pb n="II.258" facs="II.266.png"/>
               <p>"Linton dear!" whispered Catherine, "I can't go to Wuthering Heights; papa has
                  forbidden me. He'll not harm you. Why are you so afraid?" </p>
               <p>"I can never re-enter that house," he answered. "I'm not to re-enter it without
                  you." </p>
               <p>"Stop!" cried his father. "We'll respect Catherine's filial scruples -- Nelly,
                  take him in, and I'll follow your advice concerning the doctor without delay." </p>
               <p>"You'll do well," replied I. "But I must remain with my mistress; to mind your son
                  is not my business." </p>
               <p>"You are very stiff," said Heathcliff -- "I know that; but you'll force me to
                  pinch the baby and make it scream before it moves your charity. -- Come, then, my
                  hero. Are you willing to return, escorted by me?" </p>
               <p>He approached once more, and made as if he would seize the fragile being; but,
                     shrink<pb n="II.259" facs="II.267.png"/>ing back, Linton clung to his cousin,
                  and implored her to accompany him, with a frantic importunity that admitted no
                  denial. However I disapproved, I couldn't hinder her. Indeed, how could she have
                  refused him herself? What was filling him with dread we had no means of
                  discerning; but there he was, powerless under its gripe, and any addition seemed
                  capable of shocking him into idiocy. We reached the threshold. Catherine walked
                  in, and I stood waiting till she had conducted the invalid to a chair, expecting
                  her out immediately, when Mr. Heathcliff, pushing me forward, exclaimed, -- </p>
               <p>"My house is not stricken with the plague, Nelly, and I have a mind to be
                  hospitable to-day. Sit down, and allow me to shut the door." </p>
               <p>He shut and locked it also. I started. </p>
               <p>"You shall have tea before you go home," he added. "I am by myself. Hareton is
                  gone with some cattle to the Lees, and Zillah <pb n="II.260" facs="II.268.png"
                  />and Joseph are off on a journey of pleasure; and though I'm used to being alone,
                  I'd rather have some interesting company, if I can get it. -- Miss Linton, take
                  your seat by him. I give you what I have; the present is hardly worth accepting,
                  but I have nothing else to offer. It is Linton I mean. How she does stare! It's
                  odd what a savage feeling I have to anything that seems afraid of me. Had I been
                  born where laws are less strict and tastes less dainty, I should treat myself to a
                  slow vivisection of those two as an evening's amusement." </p>
               <p>He drew in his breath, struck the table, and swore to himself, "By hell, I hate
                  them!" </p>
               <p>"I'm not afraid of you!" exclaimed Catherine, who could not hear the latter part
                  of his speech. She stepped close up, her black eyes flashing with passion and
                  resolution. "Give me that key. I will have it!" she <pb n="II.261"
                     facs="II.269.png"/>said. "I wouldn't eat or drink here if I were starving." </p>
               <p>Heathcliff had the key in his hand that remained on the table. He looked up,
                  seized with a sort of surprise at her boldness, or possibly reminded by her voice
                  and glance of the person from whom she had inherited it. She snatched at the
                  instrument, and half succeeded in getting it out of his loosened fingers; but her
                  action recalled him to the present -- he recovered it speedily. </p>
               <p>"Now, Catherine Linton," he said, "stand off, or I shall knock you down, and that
                  will make Mrs. Dean mad." </p>
               <p>Regardless of this warning, she captured his closed hand and its contents again.
                  "We will go!" she repeated, exerting her utmost efforts to cause the iron muscles
                  to relax; and finding that her nails made no impression, she applied her teeth
                  pretty sharply. Heathcliff glanced at me a glance that kept <pb n="II.262"
                     facs="II.270.png"/>me from interfering a moment. Catherine was too intent on
                  his fingers to notice his face. He opened them suddenly, and resigned the object
                  of dispute; but ere she had well secured it, he seized her with the liberated
                  hand, and pulling her on his knee, administered with the other a shower of
                  terrific slaps on both sides of the head, each sufficient to have fulfilled his
                  threat, had she been able to fall. </p>
               <p>At this diabolical violence I rushed on him furiously. "You villain!" I began to
                  cry, "you villain!" A touch on the chest silenced me. I am stout, and soon put out
                  of breath; and what with that and the rage, I staggered dizzily back, and felt
                  ready to suffocate or to burst a blood-vessel. The scene was over in two minutes.
                  Catherine, released, put her two hands to her temples, and looked just as if she
                  were not sure <pb n="II.263" facs="II.271.png"/>whether her ears were off or on.
                  She trembled like a reed, poor thing, and leant against the table perfectly
                  bewildered. </p>
               <p>"I know how to chastise children, you see," said the scoundrel grimly, as he
                  stooped to repossess himself of the key, which had dropped to the floor. "Go to
                  Linton now, as I told you, and cry at your ease. I shall be your father to-morrow
                  -- all the father you'll have in a few days -- and you shall have plenty of that.
                  You can bear plenty; you're no weakling. You shall have a daily taste, if I catch
                  such a devil of a temper in your eyes again!" </p>
               <p>Cathy ran to me instead of Linton, and knelt down and put her burning cheek on my
                  lap, weeping aloud. Her cousin had shrunk into a corner of the settle, as quiet as
                  a mouse, congratulating himself, I dare say, that the correction had lighted on
                  another than him. Mr. Heathcliff, perceiving us all confounded, rose, and
                  expeditiously made the tea himself. <pb n="II.264" facs="II.272.png"/>The cups and
                  saucers were laid ready. He poured it out, and handed me a cup. </p>
               <p>"Wash away your spleen," he said. "And help your own naughty pet and mine. It is
                  not poisoned, though I prepared it. I'm going out to seek your horses." </p>
               <p>Our first thought, on his departure, was to force an exit somewhere. We tried the
                  kitchen door, but that was fastened outside. We looked at the windows; they were
                  too narrow for even Cathy's little figure. </p>
               <p>"Master Linton," I cried, seeing we were regularly imprisoned, "you know what your
                  diabolical father is after, and you shall tell us, or I'll box your ears, as he
                  has done your cousin's." </p>
               <p>"Yes, Linton, you must tell," said Catherine. "It was for your sake I came, and it
                  will be wickedly ungrateful if you refuse." </p>
               <p>"Give me some tea -- I'm thirsty -- and then I'll tell you," he answered. -- "Mrs.
                  Dean, go <pb n="II.265" facs="II.273.png"/>away. I don't like you standing over me
                  -- Now, Catherine, you are letting your tears fall into my cup. I won't drink
                  that. Give me another." </p>
               <p>Catherine pushed another to him, and wiped her face. I felt disgusted at the
                  little wretch's composure, since he was no longer in terror for himself. The
                  anguish he had exhibited on the moor subsided as soon as ever he entered Wuthering
                  Heights, so I guessed he had been menaced with an awful visitation of wrath if he
                  failed in decoying us there; and that accomplished, he had no further immediate
                  fears. </p>
               <p>"Papa wants us to be married," he continued, after sipping some of the liquid.
                  "And he knows your papa wouldn't let us marry now, and he's afraid of my dying if
                  we wait; so we are to be married in the morning, and you are to stay here all
                  night; and if you do as he wishes, you shall return home next day, and take me
                  with you." </p>
               <pb n="II.266" facs="II.274.png"/>
               <p>"Take you with her, pitiful changeling!" I exclaimed. "You marry! Why, the man is
                  mad, or he thinks us fools every one. And do you imagine that beautiful young
                  lady, that healthy, hearty girl, will tie herself to a little perishing monkey
                  like you? Are you cherishing the notion that anybody, let alone Miss <pb n="273"
                  />Catherine Linton, would have you for a husband? You want whipping for bringing
                  us in here at all, with your dastardly puling tricks; and -- don't look so silly
                  now! I've a very good mind to shake you severely for your contemptible treachery
                  and your imbecile conceit." </p>
               <p>I did give him a slight shaking, but it brought on the cough, and he took to his
                  ordinary resource of moaning and weeping, and Catherine rebuked me. </p>
               <p>"Stay all night? No," she said, looking slowly round. "Ellen, I'll burn that door
                  down, but I'll get out." </p>
               <p>And she would have commenced the execu<pb n="II.267" facs="II.275.png"/>tion of
                  her threat directly, but Linton was up in alarm for his dear self again. He
                  clasped her in his two feeble arms, sobbing, -- </p>
               <p>"Won't you have me, and save me? -- not let me come to the Grange? O darling
                  Catherine, you mustn't go and leave, after all! You must obey my father -- you
                  must!" </p>
               <p>"I must obey my own," she replied, "and relieve him from this cruel suspense. The
                  whole night! What would he think? He'll be distressed already. I'll either break
                  or burn a way out of the house. Be quiet! You're in no danger. But if you hinder
                  me -- Linton, I love papa better than you!" </p>
               <p>The mortal terror he felt of Mr. Heathcliff's anger restored to the boy his
                  coward's eloquence. Catherine was near distraught; still she persisted that she
                  must go home, and tried entreaty in her turn, persuading him to subdue his selfish
                  agony. While they were thus occupied, our gaoler re-entered. </p>
               <pb n="II.268" facs="II.276.png"/>
               <p>"Your beasts have trotted off," he said, "and -- Now, Linton! snivelling again?
                  What has she been doing to you? Come, come; have done, and get to bed. In a month
                  or two, my lad, you'll be able to pay her back her present tyrannies with a
                  vigorous hand. You're pining for pure love, are you not? -- nothing else in the
                  world; and she shall have you! There, to bed! Zillah won't be here to-night. You
                  must undress yourself. Hush! hold your noise! Once in your own room, I'll not come
                  near you. You needn't fear. By chance you've managed tolerably. I'll look to the
                  rest." </p>

               <p>He spoke these words, holding the door open for his son to pass; and the latter
                  achieved his exit exactly as a spaniel might which suspected the person who
                  attended on it of designing a spiteful squeeze. The lock was re-secured.
                  Heathcliff approached the fire, where my mistress and I stood silent. Catherine
                  looked up, and instinc<pb n="II.269" facs="II.277.png"/>tively raised her hand to
                  her cheek. His neighbourhood revived a painful sensation. Anybody else would have
                  been incapable of regarding the childish act with sternness, but he scowled on her
                  and muttered, -- </p>
               <p>"Oh! you are not afraid of me? Your courage is well disguised; you seem damnably
                  afraid!" </p>
               <p>"I am afraid now," she replied, "because, if I stay, papa will be miserable; and
                  how can I endure making him miserable when he -- when he -- Mr. Heathcliff, let me
                  go home! I promise to marry Linton; papa would like me to, and I love him. Why
                  should you wish to force me to do what I'll willingly do of myself?" </p>
               <p>"Let him dare to force you!" I cried. "There's law in the land -- thank God there
                  is! -- though we be in an out-of-the-way place. I'd inform if he were my own son.
                  And it's felony, without benefit of clergy." </p>
               <p>"Silence!" said the ruffian. "To the <pb n="II.270" facs="II.278.png"/>devil with
                  your clamour! I don't want you to speak. -- Miss Linton, I shall enjoy myself
                  remarkably in thinking your father will be miserable; I shall not sleep for
                  satisfaction. You could have hit on no surer way of fixing your residence under my
                  roof for the next twenty-four hours than informing me that such an event would
                  follow. As to your promise to marry Linton, I'll take care you shall keep it, for
                  you shall not quit this place till it is fulfilled."</p>
               <p>"Send Ellen, then, to let papa know I'm safe!" exclaimed Catherine, weeping
                  bitterly; "or marry me now. Poor papa! -- Ellen, he'll think we're lost. What
                  shall we do?" </p>
               <p>"Not he! He'll think you are tired of waiting on him, and run off for a little
                  amusement," answered Heathcliff. "You cannot deny that you entered my house of
                  your own accord, in contempt of his injunctions to the contrary. And it is quite
                  natural that you should desire amusement at your age, and that you would weary of
                  nursing a sick man, and <pb n="II.271" facs="II.279.png"/>that man only your
                  father. Catherine, his happiest days were over when your days began. He cursed
                  you, I dare say, for coming into the world (I did, at least), and it would just do
                  if he cursed you as he went out of it. I'd join him. I don't love you. How should
                  I? Weep away. As far as I can see, it will be your chief diversion hereafter,
                  unless Linton make amends for other losses; and your provident parent appears to
                  fancy he may. His letters of advice and consolation entertained me vastly. In his
                  last he recommended my jewel to be careful of his, and kind to her when he got
                  her. Careful and kind -- that's paternal. But Linton requires his whole stock of
                  care and kindness for himself. Linton can play the little tyrant well. He'll
                  undertake to torture any number of cats, if their teeth be drawn and their claws
                  pared. You'll be able to tell his uncle fine tales of his kindness when you get
                  home again, I assure you." </p>
               <p>"You're right there!" I said: "explain <pb n="II.272" facs="II.280.png"/>your
                  son's character; show his resemblance to yourself; and then, I hope, Miss Cathy
                  will think twice before she takes the cockatrice!" </p>
               <p>"I don't much mind speaking of his amiable qualities now," he answered, "because
                  she must either accept him or remain a prisoner, and you along with her, till your
                  master dies. I can detain you both, quite concealed, here. If you doubt, encourage
                  her to retract her word, and you'll have an opportunity of judging." </p>
               <p>"I'll not retract my word," said Catherine. "I'll marry him within this hour, if I
                  may go to Thrushcross Grange afterwards. Mr. Heathcliff, you're a cruel man, but
                  you're not a fiend; and you won't, from mere malice, destroy irrevocably all my
                  happiness. If papa thought I had left him on purpose, and if he died before I
                  returned, could I bear to live? I've given over crying, but I'm going to kneel
                  here at your knee; and I'll not get up, and I'll not take my eyes from your face
                  till you <pb n="II.273" facs="II.281.png"/>look back at me! No, don't turn away --
                  do look! You'll see nothing to provoke you. I don't hate you. I'm not angry that
                  you struck me. Have you never loved anybody in all your life, uncle? never? Ah!
                  you must look once. I'm so wretched, you can't help being sorry and pitying me." </p>
               <p>"Keep your eft's fingers off, and move, or I'll kick you!" cried Heathcliff,
                  brutally repulsing her. "I'd rather be hugged by a snake. How the devil can you
                  dream of fawning on me? I detest you!" </p>
               <p>He shrugged his shoulders, shook himself, indeed, as if his flesh crept with
                  aversion, and thrust back his chair, while I got up and opened my mouth to
                  commence a downright torrent of abuse. But I was rendered dumb in the middle of
                  the first sentence by a threat that I should be shown into a room by myself the
                  very next syllable I uttered. It was growing dark. We heard a sound of voices at
                  the garden gate. Our host hurried <pb n="II.274" facs="II.282.png"/>out instantly.
                  He had his wits about him; we had not. There was a talk of two or three minutes,
                  and he returned alone. </p>
               <p>"I thought it had been your cousin Hareton," I observed to Catherine. "I wish he
                  would arrive. Who knows but he might take our part?" </p>
               <p>"It was three servants sent to seek you from the Grange," said Heathcliff,
                  overhearing me. "You should have opened a lattice and called out; but I could
                  swear that chit is glad you didn't. She's glad to be obliged to stay, I'm
                  certain." </p>
               <p>At learning the chance we had missed we both gave vent to our grief without
                  control, and he allowed us to wail on till nine o'clock. Then he bade us go
                  upstairs, through the kitchen, to Zillah's chamber; and I whispered my companion
                  to obey. Perhaps we might contrive to get through the window there, or into a
                  garret, and out by its skylight. The window, however, was narrow, like those <pb
                     n="II.275" facs="II.283.png"/>below, and the garret trap was safe from our
                  attempts, for we were fastened in as before. We neither of us lay down. Catherine
                  took her station by the lattice, and watched anxiously for morning, a deep sigh
                  being the only answer I could obtain to my frequent entreaties that she would try
                  to rest. I seated myself in a chair, and rocked to and fro, passing harsh judgment
                  on my many derelictions of duty, from which, it struck me then, all the
                  misfortunes of my employers sprang. It was not the case in reality, I am aware,
                  but it was in my imagination that dismal night; and I thought Heathcliff himself
                  less guilty than I. </p>
               <p>At seven o'clock he came and inquired if Miss Linton had risen. She ran to the
                  door immediately, and answered, "Yes." "Here, then," he said, opening it, and
                  pulling her out. <pb n="II.276" facs="II.284.png"/>I rose to follow, but he turned
                  the lock again. I demanded my release. </p>
               <p>"Be patient," he replied. "I'll send up your breakfast in a while." </p>
               <p>I thumped on the panels and rattled the latch angrily, and Catherine asked why I
                  was still shut up? He answered, I must try to endure it another hour; and they
                  went away. I endured it two or three hours. At length I heard a footstep -- not
                  Heathcliff's. </p>
               <p>"I've brought you something to eat," said a voice. "Oppen t' door!" </p>
               <p>Complying eagerly, I beheld Hareton, laden with food enough to last me all day. </p>
               <p>"Tak it," he added, thursting the tray into my hand. </p>
               <p>"Stay one minute," I began. </p>
               <p>"Nay," cried he, and retired, regardless of any prayers I could pour forth to
                  detain him. </p>
               <p>And there I remained enclosed the whole day, and the whole of the next night, and
                     an<pb n="II.277" facs="II.285.png"/>other, and another. Five nights and four
                  days I remained altogether, seeing nobody but Hareton, once every morning; and he
                  was a model of a gaoler -- surly and dumb, and deaf to every attempt at moving his
                  sense of justice or compassion. </p>

               <pb n="II.278" facs="II.286.png"/>
               <p>In the fifth morning, or rather afternoon, a different step approached -- lighter
                  and shorter -- and, this time, the person entered the room. It was Zillah; donned
                  in her scarlet shawl, with a black silk bonnet on her head, and a willow basket
                  swung to her arm. </p>
               <p>"Eh, dear! Mrs. Dean," she exclaimed. "Well! there is a talk about you at
                  Gimmerton. I never thought, but you were sunk in the Blackhorse marsh, and Missy
                  with you, till master told me you'd been found, and he'd <pb n="II.279"
                     facs="II.287.png"/>lodged you here! What, and you must have got on an island,
                  sure ? And how long were you in the hole ? Did master save you, Mrs. Dean ? But
                  you're not so thin -- you've not been so poorly, have you ?" </p>
               <p>"Your master is a true scoundrel!" I replied. "But he shall answer for it. He
                  needn't have raised that tale -- it shall all be laid bare!" </p>
               <p>"What do you mean?" asked Zillah. "It's not his tale -- they tell that in the
                  village -- about your being lost in the marsh; and I calls to Earnshaw, when I
                  come in -- " </p>
               <p>" 'Eh, they's queer things, Mr. Hareton, happened since I went off. It's a sad
                  pity of that likely young lass, and cant Nelly Dean.' </p>
               <p>"He stared. I thought he had not heard aught, so I told him the rumour. </p>
               <p>"The master listened, and he just smiled to himself, and said -- </p>
               <p>"'If they have been in the marsh, they are out now, Zillah. Nelly Dean is lodged,
                  at this <pb n="II.280" facs="II.288.png"/>minute, in your room. You can tell her
                  to flit, when you go up; here is the key. The bog-water got into her head, and she
                  would have run home, quite flighty, but I fixed her, till she came round to her
                  senses. You can bid her go to the Grange, at once, if she be able, and carry a
                  message from me, that her young lady will follow in time to attend the Squire's
                  funeral."' </p>
               <p>"Mr. Edgar is not dead?" I gasped. "O Zillah, Zillah!" </p>
               <p>"No, no. Sit you down, my good mistress," she replied; "you're right sickly yet.
                  He's not dead. Dr. Kenneth thinks he may last another day. I met him on the road
                  and asked." </p>
               <p>Instead of sitting down, I snatched my outdoor things and hastened below, for the
                  way was free. On entering the house I looked about for some one to give
                  information of Catherine. The place was filled with sunshine, and the <pb
                     n="II.281" facs="II.289.png"/>door stood wide open, but nobody seemed at hand.
                  As I hesitated whether to go off at once or return and seek my mistress, a slight
                  cough drew my attention to the hearth. Linton lay on the settle, sole tenant,
                  sucking a stick of sugar-candy, and pursuing my movements with apathetic eyes.
                  "Where is Miss Catherine?" I demanded sternly, supposing I could frighten him into
                  giving intelligence by catching him thus alone. He sucked on like an innocent, </p>
               <p>"Is she gone?" I said. </p>
               <p>"No," he replied; "she's upstairs. She's not to go; we won't let her." </p>
               <p>"You won't let her, little idiot!" I exclaimed. "Direct me to her room
                  immediately, or I'll make you sing out sharply." </p>
               <p>"Papa would make you sing out if you attempted to get there," he answered. "He <pb
                     n="II.282" facs="II.290.png"/>says I'm not to be soft with Catherine. She's my
                  wife, and it's shameful that she should wish to leave me. He says she hates me and
                  wants me to die, that she may have my money. But she shan't have it, and she
                  shan't go home -- she never shall! She may cry and be sick as much as she
                  pleases!" </p>
               <p>He resumed his former occupation, closing his lids as if he meant to drop asleep. </p>
               <p>"Master Heathcliff," I resumed, "have you forgotten all Catherine's kindness to
                  you last winter, when you affirmed you loved her, and when she brought you books
                  and sang you songs, and came many a time through wind and snow to see you? She
                  wept to miss one evening, because you would be disappointed; <pb n="280"/>and you
                  felt then that she was a hundred times too good to you, and now you believe the
                  lies your father tells, though you know he detests you both. And you join him
                  against her. That's fine gratitude, is it not?" </p>
               <pb n="II.283" facs="II.291.png"/>
               <p>The corner of Linton's mouth fell, and he took the sugar-candy from his lips. </p>
               <p>"Did she come to Wuthering Heights because she hated you?" I continued. "Think for
                  yourself! As to your money, she does not even know that you will have any. And you
                  say she's sick, and yet you leave her alone up there in a strange house -- you who
                  have felt what it is to be so neglected! You could pity your own sufferings, and
                  she pitied them too, but you won't pity hers! I shed tears, Master Heathcliff, you
                  see -- an elderly woman, and a servant merely; and you, after pretending such
                  affection and having reason to worship her almost, store every tear you have for
                  yourself, and lie there quite at ease. Ah! you're a heartless, selfish boy!" </p>
               <p>"I can't stay with her," he answered crossly. "I'll not stay by myself. She cries
                  so I can't bear it. And she won't give over, though I say I'll call my father. I
                  did call him once, and he threatened to strangle her if she was <pb n="II.284"
                     facs="II.292.png"/>not quiet; but she began again the instant he left the room,
                  moaning and grieving all night long, though I screamed for vexation that I
                  couldn't sleep." </p>
               <p>"Is Mr. Heathcliff out?" I inquired, perceiving that the wretched creature had no
                  power to sympathize with his cousin's mental tortures. </p>
               <p>"He's in the court," he replied, "talking to Dr. Kenneth, who says uncle is dying,
                  truly, at last. I'm glad, for I shall be master of the Grange after him. Catherine
                  always spoke of it as her house. It isn't hers. It's mine. Papa says everything
                  she has is mine. All her nice books are mine. She offered to give me them, and her
                  pretty birds, and her pony Minny, if I would get the key of our room and let her
                  out; but I told her she had nothing to give -- they were all, all mine. And then
                  she cried, and took a little picture from her neck, and said I should have that --
                  two pictures in a gold case, on one side her mother, <pb n="II.285"
                     facs="II.293.png"/>and on the other, uncle, when they were young. That was
                  yesterday. I said they were mine too, and tried to get them from her. The spiteful
                  thing wouldn't let me; she pushed me off, and hurt me. I shrieked out; that
                  frightens her. She heard papa coming, and she broke the hinges and divided the
                  case, and gave me her mother's portrait. The other she attempted to hide; but papa
                  asked what was the matter, and I explained it. He took the one I had away, and
                  ordered her to resign hers to me. She refused, and he -- he struck her down, and
                  wrenched it off the chain, and crushed it with his foot." </p>
               <p>"And were you pleased to see her struck?" I asked, having my designs in
                  encouraging his talk. </p>
               <p>"I winked," he answered. "I wink to see my father strike a dog or a horse; he does
                  it so hard. Yet I was glad at first. She deserved punishing for pushing me. But
                  when papa was gone she made me come to the window, and <pb n="II.286"
                     facs="II.294.png"/>showed me her cheek cut on the inside, against her teeth,
                  and her mouth filling with blood; and then she gathered up the bits of the
                  picture, and went and sat down with her face to the wall, and she has never spoken
                  to me since, and I sometimes think she can't speak for pain. I don't like to think
                  so; but she's a naughty thing for crying continually, and she looks so pale and
                  wild, I'm afraid of her." </p>
               <p>"And you can get the key if you choose?" I said. </p>
               <p>"Yes, when I am upstairs," he answered. "But I can't walk upstairs now." </p>
               <p>"In what apartment is it?" I asked. </p>
               <p>"Oh," he cried, "I shan't tell you where it is! It is our secret. Nobody, neither
                  Hareton nor Zillah, is to know. There! you've tired me; go away, go away!" And he
                  turned his face on to his arm, and shut his eyes again. </p>
               <p>I considered it best to depart without seeing Mr. Heathcliff, and bring a rescue
                  for my young lady from the Grange. <pb n="II.287" facs="II.295.png"/>On reaching
                  it, the astonishment of my fellow-servants to see me, and their joy also, was
                  intense; and when they heard that their little mistress was safe, two or three
                  were about to hurry up, and shout the news at Mr. Edgar's door; but I bespoke the
                  announcement of it myself. How changed I found him even in those few days! He lay
                  an image of sadness and resignation waiting his death. Very young he looked;
                  though his actual age was thirty-nine, one would have called him ten years
                  younger, at least. He thought of Catherine, for he murmured her name. I touched
                  his hand and spoke. </p>
               <p>"Catherine is coming, dear master," I whispered. </p>
               <p>"She is alive and well, and will be here, I hope, tonight." </p>
               <p>I trembled at the first effects of this intelligence. He half rose up, looked
                  eagerly round the apartment, and then sank back in a swoon. As soon as he
                  recovered I related our com<pb n="II.288" facs="II.296.png"/>pulsory visit and
                  detention at the Heights. I said Heathcliff forced me to go in, which was not
                  quite true. I uttered as little as possible against Linton, nor did I describe all
                  his father's brutal conduct, my intentions being to add no bitterness, if I could
                  help it, to his already overflowing cup. </p>
               <p>He divined that one of his enemy's purposes was to secure the personal property,
                  as well as the estate, to his son, or rather himself; yet why he did not wait till
                  his decease was a puzzle to my master, because ignorant how nearly he and his
                  nephew would quit the world together. However, he felt that his will had better be
                  altered. Instead of leaving Catherine's fortune at her own disposal, he determined
                  to put it in the hands of trustees for her use during life, and for her children,
                  if she had any, after her. By that means it could not fall to Mr. Heathcliff,
                  should Linton die. </p>
               <p>Having received his orders, I dispatched a <pb n="II.289" facs="II.297.png"/>man
                  to fetch the attorney, and four more, provided with serviceable weapons, to demand
                  my young lady of her gaoler. Both parties were delayed very late. The single
                  servant returned first. He said Mr. Green, the lawyer, was out when he arrived at
                  his house, and he had to wait two hours for his re-entrance; and then Mr. Green
                  told him he had a little business in the village, that must be done, but he would
                  be at Thrushcross Grange before morning. The four men came back unaccompanied
                  also. They brought word that Catherine was ill -- too ill to quit her room -- and
                  Heathcliff would not suffer them to see her. I scolded the stupid fellows well for
                  listening to that tale, which I would not carry to my master, resolving to take a
                  whole bevy up to the Heights at daylight, and storm it literally, unless the
                  prisoner were quietly surrendered to us. Her father shall see her, I vowed, and
                  vowed <pb n="II.290" facs="II.298.png"/>again, if that devil be killed on his own
                  door-stones in trying to prevent it! </p>
               <p>Happily I was spared the journey and the trouble. I had gone downstairs at three
                  o'clock to fetch a jug of water, and was passing through the hall with it in my
                  hand, when a sharp knock at the front door made me jump. "Oh! it is Green," I
                  said, recollecting myself -- "only Green"; and I went on, intending to send
                  somebody else to open it; but the knock was repeated, not loud, and still
                  importunately. I put the jug on the banister and hastened to admit him myself. The
                  harvest moon shone clear outside. It was not the attorney. My own sweet little
                  mistress sprang on my neck, sobbing, -- </p>
               <p>"Ellen! Ellen! is papa alive?" </p>
               <p>"Yes!" I cried -- "yes, my angel, he is! God be thanked, you are safe with us
                  again!" </p>
               <p>She wanted to run, breathless as she was, upstairs to Mr. Linton's room, but I
                     com<pb n="II.291" facs="II.299.png"/>pelled her to sit down on a chair, and
                  made her drink, and washed her pale face, chafing it into a faint colour with my
                  apron. Then I said I must go first and tell of her arrival, imploring her to say
                  she should be happy with young Heathcliff. She stared, but soon comprehending why
                  I counselled her to utter the falsehood, she assured me she would not complain. </p>
               <p>I couldn't abide to be present at their meeting. I stood outside the chamber door
                  a quarter of an hour, and hardly ventured near the bed, then. </p>
               <p>All was composed, however. Catherine's despair was as silent as her father's joy.
                  She supported him calmly, in appearance, and he fixed on her features his raised
                  eyes, that seemed dilating with ecstasy. </p>
               <p>He died blissfully, Mr. Lockwood; he died so. Kissing her cheek, he murmured, -- </p>
               <p>"I am going to her; and you, darling child, shall come to us," and never stirred
                  or spoke <pb n="II.292" facs="II.300.png"/>again, but continued that rapt, radiant
                  gaze till his pulse imperceptibly stopped and his soul departed. None could have
                  noticed the exact minute of his death, it was so entirely without a struggle. </p>
               <p>Whether Catherine had spent her tears, or whether the grief were too weighty to
                  let them flow, she sat there dry-eyed till the sun rose; she sat till noon, and
                  would still have remained brooding over that deathbed, but I insisted on her
                  coming away and taking some repose. It was well I succeeded in removing her, for
                  at dinner-time appeared the lawyer, having called at Wuthering Heights to get his
                  instructions how to behave. He had sold himself to Mr. Heathcliff; that was the
                  cause of his delay in obeying my master's summons. Fortunately, no thought of
                  worldly affairs crossed the latter's mind, to disturb him, after his daughter's
                  arrival. </p>
               <p>Mr. Green took upon himself to order <pb n="II.293" facs="II.301.png"/>everything
                  and everybody about the place. He gave all the servants but me notice to quit. He
                  would have carried his delegated authority to the point of insisting that Edgar
                  Linton should not be buried beside his wife, but in the chapel with his family.
                  There was the will, however, to hinder that, and my loud protestations against any
                  infringement of its directions. The funeral was hurried over. Catherine, Mrs.
                  Linton Heathcliff now, was suffered to stay at the Grange till her father's corpse
                  had quitted it. </p>
               <p>She told me that her anguish had at last spurred Linton to incur the risk of
                  liberating her. She heard the men I sent disputing at the door, and she gathered
                  the sense of Heathcliff's answer. It drove her desperate. Linton, who had been
                  conveyed up to the little parlour soon after I left, was terrified into fetching
                  the key before his father reascended. He had the cunning to unlock and relock <pb
                     n="II.294" facs="II.302.png"/>the door, without shutting it; and when he should
                  have gone to bed, he begged to sleep with Hareton, and his petition was granted
                  for once. Catherine stole out before break of day. She dare not try the doors,
                  lest the dogs should raise an alarm. She visited the empty chambers and examined
                  their windows, and luckily lighting on her mother's, she got easily out of its
                  lattice, and on to the ground by means of the fir-tree close by. Her accomplice
                  suffered for his share in the escape, notwithstanding his timid contrivances. </p>

               <pb n="II.295" facs="II.303.png"/>
               <p>The evening after the funeral, my young lady and I were seated in the library; now
                  musing mournfully, one of us despairingly, on our loss, now venturing conjectures
                  as to the gloomy future. </p>
               <p>We had just agreed the best destiny which could await Catherine, would be a
                  permission to continue resident at the Grange, at least during Linton's life: he
                  being allowed to join her there, and I to remain as housekeeper. That seemed
                  rather too favourable an arrange<pb n="II.296" facs="II.304.png"/>ment to be hoped
                  for, and yet I did hope, and began to cheer up under the prospect of retaining my
                  home, and my employment, and, above all, my beloved young mistress, when a servant
                  -- one of the discarded ones, not yet departed -- rushed hastily in, and said,
                  "that devil Heathcliff" was coming through the court: should he fasten the door in
                  his face ? </p>
               <p>If we had been mad enough to order that proceeding, we had not time. He made no
                  ceremony of knocking, or announcing his name; he was master, and availed himself
                  of the master's privilege to walk straight in, without saying a word. </p>
               <p>The sound of our informant's voice directed him to the library: he entered, and
                  motioning him out, shut the door. </p>
               <p>It was the same room into which he had been ushered, as a guest, eighteen years
                  before: the same moon shone through the window; and the same autumn landscape lay
                  outside. We had not yet lighted a candle, <pb n="II.297" facs="II.305.png"/>but
                  all the apartment was visible, even to the portraits on the wall -- the splendid
                  head of Mrs. Linton, and the graceful one of her husband. </p>
               <p>Heathcliff advanced to the hearth. Time had little altered his person either.
                  There was the same man; his dark face rather sallower, and more composed, his
                  frame a stone or two heavier, perhaps, and no other difference. </p>
               <p>Catherine had risen with an impulse to dash out, when she saw him. </p>

               <p>"Stop!" he said, arresting her by the arm. "No more runnings away! Where would you
                  go? I'm come to fetch you home, and I hope you will be a dutiful daughter, and not
                  encourage my son to further disobedience. I was embarrassed how to punish him when
                  I discovered his part in the business -- be's such a cobweb, a pinch would
                  annihilate him -- but you'll see by his look that he has received his due. I
                  brought him down one evening, the day before yesterday, and just set him in <pb
                     n="II.298" facs="II.306.png"/>a chair, and never touched him afterwards. I sent
                  Hareton out, and we had the room to ourselves. In two hours I called Joseph to
                  carry him up again; and since then my presence is as potent on his nerves as a
                  ghost, and I fancy he sees me often, though I am not near. Hareton says he wakes
                  and shrieks in the night by the hour together, and calls you to protect him from
                  me; and whether you like your precious mate or not, you must come. He's your
                  concern now; I yield all my interest in him to you." </p>
               <p>"Why not let Catherine continue here," I pleaded, "and send Master Linton to her?
                  As you hate them both, you'd not miss them. They can only be a daily plague to
                  your unnatural heart." </p>
               <p>"I'm seeking a tenant for the Grange," he answered, </p>
               <p>"and I want my children about me, to be sure. Besides, that lass owes me her
                  services for her bread. I'm not going to nurture her in luxury and idleness after
                  Linton has <pb n="II.299" facs="II.307.png"/>gone. Make haste and get ready now,
                  and don't oblige me to compel you." </p>
               <p>"I shall," said Catherine. "Linton is all I have to love in the world, and though
                  you have done what you could to make him hateful to me, and me to him, you cannot
                  make us hate each other. And I defy you to hurt him when I am by, and I defy you
                  to frighten me." </p>
               <p>"You are a boastful champion," replied Heathcliff, </p>
               <p>"but I don't like you well enough to hurt him; you shall get the full benefit of
                  the torment as long as it lasts. It is not I who will make him hateful to you; it
                  is his own sweet spirit. He's as bitter as gall at your desertion and its
                  consequences. Don't expect thanks for this noble devotion. I heard him draw a
                  pleasant picture to <pb n="288"/>Zillah of what he would do if he were as strong
                  as I. The inclination is there, and his very weakness will sharpen his wits to
                  find a substitute for strength." </p>
               <p>"I know he has a bad nature," said Cathe<pb n="II.300" facs="II.308.png"/>rine;
                  "he's your son. But I'm glad I've a better, to forgive it; and I know he loves me,
                  and for that reason I love him. Mr. Heathcliff, you have nobody to love you; and
                  however miserable you make us, we shall still have the revenge of thinking that
                  your cruelty arises from your greater misery. You are miserable, are you not? --
                  lonely, like the devil, and envious like him? Nobody loves you -- nobody will cry
                  for you when you die. I wouldn't be you." </p>
               <p>Catherine spoke with a kind of dreary triumph. She seemed to have made up her mind
                  to enter into the spirit of her future family, and draw pleasure from the griefs
                  of her enemies. </p>
               <p>"You shall be sorry to be yourself presently," said her father-in-law, "if you
                  stand there another minute. Begone, witch, and get your things!" </p>
               <p>She scornfully withdrew. In her absence I began to beg for Zillah's <pb n="II.301"
                     facs="II.309.png"/>place at the Heights, offering to resign mine to her; but he
                  would suffer it on no account. He bade me be silent; and then, for the first time,
                  allowed himself a glance round the room and a look at the pictures. Having studied
                  Mrs. Linton's, he said, -- </p>
               <p>"I shall have that home -- not because I need it, but -- " He turned abruptly to
                  the fire, and continued, with what, for lack of a better word, I must call a smile
                  -- "I'll tell you what I did yesterday. I got the sexton, who was digging Linton's
                  grave, to remove the earth off her coffin-lid, and I opened it. I thought, once, I
                  would have stayed there. When I saw her face again -- it is hers yet -- he had
                  hard work to stir me; but he said it would change if the air blew on it, and so I
                  struck one side of the coffin loose, and covered it up -- not Linton's side, damn
                  him! I wish he'd been soldered in lead. And I bribed the sexton to pull it away
                  when I'm <pb n="II.302" facs="II.310.png"/>laid there, and slide mine out too.
                  I'll have it made so. And then, by the time Linton gets to us he'll not know which
                  is which." </p>
               <p>"You are very wicked Mr. Heathcliff!" I exclaimed. "Were you not ashamed to
                  disturb the dead?" </p>
               <p>"I disturbed nobody, Nelly," he replied, "and I gave some ease to myself. I shall
                  be a great deal more comfortable now, and you'll have a better chance of keeping
                  me underground when I get there. Disturbed her! No! She has disturbed me, night
                  and day, through eighteen years, incessantly, remorselessly, till yesternight; and
                  yesternight I was tranquil. I dreamt I was sleeping the last sleep by that
                  sleeper, with my heart stopped and my cheek frozen against hers." </p>
               <p>"And if she had been dissolved into earth, or worse, what would you have dreamt of
                  then?" I said. </p>
               <p>"Of dissolving with her, and being more <pb n="II.303" facs="II.311.png"/>happy
                  still," he answered. "Do you suppose I dread any change of that sort? I expected
                  such a transformation on raising the lid, but I'm better pleased that it should
                  not commence till I share it. Besides, unless I had received a distinct impression
                  of her passionless features, that strange feeling would hardly have been removed.
                  It began oddly. You know I was wild after she died, and eternally, from dawn to
                  dawn, praying her to return to me her spirit. I have a strong faith in ghosts; I
                  have a conviction that they can and do exist among us. The day she was buried
                  there came a fall of snow. In the evening I went to the churchyard. It blew bleak
                  as winter; all round was solitary. I didn't fear that her fool of a husband would
                  wander up the den so late, and no one else had business to bring them there. Being
                  alone, and conscious two yards of loose earth was the sole barrier between us, I
                  said to myself, <pb n="II.304" facs="II.312.png"/>'I'll have her in my arms again!
                  If she be cold, I'll think it is this north wind that chills me, and if she be
                  motionless, it is sleep.' I got a spade from the toolhouse, and began to delve
                  with all my might. It scraped the coffin. I fell to work with my hands. The wood
                  commenced cracking about the screws. I was on the point of attaining my object,
                  when it seemed that I heard a sigh from some one above, close at the edge of the
                  grave, and bending down. 'If I can only get this off,' I muttered, 'I wish they
                  may shovel in the earth over us both!' and I wrenched at it more desperately
                  still. There was another sigh close at my ear. I appeared to feel the warm breath
                  of it displacing the sleet-laden wind. I knew no living thing in flesh and blood
                  was by; but as certainly as you perceive the approach to some substantial body in
                  the dark, though it cannot be discerned, so certainly I felt that Cathy was there
                  -- not under me, but on the earth. <pb n="II.305" facs="II.313.png"/>A sudden
                  sense of relief flowed from my heart through every limb. I relinquished my labour
                  of agony, and turned consoled at once, unspeakably consoled. Her presence was with
                  me; it remained while I refilled the grave, and led me home. You may laugh if you
                  will, but I was sure I should see her there. I was sure she was with me, and I
                  could not help talking to her. Having reached the Heights, I rushed eagerly to the
                  door. It was fastened, and, I remember, that accursed Earnshaw and my wife opposed
                  my entrance. I remember stopping to kick the breath out of him, and then hurrying
                  upstairs to my room and hers. I looked round impatiently; I felt her by me; I
                  could almost see her, and yet I could not! I ought to have sweat blood then, from
                  the anguish of my yearning, from the fervour of my supplications to have but one
                  glimpse. I had not one. She showed herself, as she often was in life, a devil to
                  me! And since then, some<pb n="II.306" facs="II.314.png"/>times more and sometimes
                  less, I've been the sport of that intolerable torture -- infernal! keeping my
                  nerves at such a stretch that, if they had not resembled catgut, they would long
                  ago have relaxed to the feebleness of Linton's. When I sat in the house with
                  Hareton it seemed that on going out I should meet her; when I walked on the moors
                  I should meet her coming in; when I went from home I hastened to return. She must
                  be somewhere at the Heights, I was certain. And when I slept in her chamber, I was
                  beaten out of that. I couldn't lie there, for the moment I closed my eyes she was
                  either outside the window, or sliding back the panels, or entering the room, or
                  even resting her darling head on the same pillow as she did when a child, and I
                  must open my lids to see. And so I opened and closed them a hundred times a night,
                  to be always disappointed. It racked me. I've often groaned aloud, till that old
                  rascal Joseph <pb n="II.307" facs="II.315.png"/>no doubt believed that my
                  conscience was playing the fiend inside of me. Now, since I've seen her, I'm
                  pacified -- a little. It was a strange way of killing -- not by inches, but by
                  fractions of hairbreadths -- to beguile me with the spectre of a hope through
                  eighteen years!" </p>
               <p>Mr. Heathcliff paused and wiped his forehead. His hair clung to it, wet with
                  perspiration; his eyes were fixed on the red embers of the fire, the brows not
                  contracted, but raised next the temples, diminishing the grim aspect of his
                  countenance, but imparting a peculiar look of trouble and a painful appearance of
                  mental tension towards one absorbing subject. He only half addressed me, and I
                  maintained silence. I didn't like to hear him talk. After a short period he
                  resumed his meditation on the picture, took it down and leant it against the sofa
                  to contemplate it at better advantage; and while so occupied Catherine <pb
                     n="II.308" facs="II.316.png"/>entered, announcing that she was ready, when her
                  pony should be saddled. </p>
               <p>"Send that over to-morrow," said Heathcliff to me; then turning to her, he added,
                  "You may do without your pony. It is a fine evening, and you'll need no ponies at
                  Wuthering Heights, for what journeys you take your own feet will serve you. Come
                  along." </p>
               <p>"Good-bye, Ellen!" whispered my dear little mistress. As she kissed me, her lips
                  felt like ice. "Come and see me, Ellen; don't forget." </p>
               <p>"Take care you do no such thing, Mrs. Dean!" said her new father. "When I wish to
                  speak to you I'll come here. I want none of your prying at my house." </p>
               <p>He signed her to precede him, and casting back a look that cut my heart, she
                  obeyed. I watched them from the window walk down the garden. Heathcliff fixed
                  Catherine's <pb n="II.309" facs="II.317.png"/>arm under his, though she disputed
                  the act at first evidently, and with rapid strides he hurried her into the alley,
                  whose trees concealed them. </p>

               <p>I have paid a visit to the Heights, but I have not seen her since she left; Joseph
                  held the door in his hand, when I called to ask after her, and wouldn't let me
                  pass. He said Mrs. Linton was "thrang," and the master was not in. Zillah has told
                  me something of the way they go on, otherwise I should hardly know who was dead,
                  and who living. </p>
               <p>She thinks Catherine haughty, and does not like her, I can guess by her talk. My
                  young lady asked some aid of her, when she first <pb n="II.311" facs="II.319.png"
                  />came, but Mr. Heathcliff told her to follow her own business, and let his
                  daughter-in-law look after herself, and Zillah willingly acquiesced, being a
                  narrow-minded selfish woman. Catherine evinced a child's annoyance at this
                  neglect; repaid it with contempt, and thus enlisted my informant among her
                  enemies, as securely as if she had done her some great wrong. </p>
               <p>I had a long talk with Zillah, about six weeks ago, a little before you came, one
                  day, when we foregathered on the moor; and this is what she told me. </p>
               <p>"The first thing Mrs. Linton did," she said, "on her arrival at the Heights, was
                  to run upstairs without even wishing good-evening to me and Joseph; she shut
                  herself into Linton's room, and remained till morning -- then, while the master
                  and Earnshaw were at breakfast, she entered the house and asked all in a quiver if
                  the doctor might be sent for ? her cousin was very ill." </p>
               <pb n="II.312" facs="II.320.png"/>
               <p>"'We know that!' answered Heathcliff, 'but his life is not worth a farthing, and I
                  won't spend a farthing on him.' </p>
               <p>"'But I cannot tell how to do,' she said, 'and if nobody will help me, he'll die!' </p>
               <p>" 'Walk out of the room !' cried the master, 'and let me never hear a word more
                  about him ! None here care what becomes of him. If you do, act the nurse; if you
                  do not, lock him up and leave him.' </p>
               <p>"Then she began to bother me, and I said I'd had enough plague with the tiresome
                  thing. We each had our tasks, and hers was to wait on Linton; Mr. Heathcliff bade
                  me leave that labour to her. </p>
               <p>"How they managed together I can't tell. I fancy he fretted a great deal, and
                  moaned hisseln night and day; and she had precious little rest, one could guess by
                  her white face and heavy eyes. She sometimes came into the kitchen all wildered
                  like, and looked as if she would fain beg assistance. But I was not going <pb
                     n="II.313" facs="II.321.png"/>to disobey the master -- I never dare disobey
                  him, Mrs. Dean; and though I thought it wrong that Kenneth should not be sent for,
                  it was no concern of mine either to advise or complain, and I always refused to
                  meddle. Once or twice, after we had gone to bed, I've happened to open my door
                  again and seen her sitting crying on the stairs' top; and then I've shut myself in
                  quick, for fear of being moved to interfere. I did pity her then, I'm sure; still
                  I didn't wish to lose my place, you know. </p>
               <p>"At last, one night she came boldly into my chamber, and frightened me out of my
                  wits by saying, -- </p>
               <p>" 'Tell Mr. Heathcliff that his son is dying. I'm sure he is, this time. Get up
                  instantly, and tell him.' </p>
               <p>"Having uttered this speech, she vanished again. I lay a quarter of an hour
                  listening and trembling. Nothing stirred -- the house was quiet. </p>
               <pb n="II.314" facs="II.322.png"/>
               <p>"She's mistaken, I said to myself. He's got over it. I needn't disturb them. And I
                  began to doze. But my sleep was marred a second time by a sharp ringing of the
                  bell -- the only bell we have, put up on purpose for Linton; and the master called
                  to me to see what was the matter, and inform them that he wouldn't have that noise
                  repeated. </p>
               <p>"I delivered Catherine's message. He cursed to himself, and in a few minutes came
                  out with a lighted candle, and proceeded to their room. I followed. Mrs.
                  Heathcliff was seated by the bedside with her hands folded on her knees. Her
                  father-in-law went up, held the light to Linton's face, looked at him, and touched
                  him. Afterwards he turned to her. </p>
               <p>" 'Now, Catherine,' he said, 'how do you feel?' </p>
               <p>"She was dumb. </p>
               <p>" 'How do you feel, Catherine?' he repeated. </p>
               <p>" 'He's safe, and I'm free,' she answered. 'I should feel well, but,' she
                  continued, with <pb n="II.315" facs="II.323.png"/>a bitterness she couldn't
                  conceal, 'you have left me so long to struggle against death alone that I feel and
                  see only death. I feel like death.' </p>
               <p>"And she looked like it too. I gave her a little wine. Hareton and Joseph, who had
                  been wakened by the ringing and the sound of feet, and heard our talk from
                  outside, now entered. Joseph was fain, I believe, of the lad's removal; Hareton
                  seemed a thought bothered, though he was more taken up with staring at Catherine
                  than thinking of Linton. But the master bade him get off to bed again; we didn't
                  want his help. He afterwards made Joseph remove the body to his chamber, and told
                  me to return to mine, and Mrs. Heathcliff remained by herself. </p>
               <p>"In the morning he sent me to tell her she must come down to breakfast. She had
                  undressed, and appeared going to sleep, and said she was ill, at which I hardly
                  wondered. I informed Mr. Heathcliff, and he replied, -- </p>
               <pb n="II.316" facs="II.324.png"/>
               <p>" 'Well, let her be till after the funeral, and go up now and then to get her what
                  is needful; and as soon as she seems better, tell me.' " </p>
               <p>Cathy stayed upstairs a fortnight, according to Zillah, who visited her twice a
                  day, and would have been rather more friendly, but her attempts at increasing
                  kindness were proudly and promptly repelled. </p>
               <p>Heathcliff went up once to show her Linton's will. He had bequeathed the whole of
                  his and what had been her movable property to his father. The poor creature was
                  threatened or coaxed into that act during her week's absence when his uncle died.
                  The lands, being a minor, he could not meddle with. However, Mr. Heathcliff has
                  claimed and kept them in his wife's right and his also -- I suppose legally. At
                  any rate, Catherine, destitute of cash and friends, cannot disturb his possession. </p>

               <p>"Nobody," said Zillah, "ever approached <pb n="II.317" facs="II.325.png"/>her
                  door, except that once, but I; and nobody asked anything about her. The first
                  occasion of her coming down into the house was on a Sunday afternoon. She had
                  cried out, when I carried up her dinner, that she couldn't bear any longer being
                  in the cold; and I told her the master was going to Thrushcross Grange, and
                  Earnshaw and I needn't hinder her from descending; so, as soon as she heard
                  Heathcliff's horse trot off, she made her appearance, donned in black, and her
                  yellow curls combed back behind her ears as plain as a Quaker. She couldn't comb
                  them out. </p>
               <p>"Joseph and I generally go to chapel on Sundays." The kirk, you know, has no
                  minister now, explained Mrs. Dean, and they call the Methodists' or Baptists'
                  place (I can't say which it is) at Gimmerton a chapel. </p>
               <p>"Joseph has gone," she continued, "but I thought proper to bide at home. Young
                  folks are always the better for an elder's overlooking; and <pb n="II.318"
                     facs="II.326.png"/>Hareton, with all his bashfulness, isn't a model of nice
                  behaviour. I let him know that his cousin would very likely sit with us, and she
                  had been always used to see the Sabbath respected, so he had as good leave his
                  guns and bits of indoor work alone while she stayed. He coloured up at the news,
                  and cast his eyes over his hands and clothes. The train-oil and gunpowder were
                  shoved out of sight in a minute. I saw he meant to give her his company, and I
                  guessed by his way he wanted to be presentable; so, laughing as I durst not laugh
                  when the master is by, I offered to help him, if he would, and joked at his
                  confusion. He grew sullen, and began to swear. </p>
               <p>"Now, Mrs. Dean," Zillah went on, seeing me not pleased by her manner, "you happen
                  think your young lady too fine for Mr. Hareton, and happen you're right, but I own
                  I should love well to bring her pride a <pb n="II.319" facs="II.327.png"/>peg
                  lower. And what will all her learning and her daintiness do for her now? She's as
                  poor as you or I -- poorer, I'll be bound. You're saving, and I'm doing my little
                  all that road." </p>
               <p>Hareton allowed Zillah to give him her aid, and she flattered him into a good
                  humour. So, when Catherine came, half forgetting her former insults, he tried to
                  make himself agreeable, by the housekeeper's account. </p>
               <p>"Missis walked in," she said, "as chill as an icicle, and as high as a princess. I
                  got up and offered her my seat in the armchair. No, she turned up her nose at my
                  civility. Earnshaw rose too and bade her come to the settle, and sit close by the
                  fire; he was sure she was starved. </p>
               <p>" 'I've been starved a month and more,' she answered, resting on the word as
                  scornful as she could. </p>
               <p>"And she got a chair for herself, and placed it at a distance from both of us.
                  Having sat till she was warm, she began <pb n="II.320" facs="II.328.png"/>to look
                  round, and discovered a number of books in the dresser. She was instantly upon her
                  feet again, stretching to reach them; but they were too high up. Her cousin, after
                  watching her endeavours a while, at last summoned courage to help her. She held
                  her frock, and he filled it with the first that came to hand. </p>
               <p>"That was a great advance for the lad. She didn't thank him, still he felt
                  gratified that she had accepted his assistance, and ventured to stand behind as
                  she examined them, and even to stoop and point out what struck his fancy in
                  certain old pictures which they contained. Nor was he daunted by the saucy style
                  in which she jerked the page from his finger. He contented himself with going a
                  bit farther back, and looking at her instead of the book. She continued reading,
                  or seeking for something to read. His attention became, by degrees, quite centred
                  in the study of her <pb n="II.321" facs="II.329.png"/>thick, silky curls. Her face
                  he couldn't see, and she couldn't see him. And, perhaps not quite awake to what he
                  did, but attracted like a child to a candle, at last he proceeded from staring to
                  touching. He put out his hand and stroked one curl, as gently as if it were a
                  bird. He might have stuck a knife into her neck, she started round in such a
                  taking.</p>
               <p>" 'Get away this moment! How dare you touch me! Why are you stopping there?' she
                  cried in a tone of disgust. 'I can't endure you! I'll go upstairs again if you
                  come near me.' </p>
               <p>"Mr. Hareton recoiled, looking as foolish as he could do. He sat down in the
                  settle very quiet, and she continued turning over her volumes another half-hour.
                  Finally Earnshaw crossed over and whispered to me, -- </p>
               <p>" 'Will you ask her to read to us, Zillah? I'm stalled of doing naught; and I do
                  like -- I could like to hear her. Dunnot say I wanted it, but ask of yourseln.' </p>
               <pb n="II.322" facs="II.330.png"/>
               <p>" 'Mr. Hareton wishes you would read to us, ma'am,' I said immediately. 'He'd take
                  it very kind -- he'd be much obliged.' </p>
               <p>"She frowned, and looking up, answered, -- </p>
               <p>" 'Mr. Hareton and the whole set of you will be good enough to understand that I
                  reject any pretence at kindness you have the hypocrisy to offer! I despise you,
                  and will have nothing to say to any of you! When I would have given my life for
                  one kind word, even to see one of your faces, you all kept off. But I won't
                  complain to you. I'm driven down here by the cold, not either to amuse you or
                  enjoy your society.' </p>
               <p>" 'What could I ha' done?' began Earnshaw. 'How was I to blame?' </p>
               <p>" 'Oh, you are an exception,' answered Mrs. Heathcliff. 'I never missed such a
                  concern as you.' </p>
               <p>" 'But I offered more than once, and asked,' he said, kindling up at her pertness
                  -- 'I asked Mr. Heathcliff to let me wake for you -- ' </p>
               <pb n="II.323" facs="II.331.png"/>
               <p>" 'Be silent! I'll go out of doors, or anywhere, rather than have your
                  disagreeable voice in my ear,' said my lady. </p>
               <p>"Hareton muttered she might go to hell, for him, and unslinging his gun,
                  restrained himself from his Sunday occupations no longer. He talked now freely
                  enough, and she presently saw fit to retreat to her solitude; but the frost had
                  set in, and, in spite of her pride, she was forced to condescend to our company
                  more and more. However, I took care there should be no further scorning at my good
                  nature. Ever since I've been as stiff as herself, and she has no lover or liker
                  among us; and she does not deserve one, for, let them say the least <pb n="298"
                  />word to her, and she'll curl back without respect of any one. She'll snap at the
                  master himself, and as good as dares him to thrash her; and the more hurt she
                  gets, the more venomous she grows." </p>
               <p>At first, on hearing this account from Zillah, I determined to leave my situation,
                  take a cot<pb n="II.324" facs="II.332.png"/>tage, and get Catherine to come and
                  live with me; but Mr. Heathcliff would as soon permit that as he would set up
                  Hareton in an independent house, and I can see no remedy at present, unless she
                  could marry again, and that scheme it does not come within my province to arrange. </p>

               <p>Thus ended Mrs. Dean's story. Notwithstanding the doctor's prophecy, I am rapidly
                  recovering strength; and though it be only the second week in January, I propose
                  getting out on horseback in a day or two, and riding over to Wuthering Heights to
                  inform my landlord that I shall spend the next six months in London; and, if he
                  likes, he may look out for another tenant to take the place after October. I would
                  not pass another winter here for much. </p>

               <p>Yesterday was bright, calm, and frosty. I went to the Heights as I proposed; my
                  housekeeper entreated me to bear a little note from her to her young lady, and I
                  did not refuse, for the worthy woman was not conscious of anything odd in her
                  request. </p>
               <p>The front door stood open, but the jealous gate was fastened, as at my last visit;
                  I knocked and invoked Earnshaw from among the garden beds; he unchained it, and I
                  entered. The fellow is as handsome a rustic as need be seen. <pb n="II.326"
                     facs="II.334.png"/>I took particular notice of him this time; but then, he does
                  his best, apparently, to make the least of his advantages. </p>
               <p>I asked if Mr. Heathcliff were at home ? He answered, no; but he would be in at
                  dinner-time. It was eleven o'clock, and I announced my intention of going in, and
                  waiting for him, at which he immediately flung down his tools and accompanied me,
                  in the office of watchdog, not as a substitute for the host. </p>
               <p>We entered together; Catherine was there, making herself useful in preparing some
                  vegetables for the approaching meal; she looked more sulky and less spirited than
                  when I had seen her first. She hardly raised her eyes to notice me, and continued
                  her employment with the same disregard to common forms of politeness, as before;
                  never returning my bow and good morning by the slightest acknowledgment. </p>
               <p>"She does not seem so amiable," I thought, <pb n="II.327" facs="II.335.png"/>"as
                  Mrs. Dean would persuade me to believe. She's a beauty, it is true; but not an
                  angel." </p>
               <p>Earnshaw surlily bid her remove her things to the kitchen. "Remove them yourself,"
                  she said, pushing them from her, as soon as she had done, and retiring to a stool
                  by the window, where she began to carve figures of birds and beasts, out of the
                  turnip parings in her lap. </p>
               <p>I approached her, pretending to desire a view of the garden; <pb n="300"/>and, as
                  I fancied, adroitly dropped Mrs. Dean's note on to her knee, unnoticed by Hareton;
                  but she asked aloud, "What is that?" and chucked it off. </p>
               <p>"A letter from your old acquaintance, the housekeeper at the Grange," I answered,
                  annoyed at her exposing my kind deed, and fearful lest it should be imagined a
                  missive of my own. She would gladly have gathered it up at this information, but
                  Hareton beat her. He <pb n="II.328" facs="II.336.png"/>seized and put it in his
                  waistcoat, saying Mr. Heathcliff should look at it first. Thereat Catherine
                  silently turned her face from us, and very stealthily drew out her
                  pocket-handkerchief and applied it to her eyes; and her cousin, after struggling a
                  while to keep down his softer feelings, pulled out the letter and flung it on the
                  floor beside her, as ungraciously as he could. Catherine caught and perused it
                  eagerly; then she put a few questions to me concerning the inmates, rational and
                  irrational, of her former home, and gazing towards the hills, murmured in
                  soliloquy, -- </p>
               <p>"I should like to be riding Minny down there! I should like to be climbing up
                  there! Oh! I'm tired -- I'm stalled,Hareton!" And she leant her pretty head back
                  against the sill, with half a yawn and half a sigh, and lapsed into an aspect of
                  abstracted sadness, neither caring nor knowing whether we remarked her. </p>
               <pb n="II.329" facs="II.337.png"/>
               <p>"Mrs. Heathcliff," I said, after sitting some time mute, "you are not aware that I
                  am an acquaintance of yours -- so intimate that I think it strange you won't come
                  and speak to me. My housekeeper never wearies of talking about and praising you,
                  and she'll be greatly disappointed if I return with no news of or from you, except
                  that you received her letter and said nothing." </p>
               <p>She appeared to wonder at this speech, and asked, -- </p>
               <p>"Does Ellen like you?" </p>
               <p>"Yes, very well," I replied hesitatingly. </p>
               <p>"You must tell her," she continued, "that I would answer her letter, but I have no
                  materials for writing -- not even a book from which I might tear a leaf." </p>
               <p>"No books!" I exclaimed. "How do you contrive to live here without them? if I may
                  take the liberty to inquire. Though provided with a large library, I'm frequently
                  very dull <pb n="II.330" facs="II.338.png"/>at the Grange. Take my books away, and
                  I should be desperate." </p>
               <p>"I was always reading when I had them," said Catherine; "and Mr. Heathcliff never
                  reads, so he took it into his head to destroy my books. I have not had a glimpse
                  of one for weeks. Only once I searched through Joseph's store of theology, to his
                  great irritation. -- And once, Hareton, I came upon a secret stock in your room --
                  some Latin and Greek, and some tales and poetry, all old friends. I brought the
                  last here, and you gathered them, as a magpie gathers silver spoons, for the mere
                  love of stealing -- they are of no use to you; or else you concealed them in the
                  bad spirit that as you cannot enjoy them nobody else shall. Perhaps your envy
                  counselled Mr. Heathcliff to rob me of my treasures? But I've most of them written
                  on my brain and printed in my heart, and you cannot deprive me of those." </p>
               <pb n="II.331" facs="II.339.png"/>
               <p>Earnshaw blushed crimson when his cousin made this revelation of his private
                  literary accumulations, and stammered an indignant denial of her accusations. </p>
               <p>"Mr. Hareton is desirous of increasing his amount of knowledge," I said, coming to
                  his rescue. "He is not envious but emulous of your attainments. He'll be a clever
                  scholar in a few years." </p>
               <p>"And he wants me to sink into a dunce meantime," answered Catherine. "Yes, I hear
                  him trying to spell and read to himself, and pretty blunders he makes! -- I wish
                  you would repeat 'Chevy Chase' as you did yesterday; it was extremely funny. I
                  heard you, and I heard you turning over the dictionary to seek out the hard words,
                  and then cursing because you couldn't read their explanations." </p>
               <p>The young man evidently thought it too bad that he should be laughed at for his
                  ignorance, and then laughed at for trying to remove it. I had a similar notion;
                  and re<pb n="II.332" facs="II.340.png"/>membering Mrs. Dean's anecdote of his
                  first attempt at enlightening the darkness in which he had been reared, I
                  observed, -- </p>
               <p>"But, Mrs. Heathcliff, we have each had a commencement, and each stumbled and
                  tottered on the threshold. Had our teachers scorned instead of aiding us, we
                  should stumble and totter yet." </p>
               <p>"Oh!" she replied, "I don't wish to limit his acquirements. Still, he has no right
                  to appropriate what is mine, and make it ridiculous to me with his vile mistakes
                  and mispronunciations. Those books, both prose and verse, are consecrated to me by
                  other associations, and I hate to have them debased and profaned in his mouth.
                  Besides, of all, he has selected my favourite pieces that I love the most to
                  repeat, as if out of deliberate malice." Hareton's chest heaved in silence a
                  minute. He laboured under a severe sense of mortification and wrath, which it was
                  no easy task to suppress. <pb n="II.333" facs="II.341.png"/>I rose, and, from a
                  gentlemanly idea of relieving his embarrassment, took up my station in the
                  doorway, surveying the external prospect as I stood. He followed my example, and
                  left the room, but presently reappeared, bearing half a dozen volumes in his
                  hands, which he threw into Catherine's lap, exclaiming, -- </p>
               <p>"Take them! I never want to hear, or read, or think of them again!" </p>
               <p>"I won't have them now," she answered. "I shall connect them with you, and hate
                  them." </p>
               <p>She opened one that had obviously been often turned over, and read a portion in
                  the drawling tone of a beginner, then laughed and threw it from her. "And listen,"
                  she continued provokingly, commencing a verse of an old ballad in the same
                  fashion. </p>
               <p>But his self-love would endure no further <pb n="II.334" facs="II.342.png"
                  />torment. I heard, and not altogether disapprovingly, a manual check given to her
                  saucy tongue. The little wretch had done her utmost to hurt her cousin's sensitive
                  though uncultivated feelings, and a physical argument was the only mode he had of
                  balancing the account and repaying its effects on the inflictor. He afterwards
                  gathered the books and hurled them on the fire. I read in his countenance what
                  anguish it was to offer that sacrifice to spleen. I fancied that as they consumed
                  he recalled the pleasure they had already imparted and the triumph and
                  ever-increasing pleasure he had anticipated from them, and I fancied I guessed the
                  incitement to his secret studies also. He had been content with daily labour and
                  rough animal enjoyments till Catherine crossed his path. Shame at her scorn, and
                  hope of her approval, were his first prompters to higher pursuits; <pb n="II.335"
                     facs="II.343.png"/>and, instead of guarding him from one and winning him to the
                  other, his endeavours to raise himself had produced just the contrary result. </p>
               <p>"Yes, that's all the good that such a brute as you can get from them!" cried
                  Catherine, sucking her damaged lip, and watching the conflagration with indignant
                  eyes. </p>
               <p>"You'd better hold your tongue now," he answered fiercely. </p>
               <p>And his agitation precluded further speech. He advanced hastily to the entrance,
                  where I made way for him to pass. But ere he had crossed the door-stones, Mr.
                  Heathcliff, coming up the causeway, encountered him, and laying hold of his
                  shoulder, asked, -- </p>
               <p>"What's to do now, my lad?" </p>
               <p>"Naught, naught," he said, and broke away to enjoy his grief and anger in
                  solitude. </p>
               <p>Heathcliff gazed after him and sighed.</p>
               <p>"It will be odd if I thwart myself," he muttered, unconscious that I was behind
                  him. "But when I look for his father in his face, <pb n="II.336" facs="II.344.png"
                  />I find her every day more. How the devil is he so like? I can hardly bear to see
                  him." </p>
               <p>He bent his eyes to the ground, and walked moodily in. There was a restless,
                  anxious expression in his countenance I had never remarked there before, and he
                  looked sparer in person. His daughter-in-law, on perceiving him through the
                  window, immediately escaped to the kitchen, so that I remained alone. </p>
               <p>"I'm glad to see you out of doors again, Mr. Lockwood," he said, in reply to my
                  greeting, "from selfish motives partly. I don't think I could readily supply your
                  loss in this desolation. I've wondered more than once what brought you here." </p>
               <p>"An idle whim, I fear, sir," was my answer, "or else an idle whim is going to
                  spirit me away. I shall set out for London next week, and I must give you warning
                  that I feel no disposition to retain Thrushcross Grange be<pb n="II.337"
                     facs="II.345.png"/>yond the twelve months I agreed to rent it. I believe I
                  shall not live there any more." </p>
               <p>"Oh, indeed; you're tired of being banished from the world, are you?" he said.
                  "But if you be coming to plead off paying for a place you won't occupy, your
                  journey is useless. I never relent in exacting my due from any one." </p>
               <p>"I'm coming to plead off nothing about it," I exclaimed, considerably irritated.
                  "Should you wish it, I'll settle with you now." And I drew my notebook from my
                  pocket. </p>
               <p>"No, no," he replied coolly; "you'll leave sufficient behind to cover your debts
                  if you fail to return. I'm not in such a hurry. Sit down and take your dinner with
                  us. A guest that is safe from repeating his visit can generally be made welcome.
                  -- Catherine, bring the things in. Where are you?" </p>
               <p>Catherine reappeared, bearing a tray of knives and forks. </p>
               <pb n="II.338" facs="II.346.png"/>
               <p>"You may get your dinner with Joseph," muttered Heathcliff aside, "and remain in
                  the kitchen till he is gone." </p>
               <p>She obeyed his directions very punctually; perhaps she had no temptation to
                  transgress. Living among clowns and misanthropists, she probably cannot appreciate
                  a better class of people when she meets them. </p>
               <p>With Mr. Heathcliff, grim and saturnine, on the one hand, and Hareton, absolutely
                  dumb, on the other, I made a somewhat cheerless meal, and bade adieu early. I
                  would have departed by the back way, to get a last glimpse of Catherine and annoy
                  old Joseph; but Hareton received orders to lead up my horse, and my host himself
                  escorted me to the door, so I could not fulfil my wish. </p>
               <p>"How dreary life gets over in that house!" I reflected, while riding down the
                  road. "What a realization of something more romantic than a fairy tale it would
                  have been <pb n="II.339" facs="II.347.png"/>for Mrs. Linton Heathcliff had she and
                  I struck up an attachment, as her good nurse desired, and migrated together into
                  the stirring atmosphere of the town!" </p>

               <head>Chapter 2.18</head>
               <pb n="II.340" facs="II.348.png"/>
               <p>1802. -- This September, I was invited to devastate the moors of a friend, in the
                  North; and, on my journey to his abode, I unexpectedly came within fifteen miles
                  of Gimmerton. The hostler, at a roadside public-house, was holding a pail of water
                  to refresh my horses, when a cart of ven, green oats, newly reaped, passed by, and
                  he remarked -- </p>
               <p>"Yon's frough Gimmerton, nah! They're allas three wick after other folk wi' ther
                  harvest." </p>
               <pb n="II.341" facs="II.349.png"/>
               <p>"Gimmerton ?" I repeated -- my residence in that locality had already grown dim
                  and dreamy. "Ah! I know! How far is it from this?" </p>
               <p>"Happen fourteen mile o'er th' hills, and a rough road," he answered. </p>
               <p>A sudden impulse seized me to visit Thrushcross Grange. It was scarcely noon, and
                  I conceived that I might as well pass the night under my own roof, as in an inn.
                  Besides, I could spare a day easily, to arrange matters with my landlord, and thus
                  save myself the trouble of invading the neighbourhood again. </p>
               <p>Having rested a while, I directed my senant to inquire the way to the village;
                  and, with great fatigue to our beasts, we managed the distance in some three
                  hours. </p>
               <p>I left him there, and proceeded down the valley alone. The grey church looked
                  greyer, and the lonely churchyard lonelier. I distinguished a moor sheep cropping
                  the short turf on the graves. It was sweet, warm weather <pb n="II.342"
                     facs="II.350.png"/>-- too warm for travelling; but the heat did not hinder me
                  from enjoying the delightful scenery above and below; had I seen it nearer August,
                  I'm sure it would have tempted me to waste a month among its solitudes. In winter,
                  nothing more dreary, in summer, nothing more divine, than those glens shut in by
                  hills, and those bluff, bold swells of heath. </p>
               <p>I reached the Grange before sunset, and knocked for admittance; <pb n="306"/>but
                  the family had retreated into the back premises, I judged, by one thin, blue
                  wreath curling from the kitchen chimney, and they did not hear. I rode into the
                  court. Under the porch a girl of nine or ten sat knitting, and an old woman
                  reclined on the house-steps, smoking a meditative pipe. </p>
               <p>"Is Mrs. Dean within?" I demanded of the dame. </p>
               <p>"Mistress Dean? Nay!" she answered, "shoo doesn't bide here; shoo's up at th'
                  Heights." </p>
               <pb n="II.343" facs="II.351.png"/>
               <p>"Are you the housekeeper, then?" I continued. </p>
               <p>"Eea, aw keep th' hause," she replied. </p>
               <p>"Well, I'm Mr. Lockwood, the master. Are there any rooms to lodge me in, I wonder?
                  I wish to stay all night." </p>
               <p>"T'maister!" she cried in astonishment. "Whet! whoiver knew yah wur coming? Yah
                  sud ha' send word. They's nowt norther dry nor mensful abaht t' place, nowt there
                  isn't." </p>
               <p>She threw down her pipe and bustled in; the girl followed, and I entered too. Soon
                  perceiving that her report was true, and, moreover, that I had almost upset her
                  wits by my unwelcome apparition, I bade her be composed. I would go out for a
                  walk, and meantime she must try to prepare a corner of a sitting-room for me to
                  sup in, and a bedroom to sleep in. No sweeping and dusting -- only good fire and
                  dry sheets were necessary. She seemed willing to do her best, though <pb
                     n="II.344" facs="II.352.png"/>she thrust the hearth-brush into the grates in
                  mistake for the poker; and malappropriated several other articles of her craft;
                  but I retired, confiding in her energy for a resting-place against my return.
                  Wuthering Heights was the goal of my proposed excursion. An afterthought brought
                  me back when I had quitted the court. </p>
               <p>"All well at the Heights?" I inquired of the woman. </p>
               <p>"Eea, f'r owt ee knaw," she answered, skurrying away with a pan of hot cinders. </p>
               <p>I would have asked why Mrs. Dean had deserted the Grange, but it was impossible to
                  delay her at such a crisis, so I turned away and made my exit, rambling leisurely
                  along with the glow of a sinking sun behind, and the mild glory of a rising moon
                  in front -- one fading and the other brightening -- as I quitted the park and
                  climbed the stony by-road branching off to Mr. Heathcliff's dwelling. Before I
                  arrived in sight of it, all that re<pb n="II.345" facs="II.353.png"/>mained of day
                  was a beamless amber light along the west; but I could see every pebble on the
                  path, and every blade of grass, by that splendid moon. I had neither to climb the
                  gate nor to knock; it yielded to my hand. That is an improvement, I thought. And I
                  noticed another by the aid of my nostrils -- a fragrance of stocks and wallflowers
                  wafted on the air from amongst the homely fruit-trees. </p>
               <p>Both doors and lattices were open; and yet, as is usually the case in a coal
                  district, a fine, red fire illuminated the chimney. The comfort which the eye
                  derives from it renders the extra heat endurable. But the house of Wuthering
                  Heights is so large that the inmates have plenty of space for withdrawing out of
                  its influence, and accordingly what inmates there were had stationed themselves
                  not far from one of the windows. I could both see them and hear them talk before I
                  entered, and looked and listened in conse<pb n="II.346" facs="II.354.png"/>quence,
                  being moved thereto by a mingled sense of curiosity and envy that grew as I
                  lingered. </p>
               <p>"Con-trary!" said a voice as sweet as a silver bell. </p>
               <p>"That for the third time, you dunce! I'm not going to tell you again. Recollect,
                  or I'll pull your hair." </p>
               <p>"Contrary, then," answered another, in deep but softened tones. "And now, kiss me
                  for minding so well." </p>
               <p>"No; read it over first correctly, without a single mistake." </p>
               <p>The male speaker began to read. He was a young man respectably dressed and seated
                  at a table, having a book before him. His handsome features glowed with pleasure,
                  and his eyes kept impatiently wandering from the page to a small white hand over
                  his shoulder, which recalled him by a smart slap on the cheek whenever its owner
                  detected such signs of inattention. Its owner stood behind, her light, shining <pb
                     n="II.347" facs="II.355.png"/>ringlets blending at intervals with his brown
                  locks, as she bent to superintend his studies; and her face -- it was lucky he
                  could not see her face, or he would never have been so steady. I could, and I bit
                  my lip in spite at having thrown away the chance I might have had of doing
                  something besides staring at its smiting beauty. </p>
               <p>The task was done -- not free from further blunders; but the pupil claimed a
                  reward, and received at least five kisses, which, however, he generously returned.
                  Then they came to the door, and from their conversation I judged they were about
                  to issue out and have a walk on the moors. I supposed I should be condemned in
                  Hareton Earnshaw's heart, if not by his mouth, to the lowest pit in the infernal
                  regions if I showed my unfortunate person in his neighbourhood then; and feeling
                  very mean and malignant, I skulked round to seek refuge in the kitchen. There was
                  unobstructed admittance on that <pb n="II.348" facs="II.356.png"/>side also, and
                  at the door sat my old friend Nelly Dean, sewing and singing a song, which was
                  often interrupted from within by harsh words of scorn and intolerance, uttered in
                  far from musical accents. </p>
               <p>"I'd rayther, by th' haulf, hev 'em swearing i' my lugs froh morn to neeght nor
                  hearken ye hahsiver!" said the tenant of the kitchen, in answer to an unheard
                  speech of Nelly's. "It's a blazing shame that I cannot oppen t' blessed Book but
                  yah set up them glories to Sattan, and all t' flaysome wickednesses that iver were
                  born into th' warld! Oh! ye're a raight nowt, and shoo's another, and that poor
                  lad'll be lost atween ye. Poor lad!" he added, with a groan; "he's witched, I'm
                  sartin on't! O Lord, judge 'em, for there's norther law nor justice among wer
                  rullers!" </p>
               <p>"No, or we should be sitting in flaming fagots, I suppose," retorted the singer.
                  "But wisht, old man, and read your Bible like a <pb n="II.349" facs="II.357.png"
                  />Christian, and never mind me. This is 'Fairy Annie's Wedding' -- a bonny tune;
                  it goes to a dance." </p>
               <p>Mrs. Dean was about to recommence when I advanced; and recognizing me directly,
                  she jumped to her feet, crying, -- </p>
               <p>"Why, bless you, Mr. Lockwood! How could you think of returning in this way? All's
                  shut up at Thrushcross Grange. You should have given us notice." </p>
               <p>"I've arranged to be accommodated there for as long as I shall stay," I answered.
                  "I depart again tomorrow. And how are you transplanted here, Mrs. Dean? Tell me
                  that." </p>
               <p>"Zillah left, and Mr. Heathcliff wished me to come, soon after you went to London,
                  and stay till you returned. But step in, pray. Have you walked from Gimmerton this
                  evening?" </p>
               <p>"From the Grange," I replied. "And while they make me lodging room there, I want
                  to finish my business with your master, because <pb n="II.350" facs="II.358.png"
                  />I don't think of having another opportunity in a hurry." </p>
               <p>"What business, sir?" said Nelly, conducting me into the house. "He's gone out at
                  present, and won't return soon." </p>
               <p>"About the rent," I answered. </p>
               <p>"Oh! then it is with Mrs. Heathcliff you must settle," she observed, "or rather
                  with me. She has not learned to manage her affairs yet, and I act for her; there's
                  nobody else." </p>
               <p>I looked surprised. </p>
               <p>"Ah! you have not heard of Heathcliff's death, I see," she continued. </p>
               <p>"Heathcliff dead!" I exclaimed, astonished. "How long ago?" </p>
               <p>"Three months since. But sit down, and let me take your hat, and I'll tell you all
                  about it. Stop; you have had nothing to eat, have you?" </p>
               <p>"I want nothing; I have ordered supper at home. You sit down too. I never dreamt
                  of his dying. Let me hear how it came to pass. <pb n="II.351" facs="II.359.png"
                  />You say you don't expect them back for some time -- the young people?" </p>
               <p>"No. I have to scold them every evening for their late rambles, but they don't
                  care for me. At least have a drink of our old ale; it will do you good; you seem
                  weary." </p>
               <p>She hastened to fetch it before I could refuse, and I heard Joseph asking whether
                  "it warn't a crying scandal that she should have followers at her time of life.
                  And then, to get them jocks out o' t' maister's cellar! He fair shaamed to 'bide
                  still and see it." </p>
               <p>She did not stay to retaliate, but re-entered in a minute, bearing a reaming
                  silver pint, whose contents I lauded with becoming earnestness. And afterwards she
                  furnished me with the sequel of Heathcliff's history. He had a "queer" end, as she
                  expressed it. </p>

               <p>I was summoned to Wuthering Heights within a fortnight of your leaving us, she
                  said, and I obeyed joyfully, for Catherine's sake. <pb n="II.352"
                     facs="II.360.png"/>My first interview with her grieved and shocked me -- she
                  had altered so much since our separation. Mr. Heathcliff did not explain his
                  reasons for taking a new mind about my coming here; he only told me he wanted me,
                  and he was tired of seeing Catherine. I must make the little parlour my
                  sitting-room, and keep her with me. It was enough if he were obliged to see her
                  once or twice a day. She seemed pleased at this arrangement; and by degrees I
                  smuggled over a great number of books and other articles that had formed her
                  amusement at the Grange, and flattered myself we should get on in tolerable
                  comfort. The delusion did not last long. Catherine, contented at first, in a brief
                  space grew irritable and restless. For one thing, she was forbidden to move out of
                  the garden, and it fretted her sadly to be confined to its narrow bounds as spring
                  drew on; for another, in following the house I was forced to quit her <pb
                     n="II.353" facs="II.361.png"/>frequently, and she complained of loneliness. She
                  preferred quarrelling with Joseph in the kitchen to sitting at peace in her
                  solitude. I did not mind their skirmishes; but Hareton was often obliged to seek
                  the kitchen also .when the master wanted to have the house to himself; and though
                  in the beginning she either left it at his approach, or quietly joined in my
                  occupations, and shunned remarking or addressing him, and though he was always as
                  sullen and silent as possible, after a while she changed her behaviour and became
                  incapable of letting him alone, talking at him, commenting on his stupidity and
                  idleness, expressing her wonder how he could endure the life he lived, how he
                  could sit a whole evening staring into the fire and dozing. </p>
               <p>"He's just like a dog, is he not, Ellen?" she once observed, "or a cart-horse? He
                  does his work, eats his food, and sleeps eternally. What a blank, dreary mind he
                  must have! -- Do <pb n="II.354" facs="II.362.png"/>you ever dream, Hareton? And if
                  you do, what is it about? But you can't speak to me!" </p>
               <p>Then she looked at him, but he would neither open his mouth nor look again. </p>
               <p>"He's perhaps dreaming now," she continued. "He twitched his shoulder as Juno
                  twitches hers. Ask him, Ellen." </p>
               <p>"Mr. Hareton will ask the master to send you upstairs, if you don't behave," I
                  said. He had not only twitched his shoulder but clenched his fist, as if tempted
                  to use it. </p>
               <p>"I know why Hareton never speaks when I am in the kitchen," she exclaimed on
                  another occasion. "He is afraid I shall laugh at him. Ellen, what do you think? He
                  began to teach himself to read once, and because I laughed he burned his books and
                  dropped it. Was he not a fool?" </p>
               <p>"Were not you naughty?" I said. "Answer me that." </p>
               <p>"Perhaps I was," she went on, "but I did <pb n="II.355" facs="II.363.png"/>not
                  expect him to be so silly -- Hareton, if I gave you a book, would you take it now?
                  I'll try." </p>
               <p>She placed one she had been perusing on his hand. He flung it off, and muttered,
                  if she did not give over he would break her neck. </p>
               <p>"Well, I shall put it here," she said -- "in the table drawer; and I'm going to
                  bed." </p>
               <p>Then she whispered me to watch whether he touched it, and departed. But he would
                  not come near it; and so I informed her in the morning, to her great
                  disappointment. I saw she was sorry for his persevering sulkiness and indolence.
                  Her conscience reproved her for frightening him off improving himself. She had
                  done it effectually. But her ingenuity was at work to remedy the injury. While I
                  ironed or pursued other such stationary employments as I could not well do in the
                  parlour, she would bring some pleasant volume and read it aloud to me. When
                  Hareton was there she generally paused in an in<pb n="II.356" facs="II.364.png"
                  />teresting part and left the book lying about -- that she did repeatedly; but he
                  was as obstinate as a mule, and, instead of snatching at her bait, in wet weather
                  he took to smoking with Joseph; and they sat like automatons, one on each side of
                  the fire, the elder happily too deaf to understand her wicked nonsense, as he
                  would have called it, the younger doing his best to seem to disregard it. On fine
                  evenings the latter followed his shooting expeditions, and Catherine yawned and
                  sighed, and teased me to talk to her, and ran off into the court or garden the
                  moment I began, and as a last resource cried and said she was tired of living --
                  her life was useless. </p>
               <p>Mr. Heathcliff, who grew more and more disinclined to society, had almost banished
                  Earnshaw from his apartment. Owing to an accident at the commencement of March, he
                  became for some days a fixture in the kitchen. His gun burst while out on the
                  hills by himself; a splinter cut his arm, and he lost a good <pb n="II.357"
                     facs="II.365.png"/>deal of blood before he could reach home. The consequence
                  was that, perforce, he was condemned to the fireside and tranquillity till he made
                  it up again. It suited Catherine to have him there. At any rate, it made her hate
                  her room upstairs more than ever; and she would compel me to find out business
                  below, that she might accompany me. </p>
               <p>On Easter Monday Joseph went to Gimmerton fair with some cattle, and in the
                  afternoon I was busy getting up linen in the kitchen. Earnshaw sat, morose as
                  usual, at the chimney-corner, and my little mistress was beguiling an idle hour
                  with drawing pictures on the window panes, varying her amusement by smothered
                  bursts of songs, and whispered ejaculations, and quick glances of annoyance and
                  impatience in the direction of her cousin, who steadfastly smoked, and looked into
                  the grate. At a notice that I could do with her no longer intercepting my light,
                  she removed to <pb n="II.358" facs="II.366.png"/>the hearthstone. I bestowed
                  little attention on her proceedings, but presently I heard her begin, -- </p>
               <p>"I've found out, Hareton, that I want -- that I'm glad -- that I should like you
                  to be my cousin now, if you had not grown so cross to me and so rough." </p>
               <p>Hareton returned no answer. </p>
               <p>"Hareton, Hareton, Hareton! do you hear?" she continued. </p>
               <p>"Get off wi' ye!" he growled, with uncompromising gruffness. </p>
               <p>"Let me take that pipe," she said, cautiously advancing her hand and abstracting
                  it from his mouth. Before he could attempt to recover it, it was broken and behind
                  the fire. He swore at her and seized another. </p>
               <p>"Stop," she cried; "you must listen to me first; and I can't speak while those
                  clouds are floating in my face." </p>
               <pb n="II.359" facs="II.367.png"/>
               <p>"Will you go to the devil" he exclaimed ferociously, </p>
               <p>"and let me be!" </p>
               <p>"No," she persisted, "I won't. I can't tell what to do to make you talk to me, and
                  you are determined not to understand. When I call you stupid, I don't mean
                  anything. I don't mean that I despise you. Come, you shall take notice of me,
                  Hareton. You are my cousin, and you shall own me." </p>
               <p>"I shall have naught to do wi' you and your mucky pride, and your damned mocking
                  tricks!" he answered.</p>
               <p>"I'll go to hell, body and soul, before I look sideways after you again. Side out
                  o' t' gate now, this minute!" </p>
               <p>Catherine frowned and retreated to the window-seat chewing her lip, and
                  endeavouring, by humming an eccentric tune, to conceal a growing tendency to sob. </p>
               <p>"You should be friends with your cousin, Mr. Hareton," I interrupted, "since she
                  repents of her sauciness. It would do you a great deal <pb n="II.360"
                     facs="II.368.png"/>of good; it would make you another man to have her for a
                  companion." </p>
               <p>"A companion!" he cried, "when she hates me, and does not think me fit to wipe her
                  shoon! Nay! if it made me a king, I'd not be scorned for seeking her good-will any
                  more." </p>
               <p>"It is not I who hate you; it is you who hate me!" wept Cathy, no longer
                  disguising her trouble. "You hate me as much as Mr. Heathcliff does, and more." </p>
               <p>"You're a damned liar," began Earnshaw. "Why have I made him angry by taking your
                  part, then, a hundred times, and that when you sneered at and despised me, and --
                  Go on plaguing me, and I'll step in yonder and say you worried me out of the
                  kitchen." </p>
               <p>"I didn't know you took my part," she answered, drying her eyes, "and I was
                  miserable and bitter at everybody; but now I thank you, and beg you to forgive me.
                  What can I do besides?" </p>
               <p>She returned to the hearth, and frankly extended her hand. <pb n="II.361"
                     facs="II.369.png"/>He blackened and scowled like a thundercloud, and kept his
                  fists resolutely clenched, and his gaze fixed on the ground. Catherine, by
                  instinct, must have divined it was obdurate perversity, and not dislike, that
                  prompted this dogged conduct, for, after remaining an instant undecided, she
                  stooped and impressed on his cheek a gentle kiss. The little rogue thought I had
                  not seen her, and drawing back, she took her former station by the window, quite
                  demurely. I shook my head reprovingly, and then she blushed and whispered, -- </p>
               <p>"Well, what should I have done, Ellen? He wouldn't shake hands, and he wouldn't
                  look; I must show him some way that I like him -- that I want to be friends." </p>
               <p>Whether the kiss convinced Hareton I cannot tell. He was very careful, for some
                  minutes, that his face should not be seen; and when he did raise it, he was sadly
                  puzzled where to turn his eyes. </p>
               <pb n="II.362" facs="II.370.png"/>
               <p>Catherine employed herself in wrapping a handsome book neatly in white paper, and
                  having tied it with a bit of ribbon, and addressed it to "Mr. Hareton Earnshaw,"
                  she desired me to be her ambassadress, and convey the present to its destined
                  recipient. </p>
               <p>"And tell him if he'll take it I'll come and teach him to read it right," she
                  said; "and if he refuse it I'll go upstairs and never tease him again." </p>
               <p>I carried it, and repeated the message, anxiously watched by my employer. Hareton
                  would not open his fingers, so I laid it on his knee. He did not strike it off
                  either. I returned to my work. Catherine leaned her head and arms on the table,
                  till she heard the slight rustle of the covering being removed; then she stole
                  away and quietly seated herself beside her cousin. He trembled, and his face
                  glowed; all his rudeness and all his surly harshness had deserted him. He could
                  not summon cour<pb n="II.363" facs="II.371.png"/>age at first to utter a syllable
                  in reply to her questioning look and her murmured petition, -- </p>
               <p>"Say you forgive me, Hareton, do. You can make me so happy by speaking that little
                  word." </p>
               <p>He muttered something inaudible. </p>
               <p>"And you'll be my friend?" added Catherine interrogatively. </p>
               <p>"Nay, you'll be ashamed of me every day of your life," he answered, "and the more
                  ashamed the more you know me; and I cannot bide it." </p>
               <p>"So you won't be my friend?" she said, smiling as sweet as honey, and creeping
                  close up. </p>
               <p>I overheard no further distinguishable talk, but, on looking round again, I
                  perceived two such radiant countenances bent over the page of the accepted book
                  that I did not doubt the treaty had been ratified on both sides, and the enemies
                  were thenceforth sworn allies. </p>
               <p>The work they studied was full of costly <pb n="II.364" facs="II.372.png"
                  />pictures, and those and their position had charm enough to keep them unmoved
                  till Joseph came home. He, poor man, was perfectly aghast at the spectacle of
                  Catherine seated on the same bench with Hareton Earnshaw, leaning her hand on his
                  shoulder, and confounded at his favourite's endurance of her proximity; it
                  affected him too deeply to allow an observation on the subject that night. His
                  emotion was only revealed by the immense sighs he drew as he solemnly spread his
                  large Bible on the table, and overlaid it with dirty bank-notes from his
                  pocket-book, the produce of the day's transactions. At length he summoned Hareton
                  from his seat. </p>
               <p>"Tak' these in to t' maister, lad," he said, "and bide there. I's gang up to my
                  own rahm. This hoile's neither mensful nor seemly for us; we mun side out and
                  seearch another." </p>
               <p>"Come, Catherine," I said, "we must 'side out' too. I've done my ironing. Are you
                  ready to go?" </p>
               <pb n="II.365" facs="II.373.png"/>
               <p>"It is not eight o'clock," she answered, rising unwillingly -- "Hareton, I'll
                  leave this book upon the chimney-piece, and I'll bring some more to-morrow." </p>
               <p>"Ony books that yah leave I shall tak' into th' hahse," said Joseph, "and it'll be
                  mitch if yah find 'em agean. Soa yah may plase yerseln." </p>
               <p>Cathy threatened that his library should pay for hers, and smiling as she passed
                  Hareton, went singing upstairs, lighter of heart, I venture to say, than ever she
                  had been under that roof before, except, perhaps, during her earliest visits to
                  Linton. </p>
               <p>The intimacy thus commenced grew rapidly, though it encountered temporary
                  interruptions. Earnshaw was not to be civilized with a wish, and my young lady was
                  no philosopher and no paragon of patience; but both their minds tending to the
                  same point -- one loving and desiring to esteem, and the other loving and desiring
                  to be esteemed -- they contrived in the end to reach it.</p>
               <pb n="II.366" facs="II.374.png"/>
               <p>You see, Mr. Lockwood, it was easy enough to win Mrs. Heathcliff's heart. -- But
                  now I'm glad you did not try. The crown of all my wishes will be the union of
                  those two. I shall envy no one on their wedding-day. There won't be a happier
                  woman than myself in England. </p>

               <head>Chapter 2.19</head>
               <pb n="II.367" facs="II.375.png"/>
               <p>On the morrow of that Monday, Earnshaw being still unable to follow his ordinary
                  employments, and, therefore, remaining about the house, I speedily found it would
                  be impracticable to retain my charge beside me, as heretofore. </p>
               <p>She got down stairs before me, and out into the garden, where she had seen her
                  cousin performing some easy work; and when I went to bid them come to breakfast, I
                  saw she had persuaded him to clear a large space of ground <pb n="II.368"
                     facs="II.376.png"/>from currant and gooseberry bushes, and they were busy
                  planning together an importation of plants from the Grange. </p>
               <p>I was terrified at the devastation which had been accomplished in a brief half
                  hour; the black currant trees were the apple of Joseph's eye, and she had just
                  fixed her choice of a flower bed in the midst of them ! </p>
               <p>"There ! That will be all shewn to the master," I exclaimed, "the minute it is
                  discovered. And what excuse have you to offer for taking such liberties with the
                  garden? We shall have a fine explosion on the head of it: see if we don't ! Mr.
                  Hareton, I wonder you should have no more wit, than to go and make that mess at
                  her bidding !" </p>
               <p>"I'd forgotten they were Joseph's," answered Earnshaw, rather puzzled, "but I'll
                  tell him I did it." </p>
               <p>We always ate our meals with Mr. Heathcliff. I held the mistress's post in making
                  tea and carving; so I was indispensable at table. <pb n="II.369" facs="II.377.png"
                  />Catherine usually sat by me; but to-day' she stole nearer to Hareton, and I
                  presently saw she would have no more discretion in her friendship, than she had in
                  her hostility. </p>
               <p>"Now, mind you don't talk with and notice your cousin too much," were my whispered
                  instructions as we entered the room. "It will certainly annoy Mr. Heathcliff, and
                  he'll be mad at you both." </p>
               <p>"I'm not going to," she answered. </p>
               <p>The minute after, she had sidled to him, and was sticking primroses in his plate
                  of porridge. </p>
               <p>He dared not speak to her there -- he dared hardly look; and yet she went on
                  teasing till he was twice on the point of being provoked to laugh. I frowned, and
                  then she glanced toward the master, whose mind was occupied on other subjects than
                  his company, as his countenance evinced; and she grew serious for an instant,
                  scrutinizing him with deep gravity. Afterwards she turned and recommenced her <pb
                     n="II.370" facs="II.378.png"/>nonsense. At last Hareton uttered a smothered
                  laugh. Mr. Heathcliff started; his eye rapidly surveyed our faces. Catherine met
                  it with her accustomed look of nervousness and yet defiance, which he abhorred. </p>
               <p>"It is well you are out of my reach," he exclaimed. </p>
               <p>"What fiend possesses you to stare back at me continually with those infernal
                  eyes? Down with them! and don't remind me of your existence again. I thought I had
                  cured you of laughing." </p>
               <p>"It was me," muttered Hareton. </p>
               <p>"What do you say?" demanded the master. </p>
               <p>Hareton looked at his plate, and did not repeat the confession. Mr. Heathcliff
                  looked at him a bit, and then silently resumed his breakfast and his interrupted
                  musing. We had nearly finished, and the two young people prudently shifted wider
                  asunder, so I anticipated no further disturbance during that <pb n="II.371"
                     facs="II.379.png"/>sitting, when Joseph appeared at the door, revealing by his
                  quivering lip and furious eyes that the outrage committed on his precious shrubs
                  was detected. He must have seen Cathy and her cousin about the spot before he
                  examined it, for while his jaws worked like those of a cow chewing its cud, and
                  rendered his speech difficult to understand, he began, -- </p>
               <p>"I mun hev my wage, and I mun goa. I hed aimed to dee wheare I'd sarved fur sixty
                  year, and I thowt I'd lug my books up into t' garret, and all my bits o' stuff,
                  and they sud hev t' kitchen to theirseln, for t' sake o' quietness. It wur hard to
                  gie up my awn hearthstun, but I thowt I could do that. But nah; shoo's taan my
                  garden fro' me, and by th' heart, maister, I cannot stand it. Yah may bend to th'
                  yoak, and ye will; I noan used to't, and an old man doesn't sooin get used to <pb
                     n="II.372" facs="II.380.png"/>new barthens. I'd rayther arn my bite an' my sup
                  wi' a hammer in th' road." </p>
               <p>"Now, now, idiot," interrupted Heathcliff, "cut it short! What's your grievance?
                  I'll interfere in no quarrels between you and Nelly. She may thrust you into the
                  coal-hole for anything I care." </p>
               <p>"It's noan Nelly," answered Joseph. "I sudn't shift for Nelly, nasty ill nowt as
                  shoo is. Thank God! shoo cannot stale t' sowl o' nob'dy! Shoo wer niver soa
                  handsome but what a body mud look at her 'bout winking. It's yon flaysome,
                  graceless quean that's witched our lad wi' her bold een and her forrard ways, till
                  -- Nay, it fair brusts my heart! He's forgotten all I've done for him, and made on
                  him, and goan and riven up a whole row o' t' grandest currant trees i' t' garden!"
                  And here he lamented outright, unmanned by a sense of his bitter injuries and
                  Earnshaw's ingratitude and dangerous condition. </p>
               <pb n="II.373" facs="II.381.png"/>
               <p>"Is the fool drunk?" asked Mr. Heathcliff. -- "Hareton, is it you he's finding
                  fault with?" </p>
               <p>"I've pulled up two or three bushes," replied the young man, "but I'm going to set
                  'em again." </p>
               <p>"And why have you pulled them up?" said the master. </p>
               <p>Catherine wisely put in her tongue. </p>
               <p>"We wanted to plant some flowers there," she cried. </p>
               <p>"I'm the only person to blame, for I wished him to do it." </p>
               <p>"And who the devil gave you leave to touch a stick about the place?" demanded her
                  father-in-law, much surprised -- "And who ordered you to obey her?" he added,
                  turning to Hareton. </p>
               <p>The latter was speechless. His cousin replied, -- </p>
               <p>"You shouldn't grudge a few yards of earth for me to ornament, when you have taken
                  all my land!" </p>
               <p>"Your land, insolent slut! You never had any," said Heathcliff. </p>
               <pb n="II.374" facs="II.382.png"/>
               <p>"And my money," she continued, returning his angry glare, and meantime biting a
                  piece of crust, the remnant of her breakfast. </p>
               <p>"Silence!" he exclaimed. "Get done, and begone!" </p>
               <p>"And Hareton's land, and his money," pursued the reckless thing. "Hareton and I
                  are friends now, and I shall tell him all about you." </p>
               <p>The master seemed confounded a moment. He grew pale and rose up, eyeing her all
                  the while with an expression of mortal hate. </p>
               <p>"If you strike me, Hareton will strike you," she said, "so you may as well sit
                  down." </p>
               <p>"If Hareton does not turn you out of the room I'll strike him to hell," thundered
                  Heathcliff. "Damnable witch! dare you pretend to rouse him against me? -- Off with
                  her! Do you hear? Fling her into the kitchen! -- I'll kill her, Ellen Dean, if you
                  let her come into my sight again!" </p>
               <p>Hareton tried, under his breath, to persuade her to go. </p>
               <pb n="II.375" facs="II.383.png"/>
               <p>"Drag her away!" he cried savagely. "Are you staying to talk?" And he approached
                  to execute his own command. </p>
               <p>"He'll not obey you, wicked man, any more," said Catherine, "and he'll soon detest
                  you as much as I do." </p>
               <p>"Wisht! wisht!" muttered the young man reproachfully. "I will not hear you speak
                  so to him. Have done." </p>
               <p>"But you won't let him strike me?" she cried. "Come, then," he whispered
                  earnestly. </p>
               <p>It was too late. Heathcliff had caught hold of her. </p>
               <p>"Now, you go!" he said to Earnshaw. "Accursed witch! this time she has provoked me
                  when I could not bear it, and I'll make her repent it for ever!" </p>
               <p>He had his hand in her hair. Hareton attempted to release her locks, entreating
                  him not to hurt her that once. Heathcliff's black eyes flashed -- he seemed ready
                  to tear Catherine in <pb n="II.376" facs="II.384.png"/>pieces; and I was just
                  worked up to risk coming to the rescue, when of a sudden his fingers relaxed; he
                  shifted his grasp from her head to her arm, and gazed intently in her face. Then
                  he drew his hand over her eyes, stood a moment to collect himself apparently, and
                  turning anew to Catherine, said with assumed calmness, "You must learn to avoid
                  putting me in a passion, or I shall really murder you some time! Go with Mrs.
                  Dean, and keep with her, and confine your insolence to her ears. As to Hareton
                  Earnshaw, if I see him listen to you I'll send him seeking his bread where he can
                  get it. Your love will make him an outcast and a beggar. -- Nelly, take her; and
                  leave me, all of you! -- leave me!" </p>
               <p>I led my young lady out. She was too glad of her escape to resist. The other
                  followed, and Mr. Heathcliff had the room to himself till dinner. I had counselled
                  Catherine to dine up<pb n="II.377" facs="II.385.png"/>stairs, but as soon as he
                  perceived her vacant seat he sent me to call her. He spoke to none of us, ate very
                  little, and went out directly afterwards, intimating that he should not return
                  before evening. </p>
               <p>The two new friends established themselves in the house during his absence, when I
                  heard Hareton sternly check his cousin on her offering a revelation of her
                  father-in-law's conduct to his father. He said he wouldn't suffer a word to be
                  uttered in his disparagement. lf he were the devil, it didn't signify -- he would
                  stand by him; and he'd rather she would abuse himself, as she used to, than begin
                  on Mr. Heathcliff. Catherine was waxing cross at this, but he found means to make
                  her hold her tongue by asking how she would like him to speak ill of her father.
                  Then she comprehended that Earnshaw took the master's reputation home to himself,
                  and was attached by ties stronger <pb n="II.378" facs="II.386.png"/>than reason
                  could break -- chains forged by habit, which it would be cruel to attempt to
                  loosen. She showed a good heart, thenceforth, in avoiding both complaints and
                  expressions of antipathy concerning Heathcliff, and confessed to me her sorrow
                  that she had endeavoured to raise a bad spirit between him and Hareton. Indeed, I
                  don't believe she has ever breathed a syllable, in the latter's hearing, against
                  her oppressor since. </p>
               <p>When this slight disagreement was over, they were friends again, >and as busy as
                  possible in their several occupations of pupil and teacher. I came in to sit with
                  them after I had done my work, and I felt so soothed and comforted to watch them
                  that I did not notice how time got on. You know they both appeared in a measure my
                  children. I had long been proud of one, and now I was sure the other would be a
                  source of equal satisfaction. His honest, warm, and intelligent nature <pb
                     n="II.379" facs="II.387.png"/>shook off rapidly the clouds of ignorance and
                  degradation in which it had been bred, and Catherine's sincere commendations acted
                  as a spur to his industry. His brightening mind brightened his features, and added
                  spirit and nobility to their aspect. I could hardly fancy it the same individual I
                  had beheld on the day I discovered my little lady at Wuthering Heights, after her
                  expedition to the Crags. While I admired and they laboured, dusk drew on, and with
                  it returned the master. He came upon us quite unexpectedly, entering by the front
                  way, and had a full view of the whole three ere we could raise our heads to glance
                  at him. Well, I reflected, there was never a pleasanter or more harmless sight,
                  and it will be a burning shame to scold them. The red firelight glowed on their
                  two bonny heads, and revealed their faces animated with the eager interest of
                  children; for though he was twenty-three and she eighteen, each had so <pb
                     n="II.380" facs="II.388.png"/>much of novelty to feel and learn that neither
                  experienced nor evinced the sentiments of sober, disenchanted maturity. </p>
               <p>They lifted their eyes together, to encounter Mr. Heathcliff. Perhaps you have
                  never remarked that their eyes are precisely similar, and they are those of
                  Catherine Earnshaw. The present Catherine has no other likeness to her, except a
                  breadth of forehead and a certain arch of the nostril that makes her appear rather
                  haughty, whether she will or not. With Hareton the resemblance is carried further.
                  It is singular at all times; then it was particularly striking, because his senses
                  were alert, and his mental faculties wakened to unwonted activity. I suppose this
                  resemblance disarmed Mr. Heathcliff. He walked to the hearth in evident agitation,
                  but it quickly subsided as he looked at the young man -- or, I should say, altered
                  its character, for it was there yet. He took the book from his hand and <pb
                     n="II.381" facs="II.389.png"/>glanced at the open page, then returned it
                  without any observation, merely signing Catherine away. Her companion lingered
                  very little behind her; and I was about to depart also, but he bade me sit still. </p>
               <p>"It is a poor conclusion, is it not?" he observed, having brooded a while on the
                  scene he had just witnessed -- "an absurd termination to my violent exertions? I
                  get levers and mattocks to demolish the two houses, and train myself to be capable
                  of working like Hercules, and when everything is ready and in my power I find the
                  will to lift a slate of either roof has vanished! My old enemies have not beaten
                  me. Now would be the precise time to revenge myself on their representatives. I
                  could do it, and none could hinder me. But where is the use? I don't care for
                  striking; I can't take the trouble to raise my hand. That sounds as if I had been
                  labouring the whole time only to exhibit a fine trait of magnani<pb n="II.382"
                     facs="II.390.png"/>mity. It is far from being the case. I have lost the faculty
                  of enjoying their destruction, and I am too idle to destroy for nothing. </p>
               <p>"Nelly, there is a strange change approaching; I'm in its shadow at present. I
                  take so little interest in my daily life that I hardly remember to eat and drink.
                  Those two who have left the room are the only objects which retain a distinct
                  material appearance to me, and that appearance causes me pain, amounting to agony.
                  About her I won't speak, and I don't desire to think, but I earnestly wish she
                  were invisible. Her presence invokes only maddening sensations. He moves me
                  differently; and yet if I could do it without seeming insane, I'd never see him
                  again. You'll perhaps think me rather inclined to become so," he added, making an
                  effort to smile, "if I try to describe the thousand forms of past associations and
                  ideas he awakens or embodies. But you'll not talk of what I tell you; and <pb
                     n="II.383" facs="II.391.png"/>my mind is so eternally secluded in itself, it is
                  tempting at last to turn it out to another. </p>
               <p>"Five minutes ago Hareton seemed a personification of my youth, not a human being.
                  I felt to him in such a variety of ways that it would have been impossible to have
                  accosted him rationally." </p>
               <p>"In the first place, his startling likeness to Catherine connected him fearfully
                  with her. That, however, which you may suppose the most potent to arrest my
                  imagination, is actually the least; for what is not connected with her to me? and
                  what does not recall her? I cannot look down to this floor but her features are
                  shaped in the flags. In every cloud, in every tree -- filling the air at night,
                  and caught by glimpses in every object by day -- I am surrounded with her image.
                  The most ordinary faces of men and women -- my own features -- mock me with a
                  resemblance. The entire world is a dreadful collection of memo<pb n="II.384"
                     facs="II.392.png"/>randa that she did exist, and that I have lost her. Well,
                  Hareton's aspect was the ghost of my immortal love, of my wild endeavours to hold
                  my right, my degradation, my pride, my happiness, and my anguish -- </p>
               <p>"But it is frenzy to repeat these thoughts to you; only it will let you know why,
                  with a reluctance to be always alone, his society is no benefit, rather an
                  aggravation of the constant torment I suffer; and it partly contributes to render
                  me regardless how he and his cousin go on together. I can give them no attention
                  any more." </p>
               <p>"But what do you mean by a change, Mr. Heathcliff?" I said, alarmed at his manner,
                  though he was neither in danger of losing his senses nor dying, according to my
                  judgment. He was quite strong and healthy; and as to his reason, from childhood he
                  had a delight in dwelling on dark things and entertaining <pb n="II.385"
                     facs="II.393.png"/>odd fancies. He might have had a monomania on the subject of
                  his departed idol, but on every other point his wits were as sound as mine. </p>
               <p>"I shall not know that till it comes," he said, "I'm only half conscious of it
                  now." </p>
               <p>"You have no feeling of illness, have you?" I asked. </p>
               <p>"No, Nelly, I have not," he answered. </p>
               <p>"Then you are not afraid of death?" I pursued. </p>
               <p>"Afraid? No!" he replied. "I have neither a fear, nor a presentiment, nor a hope
                  of death. Why should I? With my hard constitution, and temperate mode of living,
                  and unperilous occupations, I ought to, and probably shall, remain above ground
                  till there is scarcely a black hair on my head. And yet I cannot continue in this
                  condition. I have to remind myself to breathe, almost to remind my heart to beat.
                  And it is like bending back a stiff spring; it is by compulsion that I <pb
                     n="II.386" facs="II.394.png"/>do the slightest act not prompted by one thought,
                  and by compulsion that I notice anything alive or dead which is not associated
                  with one universal idea. I have a single wish, and my whole being and faculties
                  are yearning to attain it. They have yearned towards it so long and so
                  unwaveringly that I'm convinced it will be reached -- and soon -- because it has
                  devoured my existence. I am swallowed up in the anticipation of its fulfilment. My
                  confessions have not relieved me, but they may account for some otherwise
                  unaccountable phases of humour which I show. -- O God! it is a long fight, I wish
                  it were over!" </p>
               <p>He began to pace the room, muttering terrible things to himself, till I was
                  inclined to believe, as he said Joseph did, that conscience had turned his heart
                  to an earthly hell. I wondered greatly how it would end. Though he seldom before
                  had revealed his <pb n="II.387" facs="II.395.png"/>state of mind, even by looks,
                  it was his habitual mood, I had no doubt. He asserted it himself; but not a soul,
                  from his general bearing, would have conjectured the fact. You did not when you
                  saw him, Mr. Lockwood; and at the period of which I speak he was just the same as
                  then, only fonder of continued solitude, and perhaps still more laconic in
                  company. </p>

               <pb n="II.388" facs="II.396.png"/>
               <p>For some days after that evening, Mr. Heathcliff shunned meeting us at meals; yet
                  he would not consent, formally, to exclude Hareton and Cathy. He had an aversion
                  to yielding so completely to his feelings, choosing rather to absent himself --
                  And eating once in twenty-four hours seemed sufficient sustenance for him. </p>
               <p>One night, after the family were in bed, I heard him go down stairs, and out at
                  the front door: I did not hear him re-enter <pb n="II.389" facs="II.397.png"/>and,
                  in the morning, I found he was still away. </p>
               <p>We were in April then: the weather was sweet and warm, the grass as green as
                  showers and sun could make it, and the two dwarf apple trees, near the southern
                  wall, in full bloom. </p>
               <p>After breakfast, Catherine insisted on my bringing a chair, and sitting, with my
                  work, under the fir trees at the end of the house; and she beguiled Hareton, who
                  had perfectly recovered from his accident, to dig and arrange her little garden,
                  which was shifted to that corner by the influence of Joseph's complaints. </p>
               <p>I was comfortably revelling in the spring fragrance around, and the beautiful soft
                  blue overhead, when my young lady, who had run down near the gate to procure some
                  primrose roots for a border, returned only half laden, and informed us that Mr.
                  Heathcliff was coming in. </p>
               <pb n="II.390" facs="II.398.png"/>
               <p>"And he spoke to me," she added, with a perplexed countenance. </p>
               <p>"What did he say ?" asked Hareton. </p>
               <p>"He told me to begone as fast as I could," she answered. "But he looked so
                  different from his usual look that I stopped a moment to stare at him." </p>
               <p>"How ?" he enquired. </p>
               <p>"Why, almost bright and cheerful -- No, almost nothing -- very much excited, and
                  wild and glad !" she replied. </p>
               <p>"Night-walking amuses him, then," I remarked, affecting a careless manner -- in
                  reality as surprised as she was, and anxious to ascertain the truth of her
                  statement, for to see the master looking glad would not be an every-day spectacle.
                  I framed an excuse to go in. Heathcliff stood at the open door. He was pale, and
                  he trembled, yet certainly he had a strange, joyful glitter in his eyes that
                  altered the aspect of his whole face. </p>
               <pb n="II.391" facs="II.399.png"/>
               <p>"Will you have some breakfast?" I said. "You must be hungry rambling about all
                  night." I wanted to discover where he had been, but I did not like to ask
                  directly. </p>
               <p>"No, I'm not hungry," he answered, averting his head and speaking rather
                  contemptuously, as if he guessed I was trying to divine the occasion of his
                  good-humour. </p>
               <p>I felt perplexed. I didn't know whether it were not a proper opportunity to offer
                  a bit of admonition. </p>
               <p>"I don't think it right to wander out of doors," I observed, "instead of being in
                  bed. It is not wise, at any rate, this moist season. I dare say you'll catch a bad
                  cold or a fever. You have something the matter with you now." </p>
               <p>"Nothing but what I can bear," he replied, "and with the greatest pleasure,
                  provided you'll leave me alone. Get in, and don't annoy me." </p>
               <p>I obeyed, and in passing I noticed he breathed as fast as a cat. </p>
               <pb n="II.392" facs="II.400.png"/>
               <p>"Yes," I reflected to myself, "we shall have a fit of illness. I cannot conceive
                  what he has been doing." </p>
               <p>That noon he sat down to dinner with us, and received a heaped-up plate from my
                  hands, as if he intended to make amends for previous fasting. </p>
               <p>"I've neither cold nor fever, Nelly," he remarked, in allusion to my morning's
                  speech, "and I'm ready to do justice to the food you give me." </p>
               <p>He took his knife and fork, and was going to commence eating, when the inclination
                  appeared to become suddenly extinct. He laid them on the table, looked eagerly
                  towards the window, then rose and went out. </p>

               <p>We saw him walking to and fro in the garden while we concluded our meal, and
                  Earnshaw said he'd go and ask why he would not dine; he thought we had grieved him
                  some way. </p>
               <pb n="II.393" facs="II.401.png"/>
               <p>"Well, is he coming?" cried Catherine, when her cousin returned. </p>
               <p>"Nay," he answered; "but he's not angry. He seemed rarely pleased indeed; only I
                  made him impatient by speaking to him twice, and then he bade me be off to you. He
                  wondered how I could want the company of anybody else." </p>
               <p>I set his plate to keep warm on the fender, and after an hour or two he
                  re-entered, when the room was clear, in no degree calmer -- the same unnatural (it
                  was unnatural) appearance of joy under his black brows; the same bloodless hue,
                  and his teeth visible, now and then, in a kind of smile; his frame shivering --
                  not as one shivers with chill or weakness, but as a tight-stretched cord vibrates
                  -- a strong thrilling rather than trembling.</p>
               <p>I will ask what is the matter, I thought; or who should? And I exclaimed, -- </p>
               <p>"Have you heard any good news, Mr. Heathcliff? You look uncommonly animated." </p>
               <pb n="II.394" facs="II.402.png"/>
               <p>"Where should good news come from to me?" he said. "I'm animated with hunger, and
                  seemingly I must not eat." </p>
               <p>"Your dinner is here," I returned; "why won't you get it?" </p>
               <p>"I don't want it now," he muttered hastily. "I'll wait till supper. And, Nelly,
                  once for all, let me beg you to warn Hareton and the other away from me. I wish to
                  be troubled by nobody. I wish to have this place to myself." </p>
               <p>"Is there some new reason for this banishment?" I inquired. "Tell me why you are
                  so queer, Mr. Heathcliff. Where were you last night? I'm not putting the question
                  through idle curiosity, but -- " </p>
               <p>"You are putting the question through very idle curiosity," he interrupted, with a
                  laugh. "Yes, I'll answer it. Last night I was on the threshold of hell. Today I am
                  within sight of my heaven. I have my eyes on it -- hardly three feet to sever me.
                  And <pb n="II.395" facs="II.403.png"/>now you'd better go. You'll neither see nor
                  hear anything to frighten you if you refrain from prying." </p>
               <p>Having swept the hearth and wiped the table, I departed, more perplexed than ever. </p>
               <p>He did not quit the house again that afternoon, and no one intruded on his
                  solitude, till, at eight o'clock, I deemed it proper, though unsummoned, to carry
                  a candle and his supper to him. He was leaning against the ledge of an open
                  lattice, but not looking out; his face was turned to the interior gloom. The fire
                  had smouldered to ashes; the room was filled with the damp, mild air of the cloudy
                  evening, and so still that not only the murmur of the beck down Gimmerton was
                  distinguishable, but its ripples and its gurgling over the pebbles, or through the
                  large stones which it could not cover. I uttered an ejaculation of discontent at
                  seeing the dismal grate, and commenced shut<pb n="II.396" facs="II.404.png"/>ting
                  the casements, one after another, till I came to his. </p>
               <p>"Must I close this?" I asked, in order to rouse him, for he would not stir. </p>
               <p>The light flashed on his features as I spoke. O Mr. Lockwood, I cannot express
                  what a terrible start I got by the momentary view -- those deep black eyes, that
                  smile and ghastly paleness! It appeared to me not Mr. Heathcliff, but a goblin;
                  and in my terror I let the candle bend towards the wall, and it left me in
                  darkness. </p>
               <p>"Yes, close it," he replied, in his familiar voice. </p>
               <p>"There, that is pure awkwardness! Why did you hold the candle horizontally? Be
                  quick, and bring another." </p>
               <p>I hurried out in a foolish state of dread, and said to Joseph, -- </p>
               <p>"The master wishes you to take him a light and rekindle the fire." For I dare not
                  go in myself again just then. </p>
               <p>Joseph rattled some fire into the shovel, and <pb n="II.397" facs="II.405.png"
                  />went; but he brought it back immediately with the supper-tray in his other hand,
                  explaining that Mr. Heathcliff was going to bed, and he wanted nothing to eat till
                  morning. We heard him mount the stairs directly. He did not proceed to his
                  ordinary chamber, but turned into that with the panelled bed. Its window, as I
                  mentioned before, is wide enough for anybody to get through; and it struck me that
                  he plotted another midnight excursion, of which he had rather we had no suspicion. </p>
               <p>"Is he a ghoul or a vampire?" I mused. I had read of such hideous incarnate
                  demons. And then I set myself to reflect how I had tended him in infancy, and
                  watched him grow to youth, and followed him almost through his whole course, and
                  what absurd nonsense it was to yield to that sense of horror. "But where did he
                  come from, the little dark thing, harboured by a good man to his bane?" muttered
                  Superstition, as I dozed into <pb n="II.398" facs="II.406.png"/>unconsciousness.
                  And I began, half dreaming, to weary myself with imagining some fit parentage for
                  him; and repeating my waking meditations, I tracked his existence over again, with
                  grim variations, at last picturing his death and funeral, of which all I can
                  remember is being exceedingly vexed at having the task of dictating an inscription
                  for his monument, and consulting the sexton about it; and as he had no surname,
                  and we could not tell his age, we were obliged to content ourselves with the
                  single word, "Heathcliff." That came true; we were. If you enter the kirkyard
                  you'll read on his headstone only that, and the date of his death. </p>
               <p>Dawn restored me to common-sense. I rose and went into the garden as soon as I
                  could see, to ascertain if there were any footmarks under his window. There were
                  none. "He has stayed at home," I thought, "and he'll be all right to-day." I
                  prepared breakfast for the household, as <pb n="II.399" facs="II.407.png"/>was my
                  usual custom, but told Hareton and Catherine to get theirs ere the master came
                  down, for he lay late. They preferred taking it out of doors, under the trees, and
                  I set a little table to accommodate them. </p>
               <p>On my re-entrance I found Mr. Heathcliff below. He and Joseph were conversing
                  about some farming business. He gave clear, minute directions concerning the
                  matter discussed, but he spoke rapidly, and turned his head continually aside, and
                  had the same excited expression, even more exaggerated. When Joseph quitted the
                  room he took his seat in the place he generally chose, and I put a basin of coffee
                  before him. He drew it nearer, and then rested his arms on the table and looked at
                  the opposite wall, as I supposed, surveying one particular portion, up and down,
                  with glittering, restless eyes, and with such eager interest that he stopped
                  breathing during half a minute together. </p>
               <p>"Come now," I exclaimed, pushing some <pb n="II.400" facs="II.408.png"/>bread
                  against his hand, "eat and drink that while it is hot; it has been waiting near an
                  hour." </p>
               <p>He didn't notice me, and yet he smiled. I'd rather have seen him gnash his teeth
                  than smile so. </p>
               <p>"Mr. Heathcliff! master!" I cried, "don't, for God's sake, stare as if you saw an
                  unearthly vision." </p>
               <p>"Don't, for God's sake, shout so loud," he replied.</p>
               <p>"Turn round and tell me -- are we by ourselves?" </p>
               <p>"Of course," was my answer -- "of course we are." </p>
               <p>Still I involuntarily obeyed him, as if I was not quite sure. With a sweep of his
                  hand he cleared a vacant space in front among the breakfast things, and leant
                  forward to gaze more at his ease. </p>
               <p>Now I perceived he was not looking at the wall, for when I regarded him alone it
                     <pb n="II.401" facs="II.409.png"/>seemed exactly that he gazed at something
                  within two yards' distance. And whatever it was, it communicated apparently both
                  pleasure and pain in exquisite extremes -- at least the anguished yet raptured
                  expression of his countenance suggested that idea. The fancied object was not
                  fixed either; his eyes pursued it with unwearied diligence, and, even in speaking
                  to me, were never weaned away. I vainly reminded him of his protracted abstinence
                  from food. If he stirred to touch anything in compliance with my entreaties, if he
                  stretched his hand out to get a piece of bread, his fingers clenched before they
                  reached it, and remained on the table, forgetful of their aim. I sat, a model of
                  patience, trying to attract his absorbed attention from its engrossing
                  speculation, till he grew irritable, and got up, asking why I would not allow him
                  to have his own time in taking his meals, and saying <pb n="II.402"
                     facs="II.410.png"/>that on the next occasion I needn't wait -- L might set the
                  things down and go. Having uttered these words he left the house, slowly sauntered
                  down the garden path, and disappeared through the gate. The hours crept anxiously
                  by; another evening came. I did not retire to rest till late, and when I did I
                  could not sleep. He returned after midnight, and instead of going to bed, shut
                  himself into the room beneath. I listened and tossed about, and finally dressed
                  and descended. It was too irksome to lie there harassing my brain with a hundred
                  idle misgivings. </p>
               <p>I distinguished Mr. Heathcliff's step restlessly measuring the floor, and he
                  frequently broke the silence by a deep inspiration resembling a groan. He muttered
                  detached words also. The only one I could catch was the name of Catherine, coupled
                  with some wild term of endearment or suffering, and spoken as one would speak to a
                  person present <pb n="II.403" facs="II.411.png"/>-- low and earnest, and wrung
                  from the depth of his soul. I had not courage to walk straight into the apartment,
                  but I desired to divert him from his reverie, and therefore fell foul of the
                  kitchen fire, stirred it, and began to scrape the cinders. It drew him forth
                  sooner than I expected. He opened the door immediately, and said, -- </p>
               <p>"Nelly, come here. Is it morning? Come in with your light." </p>
               <p>"It is striking four," I answered. "You want a candle to take upstairs. You might
                  have lit one at this fire." </p>
               <p>"No, I don't wish to go upstairs," he said. "Come in and kindle me a fire, and do
                  anything there is to do about the room." </p>
               <p>"I must blow the coals red first before I can carry any," I replied, getting a
                  chair and the bellows. </p>
               <p>He roamed to and fro, meantime, in a <pb n="II.404" facs="II.412.png"/>state
                  approaching distraction, his heavy sighs succeeding each other so thick as to
                  leave no space for common breathing between. </p>
               <p>"When day breaks I'll send for Green," he said. "I wish to make some legal
                  inquiries of him while I can bestow a thought on those matters, and while I can
                  act calmly. I have not written my will yet, and how to leave my property I cannot
                  determine. I wish I could annihilate it from the face of the earth." </p>
               <p>"I would not talk so, Mr. Heathcliff," I interposed. "Let your will be a while;
                  you'll be spared to repent of your many injustices yet. I never expected that your
                  nerves would be disordered. They are at present marvellously so, however, and
                  almost entirely through your own fault. The way you've passed these three last
                  days might knock up a Titan. Do take some food and some repose. You need only look
                  at yourself in a glass to see how you require both. Your cheeks are <pb n="II.405"
                     facs="II.413.png"/>hollow, and your eyes bloodshot, like a person starving with
                  hunger and going blind with loss of sleep." </p>
               <p>"It is not my fault that I cannot eat or rest," he replied. "I assure you it is
                  through no settled designs. I'll do both as soon as I possibly can. But you might
                  as well bid a man struggling in the water rest within arm's length of the shore! I
                  must reach it first, and then I'll rest. Well, never mind Mr. Green. As to
                  repenting of my injustices, I've done no injustice, and I repent of nothing. I'm
                  too happy; and yet I'm not happy enough. My soul's bliss kills my body, but does
                  not satisfy itself." </p>
               <p>"Happy, master?" I cried. "Strange happiness! If you would hear me without being
                  angry, I might offer some advice that would make you happier." </p>
               <p>"What is that?" he asked. "Give it." </p>
               <p>"You are aware, Mr. Heathcliff," I said, "that from the time you were thirteen
                  years <pb n="II.406" facs="II.414.png"/>old you have lived a selfish, unchristian
                  life, and probably hardly had a Bible in your hands during all that period. You
                  must have forgotten the contents of the book, and you may not have space to search
                  it now. Could it be hurtful to send for some one (some minister of any
                  denomination -- it does not matter which) to explain it, and show you how very far
                  you have erred from its precepts, and how unfit you will be for its heaven, unless
                  a change takes place before you die?" </p>
               <p>"I'm rather obliged than angry, Nelly," he said, "for you remind me of the manner
                  in which I desire to be buried. It is to be carried to the churchyard in the
                  evening. "You and Hareton may, if you please, accompany me; and mind particularly
                  to notice that the sexton obeys my directions concerning the two coffins. No
                  minister need come, nor need anything be said over me. I tell you I have nearly
                  attained my heaven, and that of others is altogether unvalued and uncoveted by
                  me." </p>
               <pb n="II.407" facs="II.415.png"/>
               <p>"And supposing you persevered in your obstinate fast, and died by that means, and
                  they refused to bury you in the precincts of the kirk?" I said, shocked at his
                  godless indifference. "How would you like it?" </p>
               <p>"They won't do that," he replied. "If they did, you must have me removed secretly;
                  and if you neglect it you shall prove, practically, that the dead are not
                  annihilated." </p>
               <p>As soon as he heard the other members of the family stirring he retired to his
                  den, and I breathed freer. But in the afternoon, while Joseph and Hareton were at
                  their work, he came into the kitchen again, and with a wild look bade me come and
                  sit in the house; he wanted somebody with him. I declined, telling him plainly
                  that his strange talk and manner frightened me, and I had neither the nerve nor
                  the will to be his companion alone. </p>
               <p>"I believe you think me a fiend," he said, <pb n="II.408" facs="II.416.png"/>with
                  his dismal laugh -- "something too horrible to live under a decent roof." Then
                  turning to Catherine, who was there, and who drew behind me at his approach, he
                  added, half sneeringly, "Will you come, chuck? I'll not hurt you. No! To you I've
                  made myself worse than the devil. Well, there is one who won't shrink from my
                  company. By God, she's relentless! Oh, damn it! It's unutterably too much for
                  flesh and blood to bear -- even mine." </p>
               <p>He solicited the society of no one more. At dusk he went into his chamber. Through
                  the whole night, and far into the morning, we heard him groaning and murmuring to
                  himself. Hareton was anxious to enter, but I bade him fetch Mr. Kenneth, and he
                  should go in and see him. When he came, and I requested admittance and tried to
                  open the door, I found it locked, and Heathcliff bade us be damned. He was <pb
                     n="II.409" facs="II.417.png"/>better, and would be left alone; so the doctor
                  went away. </p>
               <p>The following evening was very wet -- indeed it poured down till day-dawn; and as
                  I took my morning walk round the house I observed the master's window swinging
                  open, and the rain driving straight in. He cannot be in bed, I thought; those
                  showers would drench him through. He must either be up or out. But I'll make no
                  more ado; I'll go boldly and look." </p>
               <p>Having succeeded in obtaining entrance with another key, I ran to unclose the
                  panels, for the chamber was vacant. Quickly pushing them aside, I peeped in. Mr.
                  Heathcliff was there, laid on his back. His eyes met mine so keen and fierce, I
                  started; and then he seemed to smile. I could not think him dead; but his face and
                  throat were washed with rain, the bedclothes dripped, and he was perfectly still.
                  The lattice, flapping to and fro, had grazed <pb n="II.410" facs="II.418.png"/>one
                  hand that rested on the sill. No blood trickled from the broken skin, and when I
                  put my fingers to it I could doubt no more -- he was dead and stark! </p>
               <p>I hasped the window; I combed his black long hair from his forehead; I tried to
                  close his eyes -- to extinguish, if possible, that frightful, life-like gaze of
                  exultation before any one else beheld it. They would not shut -- they seemed to
                  sneer at my attempts; and his parted lips and sharp white teeth sneered too. Taken
                  with another fit of cowardice, I cried out for Joseph. Joseph shuffled up and made
                  a noise, but resolutely refused to meddle with him. </p>
               <p>"Th' divil's harried off his soul," he cried, "and he may hev his carcass into t'
                  bargain for aught I care! Ech! what a wicked un he looks girning at death!" and
                  the old sinner grinned in mockery. I thought he intended to cut a caper round the
                  bed; but suddenly composing himself, he <pb n="II.411" facs="II.419.png"/>fell on
                  his knees, and raised his hands, and returned thanks that the lawful master and
                  the ancient stock were restored to their rights. </p>
               <p>I felt stunned by the awful event, and my memory unavoidably recurred to former
                  times with a sort of oppressive sadness. But poor Hareton, the most wronged, was
                  the only one who really suffered much. He sat by the corpse all night, weeping in
                  bitter earnest. He pressed its hand, and kissed the sarcastic, savage face that
                  every one else shrank from contemplating, and bemoaned him with that strong grief
                  which springs naturally from a generous heart, though it be tough as tempered
                  steel. </p>
               <p>Mr. Kenneth was perplexed to pronounce of what disorder the master died. I
                  concealed the fact of his having swallowed nothing for four days, fearing it might
                  lead to trouble; and then I am persuaded he did not abstain on purpose -- it was
                  the consequence of his strange illness, not the cause. </p>
               <pb n="II.412" facs="II.420.png"/>
               <p>We buried him, to the scandal of the whole neighbourhood, as he wished. Earnshaw
                  and I, the sexton, and six men to carry the coffin, comprehended the whole
                  attendance. The six men departed when they had let it down into the grave. We
                  stayed to see it covered. Hareton, with a streaming face, dug green sods and laid
                  them over the brown mould himself. At present it is as smooth and verdant as its
                  companion mounds, and I hope its tenant sleeps as soundly. But the country folks,
                  if you ask them, would swear on the Bible that he walks. There are those who speak
                  to having met him near the church, and on the moor, and even within this house.
                  Idle tales, you'll say, and so say I. Yet that old man by the kitchen fire affirms
                  he has seen two on 'em, looking out of his chamber window, on every rainy night
                  since his death. And an odd thing happened to me about a month ago. I was going to
                  the Grange one evening -- a dark evening, threatening thunder; and just <pb
                     n="II.413" facs="II.421.png"/>at the turn of the Heights I encountered a little
                  boy with a sheep and two lambs before him. He was crying terribly, and I supposed
                  the lambs were skittish and would not be guided. </p>
               <p>"What is the matter, my little man?" I asked. </p>
               <p>"There's Heathcliff and a woman yonder, under t' nab," he blubbered, "un I darnut
                  pass 'em." </p>
               <p>I saw nothing; but neither the sheep nor he would go on, so I bade him take the
                  road lower down. </p>
               <p>He probably raised the phantoms from thinking, as he traversed the moors alone, on
                  the nonsense he had heard his parents and companions repeat. Yet, still I don't
                  like being out in the dark now, and I don't like being left by myself in this grim
                  house. I cannot help it. I shall be glad when they leave it and shift to the
                  Grange. </p>
               <pb n="II.414" facs="II.422.png"/>
               <p>"They are going to the Grange, then?" I said. </p>
               <p>"Yes," answered Mrs. Dean, "as soon as they are married, and that will be on New
                  Year's day." </p>
               <p>"And who will live here then?" </p>
               <p>"Why, Joseph will take care of the house, and perhaps a lad to keep him company.
                  They will live in the kitchen, and the rest will be shut up." </p>
               <p>"For the use of such ghosts as choose to inhabit it," I observed. </p>
               <p>"No, Mr. Lockwood," said Nelly, shaking her head. </p>
               <p>"I believe the dead are at peace, but it is not right to speak of them with
                  levity." </p>
               <p>At that moment the garden gate swung to; the ramblers were returning. </p>
               <p>"They are afraid of nothing," I grumbled, watching their approach through the
                  window. "Together they would brave Satan and all his legions." </p>
               <pb n="II.415" facs="II.423.png"/>
               <p>As they stepped on to the door-stones, and halted to take a last look at the moon
                  -- or, more correctly, at each other by her light -- I felt irresistibly impelled
                  to escape them again; and pressing a remembrance into the hand of Mrs. Dean, and
                  disregarding her expostulations at my rudeness, I vanished through the kitchen as
                  they opened the house-door, and so should have confirmed Joseph in his opinion of
                  his fellow-servant's gay indiscretions, had he not fortunately recognized me for a
                  respectable character by the sweet ring of a sovereign at his feet. </p>
               <p>My walk home was lengthened by a diversion in the direction of the kirk. When
                  beneath its walls I perceived decay had made progress, even in seven months. Many
                  a window showed black gaps deprived of glass, and slates jutted off here and there
                  beyond the right line of the roof, to be gradually worked off in coming autumn
                  storms. </p>
               <p>I sought and soon discovered the three <pb n="II.416" facs="II.424.png"
                  />headstones on the slope next the moor -- the middle one gray, and
                  half buried in heath; Edgar Linton's only harmonized by the turf and moss creeping
                  up its foot; Heathcliff's still bare. </p>
               <p>I lingered round them under that benign sky, watched the moths fluttering among
                  the heath and harebells, listened to the soft wind breathing through the grass,
                  and wondered how any one could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in
                  that quiet earth. </p>
