                            <note><hi rend="italic">The Beggar's Opera</hi> was first performed in
                                Lincoln's Inn Fields, under the management of John Rich, on January
                                29, 1728. It represented a new form of theater, the ballad opera,
                                which drew both on the world of the popular ballad and the elite
                                world of the Italian opera, then all the rage in London. The play is
                                set it in and around the famed Newgate Prison, populated with the
                                characters of the London underworld. The play is deeply satiric,
                                offering a caricature of the aristocracy and the underworld, the elaborately stylized forms of Italian opera, and the hypocrisies of the justice system itself.
                                It was incredibly popular, running for an astonishing 62 consecutive performances; the actress playing Polly--Lavinia Fenton--became an overnight
                                sensation. The play represented a new form of theater, the modern
                                musical, setting its songs to well-known contemporary tunes, and it
                                grew from a period of intense experimentation on the London stage in
                                the 1720s. Two hundred years later, in 1928, Bertholt Brecht
                                reworked Gay's satirical ballad opera into <hi rend="italic">The
                                    Threepenny Opera</hi>, drawing on both Gay's formal innovations
                                and satiric visions to critique the work of modern capitalism in
                                Germany. Brecht's collaborator, Kurt Weil, wrote the score for the
                                play, drawing on jazz and music hall influences; similarly, Gay's
                                collaborator, Christopher Pepusch, scored the ballad opera using
                                eighteenth-century equivalents--popular ballad tunes, at odds with
                                the conventions and forms of serious opera. Gay wrote a sequal to <hi rend="italic">The Beggar's Opera</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Polly</hi>, set in the West Indies and censored during Gay's life.</note>

                    <l>If Poverty be a Title to Poetry, I am sure no-body can dispute mine. I own
                        myself of the Company of Beggars; and I make one at their Weekly Festivals
                        at <hi rend="italic">St. Giles’s</hi>. I have a small Yearly Salary for my
                        Catches, and am welcome to a Dinner there whenever I please, which is more
                        than most Poets can say.</l>
                </sp>

                    <l> As we live by the Muses, it is but Gratitude in us to encourage Poetical
                        Merit wherever we find it. The Muses, contrary to all other Ladies, pay no
                        Distinction to Dress, and never partially mistake the Pertness of Embroidery
                        for Wit, nor the Modesty of Want for Dulness. Be the Author who he will, we
                        push his Play as far as it will go. So (though you are in Want) I wish you
                        success heartily. </l>

                    <l> This piece I own was originally writ for the celebrating the Marriage of <hi
                            rend="italic">James Chaunter</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Moll Lay</hi>,
                        two most excellent Ballad-Singers. I have introduced the Similes that are in
                        all your celebrated <hi rend="italic">Operas</hi>: The <hi rend="italic"
                            >Swallow</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Moth</hi>, the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Bee</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Ship</hi>, the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Flower</hi>, &amp;c. <pb/> Besides, I have a Prison-Scene, which the
                        Ladies always reckon charmingly pathetic. As to the Parts, I have observed
                        such a nice Impartiality to our two Ladies, that it is impossible for either
                        of them to take Offence. I hope I may be forgiven, that I have not made my
                        Opera throughout unnatural, like those in vogue; for I have no Recitative;
                        excepting this, as I have consented to have neither Prologue nor Epilogue,
                        it must be allowed an Opera in all its Forms. The Piece indeed hath been
                        heretofore frequently represented by ourselves in our Great Room at <hi
                            rend="italic">St. Giles’s</hi>, so that I cannot too often acknowledge
                        your Charity in bringing it now on the Stage. </l>

                    <l> Look ye, Wife. A handsome Wench in our way of Business is as profitable as
                        at the Bar of a <hi rend="italic">Temple</hi> Coffee-House, who looks upon
                        it as her livelihood to grant every Liberty but one. You see I would indulge
                        the Girl as far as prudently we can. In any thing, but Marriage! After that,
                        my Dear, how shall we be safe? Are we not then in her Husband’s Power? For a
                        Husband hath the absolute Power over all a Wife’s Secrets but her own. If
                        the Girl had the Discretion of a Court-Lady, who can have a Dozen young
                        Fellows at her Ear without complying with one, I should not matter it; but
                            <hi rend="italic">Polly</hi> is Tinder, and a Spark will at once set her
                        on a Flame. Married! If the Wench does not know her own Profit, sure she
                        knows her own Pleasure better than to make herself a Property! My Daughter
                        to me should be, like a Court-Lady to a Minister of State, a Key to the
                        whole Gang. Married! If the Affair is not already done, I’ll terrify her
                        from it, by the Example of our Neighbours. </l>

                        Ladies, and she may only allow the Captain Liberties in the view of
                        Interest. </l>

                        and sift her. In the meantime, Wife, rip out the Coronets and Marks of these
                        Dozen of Cambric Handkerchiefs, for I can dispose of them this Afternoon to

                    <l> I had a fair Tug at a charming Gold Watch. Pox take the Tailors for making
                        the Fobs so deep and narrow! It stuck by the way, and I was forc’d to make
                        my Escape under a Coach. Really, Madam, I fear I shall be cut off in the
                        Flower of my Youth, so that every now and then (since I was pumpt) I have
                        Thoughts of taking up and going to Sea. </l>

                        from being hang’d; and going to Sea, <hi rend="italic">Filch</hi>, will come
                        time enough upon a Sentence of Transportation. But now, since you have
                        nothing better to do, ev’n go to your Book, and learn your Catechism; for
                        really a Man makes but an ill Figure in the Ordinary’s Paper, who cannot

                        poor hand of her Beauty, and soon be thrown upon the Common. </l>

                        Marriage-Articles. The comfortable Estate of Widow-hood, is the only Hope
                        that keeps up a Wife’s Spirits. Where is the Woman who would scruple to be a
                        Wife, if she had it in her Power to be a Widow, whenever she pleas’d? If you

                        would like that we should get the Reward for his Death sooner than a

                        may inform him of their Design, and aid him in his Escape.--It shall be

                        Conversation! That too will distract me.--If he keep out of the way, my Papa
                        and Mama may in time relent, and we may be happy.--If he stays, he is
                        hang’d, and then he <pb/>
                        <!-- png 047 --> is lost for ever!--He intended to lie conceal’d in my Room,

                        her Ruin at my Door--I am in the Custody of her Father, and to be sure, if
                        he knows of the matter, I shall have a fine time on’t betwixt this and my
                        Execution.--But I promis’d the Wench Marriage--What signifies a Promise to a
                        Woman? Does not Man in Marriage itself promise a hundred things that he
                        never means to perform? Do all we can, Women will believe us; for they look
                        upon a Promise as an Excuse for following their own Inclinations.--But here
                        comes <hi rend="italic">Lucy</hi>, and I cannot get from her.--Wou’d I were

                            late Years I have been a great Sufferer by the Parliament.--Three
                            thousand Pounds would hardly make me amends.--The Act for destroying the
                            Mint, was a severe Cut upon our Business--’Till then, if a Customer
                            stept out of the way--we knew where to have her--No doubt you know Mrs.
                                <hi rend="italic">Coaxer</hi>--there’s a Wench now (’till to-day)
                            with a good Suit of Clothes of mine upon her Back, and I could never set
                            Eyes upon her for three Months together.--Since the Act too against
                            Imprisonment for small Sums, my Loss there too hath been very
                            considerable, and it must be so, when a Lady can borrow a handsom
                            Petticoat, or a clean Gown, and I not have the least Hank upon her! And,
                            o’ my Conscience, now-a-days most Ladies take a Delight in cheating,
                            when they can do it with Safety. </l>

                            Guineas.--Considering we must have our Profit.--To a Gentleman upon the
                            Road, a Gold Watch will be scarce worth the taking. </l>

                            and not of very safe Sale.--If you have any black Velvet Scarfs--they
                            are a handsom Winter-wear, and take with most Gentlemen who deal with my
                            Customers.--’Tis I that put the Ladies upon a good Foot. ’Tis not Youth
                            or Beauty that fixes their Price. <pb/>

                            bilking of me.--Then too, allowing for Accidents.--I have eleven fine
                            Customers now down under the Surgeon’s Hands--what with Fees and other
                            Expenses, there are great Goings-out, and no Comings in, and not a
                            Farthing to pay for at least a Month’s Clothing.--We run great

                            Hours ago; and have left her as she should be, in her Shift, with a
                            Lover of hers at my House. She call’d him up Stairs, as he was going to
                                <hi rend="italic">Mary-bone</hi> in a Hackney Coach.--And I hope,
                            for her own sake and mine, she will persuade the Captain to redeem her,
                            for the Captain is very generous to the Ladies. </l>

                        <l> To-morrow, dear Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Dye</hi>, you shall set your own
                            Price upon any of the Goods you like--We have at least half a Dozen
                            Velvet Scarfs, and all at your Service. Will you give me leave to make
                            you a Present of this Suit of Night-clothes for your own wearing?--But
                            are you sure it is Captain <hi rend="italic">Macheath</hi>. </l>

                            taken a great deal of the Captain’s Money in my Time at second-hand, for
                            he always lov’d to have his Ladies well drest. </l>

                            on’t--It hath always been my Maxim, that one Friend should assist
                            another--But if you please--I’ll take one of the Scarfs home with me.
                            ’Tis always good to have something in Hand. <pb/>

                            the Prisoner be brought back to his Wives in Triumph. </l>

                        <l> Through the whole Piece you may observe such a Similitude of Manners in
                            high and low Life, that it is difficult to determine whether (in the
                            fashionable Vices) the fine Gentlemen imitate the Gentlemen of the Road,
                            or the Gentlemen of the Road the fine Gentlemen.--Had the Play remained,
                            as I at first intended, it would have carried a most excellent Moral.
                            ’Twould have shewn that the lower Sort of People have their Vices in a
                            degree as well as the Rich: And that they are punish’d for them.</l>

                            this Day to Mirth, and I am sure she who thinks herself my Wife will
                            testify her Joy by a Dance. </l>

                            were really marry’d.--As for the rest.--But at present keep your own
                            Secret.</l>
