                     <note><p><hi rend="italic">The Importance of Being Earnest</hi> was first performed on Valentine's Day, 1895. At this time, Wilde was in a relationship with poet and journalist Lord Alfred Douglas (Bosie), then 17 years of age, which enraged his father, the Marquess of Queensbury. The Marquess frequently harrassed Wilde in public, naming him a "sodomite," and Wilde--against the advice of friends and legal counsel--sued him for libel. Wilde lost the libel case, and he was then himself sued by Queensbury on charges of "gross indecency" under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885, which was meant to protect young women under the age of 16 from sexual assault. Same-sex sodomy was only decriminalized in England in 1967. Wilde was found guilty, after several trials, and sentenced to two years of hard labor in prison, which he served from 1895 to 1897. This was the maximum sentence for the charge. Wilde wrote <hi rend="italic">De Profundus</hi>while in prison; it was published in 1905, after his death. Wilde died in Paris in 1900, shortly after his release, never to return to either Ireland or Great Britain. On the premiere of <hi rend="italic">Earnest</hi>, Queensbury had planned to pepper the stage with rotten vegetables, but the plot was avoided and the play opened successfully and secured Wilde's artistic status even as he went to prison. The first edition of the play, which we use for this digital edition, was printed in 1899--Wilde's authorship is not noted on the titlepage, or anywhere else in the text, though another small printing of a signed limited edition bearing the author's name was released later in the same year.</p></note>

                  <l>Lane's views on marriage seem somewhat lax. Really, if the lower orders don’t
                     set us a good example, what on earth is the use of them? They seem, as a class,
                     to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility. </l>

                  <l>My dear fellow, the way you flirt with Gwendolen is perfectly disgraceful. It
                     is almost as bad as the way Gwendolen flirts with you. </l>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>JACK</speaker>
                  <l>I am in love with Gwendolen. I have come up to town expressly to propose to
                     her. </l>

                  <speaker>ALGERNON</speaker>
                  <l>I really don’t see anything romantic in proposing. It is very romantic to be in
                     love. But there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal. Why, one may be
                     accepted. One usually is, I believe. Then the excitement is all over. The very
                     essence of romance is uncertainty. If ever I get married, I’ll certainly try to
                     forget the fact. </l>

                     earth is there in that? Some aunts are tall, some aunts are not tall. That is a
                     matter that surely an aunt may be allowed to decide for herself. You seem to
                     think that every aunt should be exactly like your aunt! That is absurd! For
                     Heaven's sake give me back my cigarette case. <stage>[Follows Ernest round the

                     Jack." There is no objection, I admit, to an aunt being a small aunt, but why
                     an aunt, no matter what her size may be, should call her own nephew her uncle,
                     I can't quite make out. Besides, your name isn't Jack at all; it is Ernest.</l>

                     You are the most earnest looking person I ever saw in my life. It is perfectly
                     absurd your saying that your name isn't Ernest. It's on your cards. Here is one
                     of them. Taking it from case. "Mr. Ernest Worthing, B.4, The Albany." I'll keep
                     this as a proof that your name is Ernest if ever you attempt to deny it to me,

                  <l> My dear fellow, there is nothing improbable about my explanation at all. In
                     fact it's perfectly ordinary. Old Mr. Thomas Cardew, who adopted me when I was
                     a little boy, made me in his will guardian to his grand-daughter, Miss Cecily
                     Cardew. Cecily, who addresses me as her uncle from motives of respect that you
                     could not possibly appreciate, lives at my place in the country under the
                     charge of her admirable governess, Miss Prism.</l>

                     separate occasions. Now, go on. Why are you Ernest in town and Jack in the

                  <l> My dear Algy, I don't know whether you will be able to understand my real
                     motives. You are hardly serious enough. When one is placed in the position of
                     guardian, one has to adopt a very high moral tone on all subjects. It's one's
                     duty to do so. And as a high moral tone can hardly be said to conduce very much
                     to either one's health or one's happiness, in order to get up to town I have
                     always pretended to have a younger brother of the name of Ernest, who lives in
                     the Albany, and gets into the most dreadful scrapes. That, my dear Algy, is the
                     whole truth pure and simple.</l>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>ALGERNON</speaker>
                  <l>The truth is rarely pure and never simple. Modern life would be very tedious if
                     it were either, and modern literature a complete impossibility!</l>

                  <speaker>ALGERNON</speaker>
                  <l> Literary criticism is not your forte, my dear fellow. Don't try it. You should
                     leave that to people who haven't been at a University. They do it so well in
                     the daily papers. What you really are is a Bunburyist. I was quite right in
                     saying you were a Bunburyist. You are one of the most advanced Bunburyists I
                     know.</l>

                  <l> You have invented a very useful younger brother called Ernest, in order that

                     down into the country whenever I choose. Bunbury is perfectly invaluable. If it
                     wasn’t for Bunbury’s extraordinary bad health, for instance, I wouldn’t be able
                     to dine with you at Willis’s to-night, for I have been really engaged to Aunt

                  <speaker>ALGERNON</speaker>
                  <l>I haven’t the smallest intention of doing anything of the kind. To begin with,
                     I dined there on Monday, and once a week is quite enough to dine with one’s own
                     relations. In the second place, whenever I do dine there I am always treated as
                     a member of the family, and sent down with either no woman at all, or two. In
                     the third place, I know perfectly well whom she will place me next to,
                     to-night. She will place me next Mary Farquhar, who always flirts with her own
                     husband across the dinner-table. That is not very pleasant. Indeed, it is not
                     even decent . . . and that sort of thing is enormously on the increase. The
                     amount of women in <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName> who
                     flirt with their own husbands is perfectly scandalous. It looks so bad. It is
                     simply washing one’s clean linen in public. Besides, now that I know you to be
                     a confirmed Bunburyist I naturally want to talk to you about Bunburying. I want
                     to tell you the rules. </l>

                     brother, indeed I think I’ll kill him in any case. Cecily is a little too much
                     interested in him. It is rather a bore. So I am going to get rid of Ernest. And
                     I strongly advise you to do the same with Mr. . . . with your invalid friend
                     who has the absurd name. </l>

                     but the fact is I have just had a telegram to say that my poor friend Bunbury
                     is very ill again. <stage>[Exchanges glances with Jack.] </stage>They seem to

               <sp>
                  <speaker>LADY BRACKNELL</speaker>
                  <l>Well, I must say, Algernon, that I think it is high time that Mr. Bunbury made
                     up his mind whether he was going to live or to die. This shilly-shallying with
                     the question is absurd. Nor do I in any way approve of the modern sympathy with
                     invalids. I consider it morbid. Illness of any kind is hardly a thing to be
                     encouraged in others. Health is the primary duty of life. I am always telling
                     that to your poor uncle, but he never seems to take much notice . . . as far as
                     any improvement in his ailments <pb n="24" facs="pageImages/wilde-024.jpg"/>
                     goes. I should be much obliged if you would ask Mr. Bunbury, from me, to be
                     kind enough not to have a relapse on Saturday, for I rely on you to arrange my
                     music for me. It is my last reception, and one wants something that will
                     encourage conversation, particularly at the end of the season when everyone has
                     practically said whatever they had to say, which, in most cases, was probably
                     not much. </l>

                  <speaker>ALGERNON</speaker>
                  <l>I’ll speak to Bunbury, Aunt Augusta, if he is still conscious, and I think I
                     can promise you he’ll be all right by Saturday. Of course the music is a great
                     difficulty. You see, if one plays good music, people don’t listen, and if one
                     plays bad music people don’t talk. But I’ll run over the programme I’ve drawn
                     out, if you will kindly come into the next room for a moment. </l>

                        following Algernon.] </stage>I’m sure the programme will be delightful,
                     after a few expurgations. French songs I cannot possibly allow. People always
                     seem to think that they are improper, and either look shocked, which is vulgar,
                     or laugh, which is worse. But German sounds a thoroughly respectable language,
                     and indeed, I believe is so. Gwendolen, you will accompany me. </l>

                     rate, you had been more demonstrative. For me you have always had an
                     irresistible fascination. Even before I met you I was far from indifferent to
                     you. <stage>[<hi rend="italic">Jack looks at her in amazement</hi>.]</stage> We
                     live, as I hope you know, Mr. Worthing, in an age of ideals. The fact is
                     constantly mentioned in the more expensive monthly magazines, and has reached
                     the provincial pulpits I am told; and my ideal has always been to love some one
                     of the name of Ernest. There is something in that name that inspires absolute
                     confidence. The moment Algernon first mentioned to me that he had a friend
                     called Ernest, I knew I was destined to love you. </l>

                     indeed. It does not thrill. It produces absolutely no vibrations . . . I have
                     known several Jacks, and they all, without exception, were more than usually
                     plain. Besides, Jack is a notorious domesticity for John! And I pity any woman

                     natural ignorance. Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it and the
                     bloom is gone. The whole theory of modern education is radically unsound.
                     Fortunately in <placeName type="tgn" key="7008591">England</placeName>, at any rate, education produces no effect whatsoever.
                     If it did, it would prove a serious danger to the upper classes, and probably
                     lead to acts of violence in Grosvenor Square. What is your income?

                  <l> That is satisfactory. What between the duties expected of one during one's
                     lifetime, and the duties exacted from one after one's death, land has ceased

                     have a first-class ticket for <placeName type="tgn" key="7011418">Worthing</placeName> in his pocket at the time. <placeName type="tgn" key="7011418">Worthing</placeName> is a

                     somewhat large, black leather hand-bag, with handles to it--an ordinary

                  <speaker>JACK</speaker>

                  <speaker>LADY BRACKNELL</speaker>
                  <l> The line is immaterial. Mr. Worthing, I confess I feel somewhat bewildered by
                     what you have just <pb n="38" facs="pageImages/wilde-038.jpg"/> told me. To be
                     born, or at any rate bred, in a hand-bag, whether it had handles or not, seems
                     to me to display a contempt for the ordinary decencies of family life that
                     remind one of the worst excesses of the French Revolution. And I presume you
                     know what that unfortunate movement led to? As for the particular locality in
                     which the hand-bag was found, a cloak-room at a railway station might serve to
                     conceal a social indiscretion--has probably, indeed, been used for that purpose
                     before now--but it could hardly be regarded as an assured basis for a
                     recognized position in good society. </l>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>JACK</speaker>
                  <l> May I ask you then what you would advise me to do? I need hardly say I would
                     do anything in the world to ensure Gwendolen’s happiness. </l>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>LADY BRACKNELL</speaker>
                  <l> I would strongly advise you, Mr. Worthing, to try and acquire some relations
                     as soon as possible, and to make a definite effort to produce at any rate one
                     parent, of either sex, before the season is quite over. </l>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>JACK</speaker>
                  <l> Well, I don’t see how I could possibly manage to do that. I can produce the
                     hand-bag at any moment. It is in my dressing-room at home. I really think that
                     should satisfy you, Lady Bracknell. </l>

                     Bracknell would dream of allowing our only daughter--a girl brought up with the
                     utmost care--to marry into a cloak-room, and form an alliance with a parcel?

                     you? I know it is a way she has. She is always refusing people. I think it is

                  <l> Oh, Gwendolen is as right as a trivet. As far as she is concerned, we are
                     engaged. Her mother is perfectly unbearable. Never met such a Gorgon. . . I
                     don’t really know what a Gorgon is like, but I am quite sure that Lady
                     Bracknell is one. In any case, she is a monster, without being a myth, which is
                        <pb n="40" facs="pageImages/040.jpg"/> rather unfair . . . I beg your pardon,
                     Algy, I suppose I shouldn’t talk about your own aunt in that way before you.

                     makes me put up with them at all. Relations are simply a tedious pack of
                     people, who haven’t got the remotest knowledge of how to live, nor the smallest

                  <l>Ernest, we may never be married. From the expression on mamma’s face I fear we
                     never shall. Few parents now-a-days pay any regard to what their children say
                     to them. The old-fashioned respect for the young is fast dying out. Whatever
                     influence I ever had over mamma, I lost at the age of three. But although she
                     may prevent us from becoming man and wife, and I may marry someone else, and
                     marry often, nothing that she can possibly do can alter my eternal devotion to
                     you.</l>

                  <l>Yes, but it usually chronicles the things that have <pb n="58"
                        facs="pageImages/wilde-058.jpg"/> never happened, and couldn't possibly have
                     happened. I believe that Memory is responsible for nearly all the three-volume
                     novels that Mudie sends us.</l>

                     I think advisable. Our weather is so changeable. At what hour would you wish

                     time. A case of twins that occurred recently in one of the outlying

                     And surely there must be much good in one who is kind to an invalid, and leaves

                  <l>Well, ever since dear Uncle Jack first confessed to us that he had a younger
                     brother who was very wicked and bad, you of course have formed the chief topic
                     of conversation between myself and Miss Prism. And of course a man who is much
                     talked about is always very attractive. One feels there must be something in
                     him after all. I daresay it was foolish of me, but I fell in love with you,
                     Ernest. </l>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>CECILY</speaker>
                  <l>On the 14th of February last. Worn out by your entire ignorance of my
                     existence, I determined to end the matter one way or the other, and after a
                     long struggle with myself I accepted you under this dear old tree here. The
                     next day I bought this little ring in your name, and this is the little bangle
                     with the true lovers’ knot I promised you always to wear. </l>

                  <l> You must not laugh at me, darling, but it had always been a girlish dream of
                     mine to love some one whose name was Ernest. <stage>[Algernon rises, Cecily
                        also.]</stage> There is something in that name that seems to inspire
                     absolute confidence. I pity any poor married woman whose husband is not called

                     should object to the name of Algernon. It is not at all a bad name. In fact, it
                     is rather an aristocratic name. Half of the chaps who get into the Bankruptcy
                     Court are called Algernon. But seriously, Cecily . . . [<stage>Moving to

                  <speaker>GWENDOLEN</speaker>
                  <l>Outside the family circle, papa, I am glad to say, is entirely unknown. I think
                     that is quite as it should be. The home seems to me to be the proper sphere for
                     the man. And certainly once a man begins to neglect his domestic duties he
                     becomes painfully effeminate, does he not? And I don’t like that. It makes men
                     so very attractive. Cecily, mamma, whose views on education are remarkably
                     strict, has brought me up to be extremely short-sighted; it is part of her
                     system; so do you mind my looking at you through my glasses?</l>

                  <l>Well, to speak with perfect candour, Cecily, I wish that you were fully
                     forty-two, and more than usually plain for your age. Ernest has a strong
                     upright nature. He is the very soul of truth and honour. Disloyalty would be as
                     impossible to him as deception. But even men of the noblest possible moral
                     character are extremely susceptible to the influence of the physical charms of
                     others. Modern, no less than Ancient History, supplies us with many most
                     painful examples of what I refer to. If it were not so, indeed, History would
                     be quite unreadable.</l>

                     have lifted a load from my mind. I was growing almost anxious. It would have
                     been terrible if any cloud had come across a friendship like ours, would it
                     not? Of course you are quite, quite sure that it is not Mr. Ernest Worthing who

                  <l>Dearest Gwendolen, there is no reason why I should make a secret of it to you.
                     Our little county newspaper is sure to chronicle the fact next week. Mr. Ernest
                     Worthing and I are engaged to be married. </l>

                  <l>My darling Cecily, I think there must be some slight error. Mr. Ernest Worthing
                     is engaged to me. The announcement will appear in the “Morning Post” on
                     Saturday at the latest. </l>

                     ten minutes ago. <stage>[Shows diary.]</stage>

                  <l>It is certainly very curious, for he asked me to be his wife yesterday
                     afternoon at 5.30. If you would care to verify the incident, pray do so.

                     One should always have something sensational to read in the train. I am so

                     the prior claim. </l>

                     you any mental or physical anguish, but I feel bound to point out that since
                     Ernest proposed to you he clearly has changed his mind. </l>

                     be married to your brother Ernest, so it is a matter of some importance to us

                     that I have ever been reduced to such a painful position, and I am really quite
                     inexperienced in doing anything of the kind. However I will tell you quite
                     frankly that I have no brother Ernest. I have no brother at all. I never had a
                     brother in my life, and I certainly have not the smallest intention of ever

                     both be christened Ernest. It’s absurd. Besides, I have a perfect right to be
                     christened if I like. There is no evidence at all that I ever have been
                     christened by anybody. I should think it extremely probable I never was, and so
                     does Dr. Chasuble. It is entirely different in your case. You have been
                     christened already.</l>

                  <l>True. In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity is the vital thing.
                     Mr. Worthing, what explanation can you offer to me for pretending to have a
                     brother? Was it in order that you might have an opportunity of coming up to

                     University Extension Scheme on the Influence of a permanent income on Thought.

                     seems to me a most attractive young lady, now that I look at her. Few girls of
                     the present day have any really solid qualities, any of the qualities that
                     last, and improve with time. We live, I regret to say, in an age of surfaces.

                  <l>I fear there can be no possible doubt about the matter. This afternoon, during
                     my temporary absence in <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName>
                     on an important question of romance, he obtained admission to my house by means
                     of the false pretence of being my brother. Under an assumed name he drank, I’ve
                     just been informed by my butler, an entire pint bottle of my Perrier-Jouet,
                     Brut, ’89; a wine I was specially reserving for myself. Continuing his
                     disgraceful deception, he succeeded in the course of the afternoon in
                     alienating the affections of my only ward. He subsequently stayed to tea, and
                     devoured every single muffin. And what makes his conduct all the more heartless
                     is, that he was perfectly well aware from the first that I have no brother,
                     that I never had a brother, and that I don’t intend to have a brother, not even
                     of any kind. I distinctly told him so myself yesterday afternoon. </l>

                     should ever be quite accurate about her age. It looks so calculating.

                     but admitting to twenty at evening parties. Well, it will not be very long
                     before you are of age and free from the restraints of tutelage. So I don’t
                     think your guardian’s consent is, after all, a matter of any importance. </l>

                     to tell you that according to the terms of her grandfather’s will Miss Cardew

                  <l>That does not seem to me to be a grave objection. Thirty-five is a very
                     attractive age. <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName> society
                     is full of women of the very highest birth who have, of their own free choice,
                     remained thirty-five for years. Lady Dumbleton is an instance in point. To my
                     own knowledge she has been thirty-five ever since she arrived at the age of
                     forty, which was many years ago now. I see no reason why our dear Cecily should
                     not be even still more attractive at the age you mention than she is at
                     present. There will be a large accumulation of property. </l>

                  <speaker>CECILY</speaker>
                  <l>Yes, I felt it instinctively, but I couldn’t wait all that time. I hate waiting
                     even five minutes for anybody. It always makes me rather cross. I am not
                     punctual myself, I know, but I do like punctuality in others, and waiting, even
                     to be married, is quite out of the question. </l>

                     the perambulator was discovered at midnight, standing by itself in a remote

                     that is for ever branded on my memory, I prepared as usual to take the baby out
                     in its perambulator. I had also with me a somewhat old, but capacious hand-bag
                     in which I had intended to place the manuscript of a work of fiction that I had
                     written during my few unoccupied hours. <pb n="144"

                     and placed the baby in the hand-bag. </l>
