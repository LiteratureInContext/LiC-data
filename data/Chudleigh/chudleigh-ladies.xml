                     1699 expounding on the duty of wives to their husbands. Chudleigh was a devout
                     Anglican, and had no formal education (women were not usually formally educated for a
                     century more), but she was self-taught and read widely. In her late teens, she
                     married Sir George Chudleigh, a Baronet. He was an overbearing husband, and scholars
                     suggest that her own experience was an influence for her writing. However, he did
                     allow her to publish her work, which was not common for women of her stature. To read

            <note xml:id="divorce" target="_divorce" type="editorial" resp="editors.xml#TH">Until the middle of the nineteenth century,
               with the passage of the Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857, English society was
               essentially divorceless; members of the gentility and the aristocracy typically
               married for life. The only way to secure a divorce was through a very expensive
               Private Act of Parliament; between 1700 and 1857, fewer than 325 parliamentary
               divorces were granted in England. Almost all were initiated by men, and it was only
               granted for adultery. Women could only seek divorce if the adultery were accompanied
               by extreme cruelty. Those granted to women could be counted on one hand. As a result,
               there were many unhappy marriages, and literature focused on chosing the right mate
               was popular. Those in the lower classes (and sometimes those in the growing middle
               classes) had more flexibility, often simply agreeing among themselves to leave each
               other or through the practice of "wife selling." To read more about the history of
               divorce, see <ref

               couvert"; her legal identity was subsumed into (or "covered by") her husband's, and
               she was no longer able to take on debt, own property, or engage in contracts.
               Unmarried women and widows could. To read more about this doctrine of couverture,
               which was only modified in the late 19th century, see <ref
                  target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coverture">Wikipedia</ref>. It is worth
               noting that, in the US, it was only in 1974 (with the passage of the Equal Credit
               Opportunity Act) that women could open bank accounts or apply for credit without
               needing a male co-signer. In the UK, a similar law was passed in 1975.</note>

               depicted the Ottoman world as powerful, moreso than the English themselves, whose
               empire was growing and would reach its height in the 19th century. Hence, Chudleigh
               here uses the "eastern prince" as an image of unchecked power. This is exacerbated by
               perceived differences in personal and political liberties between the English and the
               Turkish subject, and especially the female subject.</note>

                  seraglio</ref> as a site of female confinement and sexual enslavement. In British
               literature, the trope of the English captive seeking to regain their "native" or
               natural/innate liberties takes shape "against a detailed representation of the Orient
               as debased and despotic" (<ref

               Note that Chudleigh refers, in an earlier line, to the husband's "innate Rigor." To
               read more about the way the West viewed the Ottoman Empire as tyrranical and
