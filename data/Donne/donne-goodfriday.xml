                            <note>We have taken our text from the Text Creation Partnership's digitized
                                version of the 1633 edition of Donne's poems:
                                https://github.com/textcreationpartnership/A69225/blob/master/A69225.xml.
                                Donne's poems circulated in manuscript during his life time, and were not
                                issued in a print version until this edition, which came out after Donne's
                                death in 1632. The long "s" of the original has been modernized, but we have
                                otherwise kept the original spelling. The title page has been sourced from <ref target="https://specialcollections.princeton.edu/2023/05/a-donne-deal/">Princeton University Special Collections</ref>.</note>

                    <l n="3">And as the other Spheares, by being growne</l>
                    <l n="4">Subject to forraigne motion, lose their owne,</l>
                    <l n="5">And being by others hurried every day,</l>
                    <l n="6">Scarce in a yeare their naturall forme obey:</l>
                    <l n="7">Pleasure or businesse, so, our Soules admit</l>
                    <l n="8">For their first mover, and are whirld by it.</l>
                    <l n="9">Hence is't, that I am carryed towards the West</l>
                    <l n="10">This day, when my Soules forme bends toward the East.</l>
                    <l n="11">There I should see a Sunne, by rising set,</l>
                    <l n="12">And by that setting endlesse day beget;</l>
                    <l n="13">But that Christ on this Crosse, did rise and fall,</l>

                    <l n="18">What a death were it then to see God dye?</l>
                    <l n="19">It made his owne Lieutenant Nature shrinke,</l>
                    <l n="20">It made his footstoole crack, and the Sunne winke.</l>

                    <l n="29">If on these things I durst not looke, durst I</l>
                    <l n="30">Upon his miserable mother cast mine eye,</l>
                    <l n="31">Who was Gods partner here, and furnish'd thus</l>
                    <l n="32">Halfe of that Sacrifice, which ransom'd us?</l>
                    <l n="33">Though these things, as I ride, be from mine eye,</l>

                    <l n="36">O Saviour, as thou hang'st upon the tree;</l>
                    <l n="37">I turne my backe to thee, but to receive</l>
                    <l n="38">Corrections, till thy mercies bid thee leave.</l>
                    <l n="39">O thinke mee worth thine anger, punish mee,</l>
