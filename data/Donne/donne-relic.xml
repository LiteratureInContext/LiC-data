               <l>WHen my grave is broke up againe</l>
               <l>Some ſecond gheſt to entertaine,</l>
               <l>(For graves have learn'd that woman-head</l>
               <l>To be to more then one a Bed)</l>
               <l>And he that digs it, ſpies</l>
               <l>A bracelet of bright haire about the bone,</l>
               <l>Will he not let'us alone,</l>
               <l>And thinke that there a loving couple lies,</l>
               <l>Who thought that this device might be ſome way</l>
               <l>To make their ſoules, at the laſt buſie day,</l>
               <l>Meet at this grave, and make a little ſtay?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>If this fall in a time, or land,</l>
               <l>Where miſ-devotion doth command,</l>
               <l>Then, he that digges us up, will bring</l>
               <l>Us, to the Biſhop, and the King,</l>
               <l>To make us Reliques; then</l>
               <l>Thou ſhalt be a Mary Magdalen, and I</l>
               <l>A ſomething elſe thereby;</l>

All women ſhall adore us, and ſome men;</l>
               <l>And ſince at ſuch time, miracles are ſought,</l>
               <l>I would have that age by this paper taught</l>
               <l>What miracles wee harmeleſſe lovers wrought.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Firſt, we lov'd well and faithfully,</l>
               <l>Yet knew not what wee lov'd, nor why,</l>
               <l>Difference of ſex no more wee new,</l>
               <l>Then our Guardian Angells doe,</l>
               <l>Comming and going, wee,</l>
               <l>Perchance might kiſſe, but not between thoſe meales</l>
               <l>Our hands ne'r toucht the ſeales,</l>
               <l>Which nature, injur'd by late law, ſets free,</l>
               <l>Theſe miracles wee did; but now alas,</l>
               <l>All meaſure, and all language, I ſhould paſſe,</l>
               <l>Should I tell what a miracle ſhee was.</l>
