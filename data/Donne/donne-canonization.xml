               <l>FOr Godſake hold your tongue, and let me love,</l>
               <l>Or chide my palſie, or my gout,</l>
               <l>My five gray haires, or ruin'd fortune flout,</l>
               <l>With wealth your ſtate, your minde with Arts improve</l>
               <l>Take you a courſe, get you a place,</l>
               <l>Obſerve his honour, or his grace,</l>
               <l>Or the Kings reall, or his ſtamped face</l>
               <l>Contemplate, what you will, approve,</l>
               <l>So you will let me love.</l>

               <l>Alas, alas, who's injur'd by my love?</l>
               <l>What merchants ſhips have my ſighs drown'd?</l>
               <l>Who ſaies my teares have overflow'd his ground?</l>
               <l>When did my colds a forward ſpring remove?</l>
               <l>When did the heats which my veines fill</l>
               <l>Adde one more, to the plaguie Bill?</l>
               <l>Soldiers finde warres, and Lawyers finde out ſtill</l>
               <l>Litigious men, which quarrels move,</l>
               <l>Though ſhe and I do love.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Call us what you will, wee are made ſuch by love;</l>
               <l>Call her one, mee another flye,</l>
               <l>We'are Tapers too, and at our owne coſt die,</l>
               <l>And wee in us finde the'Eagle and the dove,</l>
               <l>The Phoenix ridle hath more wit</l>
               <l>By us, we two being one, are it.</l>
               <l>So, to one neutrall thing both ſexes fit.</l>
               <l>Wee dye and riſe the ſame, and prove</l>
               <l>Myſterious by this love.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Wee can dye by it, if not live by love,</l>
               <l>And if unfit for tombes and hearſe</l>
               <l>Our legends bee, it will be fit for verſe;</l>
               <l>And if no peece of Chronicle wee prove,</l>
               <l>We'll build in ſonnets pretty roomes;</l>
               <l>As well a well wrought urne becomes</l>
               <l>The greateſt aſhes, as halfe-acre tombes,</l>
               <l>And by theſe hymnes, all ſhall approve</l>
               <l>Us <hi>Canoniz'd</hi> for Love.</l>
