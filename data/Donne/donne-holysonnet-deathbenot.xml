                     <note>We have taken our text from the Text Creation Partnership's digitized
                        version of the 1633 edition of Donne's poems:
                        https://github.com/textcreationpartnership/A69225/blob/master/A69225.xml.
                        Donne's poems circulated in manuscript during his life time, and were not
                        issued in a print version until this edition, which came out after Donne's
                        death in 1632. The long "s" of the original has been modernized, but we have
                        otherwise kept the original spelling. The title page has been sourced from
                           <ref
