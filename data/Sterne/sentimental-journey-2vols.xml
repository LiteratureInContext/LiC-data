               should give a man these <pb n="2" facs="tcp:1269300201:21"/> rights—I'll look into
               them: so giving up the argument—I went straight to my lodgings, put up half a dozen

               As I acknowledged this, I felt a suffusion of a finer kind upon my cheek—more warm

               beat all chearily together, and every power which sustained life, perform'd it with

            <p>I HAD scarce utter'd the words, when a poor monk of the order of St. Francis came
               into the room to beg something for his convent. No man cares to have his virtues the
               sport of contingencies—or one man may be generous, as another man is <ref
                  target="a009" corresp="n009">puissant</ref>—<hi>sed non, quo ad hanc</hi>—or be it
               as it may—for there is no regular reasoning upon the ebbs and flows of our humours;
               they may depend upon the same causes, for ought I know, which influence the tides
               themselves—'twould oft be no discredit <pb n="9" facs="tcp:1269300201:28"/> to us, to
               suppose it was so: I'm sure at least for myself, that in many a case I should be more
               highly satisfied, to have it said by the world, <q rend="inline">"I had had an affair
                  with the moon, in which there was neither sin nor shame,"</q> than have it pass
               altogether as my own act and deed, wherein there was so much of both.</p>
            <p>—But be this as it may. The moment I cast my eyes upon him, I was predetermined not
               to give him a single <ref target="a010" corresp="n010">sous</ref>; and accordingly I
               put my purse into my pocket—button'd it up—set myself a little more upon my centre,
               and advanced up gravely to him: there was something, I fear, forbidding in my look: I
               have his <pb n="10" facs="tcp:1269300201:29"/> figure this moment before my eyes, and
               think there was that in it which deserved better.</p>
            <p>The monk, as I judged from the break in his <ref target="a011" corresp="n011"
                  >tonsure</ref>, a few scatter'd white hairs upon his temples, being all that
               remained of it, might be about seventy—but from his eyes, and that sort of fire which
               was in them, which seemed more temper'd by courtesy than years, could be no more than
               sixty—Truth might lie between—He was certainly sixty-five; and the general air of his
               countenance, notwithstanding something seem'd to have been planting wrinkles in it
               before their time, agreed to the account.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:1269300201:30"/> It was one of those heads, which <ref
                  target="a011b" corresp="n011b">Guido</ref> has often painted—mild,
               pale—penetrating, free from all common-place ideas of fat contented ignorance looking
               downwards upon the earth—it look'd forwards; but look'd, as if it look'd at something
               beyond this world. How one of his order came by it, heaven above, who let it fall
               upon a monk's shoulders, best knows: but it would have suited a <ref target="a012"
                  corresp="n012">Bramin</ref>, and had I met it upon the plains of <ref
                  target="a013" corresp="n013">Indostan</ref>, I had reverenced it.</p>
            <p>The rest of his outline may be given in a few strokes; one might put it into the
               hands of any one to design, for 'twas neither elegant or <pb n="12"
                  facs="tcp:1269300201:31"/> otherwise, but as character and expression made it so:
               it was a thin, spare form, something above the common size, if it lost not the
               distinction by a bend forwards in the figure—but it was the attitude of Intreaty; and
               as it now stands presented to my imagination, it gain'd more than it lost by it.</p>
            <p>When he had enter'd the room three paces, he stood still; and laying his left hand
               upon his breast, (a slender white staff with which he journey'd being in his
               right)—when I had got close up to him, he introduced himself with the little story of
               the wants of his convent, and the poverty of his order—and did it with <pb n="13"
                  facs="tcp:1269300201:32"/> so simple a grace—and such an air of deprecation was
               there in the whole cast of his look and figure—I was bewitch'd not to have been
               struck with it—</p>
            <p>—A better reason was, I had predetermined not to give him a single sous.</p>

            <p>—'TIS very true, said I, replying to a cast upwards with his eyes, with which he had
               concluded his address—'tis very true—and heaven be their resource who have no other
               but the charity of the world, the stock of which, I fear, is no way sufficient for
               the many <hi>great claims</hi> which are hourly made upon it.</p>
            <p>As I pronounced the words <hi>great claims,</hi> he gave a slight glance with his eye
               downwards upon the sleeve <pb n="15" facs="tcp:1269300201:34"/> of his tunick—I felt
               the full force of the appeal—I acknowledge it, said I—a coarse habit, and that but
               once in three years, with meagre diet—are no great matters; and the true point of
               pity is, as they can be earn'd in the world with so little industry, that your order
               should wish to procure them by pressing upon a fund which is the property of the
               lame, the blind, the aged and the infirm—the captive who lies down counting over and

               unfortunate—The monk made me a bow—but of all others, resumed I, the unfortunate of
               our own country, surely, have the first rights; and I have left thousands in distress
               upon our own shore—The monk gave a cordial wave with his head—as much as to say, No
               doubt, there is misery enough in every corner of the world, as well as within our
               convent—But we distinguish, said I, laying my hand upon the sleeve of his tunick, in
               return for his appeal—we distinguish, my good Father! betwixt those who wish only to
               eat the bread of their own labour—and those who eat the bread of other people's, and
               have no other plan in life, but to get <pb n="17" facs="tcp:1269300201:36"/> through

            </p>
            <p>The poor <ref target="a014" corresp="n014">Franciscan</ref> made no reply: a hectic
               of a moment pass'd across his cheek, but could not tarry—Nature seemed to have had
               done with her resentments in him; he shewed none—but letting his staff fall within
               his arm, he press'd both his hands with resignation upon his breast, and retired.</p>

            <p>MY heart smote me the moment he shut the door—Psha! said I with an air of

            <p>WHEN a man is discontented with himself, it has one advantage however, that it puts

               drew the taffeta curtain betwixt us, and being determined to write my journey, I took

            <head>PREFACE, IN THE DESOBLIGEANT.</head>
            <p>IT must have been observed by many a peripatetic philosopher, That nature has set up
               by her own unquestionable authority certain boundaries and fences to circumscribe the
               discontent of man: she has effected her purpose in the quietest and easiest manner by
               laying him under almost insuperable obligations to work out his ease, and to sustain
               his sufferings at home. It is there only that she has provided him with the most
               suitable objects to partake of his happiness, and bear a part of that burden which in
               all countries and ages, has ever been too heavy <pb n="23" facs="tcp:1269300201:42"/>
               for one pair of shoulders. 'Tis true we are endued with an imperfect power of
               spreading our happiness sometimes beyond <hi>her</hi> limits, but 'tis so ordered,
               that from the want of languages, connections, and dependencies, and from the
               difference in education, customs and habits, we lie under so many impediments in
               communicating our sensations out of our own sphere, as often amount to a total
               impossibility.</p>
            <p>It will always follow from hence, that the balance of sentimental commerce is always
               against the <ref target="a019" corresp="n019">expatriated</ref> adventurer: he must
               buy what he has little occasion for at their own price—his conversation <pb n="24"
                  facs="tcp:1269300201:43"/> will seldom be taken in exchange for theirs without a
               large discount—and this, by the by, eternally driving him into the hands of more
               equitable brokers for such conversation as he can find, it requires no great spirit
               of divination to guess at his party—</p>
            <p>This brings me to my point; and naturally leads me (if the see-saw of this
                  <hi>Desobligeant</hi> will but let me get on) into the efficient as well as the
               final causes of travelling—</p>

               reasons which may be derived from one of these general causes— <list>

               delinquents travelling under the direction of governors recommended by the

               precision and nicety, to avoid a confusion of character. And these men I speak of,
               are such as cross the seas and sojourn in a land of strangers with a view of saving
               money for various reasons and upon various pretences: but as they might also save
               themselves and others a great deal of unnecessary trouble by saving their money at

               of drinking the same wine at the Cape, that the same grape produced upon the French
               mountains—he was too phlegmatic for that—but undoubtedly <pb n="30"
                  facs="tcp:1269300201:51"/> he expected to drink some sort of vinous liquor; but
               whether good, bad, or indifferent—he knew enough of this world to know, that it did
               not depend upon his choice, but that what is generally called <hi>chance</hi> was to
               decide his success: however, he hoped for the best; and in these hopes, by an
               intemperate confidence in the fortitude of his head, and the depth of his discretion,
                     <hi><ref target="a022" corresp="n022">Mynheer</ref></hi> might possibly overset

            <p>Even so it fares with the poor Traveller, sailing and posting through the politer
               kingdoms of the globe <pb n="31" facs="tcp:1269300201:52"/> in pursuit of knowledge
               and improvements.</p>
            <p>Knowledge and improvements are to be got by sailing and posting for that purpose; but
               whether useful knowledge and real improvements, is all a lottery—and even where the
               adventurer is successful, the acquired stock must be used with caution and sobriety
               to turn to any profit—but as the chances run prodigiously the other way both as to
               the acquisition and application, I am of opinion, That a man would act as wisely, if
               he could prevail upon himself, to live contented without foreign knowledge or foreign
               improvements, especially <pb n="32" facs="tcp:1269300201:53"/> if he lives in a
               country that has no absolute want of either—and indeed, much grief of heart has it
               oft and many a time cost me, when I have observed how many a foul step the
               inquisitive Traveller has measured to see sights and look into discoveries; all
               which, as <ref target="a022b" corresp="n022b">Sancho Panca said to Don Quixote</ref>,

               with others—Knowledge in most of its branches, and in most affairs, is like music in

            <p>I Perceived that something darken'd the passage more than myself, as I stepp'd along
               it to my room; it was effectually Mons. Dessein, the master of the hôtel, who had
               just return'd from vespers, and, with his hat under his arm, was most complaisantly
               following me, to put me in mind of my wants. I had wrote myself pretty well out of
               conceit with the <hi>Desobligeant;</hi> and Mons. Dessein speaking of it, with a
               shrug, as if it would no way suit me, it immediately struck my fancy that it belong'd
               to some <hi>innocent traveller,</hi> who, on his <pb n="36" facs="tcp:1269300201:57"
               /> return home, had left it to Mons. Dessein's honour to make the most of. Four
               months had elapsed since it had finish'd its career of Europe in the corner of Mons.
               Dessein's coachyard; and having sallied out from thence but a vampt-up business at
               the first, though it had been twice taken to pieces on Mount Sennis, it had not
               profited much by its adventures—but by none so little as the standing so many months
               unpitied in the corner of Mons. Dessein's coachyard. Much indeed was not to be said
               for it—but something might—and when a few words will rescue misery out of her
               distress, I hate the man who can be a churl of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:1269300201:58"/> —Now was I the master of this hôtel, said I,
               laying the point of my fore-finger on Mons. Dessein's breast, I would inevitably make
               a point of getting rid of this unfortunate <hi>Desobligeant</hi>—itstands swinging

               persuaded, to a man who feels for others as well as for himself, every rainy night,
               disguise it as you will, must cast a damp upon your spirits—You suffer, Mons.

            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:1269300201:59"/> I have always observed, when there is as much
                  <hi>sour</hi> as <hi>sweet</hi> in a compliment, that an Englishman is eternally
               at a loss within himself, whether to take it, or let it alone: a Frenchman never is:
               Mons. Dessein made me a bow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>C'est bien vrai,</hi> said he—But in this case I should only exchange one

               giving you a chaise which would fall to pieces before you had got half way to
               Paris—figure to yourself how much I should suffer, in giving an ill impression of

            <p>IT must needs be a hostile kind of a world, when the buyer (if it be but of a sorry

            <p>—And is all this to be lighted up in the heart for a beggarly account of three or
               four louisd'ors, which is the most I can be overreach'd in?—Base passion! said I,

               raising her hand up to her forehead, for I had turned full in front upon the lady
               whom I had seen in conference with the monk—she had followed us unperceived—Heaven
               forbid indeed! said I, offering her my own—she had <ref target="a067" corresp="n067"
                  >a black pair of silk gloves</ref> open only at the thumb and two forefingers, so
               accepted it without reserve—and I led her up to the door of the Remise.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>Dessein</hi> had <hi>diabled</hi> the key above fifty times before he
               found out he had come with a wrong one in his hand: we were as impatient as himself

               obstacle, that I continued holding her hand almost without knowing it; so that
               Monsieur <hi>Dessein</hi> left us together with her hand in mine, and with our faces

            <p>WHEN I told the reader that I did not care to get out of the <hi>Desobligeant,</hi>
               because I saw the monk in close conference with a lady just arrived at the inn—I told
               him the truth; but I did not tell him the whole truth; for I was full as much
               restrained by the appearance and figure of the lady he was talking to. Suspicion
               crossed my brain, and said, he was telling her what had passed: something jarred upon
               it within me—I wished him at his convent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:1269300201:67"/> When the heart flies out before the
               understanding, it saves the judgment a world of pains—I was certain she was of a
               better order of beings—however, I thought no more of her, but went on and wrote my
               preface.</p>
            <p>The impression returned, upon my encounter with her in the street; a guarded
               frankness with which she gave me her hand, shewed, I thought, her good education and
               her good sense; and as I led her on, I felt a pleasurable ductility about her, which
               spread a calmness over all my spirits—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:1269300201:68"/> —Good God! how a man might lead such a creature
               as this round the world with him!—</p>
            <p>I had not yet seen her face—'twas not material; for the drawing was instantly set
               about, and long before we had got to the door of the Remise, <hi>Fancy</hi> had
               finished the whole head, and pleased herself as much with its fitting her goddess, as

               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:1269300201:69"/> When we had got to the door of the Remise, she
               withdrew her hand from across her forehead, and let me see the original—it was a face
               of about six and twenty—of a clear transparent brown, simply set off without rouge or
               powder—it was not critically handsome, but there was that in it, which in the frame
               of mind I was in, which attached me much more to it—it was interesting; I fancied it
               wore the characters of a widow'd look, and in that state of its declension, which had
               passed the two first paroxysms of sorrow, and was quietly beginning to reconcile
               itself to its loss—but a thousand other distresses might have traced the same lines;
               I wish'd to know <pb n="49" facs="tcp:1269300201:70"/> what they had been—and was
               ready to enquire, (had the same <hi>bon ton</hi> of conversation permitted, as in the

            <p>Such were my temptations—and in this disposition to give way to them, was I left

            <p>THIS certainly, fair lady! said I, raising her hand up a little lightly as I began,
               must be <ref target="a030" corresp="n030">one of Fortune's whimsical doings</ref>: to
               take two utter strangers by their hands—of different sexes, and perhaps from
               different corners of the globe, and in one moment place them together in such a
               cordial situation, as Friendship herself could scarce have atchieved for them, had
               she projected it for a month—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:1269300201:72"/> —And your reflection upon it, shews how much,

            <p>When the situation is, what we would wish, nothing is so ill-timed as to hint at the
               circumstances which make it so: you thank Fortune, continued she—you had reason—the
               heart knew it, and was satisfied; and who but an English philosopher would have sent
               notices of it to the brain to reverse the judgment?</p>
            <p>In saying this, she disengaged her hand with a look which I thought a sufficient
               commentary upon the text.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:1269300201:73"/> It is a miserable picture which I am going to
               give of the weakness of my heart, by owning, that it suffered a pain, which worthier
               occasions could not have inflicted.—I was mortified with the loss of her hand, and
               the manner in which I had lost it carried neither oil nor wine to the wound: I never
               felt the pain of a sheepish inferiority so miserably in my life.</p>
            <p>The triumphs of a true feminine heart are short upon these discomfitures. In a very
               few seconds she laid her hand upon the cuff of my coat, in order to finish her reply;
               so some way or other, God knows how, I regained my situation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:1269300201:74"/> —She had nothing to add.</p>
            <p>I forthwith began to model a different conversation for the lady, thinking from the
               spirit as well as moral of this, that I had been mistaken in her character; but upon
               turning her face towards me, the spirit which had animated the reply was fled—the
               muscles relaxed, and I beheld the same unprotected look of distress which first won
               me to her interest—melancholy! to see such sprightliness the prey of sorrow.—I pitied
               her from my soul; and though it may seem ridiculous enough to a torpid heart,—I could
               have taken her into my arms, and cherished her, <pb n="54" facs="tcp:1269300201:75"/>
               though it was in the open street, without blushing.</p>
            <p>The pulsations of the arteries along my fingers pressing across hers, told her what
               was passing within me: she looked down—a silence of some moments followed.</p>
            <p>I fear, in this interval, I must have made some slight efforts towards a closer
               compression of her hand, from a subtle sensation I felt in the palm of my own—not as
               if she was going to withdraw hers—but, as if she thought about it—and I had
               infallibly lost it a second time, had not instinct more than reason directed me to
               the last resource <pb n="55" facs="tcp:1269300201:76"/> in these dangers—to hold it
               loosely, and in a manner as if I was every moment going to release it, of myself; so
               she let it continue, till Monsieur <hi>Dessein</hi> returned with the key; and in the
               mean time I set myself to consider how I should undo the ill impressions which the
               poor monk's story, in case he had told it her, must have planted in her breast
               against me.</p>

            <head>THE <ref target="a032" corresp="n032">SNUFF-BOX</ref>.</head>
            <head>CALAIS.</head>
            <p>THE good old monk was within six paces of us, as the idea of him cross'd my mind; and
               was advancing towards us a little out of the line, as if uncertain whether he should
               break in upon us or no.—He stopp'd, however, as soon as he came up to us, with a
               world of frankness; and having a horn snuff-box in his hand, he presented it open to
               me—You shall taste mine—said I, pulling out my box (which was a small tortoise one)
               and putting it into his hand— <pb n="57" facs="tcp:1269300201:78"/> 'Tis most
               excellent, said the monk; Then do me the favour, I replied, to accept of the box and
               all, and when you take a pinch out of it, sometimes recollect it was the
               peace-offering of a man who once used you unkindly, but not from his heart.</p>
            <p>The poor monk blush'd as red as scarlet. <hi>Mon Dieu!</hi> said he, pressing his
               hands together—you never used me unkindly.—I should think, said the lady, he is not
               likely. I blush'd in my turn; but from what movements, I leave to the few who feel to
               analyse—Excuse me, Madame, replied I—I treated him most unkindly; and from no
               provocations—'Tis impossible, said the lady.—My <pb n="58" facs="tcp:1269300201:79"/>
               God! cried the monk, with a warmth of asseveration which seemed not to belong to
               him—the fault was in me, and in the indiscretion of my zeal—the lady opposed it, and
               I joined with her in maintaining it was impossible, that a spirit so regulated as
               his, could give offence to any.</p>
            <p>I knew not that contention could be rendered so sweet and pleasurable a thing to the
               nerves as I then felt it.—We remained silent, without any sensation of that foolish
               pain which takes place, when in such a circle you look for ten minutes in one
               another's faces without saying a word. Whilst this lasted, the monk rubb'd his horn
               box upon the sleeve of his tunick; <pb n="59" facs="tcp:1269300201:80"/> and as soon
               as it had acquired a little air of brightness by the friction—he made a low bow, and
               said, 'twas too late to say whether it was the weakness or goodness of our tempers
               which had involved us in this contest—but be it as it would—he begg'd we might
               exchange boxes—In saying this, he presented his to me with one hand, as he took mine
               from me in the other; and having kiss'd it—with a stream of good nature in his eyes
               he put it into his bosom—and took his leave.</p>
            <p>I guard this box, as I would the instrumental parts of my religion, to help my mind
               on to something better: in truth, I seldom go abroad <pb n="60"
                  facs="tcp:1269300201:81"/> without it; and oft and many a time have I called up by
               it the courteous spirit of its owner to regulate my own, in the justlings of the
               world; they had found full employment for his, as I learnt from his story, till about
               the forty-fifth year of his age, when upon some military services ill requited, and
               meeting at the same time with a disappointment in the tenderest of passions, he
               abandon'd the sword and the sex together, and took sanctuary, not so much in his
               convent as in himself.</p>
            <p>I feel a damp upon my spirits, as I am going to add, that in my last return through
               Calais, upon inquiring after Father Lorenzo, I heard <pb n="61"
                  facs="tcp:1269300201:82"/> he had been dead near three months, and was buried, not
               in his convent, but, according to his desire, in a little cimetiery belonging to it,
               about two leagues off: I had a strong desire to see where they had laid him—when,
               upon pulling out his little horn box, as I sat by his grave, and plucking up a nettle
               or two at the head of it, which had no business to grow there, they all struck
               together so forcibly upon my affections, that I burst into a flood of tears—but I am
               as weak as a woman; and I beg the world not to smile, but pity me.</p>

            <head>THE REMISE DOOR.</head>
            <head>CALAIS.</head>
            <p>I HAD never quitted the lady's hand all this time; and had held it so long, that it
               would have been indecent to have let it go, without first pressing it to my lips: the
               blood and spirits, which had suffer'd a revulsion from her, crouded back to her, as I
               did it.</p>
            <p>Now the two travellers who had spoke to me in the coach-yard, happening at that
               crisis to be passing by, and observing our communications, naturally took it into
               their heads that <pb n="63" facs="tcp:1269300201:84"/> we must be <hi>man and
                  wife</hi> at least; so stopping as soon as they came up to the door of the Remise,
               the one of them, who was the inquisitive traveller, ask'd us, if we set out for Paris
               the next morning?—I could only answer for myself, I said; and the lady added, she was
               for <ref target="a033" corresp="n033">Amiens</ref>.—We dined there yesterday, said
               the simple traveller—You go directly through the town, added the other, in your road
               to Paris. I was going to return a thousand thanks for the intelligence, <hi>that
                  Amiens was in the road to Paris;</hi> but, upon pulling out my poor monk's little
               horn box to take a pinch of snuff—I made them a quiet bow, and wishing them a <pb
                  n="64" facs="tcp:1269300201:85"/> good passage to Dover—they left us alone—</p>
            <p>—Now where would be the harm, said I to myself, if I was to beg of this distressed
               lady to accept of half of my chaise?—and what mighty mischief could ensue?</p>
            <p>Every dirty passion, and bad propensity in my nature, took the alarm, as I stated the
               proposition—It will oblige you to have a third horse, said AVARICE, which will put
               twenty livres out of your pocket.—You know not who she is, said CAUTION—or what
               scrapes the affair may draw you into, whisper'd COWARDICE—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:1269300201:86"/> Depend upon it, Yorick! said DISCRETION, 'twill
               be said you went off with a mistress, and came by assignation to Calais for that
               purpose—</p>
            <p>—You can never after, cried HYPOCRISY aloud, shew your face in the world—or rise,
               quoth MEANNESS, in the church—or be any thing in it, said PRIDE, but a lousy
               prebendary.</p>
            <p>—But 'tis a civil thing, said I—and as I generally act from the first impulse, and
               therefore seldom listen to these cabals, which serve no purpose, that I know of, but
               to encompass the heart with adamant—I turn'd instantly about to the lady—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:1269300201:87"/> —But she had glided off unperceived, as the
               cause was pleading, and had made ten or a dozen paces down the street, by the time I
               had made the determination; so I set off after her with a long stride, to make her
               the proposal with the best address I was master of; but observing she walk'd with her
               cheek half resting upon the palm of her hand—with the slow, short-measur'd step of
               thoughtfulness, and with her eyes, as she went step by step, fix'd upon the ground,
               it struck me, she was trying the same cause herself.—God help her! said I, she has
               some mother-in-law, or tartufish aunt, or nonsensical old woman, to consult upon the
               occasion, as well as myself: so not caring <pb n="67" facs="tcp:1269300201:88"/> to
               interrupt the processe, and deeming it more gallant to take her at discretion than by
               surprize, I faced about, and took a short turn or two before the door of the Remise,
               whilst she walk'd musing on one side.</p>

            <p>HAVING, on first sight of the lady, settled the affair in my fancy, <q

               laid it down as a second <ref target="a034" corresp="n034">axiom</ref>, as
               indisputable as the first, That she was a widow, and wore a character of distress—I
               went no further; I got ground enough for the situation which pleased me—and had she
               remained close beside my elbow till midnight, I should have held true to my system,
               and considered her only under that general idea.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:1269300201:90"/> She had scarce got twenty paces distant from
               me, ere something within me called out for a more particular inquiry—it brought on
               the idea of a further separation—I might possibly never see her more—the heart is for
               saving what it can; and I wanted the traces thro' which my wishes might find their
               way to her, in case I should never rejoin her myself: in a word, I wish'd to know her
               name—her family's—her condition; and as I knew the place to which she was going, I
               wanted to know from whence she came: but there was no coming at all this
               intelligence: a hundred little delicacies stood in the way. I form'd a score
               different plans—There was <pb n="70" facs="tcp:1269300201:91"/> no such thing as a
               man's asking her directly—the thing was impossible.</p>
            <p>A little French <hi>debonaire</hi> captain, who came dancing down the street, shewed
               me, it was the easiest thing in the world; for popping in betwixt us, just as the
               lady was returning back to the door of the Remise, he introduced himself to my
               acquaintance, and before he had well got announced, begg'd I would do him the honour
               to present him to the lady—I had not been presented myself—so turning about to her,
               he did it just as well by asking her, if she had come from Paris?—No: she was going
               that rout, she said.—<hi>Vous n'etez pas de Londre?</hi>—She was not, she
               replied.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:1269300201:92"/> —Then Madame must have come thro'
                  Flanders.—<hi>Apparamment vous etez Flammande?</hi> said the French captain.—The
               lady answered, she was.—<hi>Peutetre, de Lisle?</hi> added he—She said, she was not
               of Lisle.—Nor Arras?—nor Cambray?—nor Ghent?—nor Brussels? She answered, she was of
               Brussels.</p>
            <p>He had had the honour, he said, to be at the bombardment of it last war—that it was
               finely situated, <hi>pour cela</hi>—and full of noblesse when the Imperialists were
               driven out by the French (the lady made a slight curtsy)—so giving her an account of
               the affair, and of the share he had had in <pb n="72" facs="tcp:1269300201:93"/>
               it—he begg'd the honour to know her name—so made his bow.</p>
            <p>—<hi>Et Madame a son Mari?</hi>—said he, looking back when he had made two steps—and
               without staying for an answer—danced down the street.</p>

            <p>AS the little French captain left us, Mons. Dessein came up with the key of the
               Remise in his hand, and forthwith let us into his magazine of chaises.</p>
            <p>The first object which caught my eye, as Mons. Dessein open'd the door of the Remise,
               was another old tatter'd <hi>Desobligeant:</hi> and notwithstanding it was the exact
               picture of that which had hit my fancy so much in the coach-yard but an hour
               before—the very sight of it stirr'd up a <pb n="74" facs="tcp:1269300201:95"/>
               disagreeable sensation within me now; and I thought 'twas a churlish beast into whose
               heart the idea could first enter, to construct such a machine; nor had I much more
               charity for the man who could think of using it.</p>
            <p>I observed the lady was as little taken with it as myself: so Mons. Dessein led us on
               to a couple of chaises which stood abreast, telling us as he recommended them, that
               they had been purchased by my Lord A. and B. to go the <hi><ref target="a035"
                     corresp="n035">grand tour</ref>,</hi> but had gone no further than Paris, so
               were in all respects as good as new—They were too good—so I pass'd on to a third,
               which stood behind, and forthwith began to chaffer for the <pb n="75"
                  facs="tcp:1269300201:96"/> price—But 'twill scarce hold two, said I, opening the
               door and getting in—Have the goodness, Madam, said Mons. Dessein, offering his arm,
               to step in—The lady hesitated half a second, and stepp'd in; and the waiter that
               moment beckoning to speak to Mons. Dessein, he shut the door of the chaise upon us,
               and left us.</p>

               <hi>C'EST bien comique,</hi> 'tis very droll, said the lady smiling, from the
               reflection that this was the second time we had been left together by a parcel of
               nonsensical contingencies—<hi>c'est bien comique,</hi> said she—</p>
            <p>—There wants nothing, said I, to make it so, but the comick use which the <ref
                  target="a036" corresp="n036">gallantry</ref> of a Frenchman would put it to—to
               make love the first moment, and an offer of his person the second.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:1269300201:98"/> 'Tis their <hi>fort:</hi> replied the lady.</p>
            <p>It is supposed so at least—and how it has come to pass, continued I, I know not; but
               they have certainly got the credit of understanding more of love, and making it
               better than any other nation upon earth: but for my own part I think them errant
               bunglers, and in truth the worst set of marksmen that ever tried Cupid's
               patience.</p>
            <p>—To think of making love by <hi>sentiments!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I should as soon think of making a genteel suit of cloaths out of remnants:—and to do

                  facs="tcp:1269300201:99"/> the offer and themselves with it, to be sifted, with
               all their <hi>pours</hi> and <hi>contres,</hi> by an unheated mind.</p>
            <p>The lady attended as if she expected I should go on.</p>
            <p>Consider then, madam, continued I, laying my hand upon hers—</p>
            <p>That grave people hate Love for the name's sake—</p>
            <p>That selfish people hate it for their own—</p>
            <p>Hypocrites for heaven's—</p>
            <p>And that all of us both old and young, being ten times worse <pb n="79"
                  facs="tcp:1269300201:100"/> frighten'd than hurt by the very <hi>report</hi>—What
               a want of knowledge in this branch of commerce a man betrays, whoever lets the word
               come out of his lips, till an hour or two at least after the time, that his silence
               upon it becomes tormenting. A course of small, quiet attentions, not so pointed as to
               alarm—nor so vague as to be misunderstood,—with now and then a look of kindness, and
               little or nothing said upon it—leaves Nature for your mistress, and she fashions it
               to her mind.—</p>
            <p>Then I solemnly declare, said the lady, blushing—you have been making love to me all
               this while.</p>

               </gap> her brother was just arrived at the hotel. Though I had infinite good will for
               the lady, I cannot say, that I rejoiced in my heart at the event—and could not help
               telling her so—for it is fatal to a proposal, Madam, said I, that I was going to make
               you—</p>
            <p>—You need not tell me what the proposal was, said she, laying her <pb n="81"

               determined to accept it.—If I had—(she stopped a moment)—I believe your good will
               would have drawn a story from me, which would have made pity the only dangerous thing

               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:1269300201:103"/> In saying this, she suffered me to kiss her

            <p>I HAD once lost my portmanteau from behind my chaise, and twice got out in the rain,
               and one of the times up to the knees in dirt, to help the postilion to tie it on,
               without being able to find out what was wanting—Nor was it till I got to Montriul,
               upon the landlord's asking me if I wanted not a servant, that it occurred to me, that
               that was the very thing.</p>
            <p>A servant! That I do most sadly, quoth I—Because, Monsieur, said the landlord, there
               is a clever young fellow, <pb n="91" facs="tcp:1269300201:114"/> who would be very
               proud of the honour to serve an Englishman—But why an English one, more than any
               other?—They are so generous, said the landlord—I'll be shot if this is not a livre
               out of my pocket, quoth I to myself, this very night—But they have wherewithal to be
               so, Monsieur, added he—Set down one livre more for that, quoth I—It was but last
               night, said the landlord, <hi>qu'un my Lord Anglois presentoit un ecu a la fille de

            <p>Now Janatone being the landlord's daughter, and the landlord supposing I was young in
               French, took the liberty to inform me, I should <pb n="92" facs="tcp:1269300201:115"

               there is nothing. It comes to the same thing, said I. <hi>Pardonnez moi,</hi> said
               the landlord.</p>
            <p>I cannot take a fitter opportunity to observe once for all, that <hi>tant pis</hi>
               and <hi>tant mieux</hi> being two of the great hinges in French conversation, a

               </gap>, who is a man of an excellent heart, return'd thanks for both.</p>
            <p>When the landlord had set me right in this matter, he called in La Fleur, which was
               the name of the young man he had spoke of—saying only first, That as for his talents,
               he would presume to say nothing—Monsieur was the best judge what would suit him; but
               for the fidelity of La Fleur, he would stand responsible in all he was worth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:1269300201:117"/> The landlord deliver'd this in a manner which
               instantly set my mind to the business I was upon—and La Fleur, who stood waiting
               without, in that breathless expectation which every son of nature of us have felt in
               our turns, came in.</p>

               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:1269300201:121"/> the fellow determined the matter at once in
               his favour; so I hired him first—and then began to inquire what he could do: But I
               shall find out his talents, quoth I, as I want them—besides, a Frenchman can do every

            <p>Now poor La Fleur could do nothing in the world but beat a drum, and play a march or

               to be enough for me—So supper coming in, and having a frisky English spaniel on one
               side of my chair, and a French valet, with as much hilarity in his countenance as

            <p>AS La Fleur went the whole tour of France and Italy with me, and will be often upon
               the stage, I must interest the reader a little further in his behalf, by saying, that
               I had never less reason to repent of the impulses which generally do determine me,
               than in regard to this fellow—he was a faithful, affectionate, simple soul as ever
               trudged after the heels of a philosopher; and notwithstanding his talents of
               drum-beating and spatterdash-making, which, tho' very good in themselves, happen'd to
               be of no great service to me, yet <pb n="101" facs="tcp:1269300201:126"/> was I
               hourly recompenced by the festivity of his temper—it supplied all defects—I had a
               constant resource in his looks in all difficulties and distresses of my own—I was
               going to have added, of his too; but La Fleur was out of the reach of every thing;
               for whether 'twas hunger or thirst; or cold or nakedness, or watchings, or whatever
               stripes of ill luck La Fleur met with in our journeyings, there was no index in his
               physiognomy to point them out by—he was eternally the same; so that if I am a piece
               of a philosopher, which Satan now and then puts it into my head I am—it always
               mortifies the pride of the conceit, by reflecting how much I owe to the complexional
               philosophy <pb n="102" facs="tcp:1269300201:127"/> of this poor fellow, for shaming
               me into one of a better kind. With all this, La Fleur had a small cast of the
               coxcomb—but he seemed at first sight to be more a coxcomb of nature than of art; and
               before I had been three days in Paris with him—he seemed to be no coxcomb at all.</p>

            <p>THE next morning La Fleur entering upon his employment, I delivered to him the key of
               my portmanteau with an inventory of my half a dozen shirts and silk pair of breeches;
               and bid him fasten all upon the chaise—get the horses put to—and desire the landlord
               to come in with his bill.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>C'est un garçon de bonne fortune,</hi> said the landlord, pointing through the
               window to half a dozen wenches who had got round about La Fleur, and were most kindly
               taking their leave of him, as the postilion was leading out the horses. La Fleur
               kissed all their hands round and <pb n="104" facs="tcp:1269300201:129"/> round again,
               and thrice he wiped his eyes, and thrice he promised he would bring them all pardons
               from Rome.</p>
            <p>The young fellow, said the landlord, is beloved by all the town, and there is scarce
               a corner in Montriul where the want of him will not be felt: he has but one
               misfortune in the world, continued he, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"He is always in
                  love."</q>—I am heartily glad of it, said I,—'twill save me the trouble every
               night of putting my breeches under my head. In saying this, I was making not so much
               La Fleur's eloge, as my own, having been in love with one princess or another almost
               all my life, and I <pb n="105" facs="tcp:1269300201:130"/> hope I shall go on so,
               till I die, being firmly persuaded, that if ever I do a mean action, it must be in
               some interval betwixt one passion and another: whilst this interregnum lasts, I
               always perceive my heart locked up—I can scarce find in it, to give Misery a
               sixpence; and therefore I always get out of it as fast as I can, and the moment I am
               rekindled, I am all generosity and good will again; and would do any thing in the

            <head>A FRAGMENT.</head>
            <p>—THE town of Abdera, notwithstanding Democritus lived there trying all the powers of
               irony and laughter to reclaim it, was the vilest and most profligate town in all
               Thrace. What for poisons, conspiracies and assassinations—libels, <ref target="a045"
                  corresp="n045">pasquinades</ref> and tumults, there was no going there by
               day—'twas worse by night.</p>
            <p>Now, when things were at the worst, it came to pass, that the Andromeda of Euripides
               being represented at Abdera, the whole orchestra was delighted with it: but of all
               the <pb n="107" facs="tcp:1269300201:132"/> passages which delighted them, nothing
               operated more upon their imaginations, than the tender strokes of nature which the
               poet had wrought up in that pathetic speech of <ref target="a046" corresp="n046"
                  >Perseus</ref>,<q>
                  <hi>O Cupid, prince of God and men,</hi> &amp;c.</q> Every man almost spoke pure
               iambics the next day, and talk'd of nothing but Perseus his pathetic address—<q
                  rend="inline margQuotes">"O Cupid! prince of God and men"</q>—in every street of
               Abdera, in every house—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"O Cupid! Cupid!"</q>—in every
               mouth, like the natural notes of some sweet melody which drops from it whether it
               will or no—nothing but <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Cupid! Cupid! prince of God and
                  men"</q>—The fire caught—and the whole city, like <pb n="108"
                  facs="tcp:1269300201:133"/> the heart of one man, open'd itself to Love.</p>
            <p>No pharmacopolist could sell one grain of helebore—not a single armourer had a heart
               to forge one instrument of death—Friendship and Virtue met together, and kiss'd each

               and every Abderitish woman left her purple web, and chastly sat her down and listen'd

            <p>'Twas only in the power, says the Fragment, of the God whose empire <pb n="109"

            <p>WHEN all is ready, and every article is disputed and paid for in the inn, unless you
               are a little sour'd by the adventure, there is always a matter to compound at the
               door, before you can get into your chaise; and that is with the sons and daughters of
               poverty, who surround you. Let no man say, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"let them go
                  to the devil"</q>—'tis a cruel journey to send a few miserables, and they have had
               sufferings enow without it: I always think it better to take a few sous out in my
               hand; and I would counsel every gentle traveller <pb n="111"
                  facs="tcp:1269300201:136"/> to do so likewise: he need not be so exact in setting
               down his motives for giving them—they will be register'd elsewhere.</p>
            <p>For my own part, there is no man gives so little as I do; for few that I know have so
               little to give: but as this was the first publick act of my charity in France, I took
               the more notice of it.</p>
            <p>A well-a-way! said I. I have but eight sous in the world, shewing them in my hand,
               and there are eight poor men and eight poor women for 'em.</p>
            <p>A poor tatter'd soul without a shirt on instantly withdrew his claim, by <pb n="112"
                  facs="tcp:1269300201:137"/> retiring two steps out of the circle, and making a
               disqualifying bow on his part. Had the whole parterre cried out, <hi><ref
                     target="a046c" corresp="n046c">Place aux dames</ref>,</hi> with one voice, it
               would not have conveyed the sentiment of a deference for the sex with half the
               effect.</p>
            <p>Just heaven! for what wise reasons hast thou order'd it, that beggary and urbanity,
               which are at such variance in other countries, should find a way to be at unity in
               this?</p>
            <p>—I insisted upon presenting him with a single sous, merely for his <hi><ref
                     target="a047" corresp="n047">politesse</ref>.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:1269300201:138"/> A poor little dwarfish brisk fellow, who
               stood over-against me in the circle, putting something first under his arm, which had
               once been a hat, took his snuff-box out of his pocket, and generously offer'd a pinch
               on both sides of him: it was a gift of consequence, and modestly declined—The poor
               little fellow press'd it upon them with a nod of welcomeness—<hi>Prenez
                  en</hi>—<hi>prenez,</hi> said he, looking another way; so they each took a
               pinch—Pity thy box should ever want one! said I to myself; so I put a couple of sous
               into it—taking a small pinch out of his box, to enhance their value, as I did it—He
               felt the weight of the second obligation more than that of the first—'twas <pb
                  n="114" facs="tcp:1269300201:139"/> doing him an honour—the other was only doing
               him a charity—and he made me a bow down to the ground for it.</p>
            <p>—Here! said I to an old soldier with one hand, who had been campaign'd and worn out
               to death in the service—here's a couple of sous for thee—<hi>Vive le Roi!</hi> said
               the old soldier.</p>
            <p>I had then but three sous left: so I gave one, simply <hi>pour l'amour de Dieu,</hi>
               which was the footing on which it was begg'd—The poor woman had a dislocated hip; so
               it could not be well, upon any other motive.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:1269300201:140"/>
               <hi>Mon cher et tres charitable Monsieur</hi>—There's no opposing this, said I.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord Anglois</hi>—the very sound was worth the money—so I gave <hi>my last
                  sous for it.</hi> But in the eagerness of giving, I had overlook'd a <hi>pauvre
                  honteux,</hi> who had no one to ask a sous for him, and who, I believed, would
               have perish'd, ere he could have ask'd one for himself: he stood by the chaise a
               little without the circle, and wiped a tear from a face which I thought had seen
               better days—Good God! said I—and I have not one single sous left to give him—But you
               have a thousand! cried all the powers of nature, stirring within me—so I gave him—no
               matter what—I am <pb n="116" facs="tcp:1269300201:141"/> ashamed to say <hi>how
                  much,</hi> now—and was ashamed to think, how little, then: so if the reader can
               form any conjecture of my disposition, as these two fixed points are given him, he
               may judge within a livre or two what was the precise sum.</p>
            <p>I could afford nothing for the rest, but, <hi>Dieu vous benisse</hi>—<hi>Et le bon
                  Dieu vous benisse encore</hi>—said the old soldier, the dwarf, &amp;c. The
                  <hi>pauvre honteux</hi> could say nothing—he pull'd out a little handkerchief, and
               wiped his face as he turned away—and I thought he thank'd me more than them all.</p>

            <head>THE <ref target="a048" corresp="n048">BIDET</ref>.</head>
            <p>HAVING settled all these little matters, I got into my postchaise with more ease than
               ever I got into a post-chaise in my life; and La Fleur having got one large jackboot
               on the far side of a little <hi>bidet</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Post horse.</note>, and another on this (for I count
               nothing of his legs)—he canter'd away before me as happy and as perpendicular as a
               prince.—</p>
            <p>—But what is happiness! what is grandeur in this painted scene of life! A dead ass,
               before we had got a league, put a sudden stop to La Fleur's career—his bidet would
               not <pb n="118" facs="tcp:1269300201:143"/> pass by it—a contention arose betwixt
               them, and the poor fellow was kick'd out of his jack-boots the very first kick.</p>
            <p>La Fleur bore his fall like a French christian, saying neither more or less upon it,
               than, Diable! so presently got up and came to the charge again astride his bidet,
               beating him up to it as he would have beat his drum.</p>
            <p>The bidet flew from one side of the road to the other, then back again—then this
               way—then that way, and in short every way but by the dead ass.—La Fleur insisted upon
               the thing—and the bidet threw him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:1269300201:144"/> What's the matter, La Fleur, said I, with
               this bidet of thine?—<hi>Monsieur,</hi> said he, <hi>c'est un cheval le plus
                  opiniatré du monde</hi>—Nay, if he is a conceited beast, he must go his own way,
               replied I—so La Fleur got off him, and giving him a good sound lash, the bidet took
               me at my word, and away he scamper'd back to Montriul.—<hi>Peste!</hi> said La
               Fleur.</p>
            <p>It is not <hi>mal a propos</hi> to take notice here, that tho' La Fleur availed
               himself but of two different terms of exclamation in this encounter—namely,
                  <hi>Diable!</hi> and <hi>Peste!</hi> that there are nevertheless three, in the
               French language; like the positive, comparative, and superlative, one or <pb n="120"
                  facs="tcp:1269300201:145"/> the other of which serve for every unexpected throw of
               the dice in life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Le Diable!</hi> which is the first, and positive degree, is generally used upon
               ordinary emotions of the mind, where small things only fall out contrary to your
               expectations—such as—the throwing once doublets—La Fleur's being kick'd off his
               horse, and so forth—cuckoldom, for the same reason, is always—<hi>Le Diable!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in cases where the cast has something provoking in it, as in that of the bidet's
               running away after, and leaving La Fleur aground in jack-boots—'tis the second
               degree.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:1269300201:146"/> 'Tis then <hi>Peste!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the third—</p>
            <p>—But here my heart is wrung with pity and fellow-feeling, when I reflect what
               miseries must have been their lot, and how bitterly so refined a people must have
               smarted, to have forced them upon the use of it.—</p>
            <p>Grant me, O ye powers which touch the tongue with eloquence in distress!—whatever is
               my <hi>cast,</hi> Grant me but decent words to exclaim in, and I will give my nature
               way.</p>
            <p>—But as these were not to be had in France, I resolved to take every <pb n="120"
                  facs="tcp:1269300201:147"/>

               exclamation at all.</p>
            <p>La Fleur, who had made no such covenant with himself, followed the bidet with his
               eyes till it was got out of sight—and then, you may imagine, if you please, with what
               word he closed the whole affair.</p>
            <p>As there was no hunting down a frighten'd horse in jack-boots, there remained no
               alternative but taking La Fleur either behind the chaise, or into it.—</p>
            <p>I preferred the latter, and in half an hour we got to the post-house at Nampont.</p>

            <head>THE DEAD ASS.</head>
            <p>—AND this, said he, putting the remains of a crust into his wallet—and this, should
               have been thy portion, said he, hadst thou been alive to have shared it with me. I
               thought by the accent, it had been an apostrophe to his child; but 'twas to his ass,
               and to the very ass we had seen dead in the road, which had occasioned La Fleur's
               misadventure. The man seemed to lament it much; and it instantly brought into my mind
               Sancho's lamentation <pb n="124" facs="tcp:1269300201:151"/> for his; but he did it
               with more true touches of nature.</p>
            <p>The mourner was sitting upon a stone bench at the door, with the ass's pannel and its
               bridle on one side, which he took up from time to time—then laid them down—look'd at
               them and shook his head. He then took his crust of bread out of his wallet again, as
               if to eat it; held it some time in his hand—then laid it upon the bit of his ass's
               bridle—looked wistfully at the little arrangement he had made—and then gave a
               sigh.</p>
            <p>The simplicity of his grief drew numbers about him, and La Fleur <pb n="125"
                  facs="tcp:1269300201:152"/> amongst the rest, whilst the horses were getting
               ready; as I continued sitting in the post-chaise, I could see and hear over their
               heads.</p>
            <p>—He said he had come last from Spain, where he had been from the furthest borders of
               Franconia; and had got so far on his return home, when his ass died. Every one seem'd
               desirous to know what business could have taken so old and poor a man so far a
               journey from his own home.</p>
            <p>It had pleased heaven, he said, to bless him with three sons, the finest lads in all
               Germany; but having in one week lost two of the eldest of them by the small-pox, and
               the <pb n="126" facs="tcp:1269300201:153"/> youngest falling ill of the same
               distemper, he was afraid of being bereft of them all; and made a vow, if Heaven would
               not take him from him also, he would go in gratitude to St. Iago in Spain.</p>
            <p>When the mourner got thus far on his story, he stopp'd to pay nature her tribute—and
               wept bitterly.</p>
            <p>He said, Heaven had accepted the conditions; and that he had set out from his cottage
               with this poor creature, who had been a patient partner of his journey—that it had
               eat the same bread with him all the way, and was unto him as a friend.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:1269300201:154"/> Every body who stood about, heard the poor
               fellow with concern——La Fleur offered him money.—The mourner said, he did not want
               it—it was not the value of the ass—but the loss of him.—The ass, he said, he was
               assured loved him—and upon this told them a long story of a mischance upon their
               passage over the Pyrenean mountains which had separated them from each other three
               days; during which time the ass had sought him as much as he had sought the ass, and
               that they had neither scarce eat or drank till they met.</p>
            <p>Thou hast one comfort, friend, said I, at least in the loss of thy poor beast; I'm
               sure thou hast been a merciful <pb n="128" facs="tcp:1269300201:155"/> master to
               him.—Alas! said the mourner, I thought so, when he was alive—but now that he is dead
               I think otherwise.—I fear the weight of myself and my afflictions together have been
               too much for him—they have shortened the poor creature's days, and I fear I have them
               to answer for.—Shame on the world! said I to myself—Did we love each other, as this
               poor soul but loved his ass—'twould be something.—</p>

            <p>THE concern which the poor fellow's story threw me into, required some attention: the

               beasts, and set off clattering like a thousand devils.</p>
            <p>I called to him as loud as I could, for heaven's sake to go slower—and the louder I
               called the more unmercifully he galloped.—The deuce take him and his galloping
               too—said I—he'll go on tearing my nerves to pieces till he has worked me into a
               foolish passion, and then he'll go slow, that I may enjoy the sweets of it.</p>
            <p>The postillion managed the point to a miracle: by the time he had got <pb n="131"
                  facs="tcp:1269300201:158"/> to the foot of a steep hill about half a league from
               Nampont,—he had put me out of temper with him—and then with myself, for being so.</p>
            <p>My case then required a different treatment; and a good rattling gallop would have
               been of real service to me.—</p>
            <p>—Then, prithee get on—get on, my good lad, said I.</p>
            <p>The postillion pointed to the hill—I then tried to return back to the story of the
               poor German and his ass—but I had broke the clue—and could no more get into it again,
               than the postillion could into a trot.—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:1269300201:159"/> —The <ref target="a051" corresp="n051"

               make the best of the worst, as ever wight was, and all runs counter.</p>
            <p>There is one sweet lenitive at least for evils, which nature holds out to us; so I
               took it kindly at her hands, and fell asleep; and the first word which roused me was
                  <hi>Amiens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>—Bless me! said I, rubbing my eyes—this is the very town where my poor lady is to

            <head>AMIENS.</head>
            <p>THE words were scarce out of my mouth, when the Count de L***'s post-chaise, with his
               sister in it, drove hastily by: she had just time to make me a bow of recognition—and
               of that particular kind of it, which told me she had not yet done with me. She was as
               good as her look; for, before I had quite finished my supper, her brother's servant
               came into the room with a billet, in which she said, she had taken the liberty to
               charge me with a letter, which I was to present myself to Madame R*** the first <pb
                  n="134" facs="tcp:1269300201:161"/> morning I had nothing to do at Paris. There
               was only added, she was sorry, but from what <hi>penchant</hi> she had not
               considered, that she had been prevented telling me her story—that she still owed it
               me; and if my rout should ever lay through Brussels, and I had not by then forgot the
               name of Madame de L***—that Madame de L*** would be glad to discharge her
               obligation.</p>
            <p>Then I will meet thee, said I, fair spirit! at Brussels—'tis only returning from
               Italy through Germany to Holland, by the rout of Flanders, home—'twill scarce be ten
               posts out of my way; but were it ten thousand! with what a moral delight will <pb
                  n="135" facs="tcp:1269300201:162"/> it crown my journey, in sharing in the
               sickening incidents of a tale of misery told to me by such a sufferer? to see her
               weep! and though I cannot dry up the fountain of her tears, what an exquisite
               sensation is there still left, in wiping them away from off the cheeks of the first
               and fairest of women, as I'm sitting with my <ref target="a052" corresp="n052"
                  >handkerchief</ref> in my hand in silence the whole night besides her.</p>
            <p>There was nothing wrong in the sentiment; and yet I instantly reproached my heart
               with it in the bitterest and most reprobate of expressions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:1269300201:163"/> It had ever, as I told the reader, been one
               of the singular blessings of my life, to be almost every hour of it miserably in love
               with some one; and my last flame happening to be blown out by a whiff of jealousy on
               the sudden turn of a corner, I had lighted it up afresh at the pure taper of Eliza
               but about three months before—swearing as I did it, that it should last me through
               the whole journey—Why should I dissemble the matter? I had sworn to her eternal
               fidelity—she had a right to my whole heart—to divide my affections was to lessen
               them—to expose them, was to risk them: where there is risk, there may be loss—and
               what wilt <pb n="137" facs="tcp:1269300201:164"/> thou have, Yorick! to answer to a
               heart so full of trust and confidence—so good, so gentle and unreproaching?</p>
            <p>—I will not go to Brussels, replied I, interrupting myself—but my imagination went
               on—I recall'd her looks at that crisis of our separation when neither of us had power
               to say Adieu! I look'd at the picture she had tied in a black ribband about my
               neck—and blush'd as I look'd at it—I would have given the world to have kiss'd
               it,—but was ashamed—And shall this tender flower, said I, pressing it between my
               hands—shall it be smitten to its very root—and smitten, Yorick! <pb n="138"
                  facs="tcp:1269300201:165"/> by thee, who hast promised to shelter it in thy
               breast?</p>
            <p>Eternal fountain of happiness! said I, kneeling down upon the ground—be thou my
               witness—and every pure spirit which tastes it, be my witness also, That I would not
               travel to Brussels, unless Eliza went along with me, did the road lead me towards
               heaven.</p>
            <p>In transports of this kind, the heart, in spite of the understanding, will always say
               too much.</p>

            <head>THE LETTER.</head>
            <head>AMIENS.</head>
            <p>FORTUNE had not smiled upon La Fleur; for he had been unsuccessful in his feats of
               chivalry—and not one thing had offer'd to signalize his zeal for my service from the
               time he had enter'd into it, which was almost four and twenty hours. The poor soul
               burn'd with impatience; and the Count de L***'s servant's coming with the letter,
               being the first practicable occasion which offered, La Fleur had laid hold of it; and
               in order to do honour to his <pb n="140" facs="tcp:1269300201:167"/> master, had
               taken him into a back <ref target="a054" corresp="n054">parlour</ref> in the <ref
                  target="a055" corresp="n054">Auberge</ref>, and treated him with a cup or two of
               the best wine in Picardy; and the Count de L***'s servant in return, and not to be
               behind hand in politeness with La Fleur, had taken him back with him to the Count's
               hôtel. La Fleur's <hi>prevenancy</hi> (for there was a passport in his very looks)
               soon set every servant in the kitchen at ease with him; and as a Frenchman, whatever
               be his talents, has no sort of prudery in shewing them, La Fleur, in less than five
               minutes, had pull'd out his fife, and leading off the dance himself with the first
               note, set the <hi>fille de chambre,</hi> the <hi>maitre d'hotel,</hi> the cook, <pb
                  n="141" facs="tcp:1269300201:168"/> the scullion, and all the houshold, dogs and
               cats, besides an old monkey, a dancing: I suppose there never was a merrier kitchen
               since the flood.</p>
            <p>Madame de L***, in passing from her brother's apartments to her own, hearing so much
               jollity below stairs, rung up her <hi>fille de chambre</hi> to ask about it; and
               hearing it was the English gentleman's servant who had set the whole house merry with
               his pipe, she order'd him up.</p>
            <p>As the poor fellow could not present himself empty, he had loaden'd himself in going
               up stairs with a thousand compliments to Madame de L***, on the part of his master—

               </gap>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:1269300201:171"/> added a long apocrypha of inquiries after
               Madame de L***'s health—told her, that Monsieur his master was <hi>au desespoire</hi>
               for her re-establishment from the fatigues of her journey—and, to close all, that
               Monsieur had received the letter which Madame had done him the honour—And he has done
               me the honour, said Madame de L***, interrupting La Fleur, to send a <ref
                  target="a053" corresp="n053">billet</ref> in return.</p>
            <p>Madame de L*** had said this with such a tone of reliance upon the fact, that La
               Fleur had not power to disappoint her expectations—he trembled for my honour—and
               possibly might not altogether be unconcerned <pb n="143" facs="tcp:1269300201:172"/>
               for his own, as a man capable of being attach'd to a master who could be a wanting
                  <hi>en egards vis a vis d'une femme;</hi> so that when Madame de L*** asked La
               Fleur if he had brought a letter—<hi>O qu'oui,</hi> said La Fleur: so laying down his
               hat upon the ground, and taking hold of the flap of his right side pocket with his
               left hand, he began to search for the letter with his right—then
                  contrary-wise—<hi>Diable!</hi>—then sought every pocket—pocket by pocket, round,
               not forgetting his fob—<hi>Peste!</hi>—then La Fleur emptied them upon the
               floor—pulled out a dirty cravat—a handkerchief—a comb—a whip lash—a night-cap—then
               gave a peep <pb n="144" facs="tcp:1269300201:173"/> into his hat—<hi>Quelle
                  etourderie!</hi> He had left the letter upon the table in the Auberge—he would run
               for it, and be back with it in three minutes.</p>
            <p>I had just finished my supper when La Fleur came in to give me an account of his
               adventure: he told the whole story simply as it was; and only added, that if Monsieur
               had forgot <hi>(par hazard)</hi> to answer Madame's letter, the arrangement gave him
               an opportunity to recover the <hi>faux pas</hi>—and if not, that things were only as
               they were.</p>
            <p>Now I was not altogether sure of my <hi>etiquette,</hi> whether I ought to have wrote
               or no; but if I had—a devil <pb n="145" facs="tcp:1269300201:174"/> himself could not
               have been angry 'twas but the officious zeal of a wellmeaning creature for my honour;
               and however he might have mistook the road—or embarrassed me in so doing—his heart
               was in no fault—I was under no necessity to write—and what weighed more than all—he
               did not look as if he had done amiss.</p>
            <p>—'Tis all very well, La Fleur, said I.—'Twas sufficient. La Fleur flew out of the
               room like lightening, and return'd with <ref target="a056" corresp="n056">pen, ink,
                  and paper</ref>, in his hand; and coming up to the table, laid them close before
               me, with such a delight in his countenance, that I could not help taking up the
               pen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:1269300201:175"/> I begun and begun again; and though I had
               nothing to say, and that nothing might have been express'd in half a dozen lines, I
               made half a dozen different beginnings, and could no way please myself.</p>
            <p>In short, I was in no mood to write.</p>
            <p>La Fleur stepp'd out and brought a little water in a glass to dilute my ink—then
               fetch'd <ref target="a057" corresp="n057">sand and seal-wax</ref>—It was all one: I
               wrote, and blotted, and tore off, and burnt, and wrote again—<hi>Le Diable
                  l'emporte!</hi> said I half to myself—I cannot write this self-same letter;
               throwing the pen down despairingly as I said it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:1269300201:176"/> As soon as I had cast down the pen, La Fleur
               advanced with the most respectful carriage up to the table, and making a thousand
               apologies for the liberty he was going to take, told me he had a letter in his pocket
               wrote by a drummer in his regiment to a corporal's wife, which, he durst say, would
               suit the occasion.</p>
            <p>I had a mind to let the poor fellow have his humour—Then prithee, said I, let me see
               it.</p>
            <p>La Fleur instantly pull'd out a little dirty pocket-book cramm'd full of small
               letters and <ref target="a058" corresp="n058">billet-doux</ref> in a sad condition,
               and laying it upon the table, and then untying the string <pb n="148"
                  facs="tcp:1269300201:177"/> which held them all together, run them over one by
               one, till he came to the letter in question—<hi>La voila!</hi> said he, clapping his
               hands: so unfolding it first, he laid it before me, and retired three steps from the
               table whilst I read it.</p>

               nothing to do, but to take one ready made of his own recommendation.</p>
            <p>—But I fear, friend! said I, this buckle won't stand.—You may immerge it, replied he,
               into the ocean, and it will stand—</p>
            <p>What a great scale is every thing upon in this city! thought I—The <pb n="157"
                  facs="tcp:1269300201:188"/> utmost stretch of an English <ref target="a062b"

               'tis like time to eternity.</p>
            <p>I confess I do hate all cold conceptions, as I do the puny ideas which engender them;
               and am generally so struck with the great works of nature, that for my own part, if I
               could help it, I never would make a comparison less than a mountain at least. All
               that can be said against the French sublime in this instance of it, is this—that the

               likely I should run post a hundred miles out of it, to try the experiment—the
               Parisian barber meant nothing.—</p>
            <p>The pail of water standing besides the great deep, makes certainly but a sorry figure
               in speech—but 'twill be said—it has one advantage—'tis in the next room, and the
               truth of the buckle may be tried in it without more ado, in a single moment.</p>
            <p>In honest truth, and upon a more candid revision of the matter, <hi>The French

            <p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:1269300201:192"/> I think I can see the precise and

            <p>I was so long in getting from under my barber's hands, that it was too late of

            <p>—Pray, Madame, said I, have the goodness to tell me which way I must turn to go to
                  <ref target="a062c" corresp="n062c">the Opera comique</ref>:—Most willingly,
               Monsieur, said she, laying aside her work—</p>
            <p>I had given a cast with my eye into half a dozen shops as I came <pb n="162"
                  facs="tcp:1269300201:195"/> along in search of a face not likely to be disordered
               by such an interruption; till at last, this hitting my fancy, I had walked in.</p>
            <p>She was working <ref target="a063" corresp="n063">a pair of ruffles</ref> as she sat
               in a low chair on the far side of the shop facing the door—</p>
            <p>—<hi>Tres volentieres;</hi> most willingly, said she, laying her work down upon a
               chair next her, and rising up from the low chair she was sitting in, with so chearful
               a movement and so chearful a look, that had I been laying out fifty louis d'ors with
               her, I should have said—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"This woman is grateful."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:1269300201:196"/> You must turn, Monsieur, said she, going with
               me to the door of the shop, and pointing the way down the street I was to take—you
               must turn first to your left hand—<hi>mais prenez guarde</hi>—there are two turns;
               and be so good as to take the second—then go down a little way and you'll see a
               church, and when you are past it, give yourself the trouble to turn directly to the
               right, and that will lead you to the foot of the <hi>pont neuf,</hi> which you must
               cross—and there, any one will do himself the pleasure to shew you—</p>
            <p>She repeated her instructions three times over to me with the same good natur'd
               patience the third time <pb n="164" facs="tcp:1269300201:197"/> as the first;—and if
                  <hi>tones and manners</hi> have a meaning, which certainly they have, unless to
               hearts which shut them out—she seem'd really interested, that I should not lose
               myself.</p>
            <p>I will not suppose it was the woman's beauty, notwithstanding she was the handsomest
               grisset, I think, I ever saw, which had much to do with the sense I had of her
               courtesy; only I remember, when I told her how much I was obliged to her, that I
               looked very full in her eyes,—and that I repeated my thanks as often as she had done
               her instructions.</p>
            <p>I had not got ten paces from the door, before I found I had forgot <pb n="165"
                  facs="tcp:1269300201:198"/> every tittle of what she had said—so looking back, and
               seeing her still standing in the door of the shop as if to look whether I went right
               or not—I returned back, to ask her whether the first turn was to my right or left—for
               that I had absolutely forgot.—Is it possible! said she, half laughing.—'Tis very
               possible, replied I, when a man is thinking more of a woman, than of her good
               advice.</p>
            <p>As this was the real truth—she took it, as every woman takes a matter of right, with
               a slight courtesy.</p>
            <p>—<hi>Attendez!</hi> said she, laying her hand upon my arm to detain me, whilst she

               have the complaisance to step in, it will be ready in a moment, and he shall attend
               you to the place.—So I walk'd in with her to the far side of the shop, and taking up
               the ruffle in my hand which she laid upon the chair, as if I had a mind to sit, she
               sat down herself in her low chair, and I instantly sat myself down besides her.</p>
            <p>—He will be ready, Monsieur, said she, in a moment—And in that moment, replied I,
               most willingly would I say something very civil to you for <pb n="167"
                  facs="tcp:1269300201:202"/> all these courtesies. Any one may do a casual act of
               good nature, but a continuation of them shews it is a part of the temperature; and
               certainly, added I, if it is the same blood which comes from the heart, which
               descends to the extremes (touching her wrist) I am sure you must have one of the best
               pulses of any woman in the world—Feel it, said she, holding out her arm. So laying
               down my hat, I took hold of her fingers in one hand, and applied the two fore-fingers
               of my other to the artery—</p>
            <p>—Would to heaven! my dear Eugenius, thou hadst passed by, and beheld me sitting in my

               moralized upon my new profession?—and thou shouldst have laugh'd and moralized
               on—Trust me, my dear Eugenius, I should have said, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"there

               Yorick—</p>
            <p>—So much the better: for when my views are direct, Eugenius, I care not if all the

            <head>PARIS.</head>
            <p>I HAD counted twenty pulsations, and was going on fast towards the fortieth, when her
               husband coming unexpected from a back parlour into the shop, put me a little out in
               my reckoning—'Twas no body but her husband, she said—so I began a fresh
               score—Monsieur is so good, quoth she, as he pass'd by us, as to give himself the
               trouble of feeling my pulse—The husband took off his hat, and making me a bow, said,
               I did him too much honour—and having <pb n="170" facs="tcp:1269300201:205"/> said
               that, he put on his hat and walk'd out.</p>
            <p>Good God! said I to myself, as he went out—and can this man be the husband of this
               woman?</p>
            <p>Let it not torment the few who know what must have been the grounds of this
               exclamation, if I explain it to those who do not.</p>
            <p>In London a shopkeeper and a shopkeeper's wife seem to be one bone and one flesh: in
               the several endowments of mind and body, sometimes the one, sometimes the other has
               it, so as in general to be <ref target="a068" corresp="n068">upon a par</ref>, and to

            <p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:1269300201:206"/> In Paris, there are scarce two orders of
               beings more different: for the legislative and executive powers of the shop not
               resting in the husband, he seldom comes there—in some dark and dismal room behind, he
               sits commerceless in his thrum night-cap, the same rough son of Nature that Nature
               left him.</p>
            <p>The genius of a people where nothing but the monarchy is <hi><ref target="a070"
                     corresp="n070">salique</ref>,</hi> having ceded this department, with sundry

               down their asperities and sharp angles, and not only become round and smooth, but
               will receive, some of them, a polish like a brilliant—Monsieur <hi>le Mari</hi> is
               little better than the stone under your foot—</p>
            <p>—Surely—surely man! it is not good for thee to sit alone—thou wast made for social
               intercourse and gentle greetings, and this improvement of our natures from it, I
               appeal to, as my evidence.</p>
            <p>—And how does it beat, Monsieur? said she.—With all the benignity, said I, looking
               quietly in <pb n="173" facs="tcp:1269300201:208"/> her eyes, that I expected—She was
               going to say something civil in return—but the lad came into the shop with the

            <head>PARIS.</head>
            <p>THE beautiful Grisset rose up when I said this, and going behind the counter, reach'd
               down a parcel and untied it: I advanced to the side over-against her: they were all
               too large. The beautiful Grisset measured them one by one across my hand—It would not
               alter the dimensions—She begg'd I would try a single pair, which seemed to be the
               least—She held it open—my hand slipp'd into it at once—It will not do, said I, <pb
                  n="175" facs="tcp:1269300201:210"/> shaking my head a little—No, said she, doing
               the same thing.</p>
            <p>There are certain combined looks of simple subtlety—where whim, and sense, and
               seriousness, and nonsense, are so blended, that all the languages of Babel set loose
               together could not express them—they are communicated and caught so instantaneously,
               that you can scarce say which party is the infecter. I leave it to your men of words
               to swell pages about it—it is enough in the present to say again, the gloves would
               not do; so folding our hands within our arms, we both loll'd upon the counter—it was
               narrow, and there was just room for the parcel to lay between us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:1269300201:211"/> The beautiful Grisset look'd sometimes at the
               gloves, then side-ways to the window, then at the gloves—and then at me. I was not
               disposed to break silence—I follow'd her example: so I look'd at the gloves, then to
               the window, then at the gloves, and then at her—and so on alternately.</p>
            <p>I found I lost considerably in every attack—she had a quick black eye, and shot
               through two such long and silken eye-lashes with such penetration, that she look'd
               into my very heart and reins—It may seem strange, but I could actually feel she
               did—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:1269300201:212"/> —It is no matter, said I, taking up a couple
               of the pairs next me, and putting them into my pocket.</p>
            <p>I was sensible the beautiful Grisset had not ask'd above a single livre above the
               price—I wish'd she had ask'd a livre more, and was puzzling my brains how to bring
               the matter about—Do you think, my dear Sir, said she, mistaking my embarrassment,
               that I could ask a <hi>sous</hi> too much of a stranger—and of a stranger whose
               politeness, more than his want of gloves, has done me the honour to lay himself at my
                  mercy?—<hi>Men croyez capable?</hi>—Faith! not I, said I; and if you were, you are
               welcome— <pb n="178" facs="tcp:1269300201:213"/> So counting the money into her hand,
               and with a lower bow than one generally makes to a shopkeeper's wife, I went out, and
               her lad with his parcel followed me.</p>

            <head>THE TRANSLATION.</head>
            <head>PARIS.</head>
            <p>THERE was no body in the box I was let into but a kindly old French officer. I love
               the character, not only because I honour the man whose manners are softened by a
               profession which makes bad men worse; but that I once knew one—for he is no more—and
               why should I not rescue one page from violation by writing his name in it, and
               telling the world it was Captain Tobias Shandy, the dearest of my flock and friends,
               whose philanthropy I never <pb n="180" facs="tcp:1269300201:215"/> think of at this
               long distance from his death—but my eyes gush out with tears. For his sake, I have a
               predilection for the whole corps of veterans; and so I strode over the two back rows
               of benches, and placed myself beside him.</p>
            <p>The old officer was reading attentively <ref target="a071" corresp="n071">a small
                  pamphlet</ref>, it might be the book of the opera, with a large pair of
               spectacles. As soon as I sat down, he took his <ref target="a072" corresp="n072"
                  >spectacles</ref> off, and putting them into a <ref target="a072b"
                  corresp="n0732b">shagreen case</ref>, return'd them and the book into his pocket
               together. I half rose up, and made him a bow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:1269300201:216"/> Translate this into any civilized language in
               the world—the sense is this:</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Here's a poor stranger come in to the box—he seems as if
                  he knew no body; and is never likely, was he to be seven years in Paris, if every
                  man he comes near keeps his spectacles upon his nose—'tis shutting the door of
                  conversation absolutely in his face—and using him worse than a German."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The French officer might as well have said it all aloud; and if he had, I should in
               course have put the bow I made him into French too, and told him, <q

            <p>There is not a secret so aiding to the progress of sociality, as to get master of
               this <hi>short hand,</hi> and be quick in rendering the several turns of looks and
               limbs, with all their inflections and delineations, into plain words. For my own
               part, by long habitude, I do it so mechanically, that when I walk the streets of
               London, I go translating all the way; and have more than once stood behind in the
               circle, where not three words have been said, and have brought off twenty different
               dialogues with me, which I could have fairly wrote down and sworn to.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:1269300201:220"/> I was going one evening to Martini's concert
               at Milan, and was just entering the door of the hall, when the Marquesina di F*** was
               coming out in a sort of a hurry—she was almost upon me before I saw her; so I gave a
               spring to one side to let her pass—She had done the same, and on the same side too;
               so we ran our heads together: she instantly got to the other side to get out: I was
               just as unfortunate as she had been; for I had sprung to that side, and opposed her
               passage again—We both flew together to the other side, and then back—and so on—it was
               ridiculous; we both blush'd intolerably; so I did at last the thing I should have <pb
                  n="184" facs="tcp:1269300201:221"/> done at first—I stood stock still, and the
               Marquesina had no more difficulty. I had no power to go into the room, till I had
               made her so much reparation as to wait and follow her with my eye to the end of the
               passage—She look'd back twice, and walk'd along it rather side-ways, as if she would
               make room for any one coming up stairs to pass her—No, said I—that's a vile
               translation: the Marquesina has a right to the best apology I can make her; and that
               opening is left for me to do it in—so I ran and begg'd pardon for the embarrassment I
               had given her, saying it was my intention to have made her way. She answered, she <pb
                  n="185" facs="tcp:1269300201:222"/> was guided by the same intention towards me—so
               we reciprocally thank'd each other. She was at the top of the stairs; and seeing no
                  <hi>chichesbee</hi> near her, I begg'd to hand her to her coach—so we went down
               the stairs, stopping at every third step to talk of the concert and the
               adventure—Upon my word, Madame, said I when I had handed her in, I made six different
               efforts to let you go out—And I made six efforts, replied she, to let you enter—I
               wish to heaven you would make a seventh, said I—With all my heart, said she, making
               room—Life is too short to be long about the forms of it—so I instantly stepp'd in,
               and she carried me home with her—And <pb n="186" facs="tcp:1269300201:223"/> what
               became of the concert, <ref target="a073" corresp="n073">St. Cecilia</ref>, who, I
               suppose, was at it, knows more than I.</p>
            <p>I will only add, that the connection which arose out of that translation, gave me
               more pleasure than any one I had the honour to make in Italy.</p>

            <head>THE DWARF.</head>
            <head>PARIS.</head>
            <p>I HAD never heard the remark made by any one in my life, except by one; and who that
               was, will probably come out in this chapter; so that being pretty much
               unprepossessed, there must have been grounds for what struck me the moment I cast my
               eyes over the <hi><ref target="a074" corresp="n074">parterre</ref></hi>—and that was,
               the unaccountable sport of nature in forming such numbers of dwarfs—No doubt, she
               sports at certain times in almost every corner of the world; but in Paris, there is
               no <pb n="188" facs="tcp:1269300201:225"/> end to her amusements—The goddess seems
               almost as merry as she is wise.</p>
            <p>As I carried my idea out of the <hi>opera comique</hi> with me, I measured every body
               I saw walking in the streets by it—Melancholy application! especially where the size
               was extremely little—the face extremely dark—the eyes quick—the nose long—the teeth
               white—the jaw prominent—to see so many miserables, by force of accidents driven out
               of their own proper class into the very verge of another, which it gives me pain to
               write down—every third man a pigmy!—some by ricketty heads and hump backs— <pb
                  n="189" facs="tcp:1269300201:226"/> others by bandy legs—a third set arrested by
               the hand of Nature in the sixth and seventh years of their growth—a fourth, in their
               perfect and natural state, like dwarf appletrees; from the first rudiments and
               stamina of their existence, never meant to grow higher.</p>
            <p>A medical traveller might say, 'tis owing to undue bandages—a splenetic one, to want
               of air—and an inquisitive traveller, to fortify the system, may measure the height of
               their houses—the narrowness of their streets, and in how few feet square in the sixth
               and seventh stories such numbers of the <hi>Bourgoisie</hi> eat and sleep <pb n="190"
                  facs="tcp:1269300201:227"/> together; but I remember, <ref target="a075"
                  corresp="n075">Mr. Shandy the elder</ref>, who accounted for nothing like any body
               else, in speaking one evening of these matters, averred, that children, like other
               animals, might be increased almost to any size, provided they came right into the
               world; but the misery was, the citizens of Paris were so coop'd up, that they had not
               actually room enough to get them—I do not call it getting any thing, said he—'tis
               getting nothing—Nay, continued he, rising in his argument, 'tis getting worse than
               nothing, when all you have got, after twenty or five and twenty years of the
               tenderest care and most nutritious aliment bestowed upon <pb n="191"
                  facs="tcp:1269300201:228"/> it, shall not at last be as high as my leg. Now, Mr.
               Shandy being very short, there could be nothing more said upon it.</p>
            <p>As this is not a work of reasoning, I leave the solution as I found it, and content
               myself with the truth only of the remark, which is verified in every lane and by-lane
               of Paris. I was walking down that which leads from the Carousal to the Palais Royal,
               and observing a little boy in some distress at the side of the gutter, which ran down
               the middle of it, I took hold of his hand, and help'd him over. Upon turning up his
               face to look at him after, I perceived he was about <pb n="192"
                  facs="tcp:1269300201:229"/> forty—Never mind, said I; some good body will do as
               much for me when I am ninety.</p>
            <p>I feel some little principles within me, which incline me to be merciful towards this
               poor blighted part of my species, who have neither size or strength to get on in the
               world—I cannot bear to see one of them trod upon; and had scarce got seated beside my
               old French officer, ere the disgust was exercised, by seeing the very thing happen
               under the <ref target="a076" corresp="n076">box</ref> we sat in.</p>
            <p>At the end of the <ref target="a076b" corresp="n076b">orchestra</ref>, and betwixt
               that and the first <ref target="a077" corresp="n077">side-box</ref>, <pb n="193"
                  facs="tcp:1269300201:230"/> there is a small esplanade left, where, when the house
               is full, numbers of all ranks take sanctuary. Though you stand, as in the parterre,
               you pay the same price as in the orchestra. A poor defenceless being of this order
               had got thrust some how or other into this luckless place—the night was hot, and he
               was surrounded by beings two feet and a half higher than himself. The dwarf suffered
               inexpressibly on all sides; but the thing which incommoded him most, was a tall
               corpulent German, near seven feet high, who stood directly betwixt him and all
               possibility of his seeing either the stage or the actors. The poor dwarf did all he
               could to get a <pb n="194" facs="tcp:1269300201:231"/> peep at what was going
               forwards, by seeking for some little opening betwixt the German's arm and his body,
               trying first one side, then the other; but the German stood square in the most
               unaccommodating posture that can be imagined—the dwarf might as well have been placed
               at the bottom of the deepest draw-well in Paris; so he civilly reach'd up his hand to
               the German's sleeve, and told him his distress—The German turn'd his head back,
               look'd down-upon him as Goliah did upon David—and unfeelingly resumed his
               posture.</p>
            <p>I was just then taking a pinch of snuff out of my monk's little horn box—And how
               would thy meek and <pb n="195" facs="tcp:1269300201:232"/> courteous spirit, my dear
               monk! so temper'd to <hi>bear and forbear!</hi>—how sweetly would it have lent an ear
               to this poor soul's complaint!</p>
            <p>The old French officer seeing me lift up my eyes with an emotion, as I made the
               apostrophe, took the liberty to ask me what was the matter—I told him the story in
               three words; and added, how inhuman it was.</p>
            <p>By this time the dwarf was driven to extremes, and in his first transports, which are
               generally unreasonable, had told the German he would cut off his long <ref
                  target="a078" corresp="n078">queue</ref> with his knife—The German look'd back
               coolly, <pb n="196" facs="tcp:1269300201:233"/> and told him he was welcome if he
               could reach it.</p>
            <p>An injury sharpened by an insult, be it to who it will, makes every man of sentiment
               a party: I could have leaped out of the box to have redressed it.—The old French
               officer did it with much less confusion; for leaning a little over, and nodding to a
               centinel, and pointing at the same time with his finger to the distress—the centinel
               made his way up to it.—There was no occasion to tell the grievance—the thing told
               itself; so thrusting back the German instantly with his musket—he took the poor dwarf
               by the hand, and placed him <pb n="197" facs="tcp:1269300201:234"/> before him.—This
               is noble! said I, clapping my hands together—And yet you would not permit this, said
               the old officer, in England.</p>
            <p>—In England, dear Sir, said I, <hi>we sit all at our ease.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The old French officer would have set me at unity with myself, in case I had been at
               variance,—by saying it was a <hi><ref target="a079" corresp="n079">bon
               mot</ref></hi>—and as a <hi>bon mot</hi> is always worth something at Paris, he
               offered me a pinch of snuff.</p>

            <p>IT was now my turn to ask the old French officer <q rend="inline">"What was the
                  matter?"</q> for a cry of <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>Haussez les mains,

               parterre, was as unintellgible to me, as my apostrophe to the monk had been to
               him.</p>
            <p>He told me, it was some poor Abbe in one of the upper loges, who he supposed had got
               planted perdu behind a couple of grissets in <pb n="199" facs="tcp:1269300201:236"/>
               order to see the opera, and that the parterre espying him, were insisting upon his
               holding up both his hands during the representation.—And can it be supposed, said I,
               that an ecclesiastick would pick the Griffer's pockets? The old French officer
               smiled, and whispering in my car, open'd a door of knowledge which I had no idea
               of—</p>
            <p>Good God! said I, turning pale with astonishment—is it possible, that a people so
               smit with sentiment should at the same time be so unclean, and so unlike
                  themselves—<hi>Quelle grossierte!</hi> added I.</p>

               illiberal sarcasm at the church, which had begun in the theatre about the time the
                  <ref target="a080" corresp="n090">Tartuffe</ref> was given in it, by Moliere—but,
               like other remains os Gothic manners, was declining—Every nation, continued he, have
               their refinements and <hi>grossiertes,</hi> in which they take the lead, and lose it
               of one another by turns—that he had been in most countries, but never in one where he
               found not some delicacies, which others seemed to want. <hi>Le</hi> POUR, <hi>et
                  le</hi> CONTRE <hi>se trouvent en chaque nation;</hi> there is a balance, said he,
               of good and bad every where; and nothing but the knowing it is so can emancipate one
               half of the world <pb n="201" facs="tcp:1269300201:240"/> from the prepossessions
               which it holds against the other—that the advantage of travel, as it regarded the
                  <hi>sçavoir vivre,</hi> was by seeing a great deal both of men and manners; it
               taught us mutual toleration; and mutual toleration, concluded he, making me a bow,
               taught us mutual love.</p>
            <p>The old French officer delivered this with an air of such candour and good sense, as
               coincided with my first favourable impressions of his character—I thought I loved the
               man; but I fear I mistook the object—'twas my own way of thinking—the difference was,
               I could not have expressed it half so well.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:1269300201:241"/> It is alike troublesome to both the rider and
               his beast—if the latter goes pricking up his ears, and starting all the way at every
               object which he never saw before—I have as little torment of this kind as any
               creature alive; and yet I honestly confess, that many a thing gave me pain, and that
               I blush'd at many a word the first month—which I found inconsequent and perfectly
               innocent the second.</p>
            <p>Madame de Ramboulict, after an acquaintance of about six weeks with her, had done me
               the honour to take me in her coach about two leagues out of town—Of all women, Madame
               de Rambouliet is the most correct; and I never wish to see one of <pb n="203"
                  facs="tcp:1269300201:242"/> more virtues and purity of heart—In our return back,
               Madame de Rambouliet desired me to pull the cord—I ask'd her if she wanted any
                  thing—<hi>Rien que pisser,</hi> said Madame de Rambouliet—</p>
            <p>Grieve not, gentle traveller, to let Madame de Rambouliet p—ss on—And, ye fair mystic
               nymphs! go each one <hi>pluck your rose,</hi> and scatter them in your path—for
               Madame de Rambouliet did no more—I handed Madame de Rambouliet out of the coach; and
               had I been the priest of the chaste <ref target="a081" corresp="n081">CASTALIA</ref>,
               I could not have served at her fountain with a more respectful decorum.</p>

            <head>THE FILLE DE CHAMBRE</head>
            <head>PARIS.</head>
            <p>WHAT the old French officer had deliver'd upon travel>ling, bringing <ref target="a101" corresp="n101">Polonius</ref>'s
               advice to his son upon the same subject into my head—and that bringing in Hamlet; and
               Hamlet, the rest of Shakespear's works, I stopp'd at the Quai de Conti in my return
               home, to pur>chase the whole set.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:1269300202:4"/> The bookseller said he had not a set in the
                  world—<hi>Comment!</hi> said I; taking one up out of a set which lay upon the
               counter betwixt us.—He said, they were sent him only to be got bound, and were to be
               sent back to Versailles in the morning to the Count de B****.</p>
            <p>—And does the Count de B**** said I, read Shakespear? <hi>C'est un Esprit fort;</hi>
               replied the bookseller.—He loves English books; and what is more to his honour,
               Monsieur, he love the English too. You speak this so civilly, said I, that 'tis
               enough to oblige an Englishman to lay out a Louis d'or or two at your shop—the
               bookseller made a bow, and was <pb n="3" facs="tcp:1269300202:5"/> going to say
               something, when a young decent girl of about twenty, who by her air and dress, seemed
               to be <hi><ref target="a102" corresp="n102">fille de chambre</ref></hi> to some devout woman of fashion, came into the shop
               and asked for <hi><ref target="a103" corresp="n103">Les Egarments du Coeur &amp; de l'Es>prit</ref>:</hi> the bookseller gave
               her the book directly; she pulled out a little <ref target="a104" corresp="n104">green sattin purse</ref> run round with a
               ribband of the same colour, and putting her finger and thumb into it, she took out
               the money, and paid for it. As I had no>thing more to stay me in the shop, we both
               walked out at the door together.</p>
            <p>—And what have you to do, my dear, said I, with <hi>The Wanderings of the Heart,</hi>
               who scarce know yet you have one? nor till love has <pb n="4" facs="tcp:1269300202:6"
               /> first told you it, or some faithless shepherd has made it ache, can'st thou ever
               be sure it is so.—<hi>Le Dieu m'en guard!</hi> said the girl.—With reason, said I—for
               if is a good one, 'tis pity it should be stolen: 'tis a little trea>sure to thee, and
               gives a better air to your face, than if it was dress'd out with pearls.</p>
            <p>The young girl listened with a submissive attention, holding her sat>tin purse by its
               ribband in her hand all the time—'Tis a very small one, said I, taking hold of the
               bottom of it—she held it towards me—and there is very little in it, my dear, said I;
               but be but as good as thou art hand>some, and heaven will fill it: I had a <pb n="5"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:7"/> parcel of crowns in my hand to pay for Shakespear; and
               as she had let go the purse intirely, I put a single one in; and tying up the ribband
               in a bow-knot, returned it to her.</p>
            <p>The young girl made me more a humble courtesy than a low one—'twas one one of those
               quiet, thankful sinkings where the spirit bows itself down—the body does no more than
               tell it. I never gave a girl a crown in my life which gave me half the pleasure.</p>
            <p>My advice, my dear, would not have been worth a pin to you, said I, if I had not
               given this along with it: but now, when you see the crown, <pb n="6"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:8"/> you'll remember it—so don't, my dear, lay it out in
               ribbands.</p>
            <p>Upon my word, Sir, said the girl, earnestly, I am incapable—in saying which, as is
               usual in little bar>gains of honour, she gave me her hand—<hi>En verite, Monsieur, je
                  met>trai cet argent apart,</hi> said she.</p>
            <p>When a virtuous convention is made betwixt man and woman, it sanctifies their most
               private walks: so notwithstanding it was dusky, yet as both our roads lay the same
               way, we made no scruple of walking along the Quai de Conti together</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:1269300202:9"/> She made me a second courtesy in setting off, and
               before we got twenty yards from the door, as if she had not done enough before, she
               made a sort of a little stop to tell me again,—she thank'd me.</p>
            <p>It was a small tribute, I told her, which I could not avoid paying to virtue, and
               would not be mistaken in the person I had been rendering it to for the world—but I
               see innocence, my dear, in your face—and foul be>fal the man who ever lays a snare in
               its way!</p>
            <p>The girl seem'd affected some way or other with what I said—she gave a low sigh—I
               found I was not im>powered <pb n="8" facs="tcp:1269300202:10"/> to enquire at all
               after it—so said nothing more till I got to the corner of the Rue de Nevers, where we
               were to part.</p>
            <p>—But is this the way, my dear, said I, to the hotel de Modene? she told me it was—or,
               that I might go by the Rue de Guineygaude, which was the next turn.—Then I'll go, my
               dear, by the Rue de Guineygaude, said I, for two reasons; first I shall please
               myself, and next I shall give you the protection of my company as far on your way as
               I can. The girl was sensible I was civil—and said, she wish'd the hotel de Modene was
               in the Rue de St. Pierre—You live there? said I.—She told me she was <hi>fille de
                  chambre</hi> to Madame <pb n="9" facs="tcp:1269300202:11"/> R****—Good God! said
               I, 'tis the very lady for whom I have brought a letter from Amiens—The girl told me
               that Madame R****, she believed expected a stranger with a letter, and was impatient
               to see him—so I desired the girl to present my compliments to Madame R****, and say I
               would cer>tainly wait upon her in the morning.</p>
            <p>We stood still at the corner of the Rue de Nevers whilst this pass'd—We then stopp'd
               a moment whilst she disposed of her <hi>Egarments de Coeur,</hi> &amp;c. more
               commodiously than carrying them in her hand—they were two volumes; so I held the
               second for her whilst she put the first into her pocket; and then <pb n="10"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:12"/> she held her pocket, and I put in the other after
               it.</p>
            <p>'Tis sweet to feel by what fine-spun threads our affections are drawn to>gether.</p>
            <p>We set off a-fresh, and as she took her third step, the girl put her hand within my
               arm—I was just bidding her—but she did it of herself with that undeliberating
               simplicity, which shew'd it was out of her head that she had never seen me before.
               For my own part, I felt the conviction of <ref target="a105" corresp="n105">consanguinity</ref> so strongly, that I could not
               help turning half round to look in her face, and see if I could trace out <pb n="11"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:13"/> any thing in it of a family likeness—Tut! said I, are
               we not all relations?</p>
            <p>When we arrived at the turning up of the Rue de Guineygaude, I stopp'd to bid her
               adieu for good an all: the girl would thank me again for my company and kindness—She
               bid me adieu twice—I repeated it as often; and so cordial was the parting between us,
               that had it happen'd any where else, I'm not sure but I should have signed it with a
               kiss of charity, as warm and holy as an apostle.</p>
            <p>But in Paris, as none kiss each other but the men—I did, what amounted to the same
               thing—</p>
            <p>—I bid God bless her.</p>

            <head>PARIS.</head>
            <p>WHEN I got home to my hotel, La Fleur told me I had been enquired after by the
               Lieu>tenant de Police—The duce take it! said I—I know the reason. It is time the
               reader should know it, for in the order of things in which it happened, it was
               omitted; not that it was out of my head; but that had I told it then, it might have
               been forgot now—and now is the time I want it.</p>
            <p>I had left London with so much precipitation, that it never enter'd my <pb n="13"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:15"/> mind that <ref target="a107" corresp="n107">we were at war with France</ref>; and had reach'd
               Dover, and look'd through <ref target="a108" corresp="n108">my glass</ref> at the hills beyond <ref target="a109" corresp="n109">Boulogne</ref>, before the idea
               presented itself; and with this in its train, that there was no getting there without
               a passport. Go but to the end of a street, I have a mortal aversion for returning
               back no wiser than I sat out; and as this was one of the great>est efforts I had ever
               made for know>ledge, I could less bear the thoughts of it: so hearing the Count de
               **** had hired the packet, I begg'd he would take me in his <hi>suite.</hi> The Count
               had some little knowledge of me, so made little or no difficulty—only said, his
               inclination to serve me could reach no further than Calais; <pb n="14"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:16"/> as he was to return by way of Brussels to Paris:
               however, when I had once pass'd there, I might get to Paris without interruption; but
               that in Paris I must make friends and shift for myself.—Let me get to Paris, Monsieur
               le Count, said I—and I shall do very well. So I embark'd, and never thought more of
               the matter.</p>
            <p>When Le Fleur told me the Lieu>tenant de Police had been enquiring after me—the thing
               instantly recurred—and by the time Le Fleur had well told me, the master of the hotel
               came into my room to tell me the same thing, with this addition to it, that my
               passport had been particu>larly <pb n="15" facs="tcp:1269300202:17"/> ask'd after:
               the master of the hotel concluded with saying, He hoped I had one.—Not I, faith! said
               I.</p>
            <p>The master of the hotel retired three steps from me, as from an in>fected person, as
               I declared this—and poor Le Fleur advanced three steps towards me, and with that sort
               of movement which a good soul makes to succour a distress'd one—the fellow won my
               heart by it; and from that single <hi>trait,</hi> I knew his character as perfectly,
               and could rely upon it as firmly, as if he had served me with fidelity for seven
               years.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:1269300202:18"/> Mon seignior! cried the master of the hotel—but
               recollecting himself as he made the exclamation, he in>stantly changed the tone of
               it—If Monsieur, said he, has not a passport <hi>(apparament)</hi> in all likelihood
               he has friends in Paris who can procure him one.—Not that I know of, quoth I, with an
               air of indifference.—Then <hi>certes,</hi> replied he, you'll be sent to the <ref target="a110" corresp="n110">Bastile</ref>
               or the Chatelet, <hi>au moins.</hi> Poo! said I, the king of France is a good
               na>tured soul—he'll hurt no body.—<hi>Cela n'empeche pas,</hi> said he—you will
               cer>tainly be sent to the Bastile to-morrow morning.—But I've taken your lodg>ings
               for a month, answer'd I, and I'll not quit them a day before the time for all the
               kings of France in the <pb n="17" facs="tcp:1269300202:19"/> world. La Fleur
               whisper'd in my ear, That no body could oppose the king of France.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pardi!</hi> said my host, <hi>ces Messieurs Anglois sont des gens tres

            <p>I COULD not find in my heart to torture La Fleur's with a se>rious look upon the
               subject of my embarrassment, which was the rea>son I had treated it so :
               and to shew him how light it lay upon my mind, I dropt the subject en>tirely; and
               whilst he waited upon me at supper, talk'd to him with more than usual gaiety about
               Paris, and of the opera comique.—La Fleur had been there himself, and had followed me
               through the streets as far as the bookseller's shop; but seeing me come <pb n="19"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:21"/> out with the young <hi>fille de chambre,</hi> and that
               we walk'd <ref target="a111" corresp="n111">cavalierly</ref> down the <ref target="a112" corresp="n112">Quai de Conti</ref> together, La Fleur deem'd it unnecessary to follow
               me a step fur>ther—so making his own reflections upon it, he took a shorter cut—and
               got to the hotel in time to be in>form'd of the affair of the Police against my
               arrival.</p>
            <p>As soon as the honest creature had taken away, and gone down to sup himself, I then
               began to think a little seriously about my situation.—</p>
            <p>—And here, I know, <ref target="a113" corresp="n113">Eugenius</ref>, thou wilt smile at the remembrance of a short dialogue
               which pass'd be>twixt <pb n="20" facs="tcp:1269300202:22"/> us the moment I was going
               to set out—I must tell it here.</p>
            <p>Eugenius, knowing that I was as little subject to be overburthen'd with money as
               thought, had drawn me aside to interrogate me how much I had taken care for; upon
               telling him the exact sum, Eugenius shook his head, and said it would not do; so
               pull'd out his purse in order to empty it into mine.—I've enough in con>science,
               Eugenius, said I.—Indeed, Yorick, you have not, replied Eu>genius—I know France and
               Italy better than you.—But you don't consider, Eugenius, said I, refusing his offer,
               that before I have been three days in Paris, I shall take care <pb n="21"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:23"/> to say or do something or other for which I shall get
               clapp'd up into the Bastile, and that I shall live there a couple of months entirely
               at the king of France's expence.—I beg pardon, said Eugenius, drily: really, I had
               forgot that resource.</p>
            <p>Now the event I treated gaily came seriously to my door.</p>
            <p>Is it folly, or nonchalance, or phi>losophy, or pertinacity—or what is it in me,
               that, after all, when La Fleur had gone down stairs, and I was quite alone, that I
               could not bring down my mind to think of it otherwise than I had then spoken of it to
               Eugenius?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:1269300202:24"/> —And as for the Bastile! the ter>ror is in the
               word—Make the most of it you can, said I to myself, the Bastile is but another word
               for a tower—and a tower is but another word for a house you can't get out of—Mercy on
               the gouty! for they are in it twice a year—but with nine livres a day, and pen and
               ink and paper and patience, albeit a man can't get out, he may do very well within—at
               least for a month or six weeks; at the end of which, if he is a harmless fellow his
               innocence appears, and he comes out a better and wiser man than he went in.</p>
            <p>I had some occasion (I forget what) to step into the court-yard, as I settled <pb
                  n="23" facs="tcp:1269300202:25"/> this account; and remember I walk'd down stairs
               in no small triumph with the conceit of my reasoning—Be>shrew the <hi>sombre</hi>
               pencil! said I vaunt>ingly—for I envy not its powers, which paints the evils of life
               with so hard and deadly a colouring. The mind sits terrified at the objects she has
               magnified herself, and blackened: reduce them to their proper size and hue she
               overlooks them—'Tis true, said I, correcting the proposition—the Bastile is not an
               evil to be de>spised—but strip it of its towers—fill up the fossè—unbarricade the
               doors—call it simply a confinement, and sup>pose 'tis some tyrant of a distemper—and
               not of a man which holds you in <pb n="24" facs="tcp:1269300202:26"/> it—the evil
               vanishes, and you bear the other half without complaint.</p>
            <p>I was interrupted in the hey-day of this soliloquy, with a voice which I took to be
               of a child, which com>plained <q rend="inline">"it could not get out."</q>—I look'd
               up and down the passage, and seeing neither man, woman, or child, I went out without
               further attention.</p>
            <p>In my return back through the passage, I heard the same words re>peated twice over;
               and looking up, I saw it was a starling hung in a little cage.—<q
                  rend="inline margQuotes">"I can't get out—I can't get out,"</q> said the
               starling.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:1269300202:27"/> I stood looking at the bird: and to every
               person who came through the passage it ran fluttering to the side to>wards which they
               approach'd it, with the same lamentation of its captivity—<q rend="inline">"I can't
                  get out",</q> said the starling—God help thee! said I, but I'll let thee out, cost
               what it will; so I turn'd about the cage to get to the door; it was twisted and
               double twisted so fast with wire, there was no getting it open without pulling the
               cage to pieces—I took both hands to it.</p>
            <p>The bird flew to the place where I was attempting his deliverance, and thrusting his
               head through the trellis, press'd his breast against it, as if im>patient—I fear,
               poor creature! said I, <pb n="26" facs="tcp:1269300202:28"/> I cannot set thee at
               liberty—"No," said the starling—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"I can't get out—I can't
                  get out,"</q> said the star>ling.</p>
            <p>I vow, I never had my affections more tenderly awakened; or do I re>member an
               incident in my life, where the dissipated spirits, to which my reason had been a
               bubble, were so suddenly call'd home. Mechanical as the notes were, yet so true in
               tune to nature were they chanted, that in one moment they overthrew all my
               syste>matic reasonings upon the Bastile; and I heavily walk'd up stairs, un>saying
               every word I had said in go>ing down them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:1269300202:29"/> Disguise thyself as thou wilt, still slavery!
               said I—still thou art a bit>ter draught; and though thousands in all ages have been
               made to drink of thee, thou art no less bitter on that account.—'tis thou, thrice
               sweet and gracious goddess, addressing my>self to LIBERTY, whom all in pub>lic or in
               private worship, whose taste is grateful, and ever wilt be so, till NATURE herself
               shall change—no <hi>tint</hi> of words can spot thy snowy mantle, or <ref target="a114" corresp="n114">chymic</ref> power
               turn thy sceptre into iron—with thee to smile upon him as he eats his crust, the
               swain is happier than his monarch, from whose court thou art exiled—Gracious heaven!
               cried I, kneeling down upon the last step but one in my ascent— <pb n="28"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:30"/> grant me but health, thou great Be>stower of it, and
               give me but this fair goddess as my companion—and shower down thy mitres, if it seems

            <head>THE CAPTIVE.</head>
            <head>PARIS.</head>
            <p>THE bird in his cage pursued me into my room; I sat down close to my table, and
               leaning my head upon my hand, I begun to figure to myself the miseries of
               con>finement. I was in a right frame for it, and so I gave full scope to my
               imagination.</p>
            <p>I was going to begin with the millions of <ref target="a115" corresp="n115">my fellow creatures born to no inheritance
               but slavery</ref>; but finding, however affecting the pic>ture was, that I could not bring
               it <pb n="30" facs="tcp:1269300202:32"/> near me, and that the multitude of of sad
               groups in it did but distract me.—</p>
            <p>—I took a single captive, and hav>ing first shut him up in his dungeon, I then look'd
               through the twilight of his grated door to take his picture.</p>
            <p>I beheld his body half wasted away with long expectation and confine>ment, and felt
               what kind of sickness of the heart it was which arises from hope deferr'd. Upon
               looking nearer I saw him pale and feverish: in thirty years the western breeze had
               not once fann'd his blood—he had seen no sun, no moon in all that time—nor had the
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:1269300202:33"/> voice of friend or kinsman breathed through
               his lattice—his children—</p>
            <p>—But here my heart began to bleed—and I was forced to go on with another part of the
               portrait.</p>
            <p>He was sitting upon the ground upon a little straw, in the furthest corner of his
               dungeon, which was alternately his chair and bed: a little calender of small sticks
               were laid at the head notch'd all over with the dismal days and nights he had pass'd
               there—he had one of these little sticks in his hand, and with a rusty nail he was
               etching another day of misery to add to the heap. As I darkened the little light he
               had, he lifted up a hopeless <pb n="32" facs="tcp:1269300202:34"/> eye towards the
               door, then cast it down—shook his head, and went on with his work of affliction. I
               heard his chains upon his legs, as he turn'd his body to lay his little stick upon
               the bundle—He gave a deep sigh—I saw the iron enter into his soul—I burst into
               tears—I could not sustain the picture of confinement which my fancy had drawn—I
               startled up from my chair, and calling La Fleur, I bid him bespeak me a
                  <hi>remise,</hi> and have it ready at the door of the hotel by nine in the
               morning.</p>
            <p>—I'll go directly, said I, myself to Monsieur Le Duke de Choiseul.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:1269300202:35"/> La Fleur would have put me to bed; but not
               willing he should see any thing upon my cheek, which would cost the honest fellow a
               heart ache—I told him I would go to bed by himself—and bid him go do the same.</p>

            <head>ROAD TO <ref target="a117" corresp="n118">VERSAILLES</ref>.</head>
            <p>I GOT into my <hi>remise</hi> the hour I proposed: La Fleur got up behind, and I bid
               the coachman make the best of his way to Ver>sailles.</p>
            <p>As there was nothing in this road, or rather nothing which I look for in travelling,
               I cannot fill up the blank better than with a short history of this self-same bird,
               which became the subject of the last chapter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:1269300202:37"/> Whilst the Honourable Mr. **** was waiting for
               a wind at Dover it had been caught upon the cliffs be>fore it could well fly, by an
               English lad who was his groom; who not caring to destroy it, had taken it in his
               breast into the packet—and by course of feeding it. and taking it once under his
               protection, in a day or two grew fond of it, and got it safe along with him to
               Paris.</p>
            <p>At Paris the lad had laid out a a livre in a little cage for the starling, and as he
               had little to do better the five months his master stay'd there, he taught it in his
               mother's tongue the four simple words—(and no more)— <pb n="36"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:38"/> to which I own'd myself so much it's debtor.</p>
            <p>Upon his master's going on for Italy—the lad had given it to the master of the
               hotel—But his little song for liberty, being in an <hi>unknown</hi> language at
               Paris—the bird had little or no store set by him—so La Fleur bought both him and his
               cage for me for <ref target="a118" corresp="n118">a bottle of Burgundy</ref>.</p>
            <p>In my return from Italy I brought him with me to the country in whose language he had
               learn'd his notes—and telling the story of him to Lord A—Lord A begg'd the bird of
               me—in a week Lord A gave him to Lord B—Lord B made a present of him to Lord C—and
               Lord's C's <pb n="37" facs="tcp:1269300202:39"/> gentleman sold him to Lord D's for a
               shilling—Lord D gave him to Lord E—and so on—half round the alphabet—From that rank
               he pass'd into the lower house, and pass'd the hands of as many commoners—But as all
               these wanted to <hi>get in</hi>—and my bird wanted to get out—he had almost as little
               store set by him in London as in Paris.</p>
            <p>It is impossible but many of my readers must have heard of him; and if any by mere
               chance have ever seen him—I beg leave to inform them, that that bird was my bird—or
               some vile copy set up to represent him.</p>
            <p>I have nothing further to add upon him, but that from that time to this, <pb n="38"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:40"/> I have borne this poor starling as the crest to my

            <head>THE ADDRESS.</head>
            <head>VERSAILLES.</head>
            <p>I SHOULD not like to have my enemy take a view of my mind, when I am going to ask
               protection of any man: for which reason I ge>nerally endeavour to protect myself; but
               this going to Monsieur Le Duc de C***** was an act of compul>sion—had it been an act
               of choice, I should have done it, I suppose, like other people.</p>
            <p>How many mean plans of dirty address, as I went along, did my <pb n="40"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:42"/> servile heart form! I deserved the Bastile for every
               one of them.</p>
            <p>Then nothing would serve me, when I got within sight of Versailles, but putting words
               and sentences toge>ther, and conceiving attitudes and tones to wreath myself into
               Monsieur Le Duc de C*****'s good graces—This will do—said I—Just as well, retorted I
               again, as a coat carried up to him by an adventurous taylor, without taking his
               measure—Fool! continued I—see Monsieur Le Duc's face first—observe what <ref target="a119" corresp="n119">character</ref> is
               written in it; take notice in what posture he stands to hear you—mark the turns and
               expressions of <pb n="41" facs="tcp:1269300202:43"/> his body and limbs—And for the
               tone—the first sound which comes from his lips will give it you; and from all these
               together you'll compound an address at once upon the spot, which cannot disgust the
               Duke—the ingredients are his own, and most likely to go down.</p>
            <p>Well! said I, I wish it well over—Coward again! as if man to man was not equal,
               throughout the whole sur>face of the globe; and if in the field—why not face to face
               in the cabinet too? And trust me, Yorick, when>ever it is not so, man is false to
               him>self; and betrays his own succours ten times, where nature does it once. <pb
                  n="42" facs="tcp:1269300202:44"/> Go to the Duc de C**** with the Bastile in thy
               looks—My life for it, thou wilt be sent back to Paris in half an hour, with an
               escort.</p>
            <p>I believe so, said I—Then I'll go to the Duke, by heaven! with all the gaity and
               debonairness in the world.—</p>
            <p>—And there you are wrong again, replied I—A heart at ease, Yorick, flies into no
               extremes—'tis ever on its center.—Well! well! cried I, as the coachman turn'd in at
               the gates—I find I shall do very well: and by the time he had wheel'd round the
               court, and brought me up to the door, I found myself so much the better for my own
               lecture, that I <pb n="43" facs="tcp:1269300202:45"/> neither ascended the steps like
               a victim to justice, who was to part with life upon the topmost,—nor did I mount them
               with a skip and a couple of strides, as I do when I fly up, Eliza! to thee, to meet
               it.</p>
            <p>As I enter'd the door of the saloon, I was met by a person who possibly might be the
               maitre d'hotel, but had more the air of one of the under secretaries, who told me the
               Duc de C**** was busy—I am utterly ig>norant, said I, of the forms of ob>taining an
               audience, being an absolute stranger, and what is worse in the pre>sent conjuncture
               of affairs, being an Englishman too.—He replied, that did not increase the
               difficulty.—I made <pb n="44" facs="tcp:1269300202:46"/> him a slight bow, and told
               him, I had something of importance to say to Monsieur Le Duc. The secretary look'd
               towards the stairs, as if he was about to leave me to carry up this account to some
               one—But I must not mislead you, said I—for what I have to say is of no manner of
               importance to Monsieur Le Duc de C****—but of great import>ance to myself.—<hi>C'est
                  une autre affaire,</hi> replied he—Not at all, said I, to a man of gallantry.—But
               pray, good sir, continued I, when can a stranger hope to have <hi>accesse?</hi> In
               not less than two hours, said he, looking at his watch. The number of equi>pages in
               the court-yard seem'd to justify the calculation, that I could <pb n="45"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:47"/> have no nearer a prospect—and as walking backwards and
               forwards in the saloon, without a soul to commune with, was for the time as bad as
               being in the Bastile itself, I instantly went back to my <hi>remise,</hi> and bid the
               coachman drive me to the <hi>cordon bleu,</hi> which was the nearest hotel.</p>
            <p>I think there is a fatality in it—I seldom go to the place I set out for.</p>
         </div>

            <head>VERSAILLES.</head>
            <p>BEFORE I had got half-way down the street, I changed my mind: as I am at Versailles,
               thought I, I might as well take a view of the town; so I pull'd the cord, and
               or>dered the coachman to drive round some of the principal streets—I sup>pose the
               town is not very large, said I.—The coachmen begg'd pardon for setting me right, and
               told me it was very superb, and that numbers of the first dukes and marquises and
               counts had hotels—The Count de B****, of <pb n="47" facs="tcp:1269300202:49"/> whom
               the bookseller at the Quai de Conti had spoke so handsomely the night before, came
               instantly into my mind.—And why should I not go, thought I, to the Count de B****,
               who has so high an idea of English books, and Englishmen—and tell him my story? so I
               changed my mind a second time—In truth it was the third; for I had intended that day
               for Madame de R**** in the Rue St. Pierre, and had devoutly sent her word by her
                  <hi>fille de chambre</hi> that I would assuredly wait upon her—but I am govern'd
               by circumstances—I cannot govern them: so seeing a man standing with a basket on the
               other side of the street, as if he had some>thing to sell, I bid La Fleur go up <pb
                  n="48" facs="tcp:1269300202:50"/> to him and enquire for the Count's hotel.</p>
            <p>La Fleur return'd a little pale; and told me it was a Chevalier de St. Louis selling
                  <hi><ref target="a121" corresp="n121">patès</ref></hi>—It is impossible, La Fleur! said I.—La Fleur could no more account
               for the phenomenon than myself; but persisted in his story: he had seen the croix set
               in gold, with its red ribband, he said, tied to his button-hole—and had look'd into
               the basket and seen the <hi>patès</hi> which the Chevalier was selling; so could not
               be mistaken in that.</p>
            <p>Such a reverse in man's life awakens a better principle than curiosity: I could not
               help looking for some time <pb n="49" facs="tcp:1269300202:51"/> at him as I sat in
               the <hi>remise</hi>—the more I look'd at him—his croix and his basket, the stronger
               they wove themselves into my brain—I got out of the <hi>remise</hi> and went towards
               him.</p>
            <p>He was begirt with a clean linen apron which fell below his knees, and with a sort of
               a bib went half way up his breast; upon the top of this, but a little below the hem,
               hung his croix. His basket of little <hi>patès</hi> was cover'd over with a white
               <ref target="a122" corresp="n122">damask napkin</ref>; another of the same kind was spread at the bottom; and there was a
               look of <hi>propreté</hi> and neatness throughout; that one might have bought his
                  <hi>patès</hi> of him, as much from appetite as sentiment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:1269300202:52"/> He made an offer of them to nei>ther; but stood
               still with them at the corner of a hotel, for those to buy who chose it, without
               solicitation.</p>
            <p>He was about forty-eight—of a sedate look, something approaching to gravity. I did
               not wonder.—I went up rather to the basket than him, and having lifted up the nap>kin
               and taken one of his <hi>patès</hi> into my hand—I begg'd he would explain the
               appearance which affected me.</p>
            <p>He told me in a few words, that the best part of his life had pass'd in the service,
               in which, after spending a small <ref target="a123" corresp="n123">patrimony</ref>, he had obtain'd <ref target="a124" corresp="n124">a company and the croix</ref>
               with it; <pb n="51" facs="tcp:1269300202:53"/> but that at the conclusion of the last
               peace, his regiment being reformed, and the whole corps, with those of some other
               regiments, left without any provision—he found himself in a wide world without
               friends, without a livre—and indeed, said he, with>out any thing but this—(pointing,
               as he said it, to his croix)—The poor chevalier won my pity, and he finish'd the
               scene, with winning my esteem too.</p>
            <p>The king, he said, was the most generous of princes, but his gene>rosity could
               neither relieve or reward every one, and it was only his mis>fortune to be amongst
               the number. He had a little wife, he said, whom <pb n="52" facs="tcp:1269300202:54"/>
               he loved, who did the <hi>patisserie;</hi> and added, he felt no dishonour in
               defend>ing her and himself from want in this way—unless Providence had offer'd him a
               better.</p>
            <p>It would be wicked to with-hold a pleasure from the good, in passing over what
               happen'd to this poor Chevalier of St. Louis about nine months after.</p>
            <p>It seems he usually took his stand near the iron gates which lead up to the palace,
               and as his croix had caught the eye of numbers, num>bers had made the same enquiry
               which I had done—He had told them the same story, and always with <pb n="53"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:55"/> so much modesty and good sense, that it had reach'd at
               last the king's ears—who hearing the Chevalier had been a gallant officer, and
               re>spected by the whole regiment as a man of honour and integrity—he broke up his
               little trade by a pension of fifteen hundred livres a year.</p>
            <p>As I have told this to please the reader, I beg he will allow me to relate another
               out of its order, to please myself—the two stories reflect light upon each other,—and
               'tis a pity they should be parted.</p>

            <p>WHEN states and empires have their periods of declension, and feel in their turns
               what distress and poverty is—I stop not to tell the causes which gradually brought
               the house d'E**** in Britany into decay. The Marquis d'E**** had fought up against
               his condition with great firmness; wishing to pre>serve, and still shew to the world
               some little fragments of what his an>cestors had been—their indiscretions had put it
               out of his power. There <pb n="55" facs="tcp:1269300202:57"/> was enough left for the
               little exigen>cies of <hi>obscurity</hi>—But he had two boys who look'd up to him for
                  <hi>light</hi>—he thought they deserved it. He had tried his sword—it could not
               open the way—the <hi>mounting</hi> was too ex>pensive—and simple oeconomy was not a
               match for it—there was no re>source but commerce.</p>
            <p>In any other province in France, save Britany, this was smiting the root for ever of
               the little tree his pride and affection wish'd to see re>blossom—But in Britany,
               there being a provision for this, he avail'd himself of it; and taking an occasion
               when the states were assembled at Rennes, <pb n="56" facs="tcp:1269300202:58"/> the
               Marquis, attended with his two boys, enter'd the court; and having pleaded the right
               of an ancient law of the duchy, which, though seldom claim'd, he said, was no less in
               force; he took his sword from his side—Here—said he—take it; and be trusty guardians
               of it, till better times put me in condition to reclaim it.</p>
            <p>The president accepted the Mar>quis's sword—he stay'd a few minutes to see it
               deposited in the archives of his house—and departed.</p>
            <p>The Marquis and his whole family embarked the next day for <ref target="a126" corresp="n126">Martinico</ref>, and in about
               nineteen or twenty years of successful application to bu>siness, <pb n="57"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:59"/> with some unlook'd for be>quests from distant branches
               of his house—return'd home to reclaim his nobility and to support it.</p>
            <p>It was an incident of good for>tune which will never happen to any traveller, but a
               sentimental one, that I should be at Rennes at the very time of this solemn
               requisition: I call it solemn—it was so to me.</p>
            <p>The Marquis enter'd the court with his whole family: he supported his lady—his eldest
               son supported his sister, and his youngest was at the other extreme of the line next
               his mother.—he put his handkerchief to his face twice—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:1269300202:60"/> —There was a dead silence. When the Marquis had
               approach'd within six paces of the tribunal, he gave the <ref target="a127" corresp="n127">Marchioness</ref> to his youngest
               son, and advancing three steps before his fa>mily—he reclaim'd his sword. His sword
               was given him, and the moment he got it into his hand he drew it al>most out of the
               scabbard—'twas the shining face of a friend he had once given up—he look'd
               attentively along it, beginning at the hilt, as if to see whether it was the
               same—when ob>serving a little rust which it had con>tracted near the point, he
               brought it near his eye, and bending his head down over it—I think I saw a tear fall
               upon the place: I could not be deceived by what followed.</p>
            <p>

                  it off."</q>
            </p>
            <p>When the Marquis had said this, he return'd his sword into its scabbard, made a bow
               to the guardians of it—and, with his wife and daughter and his two sons following
               him, walk'd out.</p>
            <p>O how I envied him his feelings!</p>

            <p>I FOUND no difficulty in get>ting admittance to Monsieur Le Count de B****. The set
               of Shake>spears was laid upon the table; and he was tumbling them over. I walk'd up
               close to the table, and giving first such a look at the books as to make him conceive
               I knew what they were—I told him I had come without any one to present me, knowing I
               should meet with a friend in his apartment who, I trusted, would do it for me—it is
               my countryman <pb n="61" facs="tcp:1269300202:63"/> the great Shakespear, said I,
               point>ing to his works—<hi>et ayez la bontè, mon cher ami,</hi> apostrophizing his
               spirit, added I, <hi>de me faire cet hon>neur la.</hi>—</p>
            <p>The Count smil'd at the singu>larity of the introduction; and see>ing I look'd a
               little pale and sickly, insisted upon my taking an arm-chair: so I sat down; and to
               save him con>jectures upon a visit so out of all rule, I told him simply of the
               inci>dent in the bookseller's shop, and how that had impell'd me rather to go to him
               with the story of a little embarrassment I was under, than to any other man in
               France—And what <pb n="62" facs="tcp:1269300202:64"/> is your embarrassment? let me
               hear it, said the Count. So I told him the story just as I have told it the
               reader—</p>
            <p>—And the master of my hotel, said I, as I concluded it, will needs have it, Monsieur
               le Count, that I shall be sent to the Bastile—but I have no apprehensions, continued
               I—for in falling into the hands of the most polish'd people in the world, and being
               conscious I was a true man, and not come to spy the nakedness of the land, I scarce
               thought I laid at their mercy.—It does not suit the gal>lantry of the French,
               Monsieur le Count, said I, to shew it against in>valids.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:1269300202:65"/> An animated blush came into the Count de
               B****'s cheeks, as I spoke this—<hi>Ne craignez rien</hi>—Don't fear, said he—Indeed
               I don't, replied I again—besides, continued I a little sportingly—I have come
               laughing all the way from London to Paris, and I do not think Monsieur le Duc de
               Choiseul is such an enemy to mirth, as to send me back crying for my pains.</p>
            <p>—My application to you, Mon>sieur le Compte de B**** (mak>ing him a low bow) is to
               desire he will not.</p>
            <p>The Count heard me with great good nature, or I had not said half <pb n="64"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:66"/> as much—and once or twice said—<hi>C'est bien dit.</hi>
               So I rested my cause there—and determined to say no more about it.</p>
            <p>The Count led the discourse: we talk'd of indifferent things;—of books and politicks,
               and men—and then of women—God bless them all! said I, after much discourse about
               them—there is not a man upon earth who loves them so much as I do: after all the
               foibles I have seen, and all the satires I have read against them, still I love them;
               being firmly persuaded that a man who has not a sort of an affection for the whole
               sex, is incapa>ble of ever loving a single one as he ought.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:1269300202:67"/>
               <hi>Hèh bien! Monsieur l'Anglois,</hi> said the Count, gaily—You are not come to spy
               the nakedness of the land—I believe you—<hi>ni encore,</hi> I dare say, <hi>that</hi>
               of our women—But permit me to conjecture—if, <hi>par hazard,</hi> they fell in your
               way—that the prospect would not affect you.</p>
            <p>I have something within me which cannot bear the shock of the least in>decent
               insinuation: in the sportability of chit-chat I have often endeavoured to conquer it,
               and with infinite pain have hazarded a thousand things to a dozen of the sex
               together—the least of which I could not venture to a single one, to gain heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:1269300202:68"/> Excuse me, Monsieur Le Count, said I—as for the
               nakedness of your land, if I saw it, I should cast my eyes over it with tears in
               them—and for that of your women (blushing at the idea he had excited in me) I am so
               evangelical in this, and have such a fellow-feeling for what ever is <hi>weak</hi>
               about them, that I would cover it with a garment, if I knew how to throw it on—But I
               could wish, con>tinued I, to spy the <hi>nakedness</hi> of their hearts, and through
               the different disguises of customs, climates, and religion, find out what is good in
               them, to fashion my own by—and therefore am I come.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:1269300202:69"/> It is for this reason, Monsieur le Compte,
               continued I, that I have not seen the <ref target="a128" corresp="n128">Palais royal</ref>—nor the <ref target="a129" corresp="n129">Luxembourg</ref>—nor the <ref target="a130" corresp="n130">Façade
               of the Louvre</ref>—nor have attempted to swell the catalogues we have of pic>tures,
               statues, and churches—I con>ceive every fair being as a temple, and would rather
               enter in, and see the original drawings and loose sketches hung up in it, than <ref target="a131" corresp="n131">the
               transfiguration of Raphael</ref> itself.</p>
            <p>The thirst of this, continued I, as impatient as that which inflames the breast of
               the connoisseur, has led me from my own home into France—and from France will lead me
               through Italy—'tis a quiet journey <pb n="68" facs="tcp:1269300202:70"/> of the heart
               in pursuit of NATURE, and those affections which rise out of her, which make us love
               each other—and the world, better than we do.</p>
            <p>The Count said a great many civil things to me upon the occasion; and added very
               politely how much he stood obliged to Shakespear for making me known to him—but,
                  <hi>a-propos,</hi> said he—Shakespear is full of great things—He forgot a small
               punctillio of announcing your name—it puts you under a necessity of doing it
               yourself.</p>

            <p>THERE is not a more per>plexing affair in life to me, than to set about telling any

               myself; and I have often wish'd I could do it in a single word—and have an end of it.
               It was the only time and occasion in my life, I could accomplish this to any
               purpose—for Shakespear lying upon the table, and recollecting I was in his books, I
               took up Hamlet, and turning imme>diately to the grave-diggers scene in <pb n="70"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:72"/> the fifth act, <ref target="a132" corresp="n132">I lay'd my finger upon YORICK</ref>, and
               advancing the book to the Count, with my finger all the way over the name—Me,
                  <hi>Voici!</hi> said I.</p>
            <p>Now whether the idea of poor Yorick's skull was put out of the Count's mind, by the
               reality of my own, or by what magic he could drop a period of seven or eight hun>dred
               years, makes nothing in this account—'tis certain the French con>ceive better than
               they combine—I wonder at nothing in this world, and the less at this; inasmuch as one
               of the first of our own church, for whose candour and paternal sentiments I have the
               highest veneration, fell <pb n="71" facs="tcp:1269300202:73"/> into the same mistake
               in the very same case.—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"He could not bear, he said, to

               I—but there are two Yorick's. The Yorick your lordship thinks of, has been dead and
               buried eight hundred years ago; he flourish'd in Horwendillus's court—the other
               Yorick is myself, who have flourish'd my lord in no court—He shook his head—Good God!
               said I, you might as well confound Alex>ander the Great, with Alexander the

            <p>—If Alexander king of Macedon could have translated your lordship, <pb n="72"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:74"/> said I—I'm sure your Lordship would not have said
               so.</p>
            <p>The poor Count de B**** fell but into the same <hi>error</hi>—</p>
            <p>—<hi>Et, Monsieur, est il Yorick?</hi> cried the Count.—<hi>Je le suis,</hi> said

            </p>

               there is no retreat from them in this world, then I take a new course—I leave it—and
               as I have a clearer idea of the elysian fields than I have of heaven, I force myself,
               like Eneas, into them—I see him meet the pensive shade of his forsaken Dido—and wish
               to re>cognize it—I see the injured spirit wave her head, and turn off silent from the
               author of her miseries and dishonours—I lose the feelings for myself in hers—and in
               those af>fections which were wont to make me mourn for her when I was at school.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Surely this is not walking in a vain shadow—nor does man disquiet himself</hi> in
               vain, <hi>by it</hi>—he oftener does so in <pb n="76" facs="tcp:1269300202:78"/>
               trusting the issue of his commotions to reason only.—I can safely say for myself, I
               was never able to conquer any one single bad sensation in my heart so decisively, as
               by beating up as fast as I could for some kindly and gentle sensation, to fight it
               upon its own ground.</p>
            <p>When I had got to the end of the third act, the Count de B**** en>tered with my
               Passport in his hand. Mons. le Duc de C****, said the Count, is as good a prophet, I
               dare say, as he is a statesman—<hi>Un homme qui rit,</hi> said the duke, <hi>ne sera
                  jamais dangereuz.</hi>—Had it been for any one but the king's jester, added the
               Count, I <pb n="77" facs="tcp:1269300202:79"/> could not have got it these two
                  hours.—<hi>Pardonncz moi,</hi> Mons. Le Compte, said I—I am not the king's
               jester.—But you are Yorick?—Yes.—<hi>Et vous plaisantez?</hi>—I answered, In>deed I
               did jest—but was not paid for it—'twas entirely at my own ex>pence.</p>
            <p>We have no jester at court, Mons. Le Compte, said I, the last we had was in <ref target="a133" corresp="n133">the
               licentious reign of Charles the IId</ref>—since which time our manners have been so
               gradually refining, that our court at present is so full of patriots, who wish for
                  <hi>nothing</hi> but the honours and wealth of their country—and our ladies are
               all so chaste, so spotless, so good, so devout <pb n="78" facs="tcp:1269300202:80"/>
               —there is nothing for a jester to make a jest of—</p>
            <p>

               of obtaining the Passport was not a little tarnish'd by the figure I cut in it—But
               there is nothing un>mixt in this world; and some of the gravest of our divines have
               carried it so far as to affirm, that enjoyment it>self <pb n="80"

               incommoded him all the time he wrote, and at last had entirely taken him off from his

            <p>—'Tis strange! writes Bevoriskius; but the facts are certain, for I have <pb n="81"

            <head>CHARACTER.</head>
            <head>VERSAILLES.</head>
            <p>AND how do you find the French? said the Count de B****, after he had given me the
               Passport.</p>
            <p>The reader may suppose that after so obliging a proof of courtesy, I could not be at
               a loss to say some>thing handsome to the enquiry.</p>
            <p>—<hi>Mais passe, pour cela</hi>—Speak frankly, said he; do you find all the urbanity
               in the French which the <pb n="84" facs="tcp:1269300202:86"/> world give us the
               honour of?—I had found every thing, I said, which con>firmed it—<hi>Vraiment,</hi>
               said the count.—<hi>Les Francois sont poli. s</hi>—To an ex>cess, replied I.</p>
            <p>The count took notice of the word <hi>excesse;</hi> and would have it I meant more
               than I said. I defended myself a long time as well as I could against it—he insisted
               I had a reserve, and that I would speak my opinion frankly.</p>
            <p>I believe, Mons. Le Compte, said I, that man has a certain compass, as well as an
               instrument; and that the social and other calls have occasion by turns for every key
               in him; sothat <pb n="85" facs="tcp:1269300202:87"/> if you begin a note too high or
               too low, there must be a want either in the upper or under part, to fill up the
               system of harmony.—The Count de B**** did not un>derstand music, so desired me to
               ex>plain it some other way. A polish'd nation, my dear Count, said I, makes every one
               its debtor; and besides urbanity itself, like the fair sex, has so many charms; it
               goes against the the heart to say it can do ill; and yet, I believe, there is but a
               certain line of perfection, that man, take him altogether, is empower'd to arrive
               at—if he gets beyond, he rather ex>changes qualities, than gets them. I must not
               presume to say, how far this has affected the French in the sub>ject <pb n="86"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:88"/> we are speaking of—but should it ever be the case of
               the English, in the progress of their resentments, to arrive at the same polish which
               dis>tinguishes the French, if we did not lose the <hi>politesse de coeur,</hi> which
               in>clines men more to human actions, than courteous ones—we should at least lose that
               distinct variety and originality of character, which dis>tinguishes them, not only
               from each other, but from all the world be>sides.</p>
            <p>I had a few <ref target="a135" corresp="n135">king William's shillings as smooth as glass</ref> in my pocket; and foreseeing
               they would be of use in the illustration of my hypothesis, <pb n="87"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:89"/> I had got them into my hand, when I had proceeded so
               far—</p>
            <p>See, Mons. Le Compte, said I, rising up, and laying them before him upon the table—by
               jingling and ribbing one against another for seventy years together in one body's
               pocket or another's, they are become so much alike, you can scarce distin>guish one
               shilling from another.</p>
            <p>The English, like antient medais, kept more apart, and passing but few peoples hands,
               preserve the first sharpnesses which the fine hand of na>ture has given them—they are
               not so pleasant to feel—but in return, <pb n="88" facs="tcp:1269300202:90"/> the
               legend is so visible, that at the first look you see whose image and superscription
               they bear.—But the French, Mons. Le Compte, added I, wishing to soften what I had
               said, have so many excellencies, they can the better spare this—they are a loyal, a
               gallant, a generous, an ingenious, and good temper'd people as is under heaven—if
               they have a fault—they are too <hi>serious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mon Dieu!</hi> cried the Count, rising out of his chair.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mais vous plaisantez,</hi> said he, cor>recting his exclamation.—I laid my hand
               upon my breast, and with ear>nest <pb n="89" facs="tcp:1269300202:91"/> gravity
               assured him, it was my most settled opinion.</p>
            <p>The Count said he was mortified, he could not stay to hear my rea>sons, being engaged
               to go that mo>ment to dine with the Duc de C****.</p>
            <p>But if it is not too far to come to Versailles to eat your soup with me, I beg,
               before you leave France, I may have the pleasure of knowing you retract your
               opinion—or, in what manner you support it.—But if you do support it, Mons. Anglois,
               said he, you must do it with all your powers, because you have the whole <pb n="90"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:92"/> world against you.—I promised the Count I would do
               myself the honour of dining with him before I set out for Italy—so took my leave.</p>

            <head>THE TEMPTATION.</head>
            <head>PARIS.</head>
            <p>WHEY I alighted at the hotel, the porter told me a young woman with a <ref target="a136" corresp="n136">band-box</ref> had
               been that moment enquiring for me.—I do not know, said the porter, whether she is
               gone away or no. I took the key of my chamber of him, and went up stairs; and when I
               had got with>in ten steps of the top of the landing before my door, I met her coming
               easily down.</p>
            <p>It was the fair <hi>fille de chambre</hi> I had walked along the Quai de Conti <pb
                  n="92" facs="tcp:1269300202:94"/> with: Madame de R**** had sent her upon some
               commissions to a <hi>mer>chande de modes</hi> within a step or two of the hotel de
               Modene; and as I had fail'd in waiting upon her, had bid her enquire if I had left
               Paris; and if so, whether I had not left a letter address'd to her.</p>
            <p>As the fair <hi>fille de chambre</hi> was so near my door she turned back, and went
               into the room with me for a moment or two whilst I wrote a card.</p>
            <p>It was a fine still evening in the latter end of the month of May—the crimson window
               curtains (which were of the same colour of those of <pb n="93"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:95"/> the bed) were drawn close—the sun was setting and
               reflected through them so warm a tint into the fair <hi>fille de chambre</hi>'s
               face—I thought she blush'd—the idea of it made me blush myself—we were quite alone;
               and that super-induced a second blush before the first could get off.</p>
            <p>There is a sort of a pleasing half guilty blush, where the blood is more in fault
               than the man—'tis sent impetuous from the heart, and virtue flies after it—not to
               call it back, but to make the sensation of it more delicious to the nerves—'tis
               asso>ciated.—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:1269300202:96"/> But I'll not describe it.—I felt something at
               first within me which was not in strict unison with the lesson of virtue I had given
               her the night before—I sought five mi>nutes for a card—I knew I had not one.—I took
               up a pen—I laid it down again—my hand trembled—the devil was in me.</p>
            <p>I know as well as any one, he is an adversary, whom if we resist, he will fly from
               us—but I seldom resist him at all; from a terror, that though I may conquer, I may
               still get a hurt in the combat—so I give up the triumph, for security; and instead of
               thinking to make him fly, I ge>nerally fly myself.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:1269300202:97"/> The fair <hi>fille de chambre</hi> came close
               up to the bureau where I was looking for a card—took up first the pen I cast down,
               then offered to hold me the ink: she offer'd it so sweetly, I was going to accept
               it—but I durst not—I have nothing, my dear, said I, to write upon.—Write it, said
               she, simply, upon any thing.—</p>
            <p>I was just going to cry out, Then I will write it, fair girl! upon thy lips.—</p>
            <p>If I do, said I, I shall perish—so I took her by the hand, and led her to the door,
               and begg'd she would not forget the lesson I had given her—She said, Indeed she would
               not— <pb n="96" facs="tcp:1269300202:98"/> and as she utter'd it with some
               ear>nestness, she turned about, and gave me both her hands, closed together, into
               mine—it was impossible not to compress them in that situation—I wish'd to let them
               go; and all the time I held them, I kept arguing within myself against it—and still I
               held them on.—In two minutes I found I had all the battle to fight over again—and I
               felt my legs and every limb about me tremble at the idea.</p>
            <p>The foot of the bed was within a yard and a half of the place where we were
               standingg—I had still hold of her hands—and how it happened I can give no account,
               but I neither <pb n="97" facs="tcp:1269300202:99"/> ask'd her—nor drew her—nor did I
               think of the bed—but so it did hap>pen, we both sat down.</p>
            <p>I'll just shew you, said the fair <hi>fille de chambre,</hi> the little purse I have
               been making to-day to hold your crown. So she put her hand into her right pocket,
               which was next me, and felt for it for sometime—then into into the left—<q
                  rend="inline">"She had lost it."</q>—I never bore expectation more quietly—it was
               in her right pocket at last—she pulled it out; it was of green taffeta, lined with a
               little bit of white quilted sattin, and just big enough to hold the crown—she put it
               into my hand—it was pretty; and I held it ten minutes with the back of my hand <pb
                  n="98" facs="tcp:1269300202:100"/> resting upon her lap—looking some>times at the
               purse, sometimes on one side of it.</p>
            <p>A stitch or two had broke out in the gathers of my stock—the fair <hi>fille de
                  chambre,</hi> without saying a word, took out her little hussive, threaded a small
               needle, and sew'd it up—I foresaw it would hazard the glory of the day; and as she
               passed her hand in silence across and across my neck in the manoeuvre, I felt the
               laurels shake which fancy had wreath'd about my head.</p>
            <p><ref target="a137" corresp="n137">A strap had given way in her walk, and the buckle of her shoe was just falling

            <p>YES—and then—Ye whose clay-cold heads and luke-warm hearts can argue down or mask
               your passions—tell me, what trespass is it that man should have them? or how his
               spirit stands answerable, to the father of spirits, but for his conduct under
               them?</p>
            <p>If nature has so wove her web of kindness, that some threads of love and desire are
               entangled with the piece—must the whole web be rent in drawing them out?—Whip me such
               stoics, great governor of nature! <pb n="101" facs="tcp:1269300202:103"/> said I to
               myself—Wherever thy pro>vidence shall place me for the trials of my virtue—whatever
               is my danger—whatever is my situation—let me feel the movements which rise out of it,
               and which belong to me as a man—and if I govern them as a good one—I will trust the
               issues to thy justice, for thou hast made us—and not we ourselves.</p>
            <p>As I finish'd my address, I raised the fair <hi>fille de chambre</hi> up by the hand,
               and led her out of the room—she stood by me till I lock'd the door and put the key in

               of musick</ref>, which had call'd forth my affections—therefore, when I let go the hand of
               the <hi>fille de chambre,</hi> I remain'd at the gate of the hotel for some time,
               looking at every one who pass'd by, and forming conjectures upon them, till my
               attention got fix'd <pb n="104" facs="tcp:1269300202:106"/> upon a single object
               which confounded all kind of reasoning upon him.</p>
            <p>It was a tall figure of a philoso>phic serious, adust look, which pass'd and repass'd
               sedately along the street, making a turn of about sixty paces on each side of the
               gate of the hotel—the man was about fifty-two—had a small cane under his arm—was
               dress'd in a dark <ref target="a140" corresp="n140">drab-colour'd coat</ref>, waistcoat, and breeches, which seem'd to have
               seen some years ser>vice—they were still clean, and there was a little air of <ref target="a141" corresp="n141">frugal
                  <hi>propretè</hi></ref> throughout him. By his pulling off his hat, and his attitude of
               accosting a good many in his way, I saw he was asking charity; so I got a sous or <pb
                  n="105" facs="tcp:1269300202:107"/> two out of my pocket ready to give him, as he
               took me in his turn—he pass'd by me without asking any thing—and yet did not go five
               steps further before he ask'd charity of a little woman—I was much more likely to
               have given of the two—He had scarce done with the woman, when he pull'd off his hat
               to another who was coming the same way.—An ancient gentleman came slowly—and, after
               him, a young smart one—He let them both pass, and ask'd nothing: I stood observing
               him half an hour, in which time he had made a dozen turns backwards and forwards, and
               found that he invariably pursued the same plan.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:1269300202:108"/> There were two things very sin>gular in this,
               which set my brain to work, and to no purpose—the first was, why the man should
                  <hi>only</hi> tell his story to the sex—and secondly—what kind of story it was,
               and what species of eloquence it could be, which soften'd the hearts of the women,
               which he knew 'twas to no purpose to practise upon the men.</p>
            <p>There were two other circum>stances which entangled this mystery—the one was, he told
               every woman what he had to say in her ear, and in a way which had much more the air
               of a secret than a petition—the other was, it was always successful—he never stopp'd
               a woman, but she <pb n="107" facs="tcp:1269300202:109"/> pull'd out her purse, and
               immedi>ately gave him something.</p>
            <p>I could form no system to explain the phenomenon.</p>
            <p>I had got a riddle to amuse me for the rest of the evening, so I walk'd up stairs to
               my chamber.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF CONSCIENCE.</head>
            <head>PARIS.</head>
            <p>I WAS immediately followed up by the master of the hotel, who came into my room to
               tell me I must provide lodgings else where.—How so, friend? said I.—He answer'd, I
               had had a young woman lock'd up with me two hours that evening in my bed-chamber, and
               'twas against the rules of his house.—Very well, said I, we'll all part friends
               then—for the girl is no worse—and I am no worse—and you will be just as I found
               you.—It was enough, he said, to <pb n="109" facs="tcp:1269300202:111"/> overthrow the
               credit of his hotel.—<hi>Voyez vous, Monsieur,</hi> said he, point>ing to the foot of
               the bed we had been sitting upon.—I own it had something of the appearance of an
               evidence; but my pride not suffering me to enter into any detail of the case, I
               exhorted him to let his soul sleep in peace, as I resolved to let mine do that night,
               and that I would dis>charge what I owed him at break>fast.</p>
            <p>I should not have minded, <hi>Monsieur,</hi> said he, if you had had twenty
               girls—'Tis a score more, replied I, in>terrupting him, than I ever reckon'd
               upon—Provided, added he, it hadbeen <pb n="110" facs="tcp:1269300202:112"/> but in a
               morning.—And does the difference of the time of the day at Paris make a difference in
               the sin?—It made a difference, he said, in the scandal.—I like a good distinction in
               my heart; and cannot say I was in>tolerably out of temper with the man.—I own it is
               necessary, re-assumed the master of the hotel, that a stranger at Paris should have
               the opportuni>ties presented to him of buying lace and silk stockings and ruffles,
                  <hi>et tout cela</hi>—and 'tis nothing if a woman comes with a band box.—O' my
               conscience, said I, she had one; but I never look'd into it.—Then, <hi>Monsieur,</hi>
               said he, has bought no>thing.—Not one earthly thing, replied I.—Because, said he, I
               could recom>mend <pb n="111" facs="tcp:1269300202:113"/> one to you who would use you
                  <hi>en conscience.</hi>—But I must see her this night, said I.—He made me a low
               bow and walk'd down.</p>
            <p>Now shall I triumph over this <hi>maitre d'hotel,</hi> cried I—and what then?—Then I
               shall let him see I know he is a dirty fellow.—And what then?—What then!—I was too
               near myself to say it was for the sake of others.—I had no good answer left—there was
               more of spleen than principle in my project, and I was sick of it before the
               execution.</p>
            <p>In a few minutes the Grisset came in with her box of lace—I'll buy <pb n="112"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:114"/> nothing however, said I, within my>self.</p>
            <p>The Grisset would shew me every thing—I was hard to please: she would not seem to see
               it; she open'd her little <ref target="a142" corresp="n142">magazine</ref>, laid all her laces one after another before
               me—un>folded and folded them up again one by one with the most patient sweetness—I
               might buy—or not—she would let me have every thing at my own price—the poor creature
               seem'd anxious to get a penny; and laid her>self out to win me, and not so much in a
               manner which seem'd artful, as in one I felt simple and caressing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:1269300202:115"/> If there is not a fund of honest cullibility
               in man, so much the worse—my heart relented, and I gave up my second resolution as
               quietly as the first—Why should I chastise one for the trespass of another? if thou
               art tributary to this tyrant of an host, thought I, looking up in her face, so much
               harder is thy bread.</p>
            <p>If I had not had more than four <hi>Louis d'ors</hi> in my purse, there was no such
               thing as rising up and shewing her the door, till I had first laid three of them out
               in a pair of ruffles.</p>
            <p>—The master of the hotel will share the profit with her—no mat>ter<pb n="114"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:116"/> —then I have only paid as many a poor soul has
                  <hi>paid</hi> before me for an act he <hi>could</hi> not do, or think of.</p>

            <head>THE RIDDLE.</head>
            <head>PARIS.</head>
            <p>WHEN La Fleur came up to wait upon me at supper, he told me how sorry the master of
               the hotel was for his affront to me in bidding me change my lodgings.</p>
            <p>A man who values a good night's rest will not lay down with enmity in his heart if he
               can help it—So I bid La Fleur tell the master of the hotel, that I was sorry on my
               side for the occasion I had given him— <pb n="116" facs="tcp:1269300202:118"/> and
               you may tell him, if you will, La Fleur, added I, that if the young woman should call
               again, I shall not see her.</p>
            <p>This was a sacrifice not to him, but myself, having resolved, after so narrow an
               escape, to run no more risks, but to leave Paris, if it was possible, with all the
               virtue I enter'd in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>C'est deroger à noblesse, Monsieur,</hi> said La Fleur, making me a bow down to
               the ground as he said it—<hi>Et encore Monsieur,</hi> said he, may change his
               sentiments—and if <hi>(par hazard)</hi> he should like to amuse himself— <pb n="117"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:119"/> I find no amusement in it, said I, interrupting
               him—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mon Dieu!</hi> said La Fleur—and took away.</p>
            <p>In an hour's time he came to put me to bed, and was more than com>monly
               officious—something hung upon his lips to say to me, or ask me, which he could not
               get off: I could not conceive what it was; and indeed gave myself little trouble to
               find it out, as I had another riddle so much more interesting upon my mind, which was
               that of the man's asking charity before the door of the hotel—I would have given any
               thing to have got to the bottom of it; and <pb n="118" facs="tcp:1269300202:120"/>
               that, not out of curiosity—'tis so low a principle of enquiry, in ge>neral, I would
               not purchase the grati>fication of it with a two-sous piece—but a secret, I thought,
               which so soon and so certainly soften'd the heart of every woman you came near, was a
               secret at least equal to the phi>losopher's stone: <ref target="a143" corresp="n143">had I had both the Indies</ref>, I would
               have given up one to have been master of it.</p>
            <p>I toss'd and turn'd it almost all night long in my brains to no man>ner of purpose;
               and when I awoke in the morning, I found my spirit as much troubled with my
                  <hi>dreams,</hi> as ever the king of Babylon had been <pb n="119"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:121"/> with his; and I will not hesitate to affirm, it would
               have puzzled all the wise men of Paris, as much as those of <ref target="a144" corresp="n144">Chaldea</ref>, to have given

            <head>LE DIMANCHE.</head>
            <head>PARIS.</head>
            <p>IT was Sunday; and when <ref target="a145" corresp="n145">La Fleur</ref> came in, in the morning, with my coffee and role and
               butter, he had got himself so gallantly array'd, I scarce knew him.</p>
            <p>I had convenanted at Montreal to give him <ref target="a146" corresp="n146">a new hat with a silver button and loop,
               and four Louis d'ors <hi>pour s'adoniser,</hi></ref> when we got to Paris; and the poor
               fellow, to do him justice, had done wonders with it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:1269300202:123"/> He had bought <ref target="a147" corresp="n147">a bright, clean, good scarlet
               coat and a pair of breeches of the same</ref>—They were not a crown worse, he said, for the
               wear>ing—I wish'd him hang'd for telling me—they look'd so fresh, that tho' I knew
               the thing could not be done, yet I would rather have imposed upon my fancy with
               thinking I had bought them new for the fellow, than that they had come out of the
                  <hi>Rue de friperie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a nicety which makes not the heart sore at Paris.</p>
            <p>He had purchased moreover <ref target="a148" corresp="n148">a handsome blue sattin waistcoat, fancifully enough
               embroidered</ref>—this <pb n="122" facs="tcp:1269300202:124"/> was indeed something the
               worse for the services it had done, but 'twas clean scour'd—the gold had been touch'd
               up, and upon the whole was rather showy than otherwise—and as the blue was not
               violent, it suited with the coat and breeches very well: he had squeez'd out of the
               money, moreover, <ref target="a149" corresp="n149">a new bag</ref> and <ref target="a150" corresp="n150">a solitaire</ref>; and had insisted with the
                  <hi>fripier,</hi> upon <ref target="a151" corresp="n151">a gold pair of garters</ref> to his breeches knees—He had
               purchased <ref target="a152" corresp="n152">muslin ruffles</ref>, <hi>bien brodées,</hi> with four livres of his own
               money—and a pair of <ref target="a153" corresp="n153">white silk stockings</ref> for five more—and, to top all, nature had
               given him a handsome figure, without costing him a sous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:1269300202:125"/> He enter'd the room thus set off, with his
               <ref target="a154" corresp="n154">hair dress'd in the first stile</ref>, and with a handsome <hi>bouquet</hi> in his
               breast—in a word, there was that look of festivity in every thing about him, which at
               once put me in mind it was Sunday—and by com>bining both together, it instantly
               struck me, that the favour he wish'd to ask of me the night before, was to spend the
               day, as every body in Paris spent it, besides. I had scarce made the conjecture, when
               La Fleur, with infinite humility, but with a look of trust, as if I should not
               re>fuse him, begg'd I would grant him the day, <hi>pour faire le galant vis à vis de

            <p>—And what mistress, La Fleur, said I, canst thou have pick'd up in so little a time

               knows—he had connected himself with the <hi>demoiselle</hi> upon the landing of the

               enough for me to win the Count to my inte>terest, La Fleur had contrived to make it
               do to win the maid to his—the family, it seems, was to be at Paris that day, and he
               had made a party with her, and two or three more of the Count's houshold, upon the

            <p>LA Fleur had left me something to amuse myself with for the day more than I had

            <p>He had brought the little print of butter upon a currant leaf; and as the morning was

               dinner, and leave me to breakfast by myself.</p>
            <p>When I had finish'd the butter, I threw the currant leaf out of the window, and was
               going to do the same by the waste paper—but stopping to read a line first, and that
               drawing me on to a second and third—I thought it better worth; so I shut the window,
               and drawing a chair up to it, I sat down to read it.</p>
            <p>It was in the old French of <ref target="a156" corresp="n156">Rabelais</ref>'s time, and for ought I know might have been
               wrote by him—it was moreover in <ref target="a157" corresp="n157">a Gothic letter</ref>, and that <pb n="130"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:134"/> so faded and gone off by damps and length of time, it
               cost me infinite trouble to make any thing of it—I threw it down; and then wrote a
               letter to <ref target="a158" corresp="n158">Eugenius</ref>—then I took it up again, and embroiled my patience with it
               afresh—and then to cure that, I wrote a letter to Eliza.—Still it kept hold of me;
               and the difficulty of un>derstanding it increased but the desire.</p>
            <p>I got my dinner; and after I had enlightened my mind with a bottle of Burgundy, I at
               it again—and after two or three hours poring upon it, with almost as deep attention
               as ever <ref target="a159"  corresp="n159">Gruter or Jacob Spon</ref> did upon a nonsensical inscription, I thought I <pb
                  n="131" facs="tcp:1269300202:135"/> made sense of it; but to make sure of it, the
               best way, I imagined, was to turn it into English, and see how it would look then—so
               I went on leisurely, as a trifling man does, some>times writing a sentence—then
               taking a turn or two—and then looking how the world went, out of the window; so that
               it was nine o'clock at night before I had done it—I then begun and read it as
               follows.</p>

            <head>THE FRAGMENT.</head>
            <head>PARIS.</head>
            <p>—Now as the notary's wife disputed the point with the no>tary with too much heat—I
               wish, said the notary, throwing down the parch>ment, that there was another notary
               here only to set down and attest all this—</p>
            <p>—And what would you do then, Monsieur? said she, rising hastily up—the notary's wife
               was a little fume of a woman, and the notary thought it <pb n="133"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:137"/> well to avoid a hurricane by a mild reply—I would go,
               answer'd he, to bed.—You may go to the devil, answer'd the notary's wife.</p>
            <p>Now there happening to be but one bed in the house, the other two rooms being
               unfurnish'd, as is the custom at Paris, and the notary not caring to lie in the same
               bed with a woman who had but that moment sent him pell-mell to the devil, went forth
               with his hat and cane and short cloak, the night being very windy, and walk'd out ill
               at ease towards the <hi>pont neuf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of all the bridges which ever were built, the whole world who have <pb n="134"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:138"/> pass'd over the <hi><ref target="a160" corresp="n160">pont neuf</ref>,</hi> must own, that it
               is the noblest—the finest—the grandest—the lightest—the longest—the broadest that
               ever conjoin'd land and land together upon the face of the terraqueous globe—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By this, it seems, as if the author of the fragment had not been a
                  French>man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The worst fault which divines and the doctors of the Sorbonne can al>lege against it,
               is, that if there is but a cap-full of wind in or about Paris, 'tis more
               blasphemously <hi>sacre Dieu'd</hi> there than in any other aper>ture of the whole
               city—and with rea>son, <pb n="135" facs="tcp:1269300202:139"/> good and cogent
               Messieurs; for it comes against you without crying <hi>garde d'eau,</hi> and with
               such unpre>meditable puffs, that of the few who cross it with their hats on, not one
               in fifty but hazards two livres and a half, which is its full worth.</p>
            <p>The poor notary, just as he was passing by the sentry, instinctively clapp'd his cane
               to the side of it, but in raising it up the point of his cane catching hold of the
               loop of the sen>tinel's hat hoisted it over the spikes of the <ref target="a161" corresp="n161">ballustrade</ref> clear into
               the Seine—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:1269300202:140"/> —<hi>'Tis an ill wind,</hi> said a boats>man,
               who catch'd it, <hi>which blows no body any good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The sentry being a <ref target="a162" corresp="n162">gascon</ref> incon>tinently twirl'd up his whiskers, and levell'd his
               <ref target="a163" corresp="n163">harquebuss</ref>.</p>
            <p>Harquebusses in those days went off with matches; and an old wo>man's <ref target="a164" corresp="n164">paper lanthorn</ref>
               at the end of the bridge happening to be blown out, she had borrow'd the sentry's
               match to light it—it gave a moment's time for the gascon's blood to run cool, and
               turn the accident better to his advantage—<hi>'Tis an ill wind,</hi> said he,
               catching off the notary's castor, and <pb n="137" facs="tcp:1269300202:141"/>
               legitimating the capture with the boatman's adage.</p>
            <p>The poor notary cross'd the bridge, and passing along the rue de Dauphine into the
               fauxbourgs of St. Germain, lamented himself as he walk'd along in this manner:</p>
            <p>Luckless man! that I am, said the <ref target="a165" corresp="n165">notary</ref>, to be the sport of hurri>canes all my

               pontific ones—to be here, bare-headed, in a windy night at the mercy of the ebbs and
               flows of acci>dents—where I am to lay my head?—miserable man! what wind in the
               two-and-thirty points of the whole com>pass can blow unto thee, as it does to the
               rest of thy fellow creatures, good!</p>
            <p>As the notary was passing on by a dark passage, complaining in this sort, a voice
               call'd out to a girl, to bid her run for the next notary—now the notary being the
               next, and avail>ing himself of his situation, walk'd up the passage to the door, and
               pass>ing <pb n="139" facs="tcp:1269300202:145"/> through an old sort of a saloon, was
               usher'd into a large chamber dis>mantled of every thing but a long military pike—a
               breast plate—a rusty old sword, and bandoleer, hung up equi-distant in four different
               places against the wall.</p>
            <p>An old personage, who had hereto>sore been a gentleman, and unless de>cay of fortune
               taints the blood along with it was a gentleman at that time, lay supporting his head
               upon his hand in his bed; a little table with a taper burning was set close beside
               it, and close by the table was placed a chair—the notary sat him down in it; and
               pulling out his ink-horn and a sheet or two of paper which he had in his <pb n="140"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:146"/> pocket, he placed them before him, and dipping his pen
               in his ink, and leaning his breast over the table, he disposed every thing to make
               the gentleman's last will and testa>ment.</p>
            <p>Alas! Monsieur le Notaire, said the gentleman, raising himself up a little, I have
               nothing to bequeath which will pay the expence of be>queathing, except the history of
               my>self, which, I could not die in peace unless I left it as a legacy to the world;
               the profits arising out of it, I bequeath to you for the pains of tak>ing it from
               me—it is a story so un>common, it must me read by all <pb n="141"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:147"/> mankind—it will make the fortunes of your house—the
               notary dipp'd his pen into his ink-horn—Almighty di>rector of every event in my life!
               said the old gentleman, looking up ear>nestly and raising his hands towards
               heaven—thou whose hand has led me on through such a labyrinth of strange passages
               down into this scene of desolation, assist the decaying me>mory of an old, infirm,
               and broken>hearted man—direct my tongue, by the spirit of thy eternal truth, that
               this stranger may set down naught but what is written in that Book, from whose
               records, said he, clasping his hands together, I am to be condemn'd or acquitted!—the
               notary held up <pb n="142" facs="tcp:1269300202:148"/> the point of his pen betwixt
               the taper and his eye—</p>
            <p>—It is a story, Monsieur le No>taire, said the gentleman, which will rouse up every
               affection in nature—it will kill the humane, and touch the heart of cruelty herself
               with pity—</p>
            <p>—The notary was inflamed with a desire to begin, and put his pen a third time into
               his ink-horn—and the old gentleman turning a little more towards the notary, began to
               dictate his story in these words—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:1269300202:149"/> —And where is the rest of it, La Fleur? said

            <p>WHEN La Fleur came up close to the table, and was made to comprehend what I wanted,
               he told me there were only two other sheets of it which he had wrapt round the stalks

            <head>THE ACT OF CHARITY.</head>
            <head>PARIS.</head>
            <p>THE man who either disdains or fears to walk up a dark entry may be an excellent good
               man, and fit for a hundred things; but he will not do to make a good sentimental
               traveller. I count little of the many things I see pass at broad noon day, in large
               and open streets.—Na>ture is shy, and hates to act before spectators; but in such an
               unob>served corner, you sometimes see a single short scene of her's worth all the
               sentiments of a dozen French plays compounded together—and yet <pb n="148"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:154"/> they are <hi>absolutely</hi> fine;—and when>ever I
               have a more brilliant affair upon my hands than common, as they suit a preacher just
               as well as a hero, I generally make my sermon out of 'em—and for the text—<q
                  rend="inline margQuotes">"Ca>padosia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and
               Pamphilia"</q>—is as good as any one in the Bible.</p>
            <p>There is a long dark passage issu>ing out from the opera comique into a narrow
               street; 'tis trod by a few who humbly wait for a <hi><ref target="a167" corresp="n167">fiacre</ref></hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Hackney-coach.</note>, or wish to get off quietly o'foot
               when the opera is done. At the end of it, towards the theatre, 'tis lighted by a
               small candle, <pb n="149" facs="tcp:1269300202:155"/> the light of which is almost
               lost before you get half-way down, but near the door—'tis more for ornament than use:
               you see it as a fix'd star of the least magnitude; it burns—but does little good to
               the world, that we know of.</p>
            <p>In returning along this passage, I discern'd, as I approach'd within five or six
               paces of the door, two ladies standing arm in arm, with their backs against the wall,
               waiting, as I ima>gined, for a <hi>fiacre</hi>—as they were next the door, I thought
               they had a prior right; so edged myself up within a yard or little more of them, and
               quietly took my stand—I was in black, and scarce seen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:1269300202:156"/> The lady next me was a tall lean figure of a
               woman of about thirty-six; the other of the same size and make, of about forty; there
               was no mark of wife or widow in any one part of either of them—they seem'd to be two
               upright vestal sisters, unsapp'd by caresses, unbroke in upon by tender salutations:
               I could have wish'd to have made them happy—their happiness was destin'd, that night,
               to come from another quar>ter.</p>
            <p>A low voice, with a good turn of expression, and sweet cadence at the end of it,
               begg'd for a twelve-sous piece betwixt them, for the love of heaven. I thought it
               singular, that <pb n="151" facs="tcp:1269300202:157"/> a beggar should fix the quota
               of an alms—and that the sum should be twelve times as much as what is usually given
               in the dark. They both seemed astonish'd at it as much as myself.—Twelve sous! said
               one—a twelve-sous piece! said the other—and made no reply.</p>
            <p>The poor man said, He knew not how to ask less of ladies of their rank; and bow'd
               down his head to the ground.</p>
            <p>Poo! said they—we have no money.</p>
            <p>The beggar remained silent for a moment or two, and renew'd his sup>plication.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:1269300202:158"/> Do not, my fair young ladies, said he, stop
               your good ears against me—Upon my word, honest man! said the younger, we have no
               change—Then God bless you, said the poor man, and multiply those joys which you can
               give to others without change!—I observed the elder sister put her hand into her
               pocket—I'll see, said she, if I have a sous.—A sous! give twelve, said the
               suppli>cant; Nature has been bountiful to you, be bountiful to a poor man.</p>
            <p>I would, friend, with all my heart, said the younger, if I had it.</p>
            <p>My fair charitable! said he, addressing himself to the elder— <pb n="153"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:159"/> What is it but your goodness and hu>manity which makes
               your bright eyes so sweet, that they outshine the the morning even in this dark
               passage? and what was it which made the Marquis de Santerre and his brother say so
               much of you both as they just pass'd by?</p>
            <p>The two ladies seemed much af>fected; and impulsively at the same time they both put
               their hands into their pocket, and each took out a twelve-sous piece.</p>
            <p>The contest betwixt them and the poor supplicant was no more—it was continued betwixt
               themselves, which <pb n="152" facs="tcp:1269300202:160"/>

            <head>PARIS.</head>
            <p>I Stepp'd hastily after him: it was the very man whose success in asking charity of
               the women before the door of the hotel had so puzzled me—and I found at once his
               secret, or at least the basis of it—'twas flattery.</p>
            <p>Delicious essence! how refreshing art thou to nature! how strongly are all its powers
               and all its weaknesses on thy side! how sweetly dost thou mix with the blood, and
               help it through the most difficult and tortu>ous passages to the heart!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:1269300202:164"/> The poor man, as he was not straighten'd for
               time, had given it here in a larger dose: 'tis certain he had a way of bringing it
               into less form, for the many sudden cases he had to do with in the streets; but how
               he contrived to correct, sweeten, concentre, and qualify it—I vex not my spirit with
               the inquiry—it is enough, the beggar gain'd two twelve>sous pieces—and they can best
               tell the rest, who have gain'd much greater matters by it.</p>

            <p>WE get forwards in the world not so much by doing ser>vices, as receiving them: you
               take a withering twig, and put it in the ground; and then you water it, be>cause you
               have planted it.</p>
            <p>Mons. Le Compte de B****, merely because he had done me one kindness in the affair of
               my pass>port, would go on and do me another, the few days he was at Paris, in making
               me known to a few people of rank; and they were to present me to others, and so
               on.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:1269300202:166"/> I had got master of my <hi>secret,</hi> just
               in time to turn these honours to some little account; otherwise, as is com>monly the
               case, I should have din'd or supp'd a single time or two round, and then by
                  <hi>translating</hi> French looks and attitudes into plain English, I should
               presently have seen, that I had got hold of the <hi>couvert</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Plate, napkin, knife, fork, and spoon.</note> of some more
               entertaining guest; and in course, should have resigned all my places one after
               another, merely upon the principle that I could not keep them.—As it was, things did
               not go much amiss.</p>
            <p>I had the honour of being intro>duced to the old Marquis de B****: <pb n="159"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:167"/> in days of yore he had signaliz'd himself by some
               small feats of chi>valry in the <hi>Cour d'amour,</hi> and had dress'd himself out to
               the idea of tilts and tournaments ever since—the Marquis de B**** wish'd to have it
               thought the affair was somewhere else than in his brain. <q rend="inline margQuotes"
                  >"He could like to take a trip to England,"</q> and ask'd much of the English
               ladies. Stay where you are, I beseech you, Mons. le Marquise, said I—Les Messrs.
               Angloise can scarce get a kind look from them as it is.—The Marquis invited me to
               supper.</p>
            <p>Mons. P**** the farmer-general was just as inquisitive about our taxes.—They were
               very considerable, <pb n="160" facs="tcp:1269300202:168"/> he heard—If we knew but
               how to collect them, said I, making him a low bow.</p>
            <p>I could never have been invited to Mons. P****'s concerts upon any other terms.</p>
            <p>I had been misrepresented to Ma>dame de Q*** as an <hi>esprit</hi>—Madam de Q*** was
               an <hi>esprit</hi> her>self; she burnt with impatience to see me, and hear me talk. I
               had not taken my seat, before I saw she did not care a sous whether I had any wit or
               no—I was let in, to be con>vinced she had.—I call heaven to witness I never once
               open'd the door of my lips.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:1269300202:169"/> Madame de Q*** vow'd to every creature she
               met, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"She had never had a more improving conver>sation
                  with a man in her life."</q>
            </p>
            <p>There are three epochas in the empire of a French-woman—She is <ref target="a168" corresp="n168">coquette</ref>—then
               <ref target="a169" corresp="n169">deist</ref>—then <hi><ref target="a170" corresp="n170">devôte</ref>:</hi> the empire during these is never lost—she only changes
               her subjects: when thirty-five years and more have unpeopled her dominions of the
               slaves of love, she re-peoples it with slaves of infidelity—and then with the slaves
               of the Church.</p>
            <p>Madame de V*** was vibrating betwixt the first of these epochas: the colour of the
               rose was shading <pb n="162" facs="tcp:1269300202:170"/> fast away—she ought to have
               been a deist five years before the time I had the honour to pay my first visit.</p>
            <p>She placed me upon the same so>pha with her, for the sake of disput>ing the point of
               religion more closely.—In short, Madame de V*** told me she believed nothing.</p>
            <p>I told Madame de V*** it might be her principle; but I was sure it could not be her
               interest to level the outworks, without which I could not conceive how such a citadel
               as hers could be defended—that there was not a more dangerous thing in the world,
               than for a beauty to be a deist—that it was a debt I owed my <pb n="163"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:171"/> creed, not to conceal it from her—that I had not been
               five minutes sat upon the sopha besides her, but I had begun to form designs—and what
               is it, but the sentiments of religion, and the persuasion they had existed in her
               breast, which could have check'd them as they rose up.</p>
            <p>We are not adamant, said I, taking hold of her hand—and there is need of all
               restraints, till age in her own time steals in and lays them on us—but, my dear lady,
               said I, kissing her hand—'tis too—too soon—</p>
            <p>I declare I had the credit all over Paris of unperverting Madame de V***.—She
               affirmed to Mons. <pb n="164" facs="tcp:1269300202:172"/> D*** and the Abbe M***,
               that in one half hour I had said more for revealed religion, than all their
               Ency>clopedia had said against it—I was listed directly into Madame de V***'s
                  <hi>Coterie</hi>—and she put off the epocha of deism for two years.</p>
            <p>I remember it was in this <hi>Coterie,</hi> in the middle of a discourse, in which I
               was shewing the necessity of a <hi>first cause,</hi> that the young Count de
               Fai>neant took me by the hand to the furthest corner of the room, to tell me my
                  <hi>solitaire</hi> was pinn'd too strait about my neck—It should be <hi>plus
                  badinant,</hi> said the Count, looking down upon his own—but a word, Mons. Yorick,
               to <hi>the wise</hi>—.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:1269300202:173"/> —And from the wise, Mons. Le Compte, replied
               I, making him a bow—<hi>is enough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Count de Faineant embraced me with more ardour than ever I was embraced by mortal
               man.</p>
            <p>For three weeks together, I was of every man's opinion I met.—<hi>Pardi! ce Mons.
                  Yorick a autant d'esprit que nous autres.—Il rai>sonne bien,</hi> said
                  another.—<hi>C'est un bon enfant,</hi> said a third.—And at this price I could
               have eaten and drank and been merry all the days of my life at Paris; but 'twas a
               dishonest <hi>reckoning</hi>—I grew ashamed of it—it was the gain of a slave— <pb
                  n="166" facs="tcp:1269300202:174"/> every sentiment of honour revolted against
               it—the higher I got, the more was I forced upon my <hi>beggarly system</hi>—the
               better the <hi><ref target="a171" corresp="n171">Coterie</ref></hi>—the more children of Art—I languish'd for those of
               Nature: and one night, after a most vile prostitution of my>self to half a dozen
               different people, I grew sick—went to bed—order'd La Fleur to get me horses in the
               morning to set out for Italy.</p>

            <p>I NEVER felt what the distress of plenty was in any one shape till now—to travel it
               through <ref target="a173" corresp="n173">the Bourbonnois, the sweetest part of France</ref>—in the hey-day of the vintage,
               when Nature is pouring her abundance into every one's lap, and every eye is lifted
               up—a journey through each step of which music beats time to <hi>Labour,</hi> and all
               her children are re>joicing as they carry in their clusters—to pass through this with
               my affec>tions flying out, and kindling at every <pb n="168"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:176"/> group before me—and every one of 'em was pregnant with
               adventures.</p>
            <p>Just heaven!—it would fill up twenty volumes—and alas! I have but a few small pages
               left of this to croud it into—and half of these must be taken up with the poor Maria
               <ref target="a174" corresp="n174">my friend, Mr. Shandy</ref>, met with near Moulines.</p>
            <p>The story he had told of that dis>order'd maid affect'd me not a little in the
               reading; but when I got with>in the neighbouthood where she lived, it returned so
               strong into my mind, that I could not resist an impulse which prompted me to go half
               a league out of the road to the village <pb n="169" facs="tcp:1269300202:177"/> where
               her parents dwelt to enquire after her.</p>
            <p>'Tis going, I own, like the <ref target="a175" corresp="n175">Knight of the Woeful Countenance</ref>, in quest of melancholy
               adventures—but I know not how it is, but I am never so perfectly conscious of the
               existence of a soul within me, as when I am en>tangled in them.</p>
            <p>The old mother came to the door, her looks told me the story before she open'd her
               mouth—She had lost her husband; he had died, she said, of anguish, for the loss of
               Maria's senses about a month before.—She had feared at first, she added, that it
               would have plunder'd her poor girl <pb n="170" facs="tcp:1269300202:178"/> of what
               little understanding was left—but, on the contrary, it had brought her more to
               herself—still she could not rest—her poor daughter, she said, crying, was wandering
               some>where about the road—</p>
            <p>—Why does my pulse beat languid as I write this? and what made La Fleur, whose heart
               seem'd only to be tuned to joy, to pass the back of his hand twice across his eyes,
               as the woman stood and told it? I beck>on'd to the postilion to turn back into the
               road.</p>
            <p>When we had got within half a league of Moulines, at a little opening in the road
               leading to a thicket, I <pb n="171" facs="tcp:1269300202:179"/> discovered poor Maria
               sitting under a poplar—she was sitting with her elbow in her lap, and her head
               lean>ing on one side within her hand—a small brook ran at the foot of the tree.</p>
            <p>I bid the postilion go on with the chaise to Moulines—and La Fleur to bespeak my
               supper—and that I would walk after him.</p>
            <p>She was dress'd in white, and much as my friend described her, except that her hair
               hung loose, which before was twisted within a <ref target="a176" corresp="n176">silk net</ref>.—She had, superadded likewise
               to her jacket, a pale green ribband which fell across her shoulder to the waist; at
               the end <pb n="172" facs="tcp:1269300202:180"/> of which hung <ref target="a177" corresp="n177">her pipe</ref>.—Her goat had
               been as faithless as her lover; and she had got <ref target="a178" corresp="n178">a little dog</ref> in lieu of him, which
               she had kept tied by a string to her girdle; as I look'd at her dog, she drew him
               towards her with the string.—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Thou shalt not leave me,
                  Sylvio,"</q> said she. I look'd in Maria's eyes, and saw she was thinking more of
               her father than of her lover or her little goat; for as she utter'd them the tears
               trickled down her cheeks.</p>
            <p>I sat down close by her; and Ma>ria let me wipe them away as they fell with my
               handkerchief.—I then sleep'd it in my own—and then in hers—and then in mine—and then
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:1269300202:181"/> I wip'd hers again—and as I did it, I felt
               such undescribable emotions within me, as I am sure could not be accounted for from
               any combina>tions of matter and motion.</p>
            <p>I am positive I have a soul; nor can all the books with which mate>rialists have
               pester'd the world ever convince me of the contrary.</p>

            <head>MARIA.</head>
            <p>WHEN Maria had come a little to herself, I ask'd her if she remember'd a pale thin
               person of a man who had sat down betwixt her and her goat about two years before? She
               said, she was unsettled much at that time, but remember'd it upon two accounts—that
               ill as she was she saw the person pitied her; and next, that her goat had stolen his
               handker>chief, and she had beat him for the theft—she had wash'd it, she said, in the
               brook, and kept it ever since in her pocket to restore it to him in case she should
               ever see him again, which, <pb n="175" facs="tcp:1269300202:183"/> she added, he had
               half promised her. As she told me this, she took the hand>kerchief out of her pocket
               to let me see it; she had folded it up neatly in a couple of vine leaves, tied round
               with a tendril—on opening it, I saw an S mark'd in one of the corners.</p>
            <p>She had since that, she told me, stray'd as far as Rome, and walk'd round St Peter's
               once—and return'd back—that she found her way alone across the Apennines—had
               travell'd over all Lombardy without money—and through the flinty roads of Savoy
               without shoes—how she had borne it, and how she had got sup>ported, she could not
               tell—but <hi>God</hi>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:1269300202:184"/>
               <hi>tempers the wind,</hi> said Maria, to the shorn lamb.</p>
            <p>Shorn indeed! and to the quick, said I; and wast thou in my own land, where I have a
               cottage, I would take thee to it and shelter thee: thou shouldst eat of my own bread,
               and drink of my own cup—I would be kind to thy Sylvio—in all thy weak>nesses and
               wanderings I would seek after thee and bring thee back—when the sun went down I would
               say my prayers, and when I had done thou shouldst play thy evening song upon thy
               pipe, nor would the incense of my sacrifice be worse accepted for entering heaven
               along with that of a broken heart.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:1269300202:185"/> Nature melted within me, as I utter'd this;
               and Maria observing, as I took out my handkerchief, that it was steep'd to much
               already to be of use, would needs go wash it in the stream.—And where will you dry
               it, Maria? said I—I'll dry it in my bo>som, said she—'twill do me good.</p>
            <p>And is your heart still so warm, Maria? said I.</p>
            <p>I touch'd upon the string on which hung all her sorrows—she look'd with wistful
               disorder for some time in my face; and then, without saying any thing, took her pipe,
               and play'd her service to the Virgin—The string I had touch'd ceased to vibrate—in a
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:1269300202:186"/> moment or two Maria returned to
               herself—let her pipe fall—and rose up.</p>
            <p>And where art you going, Ma>ria? said I.—She said to Moulines.—Let us go, said I,
               together.—Maria put her arm within mine, and length>ening the string, to let the dog
               follow—in that order we entered Mou>lines.</p>

            <p>THO' I hate salutations and greetings in the market-place, yet when we got into the

            <p>THERE was nothing from which I had painted out for myself so joyous a riot of the

            <head>THE SUPPER.</head>
            <p>A SHOE coming loose from the fore-foot of the thill-horse, at the beginning of the
               ascent of mount Taurira, the postilion dismounted, twisted the shoe off, and put it
               in his pocket; as the ascent was of five or six miles, and that horse our main
               dependence, I made a point of having the shoe fasten'd on again, as well as we could;
               but the postilion had thrown away the nails, and the ham>mer in the chaise-box, being
               of no great use without them, I submitted to go on.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:1269300202:194"/> He had not mounted half a mile higher, when
               coming to a flinty piece of road, the poor devil lost a second shoe, and from off his
               other fore-foot; I then got out of the chaise in good earnest; and seeing a house
               about a quarter of a mile to the left-hand, with a great deal to do, I prevailed upon
               the postilion to turn up to it. The look of the house, and of every thing about it,
               as we drew nearer, soon reconciled me to the disaster.—It was a little farm-house
               surrounded with about twenty acres of vineyard, about as much corn—and close to the
               house, on one side, was a <hi>potagerie</hi> of an acre and a half, full of every
               thing <pb n="187" facs="tcp:1269300202:195"/> which could make plenty in a French
               peasant's house—and on the other side was a little wood which furnished wherewithal
               to dress it. It was about eight in the evening when I got to the house—so I left the
               postilion to ma>nage his point as he could—and for mine, I walk'd directly into the
               house.</p>
            <p>The family consisted of an old grey-headed man and his wife, with five or six sons
               and sons-in-law and their several wives, and a joyous ge>nealogy out of 'em.</p>
            <p>They were all sitting down to>gether to their lentil-soup; a large wheaten loaf was
               in the middle of the <pb n="188" facs="tcp:1269300202:196"/> table; and a <ref target="a181" corresp="n181">flaggon of
               wine</ref> at each end of it promised joy thro' the stages of the repast—'twas a feast of
               love.</p>
            <p>The old man rose up to meet me, and with a respectful cordiality would have me sit
               down at the table; my heart was sat down the moment I en>ter'd the room; so I sat
               down at once like a son of the family; and to invest myself in the character as
               speedily as I could, I instantly borrowed the old man's knife, and taking up the loaf
               cut myself a hearty luncheon; and as I did it I saw a testimony in every eye, not
               only of an honest welcome, but of a welcome mix'd with thanks that I had not seem'd
               to doubt it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:1269300202:197"/> Was it this; or tell me, Nature, what else it
               was which made this mor>sel so sweet—and to what magick I owe it, that the draught I
               took of their flaggon was so delicious with it, that they remain upon my palate to
               this hour?</p>
            <p>If the supper was to my taste—the grace which follow'd it was much more so.</p>

            <head>THE GRACE.</head>
            <p>WHEN supper was over, the old man gave a knock upon the table with the haft of his
               knife—to bid them prepare for the dance: the moment the signal was given, the women
               and girls ran all together into a back apartment to tye up their hair—and the young
               men to the door to wash their faces, and change their <ref target="a182" corresp="n182">sabots</ref>; and in three minutes
               every soul was ready upon a little espla>nade before the house to begin—The old man
               and his wife came out last, and, placing me betwixt them, sat down upon a sopha of
               turf by the door.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:1269300202:199"/> The old man had some fifty years ago been no
               mean performer upon the <ref target="a183" corresp="n183">vielle</ref>—and at the age he was then of, touch'd it well enough
               for the purpose. His wife sung now-and-then a little to the tune—then
               inter>mitted—and joined her old man again as their children and grand-children danced
               before them.</p>
            <p>It was not till the middle of the second dance, when, from some pauses in the
               movement wherein they all seemed to look up, I fancied I could distinguish an
               elevation of spirit dif>ferent from that which is the cause or the effect of simple
               jollity.—In a word, I thought I beheld <hi>Religion</hi> mixing in the dance—but as I
               had never seen <pb n="192" facs="tcp:1269300202:200"/> her so engaged, I should have
               look'd upon it now, as one of the illusions of an imagination which is eternally
               misleading me, had not the old man, as soon as the dance ended, said, that this was
               their constant way; and that all his life long he had made it a rule, after supper
               was over, to call out his family to dance and rejoice; believing, he said, that a
               chearful and contented mind was the best sort of thanks to heaven that an illiterate
               peasant could pay—</p>
            <p>—Or a learned prelate either, said I.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF DELICACY.</head>
            <p>WHEN you have gained the top of mount Taurira, you run presently down to Lyons—adieu
               then to all rapid movements! 'Tis a journey of caution; and it fares better with
               sentiments, not to be in a hurry with them; so I con>tracted with a <ref target="a184" corresp="n184">Voiturin</ref> to take
               his time with a couple of mules, and convey me in my own chaise safe to Turin through
               Savoy.</p>
            <p>Poor, patient, quiet, honest peo>ple! fear not; your poverty, the treasury of your
               simple virtues, will <pb n="194" facs="tcp:1269300202:202"/> not be envied you by the
               world, nor will your vallies be invaded by it.—Nature! in the midst of thy
               dis>orders, thou art still friendly to the scantiness thou hast created—with all thy
               great works about thee, little hast thou left to give, either to the scithe or to the
               sickle—but to that little, thou grantest safety and protec>tion; and sweet are the
               dwellings which stand so shelter'd.</p>
            <p>Let the way-worn traveller vent his complaints upon the sudden turns and dangers of
               your roads—your rocks—your precipices—the difficulties of getting up—the horrors of
               getting down—mountains impracticable—and cataracts, which roll down great <pb n="195"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:203"/> stones from their summits, and block his up road.—The
               peasants had been all day at work in removing a fragment of this kind between St.
               Michael and Madane; and by the time my Voi>turin got to the place, it wanted full two
               hours of compleating be>fore a passage could any how be gain'd: there was nothing but
               to wait with patience—'twas a wet and tem>pestuous night; so that by the de>lay, and
               that together, the Voiturin found himself obliged to take up five miles short of his
               stage at a little decent kind of an inn by the road side.</p>
            <p>I forthwith took possession of my bed-chamber—got a good fire—or>der'd <pb n="196"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:204"/> supper; and was thanking heaven it was no worse—when a
               voiture arrived with a lady in it and her servant-maid.</p>
            <p>As there was no other bed-cham>ber in the house, the hostess, without much nicety,
               led them into mine, telling them, as she usher'd them in, that there was no body in
               it but an English gentleman—that there were two good beds, in it and a closet with>in
               the room which held another—the accent in which she spoke of this third bed did not
               say much for it—however, she said, there were three beds, and but three people—and
               she durst say, the gentleman would do <pb n="197" facs="tcp:1269300202:205"/> any
               thing to accommodate matters.—I left not the lady a moment to make a conjecture about
               it—so instantly made a declaration I would do any thing in my power.</p>
            <p>As this did not amount to an ab>solute surrender of my bed-chamber, I still felt
               myself so much the pro>prietor, as to have a right to do the honours of it—so I
               desired the lady to sit down—pressed her into the warmest seat—call'd for more
               wood—desired the hostess to enlarge the plan of the supper, and to favour us with the
               very best wine.</p>
            <p>The lady had scarce warm'd her>self five minutes at the fire, before <pb n="198"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:206"/> she began to turn her head back, and give alook at the
               beds; and the oftener she cast her eyes that way, the more they return'd perplex'd—I
               felt for her—and for myself; for in a few minutes, what by her looks, and the case
               itself, I found my>self as much embarrassed as it was possible the lady could be
               herself.</p>
            <p>That the beds we were to lay in were in one and the same room, was enough simply by
               itself to have ex>cited all this—but the position of them, for they stood parallel,
               and so very close to each other as only to allow space for a small wicker chair
               betwixt them, render'd the affair <pb n="199" facs="tcp:1269300202:207"/> still more
               oppressive to us—they were fixed up moreover near the fire, and the projection of the
               chimney on one side, and a large beam which cross'd the room on the other, form'd a
               kind of recess for them that was no way favourable to the nicety of our
               sen>sations—if any thing could have added to it, it was, that the two beds were both
               of 'em so very small, as to cut us off from every idea of the lady and the maid lying
               together; which in either of them, could it have been feasible, my lying besides
               them, tho' a thing not to be wish'd, yet there was nothing in it so terrible which
               the imagination might not have pass'd over without torment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:1269300202:208"/> As for the little room within, it offer'd
               little or no consolation to us; 'twas a damp cold closet, with a half dismantled
               window shutter, and with a window which had neither glass or oil paper in it to keep
               out the tem>pest of the night. I did not endea>vour to stifle my cough when the lady
               gave a peep into it; so it reduced the case in course to this alternative—that the
               lady should sacrifice her health to her feelings, and take up with the closet
               herself, and abandon the bed next mine to her maid—or that the girl should take the
               closet, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The lady was a <ref target="a185" corresp="n185">Piedmontese</ref> of about thirty, with a glow of health <pb n="201"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:209"/> in her cheeks.—The maid was a <ref target="a186" corresp="n186">Lyonoise</ref> of twenty, and
               as brisk and lively a French girl as ever moved.—There were difficulties every
               way—and the obstacle of the stone in the road, which brought us into the dis>tress,
               great as it appeared whilst the peasants were removing it, was but a pebble to what
               lay in our ways now—I have only to add, that it did not lessen the weight which hung
               upon our spirits, that we were both too delicate to communicate what we felt to each
               other upon the oc>casion.</p>
            <p>We sat down to supper; and had we not had more generous wine to it than a little inn
               in Savoy could have <pb n="200" facs="tcp:1269300202:210"/>

               necessity herself had set them at liberty—but the lady having a few bottles of
               Burgundy in her voiture sent down her Fille de Chambre for a couple of them; so that
               by the time supper was over, and we were left alone, we felt ourselves inspired with
               a strength of mind suf>ficient to talk, at least, without re>serve upon our
               situation. We turn'd it every way, and debated and con>sidered it in all kind of
               lights in the course of a two hours negociation; at the end of which the <ref target="a187" corresp="n187">articles</ref>
               were settled finally betwixt us, and stipulat>ed for in form and manner of a treaty
               of peace—and I believe with as much <pb n="203" facs="tcp:1269300202:213"/> religion
               and good faith on both sides, as in any treaty which as yet had the honour of being
               handed down to po>sterity.</p>
            <p>They were as follows:</p>
            <p>First. As the right of the bed>chamber is in Monsieur—and he thinking the bed next to
               the fire to be the warmest, he insists upon the concession on the lady's side of
               tak>ing up with it.</p>
            <p>Granted, on the part of Madame; with a <ref target="a188" corresp="n188">proviso</ref>, That as the curtains of that bed are
               of a flimsy trans>parent cotton, and appear likewise too scanty to draw close, that
               the <pb n="204" facs="tcp:1269300202:214"/> Fille de Chambre, shall fasten up the
               opening, either by corking pins, or needle and thread, in such manner as shall be
               deemed a sufficient barrier on the side of Monsieur.</p>
            <p>2dly. It is required on the part of Madame, that Monsieur shall lay the whole night
               through in his robe de chambre.</p>
            <p>Rejected: inasmuch Monsieur is not worth a robe de chambre; he having nothing in his
               portmanteau but six shirts and a black silk pair of breeches.</p>
            <p>The mentioning the silk pair of breeches made an entire change of the article—for the
               breeches were ac>cepted <pb n="205" facs="tcp:1269300202:215"/> as an equivalent for
               the robe de chambre, and so it was stipulated and agreed upon that I should lay in my
               black silk breeches all night.</p>
            <p>3dly. It was insisted upon, and sti>pulated for by the lady, that after Monsieur was
               got to bed, and the candle and fire extinguished, that Monsieur should not speak one
               single word the whole night.</p>
            <p>Granted; provided Monsieur's say>ing his prayers might not be deem'd an infraction of
               the treaty.</p>
            <p>There was but one point forgot in this treaty, and that was the manner in which the
               lady and myself should <pb n="206" facs="tcp:1269300202:216"/> be obliged to undress
               and get to bed—there was but one way of doing it, and that I leave to the reader to
               de>vise; protesting as I do it, that if it is not the most delicate in nature, 'tis
               the fault of his own imagination—against which this is not my first complaint.</p>
            <p>Now when we were got to bed, whether it was the novelty of the situation, or what it
               was, I know not; but so it was, I could not shut my eyes; I tried this side and that,
               and turn'd and turn'd again, till a full hour after midnight; when Nature and
               patience both wearing out—O my God! said I—</p>
            <p>—You have broke the treaty, Monsieur, said the lady, who had no <pb n="207"
                  facs="tcp:1269300202:217"/> more slept than myself.—I begg'd a thousand
               pardons—but insisted it was no more than en ejaculation—she main>tain'd 'twas an
               entire infraction of the treaty—I maintain'd it was pro>vided for in the clause of
               the third article.</p>
            <p>The lady would by no means give up her point, tho' she weakened her barrier by it;
               for in the warmth of the dispute, I could hear two or three corking pins fall out of
               the curtain to the ground.</p>
            <p>Upon my word and honour, Ma>dame, said I—stretching my arm out of bed, by way
               asseveration—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:1269300202:218"/> —(I was going to have added, that I would not
               have trespass'd against the remotest idea of decorum for the world)—</p>
            <p>—But the Fille de Chambre hearing there were words between us, and fear>ing that
               hostilities would ensue in course, had crept silently out of her clo>set, and it
               being totally dark, had stolen so close to our beds, that she had got herself into
               the narrow passage which separated them, and had advanc'd so far up as to be in a
               line betwixt her mistress and me—</p>
            <p>So that when I stretch'd out my hand, I caught hold of the Fille de Chambre's</p>

               the word "sentimental" in its eighteenth-century context of emotion in opposition to
               reason. With the development of the novel as a form of writing came the sub-genre of the sentimental novel, which sought to celebrate emotion as a means to moral truth, and to similarly generate emotion in its readers.</note>
