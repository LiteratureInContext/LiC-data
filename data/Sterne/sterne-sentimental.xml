<head>A SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY, &amp;c. &amp;c.</head>
<p>—THEY order, said I, this matter better in France—</p>
<p>—You have been in France? said my gentleman, turning quick upon me with the most civil triumph in the world.—Strange! quoth I, de|bating the matter with myself, That one and twenty miles sailing, for 'tis absolutely no further from Dover to Calais, should give a man these
<pb n="2" />
rights—I'll look into them: so giv|ing up the argument—I went straight to my lodgings, put up half a dozen shirts and a black pair of silk breeches—<q rend="inline">" the coat I have on, said I, look|ing at the sleeve, will do"</q>—took a place in the Dover stage; and the packet sailing at nine the next morn|ing—by three I had got sat down to my dinner upon a fricassee'd chicken so incontestably in France, that had I died that night of an indigestion, the whole world could not have sus|pended the effects of the <note n="*" place="foot">All the effects of strangers (Swiss and Scotch excepted) dying in France, are seized by virtue of this law, tho' the heir be upon the spot—the profit of these contingencies being farm'd, there is no redress.</note> <hi>Droits</hi>
<pb n="3"/>
<hi>d'aubaine</hi>—my shirts, and black pair of silk breeches—portmanteau and all must have gone to the King of France—even the little picture which I have so long worn, and so often have told thee, Eliza, I would carry with me into my grave, would have been torn from my neck.—Ungene|rous!—to seize upon the wreck of an unwary passenger, whom your sub|jects had beckon'd to their coast—by heaven! SIRE, it is not well done; and much does it grieve me, 'tis the monarch of a people so civilized and courteous, and so renown'd for sen|timent and fine feelings, that I have to reason with—</p>
<p>But I have scarce set foot in your dominions—</p>
</div>
<div type="section">

<head>CALAIS.</head>
<p>WHEN I had finish'd my din|ner, and drank the King of France's health, to satisfy my mind that I bore him no spleen, but, on the contrary, high honour for the huma|nity of his temper—I rose up an inch taller for the accommodation.</p>
<p>—No—said I—the Bourbon is by no means a cruel race: they may be misled like other people; but there is a mildness in their blood. As I ac|knowledged this, I felt a suffusion of a finer kind upon my cheek—more warm and friendly to man, than
<pb n="5"/>
what Burgundy (at least of two livres a bottle, which was such as I had been drinking) could have produced.</p>
<p>—Just God! said I, kicking my portmanteau aside, what is there in this world's goods which should sharpen our spirits, and make so many kind-hearted brethren of us, fall out so cruelly as we do by the way?</p>
<p>When man is at peace with man, how much lighter than a feather is the heaviest of metals in his hand! he pulls out his purse, and holding it airily and uncompress'd, looks round him, as if he sought for an object to share it with—In doing this, I felt
<pb n="6" />
every vessel in my frame dilate—the arteries beat all chearily together, and every power which sustained life, perform'd it with so little friction, that 'twould have confounded the most <hi>physical precieuse</hi> in France: with all her materialism, she could scarce have called me a machine—</p>
<p>I'm confident, said I to myself, I should have overset her creed.</p>
<p>The accession of that idea, carried nature, at that time, as high as she could go—I was at peace with the world before, and this finish'd the treaty with myself—</p>
<p><pb n="7" />
—Now, was I a King of France, cried I—what a moment for an or|phan to have begg'd his father's portmanteau of me!</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<pb n="8" />
<head>THE MONK.</head>
<head>CALAIS.</head>
<p>I HAD scarce utter'd the words, when a poor monk of the order of St. Francis came into the room to beg something for his convent. No man cares to have his virtues the sport of contingencies—or one man may be generous, as another man is puissant—<hi>sed non, quo ad hanc</hi>—or be it as it may—for there is no regular reasoning upon the ebbs and flows of our humours; they may depend upon the same causes, for ought I know, which influence the tides themselves—'twould oft be no dis|credit
<pb n="9" />
to us, to suppose it was so: I'm sure at least for myself, that in many a case I should be more highly satisfied, to have it said by the world, <q rend="inline">"I had had an affair with the moon, in which there was neither sin nor shame,"</q> than have it pass altogether as my own act and deed, wherein there was so much of both.</p>
<p>—But be this as it may. The moment I cast my eyes upon him, I was predetermined not to give him a single sous; and accordingly I put my purse into my pocket—button'd it up—set myself a little more upon my centre, and advanced up gravely to him: there was something, I fear, forbidding in my look: I have his
<pb n="10"/>
figure this moment before my eyes, and think there was that in it which deserved better.</p>
<p>The monk, as I judged from the break in his tonsure, a few scatter'd white hairs upon his temples, being all that remained of it, might be about seventy—but from his eyes, and that sort of fire which was in them, which seemed more temper'd by courtesy than years, could be no more than sixty—Truth might lie between—He was certainly sixty-five; and the general air of his counte|nance, notwithstanding something seem'd to have been planting wrinkles in it before their time, agreed to the account.</p>
<p><pb n="11"/>
It was one of those heads, which Guido has often painted—mild, pale—penetrating, free from all com|mon-place ideas of fat contented ig|norance looking downwards upon the earth—it look'd forwards; but look'd, as if it look'd at something beyond this world. How one of his order came by it, heaven above, who let it fall upon a monk's shoulders, best knows: but it would have suited a Bramin, and had I met it upon the plains of Indostan, I had reverenced it.</p>
<p>The rest of his outline may be given in a few strokes; one might put it into the hands of any one to design, for 'twas neither elegant or
<pb n="12" />
otherwise, but as character and ex|pression made it so: it was a thin, spare form, something above the common size, if it lost not the dis|tinction by a bend forwards in the figure—but it was the attitude of Intreaty; and as it now stands pre|sented to my imagination, it gain'd more than it lost by it.</p>
<p>When he had enter'd the room three paces, he stood still; and lay|ing his left hand upon his breast, (a slender white staff with which he journey'd being in his right)—when I had got close up to him, he intro|duced himself with the little story of the wants of his convent, and the poverty of his order—and did it with
<pb n="13" />
so simple a grace—and such an air of deprecation was there in the whole cast of his look and figure—I was be|witch'd not to have been struck with it—</p>
<p>—A better reason was, I had pre|determined not to give him a single sous.</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<pb n="14"/>
<head>THE MONK.</head>
<head>CALAIS.</head>
<p>—'TIS very true, said I, reply|ing to a cast upwards with his eyes, with which he had con|cluded his address—'tis very true—and heaven be their resource who have no other but the charity of the world, the stock of which, I fear, is no way sufficient for the many <hi>great claims</hi> which are hourly made upon it.</p>
<p>As I pronounced the words <hi>great claims,</hi> he gave a slight glance with his eye downwards upon the sleeve
<pb n="15" />
of his tunick—I felt the full force of the appeal—I acknowledge it, said I—a coarse habit, and that but once in three years, with meagre diet—are no great matters; and the true point of pity is, as they can be earn'd in the world with so little industry, that your order should wish to pro|cure them by pressing upon a fund which is the property of the lame, the blind, the aged and the infirm—the captive who lies down counting over and over again the days of his af|flictions, languishes also for his share of it; and had you been of the <hi>order of mercy,</hi> instead of the order of St. Francis, poor as I am, continued I, pointing at my portmanteau, full chearfully should it have been open'd
<pb n="16" />
to you, for the ransom of the unfor|tunate—The monk made me a bow—but of all others, resumed I, the unfortunate of our own country, surely, have the first rights; and I have left thousands in distress upon our own shore—The monk gave a cordial wave with his head—as much as to say, No doubt, there is misery enough in every corner of the world, as well as within our convent—But we distinguish, said I, laying my hand upon the sleeve of his tunick, in return for his appeal—we distin|guish, my good Father! betwixt those who wish only to eat the bread of their own labour—and those who eat the bread of other people's, and have no other plan in life, but to get
<pb n="17"/>
through it in sloth and ignorance, <hi>for the love of God.</hi></p>
<p>The poor Franciscan made no re|ply: a hectic of a moment pass'd across his cheek, but could not tarry—Nature seemed to have had done with her resentments in him; he shewed none—but letting his staff fall within his arm, he press'd both his hands with resignation upon his breast, and retired.</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<pb n="18" />
<head>THE MONK.</head>
<head>CALAIS.</head>
<p>MY heart smote me the moment he shut the door—Psha! said I with an air of carelessness, three several times—but it would not do: every ungracious syllable I had ut|ter'd, crouded back into my imagi|nation: I reflected, I had no right over the poor Franciscan, but to de|ny him; and that the punishment of that was enough to the disappointed without the addition of unkind lan|guage—I consider'd his grey hairs—his courteous figure seem'd to re|enter and gently ask me what injury he had done me?—and why I could
<pb n="19" />
use him thus—I would have given twenty livres for an advocate—I have behaved very ill; said I within myself; but I have only just set out upon my travels; and shall learn better manners as I get along.</p>

<head>THE DESOBLIGEANT.</head>
<head>CALAIS.</head>
<p>WHEN a man is discontented with himself, it has one ad|vantage however, that it puts him into an excellent frame of mind for making a bargain. Now there being no travelling through France and Italy without a chaise—and nature generally prompting us to the thing we are fittest for, I walk'd out into the coach yard to buy or hire some|thing of that kind to my purpose: an old <note n="*" place="foot">A chaise, so called in France, from its bolding but one person.</note> Desobligeant in the furthest corner of the court, hit my fancy at first sight, so I instantly got into it,
<pb n="21" />
and finding it in tolerable harmony with my feelings, I ordered the waiter to call Monsieur Dessein the master of the hôtel—but Monsieur Dessein being gone to vespers, and not caring to face the Franciscan whom I saw on the opposite side of the court, in conference with a lady just arrived, at the inn—I drew the taffeta curtain betwixt us, and being determined to write my journey, I took out my pen and ink, and wrote the preface to it in the <hi>Disobligeant.</hi></p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<pb n="22"/>
<head>PrefACE, IN THE DESOBLIGEANT.</head>
<p>IT must have been observed by many a peripatetic philosopher, That nature has set up by her own unquestionable authority certain boundaries and fences to circum|scribe the discontent of man: she has effected her purpose in the quietest and easiest manner by laying him under almost insuperable obligations to work out his ease, and to sustain his sufferings at home. It is there only that she has provided him with the most suitable objects to partake of his happiness, and bear a part of that burden which in all countries and ages, has ever been too heavy
<pb n="23" />
for one pair of shoulders. 'Tis true we are endued with an imperfect power of spreading our happiness sometimes beyond <hi>her</hi> limits, but 'tis so ordered, that from the want of languages, connections, and de|pendencies, and from the difference in education, customs and habits, we lie under so many impediments in communicating our sensations out of our own sphere, as often amount to a total impossibility.</p>
<p>It will always follow from hence, that the balance of sentimental com|merce is always against the expa|triated adventurer: he must buy what he has little occasion for at their own price—his conversation
<pb n="24" />
will seldom be taken in exchange for theirs without a large discount—and this, by the by, eternally driv|ing him into the hands of more equitable brokers for such conver|sation as he can find, it requires no great spirit of divination to guess at his party—</p>
<p>This brings me to my point; and naturally leads me (if the see-saw of this <hi>Desobligeant</hi> will but let me get on) into the efficient as well as the final causes of travelling—</p>
<p>Your idle people that leave their native country and go abroad for some reason or reasons which may be derived from one of these general causes— 
<list>
<pb n="25" />
<item>Infirmity of body,</item>
<item>Imbecility of mind, or </item>
<item>Inevitable necessity.</item>
</list> The first two include all those who travel by land or by water, la|bouring with pride, curiosity, vanity or spleen, subdivided and combined <hi>in infinitum.</hi></p>
<p>The third class includes the whole army of peregrine martyrs; more especially those travellers who set out upon their travels with the be|nefit of the clergy, either as delin|quents travelling under the direction of governors recommended by the magistrate—or young gentlemen transported by the cruelty of pa|rents and guardians, and travelling under the direction of governors re|commended
<pb n="24"/>

<p>There is a fourth class, but their number is so small that they would not deserve a distinction, was it not necessary in a work of this nature to observe the greatest precision and nicety, to avoid a confusion of cha|racter. And these men I speak of, are such as cross the seas and sojourn in a land of strangers with a view of saving money for various reasons and upon various pretences: but as they might also save themselves and others a great deal of unnecessary trouble by saving their money at home—and as their reasons for travelling are the least complex of any other species of emigrants, I shall di|stinguish

these gentlemen by the name of<list>
<item>Simple Travellers.</item>

<p>Thus the whole circle of travellers may be reduced to the following <hi>Heads.</hi><list>
<item>Idle Travellers,</item>
<item>Inquisitive Travellers,</item>
<item>Lying Travellers,</item>
<item>Proud Travellers,</item>
<item>Vain Travellers,</item>

 <list>
<item>The Sentimental Traveller</item>
</list>
 
 (meaning thereby myself) who have 
 travell'd, and of which I am now sitting down to give an 
 account—as much out of <hi>Necessity,</hi> 
 and the <hi>besoin de</hi> Voyager, as any one 
 in the class.</p>
<p>I am well aware, at the same time, as both my travels and observations will be altogether of a different cast from any of my fore-runners; that I might have insisted upon a whole nitch entirely to myself—but I should break in upon the confines of the <hi>Vain</hi> Traveller, in wishing to draw attention towards me, till I have some better grounds for it, than the mere <hi>Novelty of my Ve|hicle.</hi></p>
<p><pb n="29"/>
It is sufficient for my reader, if he has been a traveller himself, that with study and reflection hereupon he may be able to determine his own place and rank in the cata|logue—it will be one step towards knowing himself; as it is great odds, but he retains some tincture and resemblance, of what he imbibed or carried out, to the present hour.</p>
<p>The man who first transplanted the grape of Burgundy to the Cape of Good Hope (observe he was a Dutch man) never dreamt of drink|ing the same wine at the Cape, that the same grape produced upon the French mountains—he was too phlegmatic for that—but undoubt|edly
<pb n="30"/>
he expected to drink some sort of vinous liquor; but whether good, bad, or indifferent—he knew enough of this world to know, that it did not depend upon his choice, but that what is generally called <hi>chance</hi> was to decide his success: however, he hoped for the best; and in these hopes, by an intemperate confidence in the fortitude of his head, and the depth of his discretion, <hi>Mynheer</hi> might possibly overset both in his new vineyard; and by discovering his nakedness, become a laughing|stock to his people.</p>
<p>Even so it fares with the poor Traveller, sailing and posting through the politer kingdoms of the globe
<pb n="31"/>
in pursuit of knowledge and im|provements.</p>
<p>Knowledge and improvements are to be got by sailing and posting for that purpose; but whether use|ful knowledge and real improve|ments, is all a lottery—and even where the adventurer is successful, the acquired stock must be used with caution and sobriety to turn to any profit—but as the chances run prodigiously the other way both as to the acquisition and application, I am of opinion, That a man would act as wisely, if he could prevail upon himself, to live con|tented without foreign knowledge or foreign improvements, especially
<pb n="32"/>
if he lives in a country that has no absolute want of either—and indeed, much grief of heart has it oft and many a time cost me, when I have observed how many a foul step the inquisitive Traveller has measured to see sights and look into disco|veries; all which, as Sancho Panca said to Don Quixote, they might have seen dry-shod at home. It is an age so full of light, that there is scarce a country or corner of Eu|rope whose beams are not crossed and interchanged with others—Knowledge in most of its branches, and in most affairs, is like music in an Italian street, whereof those may partake, who pay nothing—But there is no nation under heaven
<pb n="33"/>
—and God is my record, (before whose tribunal I must one day come and give an account of this work)—that I do not speak it vauntingly—But there is no nation under heaven abounding with more variety of learn|ing—where the sciences may be more fitly woo'd, or more surely won than here—where art is encouraged, and will so soon rise high—where Nature (take her all together) has so little to answer for—and, to close all, where there is more wit and variety of cha|racter to feed the mind with—Where then, my dear countrymen, are you going—</p>
<p>—We are only looking at this chaise, said they—Your most obe|dient
<pb n="34"/>
servant, said I, skipping out of it, and pulling off my hat—We were wondering, said one of them, who, I found, was an <hi>inquisitive traveller</hi>—what could occasion its motion.——'Twas the agitation, said I coolly, of writing a preface—I never heard, said the other, who was a <hi>simple tra|veller,</hi> of a preface wrote in a <hi>Deso|bligeant.</hi>—It would have been better, said I, in a <hi>Vis a Vis.</hi></p>
<p>—<hi>As an English man does not travel to see English men,</hi> I retired to my room.</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<pb n="35"/>
<head>CALAIS.</head>
<p>I Perceived that something darken'd the passage more than myself, as I stepp'd along it to my room; it was effectually Mons. Dessein, the master of the hôtel, who had just re|turn'd from vespers, and, with his hat under his arm, was most com|plaisantly following me, to put me in mind of my wants. I had wrote my|self pretty well out of conceit with the <hi>Desobligeant;</hi> and Mons. Dessein speaking of it, with a shrug, as if it would no way suit me, it immediately struck my fancy that it belong'd to some <hi>innocent traveller,</hi> who, on his
<pb n="36"/>
return home, had left it to Mons. Dessein's honour to make the most of. Four months had elapsed since it had finish'd its career of Europe in the corner of Mons. Dessein's coach|yard; and having sallied out from thence but a vampt-up business at the first, though it had been twice taken to pieces on Mount Sennis, it had not profited much by its adven|tures—but by none so little as the standing so many months unpitied in the corner of Mons. Dessein's coach|yard. Much indeed was not to be said for it—but something might—and when a few words will rescue misery out of her distress, I hate the man who can be a churl of them.</p>
<p><pb n="37"/>
—Now was I the master of this hôtel, said I, laying the point of my fore-finger on Mons. Dessein's breast, I would inevitably make a point of getting rid of this unfortunate <hi>Deso|bligeant</hi>—itstands swinging reproaches at you every time you pass by it—</p>
<p><hi>Mon Dieu!</hi> said Mons. Dessein—I have no interest—Except the in|terest, said I, which men of a certain turn of mind take, Mons. Dessein, in their own sensations—I'm persuaded, to a man who feels for others as well as for himself, every rainy night, dis|guise it as you will, must cast a damp upon your spirits—You suffer, Mons. Dessein, as much as the machine—</p>
<p><pb n="38"/>
I have always observed, when there is as much <hi>sour</hi> as <hi>sweet</hi> in a compli|ment, that an Englishman is eternally at a loss within himself, whether to take it, or let it alone: a Frenchman never is: Mons. Dessein made me a bow.</p>
<p><hi>C'est bien vrai,</hi> said he—But in this case I should only exchange one dis|quietude for another, and with loss: figure to yourself, my dear Sir, that in giving you a chaise which would fall to pieces before you had got half way to Paris—figure to yourself how much I should suffer, in giving an ill impression of myself to a man of ho|nour, and lying at the mercy, as I must do, <hi>d'un homme d'esprit.</hi></p>
<p><pb n="39"/>
The dose was made up exactly after my own prescription; so I could not help taking it—and returning Mons. Dessein his bow, without more casuistry we walk'd together towards his Remise, to take a view of his magazine of chaises.</p>
</div>

<head>IN THE STREET.</head>
<head>CALAIS.</head>
<p>IT must needs be a hostile kind of a world, when the buyer (if it be but of a sorry post-chaise) can|not go forth with the seller there|of into the street to terminate the difference betwixt them, but he in|stantly falls into the same frame of mind and views his conventionist with the same sort of eye, as if he was going along with him to Hyde|park corner to fight a duel. For my own part, being but a poor sword's|man, and no way a match for Mon|sieur <hi>Dessein,</hi> I felt the rotation of
<pb n="41"/>
all the movements within me, to which the situation is incident—I looked at Monsieur <hi>Dessein</hi> through and through—ey'd him as he walked along in profile—then, <hi>en face</hi>—thought he look'd like a Jew—then a Turk—disliked his wig—cursed him by my gods—wished him at the devil—</p>
<p>—And is all this to be lighted up in the heart for a beggarly ac|count of three or four louisd'ors, which is the most I can be over|reach'd in?—Base passion! said I, turning myself about, as a man na|turally does upon a sudden reverse of sentiment—base, ungentle passion! thy hand is against every man, and
<pb n="42"/>
every man's hand against thee—heaven forbid! said she, raising her hand up to her forehead, for I had turned full in front upon the lady whom I had seen in conference with the monk—she had followed us unperceived—Heaven forbid indeed! said I, offering her my own—she had a black pair of silk gloves open only at the thumb and two fore|fingers, so accepted it without re|serve—and I led her up to the door of the Remise.</p>
<p>Monsieur <hi>Dessein</hi> had <hi>diabled</hi> the key above fifty times before he found out he had come with a wrong one in his hand: we were as impatient as himself to have it open'd; and so
<pb n="43"/>
attentive to the obstacle, that I con|tinued holding her hand almost with|out knowing it; so that Monsieur <hi>Dessein</hi> left us together with her hand in mine, and with our faces turned towards the door of the Remise, and said he would be back in five minutes.</p>
<p>Now a colloquy of five mi|nutes, in such a situation, is worth one of as many ages, with your faces turned towards the street: in the latter case, 'tis drawn from the objects and occurrences with|out—when your eyes are fixed upon a dead blank—you draw purely from yourselves. A silence of a single moment upon Monsieur <hi>Dessein</hi>'s
<pb n="44"/>
leaving us, had been fatal: to the situation—she had infallibly turned about—so I begun the conversation instantly.—</p>
<p>—But what were the temptations, (as I write not to apologize for the weaknesses of my heart in this tour,—but to give an account of them)—shall be described with the same simplicity, with which I felt them.</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<pb n="45"/>
<head>THE REMISE DOOR.</head>
<head>CALAIS.</head>
<p>WHEN I told the reader that I did not care to get out of the <hi>Desobligeant,</hi> because I saw the monk in close conference with a lady just arrived at the inn—I told him the truth; but I did not tell him the whole truth; for I was full as much restrained by the appearance and figure of the lady he was talking to. Suspicion crossed my brain, and said, he was telling her what had passed: something jarred upon it within me—I wished him at his convent.</p>
<p><pb n="46" />
When the heart flies out before the understanding, it saves the judg|ment a world of pains—I was cer|tain she was of a better order of beings—however, I thought no more of her, but went on and wrote my preface.</p>
<p>The impression returned, upon my encounter with her in the street; a guarded frankness with which she gave me her hand, shewed, I thought, her good education and her good sense; and as I led her on, I felt a pleasurable ductility about her, which spread a calmness over all my spirits—</p>
<p><pb n="47" />
—Good God! how a man might lead such a creature as this round the world with him!—</p>
<p>I had not yet seen her face—'twas not material; for the drawing was instantly set about, and long before we had got to the door of the Remise, <hi>Fancy</hi> had finished the whole head, and pleased herself as much with its fitting her goddess, as if she had dived into the TIBER for it—but thou art a seduced, and a se|ducing slut; and albeit thou cheatest us seven times a day with thy pic|tures and images, yet with so many charms dost thou do it, and thou deckest out thy pictures in the shapes of so many angels of light, 'tis a shame to break with thee.</p>
<p><pb n="48"/>
When we had got to the door of the Remise, she withdrew her hand from across her forehead, and let me see the original—it was a face of about six and twenty—of a clear transparent brown, simply set off without rouge or powder—it was not critically handsome, but there was that in it, which in the frame of mind I was in, which attached me much more to it—it was interesting; I fancied it wore the characters of a widow'd look, and in that state of its declension, which had passed the two first paroxysms of sorrow, and was quietly beginning to reconcile itself to its loss—but a thousand other distresses might have traced the same lines; I wish'd to know
<pb n="49"/>
what they had been—and was ready to enquire, (had the same <hi>bon ton</hi> of conversation permitted, as in the days of Esdras)—<q rend="inline">"<hi>What aileth thee? and why art thou disquieted? and why is thy understanding troubled?</hi>"</q>—In a word, I felt benevolence for her; and resolved some way or other to throw in my mite of courtesy—if not of service.</p>
<p>Such were my temptations—and in this disposition to give way to them, was I left alone with the lady with her hand in mine, and with our faces both turned closer to the door of the Remise than what was ab|solutely necessary.</p>
</div>
<div type="section">

<head>THE REMISE DOOR.</head>
<head>CALAIS.</head>
<p>THIS certainly, fair lady! said I, raising her hand up a little lightly as I began, must be one of Fortune's whimsical doings: to take two utter strangers by their hands—of different sexes, and per|haps from different corners of the globe, and in one moment place them together in such a cordial situ|ation, as Friendship herself could scarce have atchieved for them, had she projected it for a month—</p>
<p><pb n="51"/>
—And your reflection upon it, shews how much, Monsieur, she has embarassed you by the adventure.—</p>
<p>When the situation is, what we would wish, nothing is so ill-timed as to hint at the circumstances which make it so: you thank Fortune, con|tinued she—you had reason—the heart knew it, and was satisfied; and who but an English philosopher would have sent notices of it to the brain to reverse the judgment?</p>
<p>In saying this, she disengaged her hand with a look which I thought a sufficient commentary upon the text.</p>
<p><pb n="52" />
It is a miserable picture which I am going to give of the weakness of my heart, by owning, that it suffered a pain, which worthier occasions could not have inflicted.—I was mortified with the loss of her hand, and the manner in which I had lost it carried neither oil nor wine to the wound: I never felt the pain of a sheepish inferiority so miserably in my life.</p>
<p>The triumphs of a true feminine heart are short upon these discomfi|tures. In a very few seconds she laid her hand upon the cuff of my coat, in order to finish her reply; so some way or other, God knows how, I regained my situation.</p>
<p><pb n="53" />
—She had nothing to add.</p>
<p>I forthwith began to model a dif|ferent conversation for the lady, thinking from the spirit as well as moral of this, that I had been mi|staken in her character; but upon turning her face towards me, the spirit which had animated the reply was fled—the muscles relaxed, and I beheld the same unprotected look of distress which first won me to her interest—melancholy! to see such sprightliness the prey of sorrow.—I pitied her from my soul; and though it may seem ridiculous enough to a torpid heart,—I could have taken her into my arms, and cherished her,
<pb n="54"/>
though it was in the open street, without blushing.</p>
<p>The pulsations of the arteries along my fingers pressing across hers, told her what was passing within me: she looked down—a silence of some mo|ments followed.</p>
<p>I fear, in this interval, I must have made some slight efforts to|wards a closer compression of her hand, from a subtle sensation I felt in the palm of my own—not as if she was going to withdraw hers—but, as if she thought about it—and I had infallibly lost it a second time, had not instinct more than rea|son directed me to the last resource
<pb n="55"/>
in these dangers—to hold it loosely, and in a manner as if I was every moment going to release it, of my|self; so she let it continue, till Mon|sieur <hi>Dessein</hi> returned with the key; and in the mean time I set myself to consider how I should undo the ill impressions which the poor monk's story, in case he had told it her, must have planted in her breast against me.</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<pb n="56" />
<head>THE SNUFF-BOX.</head>
<head>CALAIS.</head>
<p>THE good old monk was within six paces of us, as the idea of him cross'd my mind; and was ad|vancing towards us a little out of the line, as if uncertain whether he should break in upon us or no.—He stopp'd, however, as soon as he came up to us, with a world of frankness; and having a horn snuff-box in his hand, he presented it open to me—You shall taste mine—said I, pulling out my box (which was a small tortoise one) and putting it into his hand—
<pb n="57" />
'Tis most excellent, said the monk; Then do me the favour, I replied, to accept of the box and all, and when you take a pinch out of it, sometimes recollect it was the peace-offering of a man who once used you unkindly, but not from his heart.</p>
<p>The poor monk blush'd as red as scarlet. <hi>Mon Dieu!</hi> said he, press|ing his hands together—you never used me unkindly.—I should think, said the lady, he is not likely. I blush'd in my turn; but from what movements, I leave to the few who feel to analyse—Excuse me, Madame, replied I—I treated him most un|kindly; and from no provocations—'Tis impossible, said the lady.—My
<pb n="58"/>
God! cried the monk, with a warmth of asseveration which seemed not to belong to him—the fault was in me, and in the indiscretion of my zeal—the lady opposed it, and I joined with her in maintaining it was impossible, that a spirit so regulated as his, could give offence to any.</p>
<p>I knew not that contention could be rendered so sweet and pleasurable a thing to the nerves as I then felt it.—We remained silent, without any sensation of that foolish pain which takes place, when in such a circle you look for ten minutes in one another's faces without saying a word. Whilst this lasted, the monk rubb'd his horn box upon the sleeve of his tunick;
<pb n="59"/>
and as soon as it had acquired a little air of brightness by the friction—he made a low bow, and said, 'twas too late to say whether it was the weak|ness or goodness of our tempers which had involved us in this contest—but be it as it would—he begg'd we might exchange boxes—In say|ing this, he presented his to me with one hand, as he took mine from me in the other; and having kiss'd it—with a stream of good nature in his eyes he put it into his bosom—and took his leave.</p>
<p>I guard this box, as I would the instrumental parts of my religion, to help my mind on to something bet|ter: in truth, I seldom go abroad
<pb n="60" />
without it; and oft and many a time have I called up by it the courteous spirit of its owner to regulate my own, in the justlings of the world; they had found full employment for his, as I learnt from his story, till about the forty-fifth year of his age, when upon some military services ill re|quited, and meeting at the same time with a disappointment in the ten|derest of passions, he abandon'd the sword and the sex together, and took sanctuary, not so much in his con|vent as in himself.</p>
<p>I feel a damp upon my spirits, as I am going to add, that in my last return through Calais, upon inquir|ing after Father Lorenzo, I heard
<pb n="61"/>
he had been dead near three months, and was buried, not in his convent, but, according to his desire, in a little cimetiery belonging to it, about two leagues off: I had a strong desire to see where they had laid him—when, upon pulling out his little horn box, as I sat by his grave, and plucking up a nettle or two at the head of it, which had no business to grow there, they all struck together so forcibly upon my affections, that I burst into a flood of tears—but I am as weak as a woman; and I beg the world not to smile, but pity me.</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<pb n="62" />
<head>THE REMISE DOOR.</head>
<head>CALAIS.</head>
<p>I HAD never quitted the lady's hand all this time; and had held it so long, that it would have been indecent to have let it go, without first pressing it to my lips: the blood and spirits, which had suffer'd a re|vulsion from her, crouded back to her, as I did it.</p>
<p>Now the two travellers who had spoke to me in the coach-yard, hap|pening at that crisis to be passing by, and observing our communications, naturally took it into their heads that
<pb n="63"/>
we must be <hi>man and wife</hi> at least; so stopping as soon as they came up to the door of the Remise, the one of them, who was the inquisitive tra|veller, ask'd us, if we set out for Paris the next morning?—I could only answer for myself, I said; and the lady added, she was for Amiens.—We dined there yesterday, said the simple traveller—You go directly through the town, added the other, in your road to Paris. I was going to return a thousand thanks for the intelligence, <hi>that Amiens was in the road to Paris;</hi> but, upon pulling out my poor monk's little horn box to take a pinch of snuff—I made them a quiet bow, and wishing them a
<pb n="64"/>
good passage to Dover—they left us alone—</p>
<p>—Now where would be the harm, said I to myself, if I was to beg of this distressed lady to accept of half of my chaise?—and what mighty mischief could ensue?</p>
<p>Every dirty passion, and bad pro|pensity in my nature, took the alarm, as I stated the proposition—It will oblige you to have a third horse, said AVARICE, which will put twenty livres out of your pocket.—You know not who she is, said CAUTION—or what scrapes the affair may draw you into, whisper'd COWARDICE—</p>
<p><pb n="65"/>
Depend upon it, Yorick! said DISCRETION, 'twill be said you went off with a mistress, and came by as|signation to Calais for that purpose—</p>
<p>—You can never after, cried HY|POCRISY aloud, shew your face in the world—or rise, quoth MEANNESS, in the church—or be any thing in it, said PRIDE, but a lousy prebendary.</p>
<p>—But 'tis a civil thing, said I—and as I generally act from the first impulse, and therefore seldom listen to these cabals, which serve no pur|pose, that I know of, but to encom|pass the heart with adamant—I turn'd instantly about to the lady—</p>
<p><pb n="66"/>
—But she had glided off unper|ceived, as the cause was pleading, and had made ten or a dozen paces down the street, by the time I had made the determination; so I set off after her with a long stride, to make her the proposal with the best address I was master of; but observ|ing she walk'd with her cheek half resting upon the palm of her hand—with the slow, short-measur'd step of thoughtfulness, and with her eyes, as she went step by step, fix'd upon the ground, it struck me, she was trying the same cause herself.—God help her! said I, she has some mother-in-law, or tartufish aunt, or nonsensical old woman, to consult upon the oc|casion, as well as myself: so not car|ing
<pb n="67" />
to interrupt the processe, and deeming it more gallant to take her at discretion than by surprize, I faced about, and took a short turn or two before the door of the Remise, whilst she walk'd musing on one side.</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<pb n="68" />
<head>IN THE STREET.</head>
<head>CALAIS.</head>
<p>HAVING, on first sight of the lady, settled the affair in my fancy, <q rend="inline, marginal quotes">"that she was of the better order of beings"</q>—and then laid it down as a second axiom, as indisput|able as the first, That she was a wi|dow, and wore a character of dis|tress—I went no further; I got ground enough for the situation which pleased me—and had she remained close be|side my elbow till midnight, I should have held true to my system, and considered her only under that gene|ral idea.</p>
<p><pb n="69" />
She had scarce got twenty paces distant from me, ere something within me called out for a more particular inquiry—it brought on the idea of a further separation—I might possibly never see her more—the heart is for saving what it can; and I wanted the traces thro' which my wishes might find their way to her, in case I should never rejoin her myself: in a word, I wish'd to know her name—her fa|mily's—her condition; and as I knew the place to which she was going, I wanted to know from whence she came: but there was no coming at all this intelligence: a hundred little delicacies stood in the way. I form'd a score different plans—There was
<pb n="70" />
no such thing as a man's asking her directly—the thing was impossible.</p>
<p>A little French <hi>debonaire</hi> captain, who came dancing down the street, shewed me, it was the easiest thing in the world; for popping in betwixt us, just as the lady was returning back to the door of the Remise, he intro|duced himself to my acquaintance, and before he had well got announ|ced, begg'd I would do him the ho|nour to present him to the lady—I had not been presented myself—so turning about to her, he did it just as well by asking her, if she had come from Paris?—No: she was going that rout, she said.—<hi>Vous n'etez pas de Londre?</hi>—She was not, she replied.</p>
<p><pb n="71" />
—Then Madame must have come thro' Flanders.—<hi>Apparamment vous etez Flammande?</hi> said the French cap|tain.—The lady answered, she was.—<hi>Peutetre, de Lisle?</hi> added he—She said, she was not of Lisle.—Nor Ar|ras?—nor Cambray?—nor Ghent?—nor Brussels? She answered, she was of Brussels.</p>
<p>He had had the honour, he said, to be at the bombardment of it last war—that it was finely situated, <hi>pour cela</hi>—and full of noblesse when the Imperialists were driven out by the French (the lady made a slight curtsy)—so giving her an account of the af|fair, and of the share he had had in
<pb n="72"/>
it—he begg'd the honour to know her name—so made his bow.</p>
<p>—<hi>Et Madame a son Mari?</hi>—said he, looking back when he had made two steps—and without staying for an answer—danced down the street.</p>
<p>Had I served seven years appren|ticeship to good breeding, I could not have done as much.</p>

<head>CALAIS.</head>
<p>AS the little French captain left us, Mons. Dessein came up with the key of the Remise in his hand, and forthwith let us into his magazine of chaises.</p>
<p>The first object which caught my eye, as Mons. Dessein open'd the door of the Remise, was another old tatter'd <hi>Desobligeant:</hi> and notwith|standing it was the exact picture of that which had hit my fancy so much in the coach-yard but an hour before—the very sight of it stirr'd up a
<pb n="74"/>
disagreeable sensation within me now; and I thought 'twas a churlish beast into whose heart the idea could first enter, to construct such a machine; nor had I much more charity for the man who could think of using it.</p>
<p>I observed the lady was as little taken with it as myself: so Mons. Dessein led us on to a couple of chaises which stood abreast, telling us as he recommended them, that they had been purchased by my Lord A. and B. to go the <hi>grand tour,</hi> but had gone no further than Paris, so were in all respects as good as new—They were too good—so I pass'd on to a third, which stood behind, and forthwith began to chaffer for the
<pb n="75"/>
price—But 'twill scarce hold two, said I, opening the door and getting in—Have the goodness, Madam, said Mons. Dessein, offering his arm, to step in—The lady hesitated half a se|cond, and stepp'd in; and the waiter that moment beckoning to speak to Mons. Dessein, he shut the door of the chaise upon us, and left us.</p>

<p><hi>C'EST bien comique,</hi> 'tis very droll, said the lady smiling, from the reflection that this was the se|cond time we had been left to|gether by a parcel of nonsensical contingencies—<hi>c'est bien comique,</hi> said she—</p>
<p>—There wants nothing, said I, to make it so, but the comick use which the gallantry of a French|man would put it to—to make love the first moment, and an offer of his person the second.</p>
<p><pb n="77"/>
'Tis their <hi>fort:</hi> replied the lady.</p>
<p>It is supposed so at least—and how it has come to pass, continued I, I know not; but they have certainly got the credit of understanding more of love, and making it better than any other nation upon earth: but for my own part I think them errant bunglers, and in truth the worst set of marksmen that ever tried Cupid's patience.</p>
<p>—To think of making love by <hi>sentiments!</hi></p>
<p>I should as soon think of making a genteel suit of cloaths out of rem|nants:—and to do it—pop—at first sight by declaration—is submitting
<pb n="78"/>
the offer and themselves with it, to be sifted, with all their <hi>pours</hi> and <hi>contres,</hi> by an unheated mind.</p>
<p>The lady attended as if she ex|pected I should go on.</p>
<p>Consider then, madam, continued I, laying my hand upon hers—</p>
<p>That grave people hate Love for the name's sake—</p>
<p>That selfish people hate it for their own—</p>
<p>Hypocrites for heaven's—</p>
<p>And that all of us both old and young, being ten times worse
<pb n="79"/>
frighten'd than hurt by the very <hi>report</hi>—What a want of knowledge in this branch of commerce a man betrays, whoever lets the word come out of his lips, till an hour or two at least after the time, that his silence upon it becomes tormenting. A course of small, quiet attentions, not so pointed as to alarm—nor so vague as to be misunderstood,—with now and then a look of kindness, and little or nothing said upon it—leaves Nature for your mistress, and she fashions it to her mind.—</p>
<p>Then I solemnly declare, said the lady, blushing—you have been mak|ing love to me all this while.</p>

<head>THE REMISE.</head>
<head>CALAIS.</head>
<p>MONSIEUR <hi>Dessein</hi> came back to let us out of the chaise, and acquaint the lady, the Count de L-- her brother was just arrived at the hotel. Though I had infinite good will for the lady, I cannot say, that I rejoiced in my heart at the event—and could not help telling her so—for it is fatal to a proposal, Madam, said I, that I was going to make you—</p>
<p>—You need not tell me what the proposal was, said she, laying her
<pb n="81"/>
hand upon both mine, as she inter|rupted me.—A man, my good Sir, has seldom an offer of kindness to make-to a woman, but she has a presentiment of it some moments before—</p>
<p>Nature arms her with it, said I, for immediate preservation—But I think, said she, looking in my face, I had no evil to apprehend—and to deal frankly with you, had deter|mined to accept it.—If I had—(she stopped a moment)—I believe your good will would have drawn a story from me, which would have made pity the only dangerous thing in the journey.</p>
<p><pb n="82"/>
In saying this, she suffered me to kiss her hand twice, and with a look of sensibility mixed with a concern she got out of the chaise—and bid adieu.</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<pb n="83"/>
<head>IN THE STREET.</head>
<head>CALAIS.</head>
<p>I NEVER finished a twelve-guinea bargain so expeditiously in my life: my time seemed heavy upon the loss of the lady, and knowing every moment of it would be as two, till I put myself into motion—I ordered post horses directly, and walked towards the hotel.</p>
<p>Lord! said I, hearing the town clock strike four, and recollecting that I had been little more than a single hour in Calais—</p>
<p><pb n="84"/>
—What a large volume of ad|ventures may be grasped within this little span of life by him who in|terests his heart in every thing, and who, having eyes to see, what time and chance are perpetually holding out to him as he journeyeth on his way, misses nothing he can <hi>fairly</hi> lay his hands on.—</p>
<p>—If this won't turn out something—another will—no matter—'tis an assay upon human nature—I get my labour for my pains—'tis enough—the pleasure of the experiment has kept my senses, and the best part of my blood awake, and laid the gross to sleep.</p>
<p><pb n="85"/>
I pity the man who can travel from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beersheba,</hi> and cry, 'Tis all barren—and so it is; and so is all the world to him who will not culti|vate the fruits it offers. I declare, said I, clapping my hands chearily together, that was I in a desart, I would find out wherewith in it to call forth my affections—If I could not do better, I would fasten them upon some sweet myrtle, or seek some me|lancholy cypress to connect myself to—I would court their shade, and greet them kindly for their protec|tion—I would cut my name upon them, and swear they were the love|liest trees throughout the desert: if their leaves wither'd, I would teach
<pb n="84" />

myself to mourn, and when they re|joiced, I would rejoice along with them.</p>
<p>The learned SMELFUNGUS travel|led from Boulogne to Paris—from Paris to Rome—and so on—but he set out with the spleen and jaundice, and every object he pafs'd by was discoloured or distorted—He wrote an account of them, but'twas nothing but the account of his miserable feel|ings.</p>
<p>I met Smelfungus in the grand portico of the Pantheon—he was just coming out of it—<hi>'Tis nothing but a huge cock-pit</hi><note n="*" place="foot">Vide S--'s Travels.</note>, said he—I wish you had said nothing worse of the Venus
<pb n="87"/>
of Medicis, replied I—for in passing through Florence, I had heard he had fallen foul upon the goddess, and used her worse than a common strumpet, without the least provo|cation in nature.</p>
<p>I popp'd upon Smelfungus again at Turin, in his return home; and a sad tale of sorrowful adventures had he to tell,<q rend="inline, marginal quotes">"wherein he spoke of moving accidents by flood and field, and of the cannibals which each other eat: the Anthropophagi"</q>—he had been flea'd alive, and bedevil'd, and used worse than St. Bartholo|mew, at every stage he had come at—</p>
<p><pb n="88"/>
—I'll tell it, cried Smelfungus, to the world. You had better tell it, said I, to your physician.</p>
<p>Mundungus, with an immense for|tune, made the whole tour; going on from Rome to Naples—from Naples to Venice—from Venice to Vienna—to Dresden, to Berlin, with|out one generous connection or pleasur|able anecdote to tell of; but he had travell'd straight on looking neither to his right hand or his left, lest Love or Pity should seduce him out of his road.</p>
<p>Peace be to them! if it is to be found; but heaven itself, was it pos|sible to get there with such tempers,
<pb n="89"/>
would want objects to give it—every gentle spirit would come flying upon the wings of Love to hail their ar|rival—Nothing would the souls of Smelfungus and Mundungus hear of, but fresh anthems of joy, fresh rap|tures of love, and fresh congratula|tions of their common felicity—I heartily pity them: they have brought up no faculties for this work; and was the happiest mansion in heaven to be allotted to Smelfungus and Mundungus, they would be so far from being happy, that the souls of Smelfungus and Mundungus would do penance there to all eternity.</p>

<head>MONTRIUL.</head>
<p>I HAD once lost my portmanteau from behind my chaise, and twice got out in the rain, and one of the times up to the knees in dirt, to help the postilion to tie it on, without be|ing able to find out what was want|ing—Nor was it till I got to Mon|triul, upon the landlord's asking me if I wanted not a servant, that it oc|curred to me, that that was the very thing.</p>
<p>A servant! That I do most sadly, quoth I—Because, Monsieur, said the landlord, there is a clever young fel|low,
<pb n="91"/>
who would be very proud of the honour to serve an Englishman—But why an English one, more than any other?—They are so generous, said the landlord—I'll be shot if this is not a livre out of my pocket, quoth I to myself, this very night—But they have wherewithal to be so, Monsieur, added he—Set down one livre more for that, quoth I—It was but last night, said the landlord, <hi>qu'un my Lord Anglois presentoit un ecu a la fille de chambre</hi>—<hi>Tant pis, pour Madlle Janatone,</hi> said I.</p>
<p>Now Janatone being the land|lord's daughter, and the landlord supposing I was young in French, took the liberty to inform me, I should
<pb n="92"/>
not have said <hi>tant pis</hi>—but, <hi>tant mieux. Tant mieux, toujours, Monsieur,</hi> said he, when there is any thing to be got—<hi>tant pis,</hi> when there is nothing. It comes to the same thing, said I. <hi>Pardonnez moi,</hi> said the landlord.</p>
<p>I cannot take a fitter opportunity to observe once for all, that <hi>tant pis</hi> and <hi>tant mieux</hi> being two of the great hinges in French conversation, a stran|ger would do well to set himself right in the use of them, before he gets to Paris.</p>
<p>A prompt French Marquis at our ambassador's table demanded of Mr. H--, if he was H-- the poet?
<pb n="93" />
No, said H-- mildly—<hi>Tant pis,</hi> replied the Marquis.</p>
<p>It is H-- the historian, said an|other—<hi>Tant mieux,</hi> said the Marquis. And Mr. H--, who is a man of an excellent heart, return'd thanks for both.</p>
<p>When the landlord had set me right in this matter, he called in La Fleur, which was the name of the young man he had spoke of—saying only first, That as for his talents, he would presume to say nothing—Mon|sieur was the best judge what would suit him; but for the fidelity of La Fleur, he would stand responsible in all he was worth.</p>
<p><pb n="94"/>
The landlord deliver'd this in a manner which instantly set my mind to the business I was upon—and La Fleur, who stood waiting without, in that breathless expectation which every son of nature of us have felt in our turns, came in.</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<pb n="95"/>
<head>MONTRIUL.</head>
<p>I AM apt to be taken with all kinds of people at first sight; but never more so, than when a poor devil comes to offer his service to so poor a devil as myself; and as I know this weakness, I always suffer my judg|ment to draw back something on that very account—and this more or less, according to the mood I am in, and the case—and I may add the gender too, of the person I am to govern.</p>
<p>When La Fleur enter'd the room, after every discount I could make for my soul, the genuine look and air of

the fellow determined the matter at once in his favour; so I hired him first—and then began to inquire what he could do: But I shall find out his talents, quoth I, as I want them—besides, a Frenchman can do every thing.</p>
<p>Now poor La Fleur could do no|thing in the world but beat a drum, and play a march or two upon the fife. I was determined to make his talents do; and can't say my weak|ness was ever so insulted by my wis|dom, as in the attempt.</p>
<p>La Fleur had set out early in life, as gallantly as most Frenchmen do, with <hi>serving</hi> for a few years; at the end
<pb n="97"/>
of which, having satisfied the senti|ment, and found moreover, That the honour of beating a drum was likely to be its own reward, as it open'd no further track of glory to him—he retired <hi>a ses terres,</hi> and lived <hi>comme il plaisoit a Dieu</hi>—that is to say, upon nothing.</p>
<p>—And so, quoth <hi>Wisdome,</hi> you have hired a drummer to attend you in this tour of your's thro' France and Italy! Psha! said I, and do not one half of our gentry go with a hum-drum <hi>compagnon du voiage</hi> the same round, and have the piper and the devil and all to pay besides? When man can extricate himself with
<pb n="98" />
an <hi>equivoque</hi> in such an unequal match—he is not ill of—But you can do something else, La Fleur? said I—<hi>O qu'oui!</hi>—he could make spat|terdashes, and play a little upon the fiddle—Bravo! said Wisdome—Why, I play a bass myself, said I—we shall do very well.—You can shave, and dress a wig a little, La Fleur?—He had all the dispositions in the world—It is enough for heaven! said I, in|terrupting him—and ought to be enough for me—So supper coming in, and having a frisky English spa|niel on one side of my chair, and a French valet, with as much hilarity in his countenance as ever nature painted in one, on the other—I was
<pb n="99" />
satisfied to my heart's content with my empire; and if monarchs knew what they would be at, they might be as satisfied as I was.</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<pb n="100"/>
<head>MONTRIUL.</head>
<p>AS La Fleur went the whole tour of France and Italy with me, and will be often upon the stage, I must interest the reader a little fur|ther in his behalf, by saying, that I had never less reason to repent of the impulses which generally do deter|mine me, than in regard to this fel|low—he was a faithful, affectionate, simple soul as ever trudged after the heels of a philosopher; and notwith|standing his talents of drum-beating and spatterdash-making, which, tho' very good in themselves, happen'd to be of no great service to me, yet
<pb n="101" />
was I hourly recompenced by the festivity of his temper—it supplied all defects—I had a constant resource in his looks in all difficulties and dis|tresses of my own—I was going to have added, of his too; but La Fleur was out of the reach of every thing; for whether 'twas hunger or thirst; or cold or nakedness, or watchings, or whatever stripes of ill luck La Fleur met with in our journeyings, there was no index in his physiognomy to point them out by—he was eter|nally the same; so that if I am a piece of a philosopher, which Satan now and then puts it into my head I am—it always mortifies the pride of the conceit, by reflecting how much I owe to the complexional philosophy
<pb n="102" />
of this poor fellow, for shaming me into one of a better kind. With all this, La Fleur had a small cast of the coxcomb—but he seemed at first sight to be more a coxcomb of nature than of art; and before I had been three days in Paris with him—he seemed to be no coxcomb at all.</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<pb n="103"/>
<head>MONTRIUL.</head>
<p>THE next morning La Fleur entering upon his employ|ment, I delivered to him the key of my portmanteau with an inventory of my half a dozen shirts and silk pair of breeches; and bid him fasten all upon the chaise—get the horses put to—and desire the landlord to come in with his bill.</p>
<p><hi>C'est un garçon de bonne fortune,</hi> said the landlord, pointing through the window to half a dozen wenches who had got round about La Fleur, and were most kindly taking their leave of him, as the postilion was leading out the horses. La Fleur kissed all their hands round and
<pb n="104"/>
round again, and thrice he wiped his eyes, and thrice he promised he would bring them all pardons from Rome.</p>
<p>The young fellow, said the land|lord, is beloved by all the town, and there is scarce a corner in Montriul where the want of him will not be felt: he has but one misfortune in the world, continued he, <q rend="inline, marginal quotes">"He is always in love."</q>—I am heartily glad of it, said I,—'twill save me the trouble every night of putting my breeches under my head. In saying this, I was making not so much La Fleur's eloge, as my own, having been in love with one princess or another almost all my life, and I
<pb n="105"/>
hope I shall go on so, till I die, being firmly persuaded, that if ever I do a mean action, it must be in some interval betwixt one passion and another: whilst this interregnum lasts, I always perceive my heart locked up—I can scarce find in it, to give Misery a sixpence; and there|fore I always get out of it as fast as I can, and the moment I am re|kindled, I am all generosity and good will again; and would do any thing in the world either for, or with any one, if they will but satisfy me there is no sin in it.</p>
<p>—But in saying this—surely I am commending the passion—not my|self.</p>

<div type="section">

<head>A FRAGMENT.</head>
<p>—THE town of Abdera, notwithstanding Democritus lived there trying all the powers of irony and laughter to reclaim it, was the vilest and most profligate town in all Thrace. What for poisons, conspi|racies and assassinations—libels, pas|quinades and tumults, there was no going there by day—'twas worse by night.</p>
<p>Now, when things were at the worst, it came to pass, that the An|dromeda of Euripides being repre|sented at Abdera, the whole orchestra was delighted with it: but of all the
<pb n="107" />
passages which delighted them, no|thing operated more upon their ima|ginations, than the tender strokes of nature which the poet had wrought up in that pathetic speech of Perseus,<q><hi>O Cupid, prince of God and men,</hi> &amp;c.</q> Every man almost spoke pure iam|bics the next day, and talk'd of no|thing but Perseus his pathetic ad|dress—<q rend="inline, marginal quotes">"O Cupid! prince of God and men"</q>—in every street of Ab|dera, in every house—<q rend="inline, marginal quotes">"O Cupid! Cupid!"</q>—in every mouth, like the natural notes of some sweet melody which drops from it whether it will or no—nothing but <q rend="inline, marginal quotes">"Cupid! Cupid! prince of God and men"</q>—The fire caught—and the whole city, like
<pb n="108" />
the heart of one man, open'd itself to Love.</p>
<p>No pharmacopolist could sell one grain of helebore—not a single ar|mourer had a heart to forge one in|strument of death—Friendship and Virtue met together, and kiss'd each other in the street—the golden age return'd, and hung o'er the town of Abdera—every Abderite took his oaten pipe, and every Abderitish woman left her purple web, and chastly sat her down and listen'd to the song—</p>
<p>'Twas only in the power, says the Fragment, of the God whose empire
<pb n="109" />
extendeth from heaven to earth, and even to the depths of the sea, to have done this.</p>

<div type="section">

<head>MONTRIUL.</head>
<p>WHEN all is ready, and every article is disputed and paid for in the inn, unless you are a little sour'd by the adventure, there is al|ways a matter to compound at the door, before you can get into your chaise; and that is with the sons and daughters of poverty, who surround you. Let no man say, <q rend="inline, marginal quotes">"let them go to the devil"</q>—'tis a cruel jour|ney to send a few miserables, and they have had sufferings enow with|out it: I always think it better to take a few sous out in my hand; and I would counsel every gentle travel|ler
<pb n="111"/>
to do so likewise: he need not be so exact in setting down his motives for giving them—they will be re|gister'd elsewhere.</p>
<p>For my own part, there is no man gives so little as I do; for few that I know have so little to give: but as this was the first publick act of my charity in France, I took the more notice of it.</p>
<p>A well-a-way! said I. I have but eight sous in the world, shewing them in my hand, and there are eight poor men and eight poor women for 'em.</p>
<p>A poor tatter'd soul without a shirt on instantly withdrew his claim, by
<pb n="112"/>
retiring two steps out of the circle, and making a disqualifying bow on his part. Had the whole parterre cried out, <hi>Place aux dames,</hi> with one voice, it would not have conveyed the sentiment of a deference for the sex with half the effect.</p>
<p>Just heaven! for what wise reasons hast thou order'd it, that beggary and urbanity, which are at such variance in other countries, should find a way to be at unity in this?</p>
<p>—I insisted upon presenting him with a single sous, merely for his <hi>po|litesse.</hi></p>
<p><pb n="113"/>
A poor little dwarfish brisk fellow, who stood over-against me in the circle, putting something first under his arm, which had once been a hat, took his snuff-box out of his pocket, and generously offer'd a pinch on both sides of him: it was a gift of consequence, and modestly declined—The poor little fellow press'd it upon them with a nod of welcomeness—<hi>Prenez en</hi>—<hi>prenez,</hi> said he, look|ing another way; so they each took a pinch—Pity thy box should ever want one! said I to myself; so I put a couple of sous into it—taking a small pinch out of his box, to en|hance their value, as I did it—He felt the weight of the second obliga|tion more than that of the first—'twas
<pb n="114" />
doing him an honour—the other was only doing him a charity—and he made me a bow down to the ground for it.</p>
<p>—Here! said I to an old soldier with one hand, who had been cam|paign'd and worn out to death in the service—here's a couple of sous for thee—<hi>Vive le Roi!</hi> said the old sol|dier.</p>
<p>I had then but three sous left: so I gave one, simply <hi>pour l'amour de Dieu,</hi> which was the footing on which it was begg'd—The poor woman had a dislocated hip; so it could not be well, upon any other motive.</p>
<p><pb n="115" />
<hi>Mon cher et tres charitable Mon|sieur</hi>—There's no opposing this, said I.</p>
<p><hi>My Lord Anglois</hi>—the very sound was worth the money—so I gave <hi>my last sous for it.</hi> But in the eagerness of giving, I had overlook'd a <hi>pauvre honteux,</hi> who had no one to ask a sous for him, and who, I believed, would have perish'd, ere he could have ask'd one for himself: he stood by the chaise a little without the circle, and wiped a tear from a face which I thought had seen better days—Good God! said I—and I have not one single sous left to give him—But you have a thousand! cried all the powers of nature, stirring within me—so I gave him—no matter what—I am
<pb n="116"/>
ashamed to say <hi>how much,</hi> now—and was ashamed to think, how little, then: so if the reader can form any conjecture of my disposition, as these two fixed points are given him, he may judge within a livre or two what was the precise sum.</p>
<p>I could afford nothing for the rest, but, <hi>Dieu vous benisse</hi>—<hi>Et le bon Dieu vous benisse encore</hi>—said the old sol|dier, the dwarf, &amp;c. The <hi>pauvre honteux</hi> could say nothing—he pull'd out a little handkerchief, and wiped his face as he turned away—and I thought he thank'd me more than them all.</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<pb n="117" />
<head>THE BIDET.</head>
<p>HAVING settled all these little matters, I got into my post|chaise with more ease than ever I got into a post-chaise in my life; and La Fleur having got one large jack|boot on the far side of a little <hi>bidet</hi><note n="*" place="foot">Post horse.</note>, and another on this (for I count no|thing of his legs)—he canter'd away before me as happy and as perpen|dicular as a prince.—</p>
<p>—But what is happiness! what is grandeur in this painted scene of life! A dead ass, before we had got a league, put a sudden stop to La Fleur's career—his bidet would not
<pb n="118" />
pass by it—a contention arose betwixt them, and the poor fellow was kick'd out of his jack-boots the very first kick.</p>
<p>La Fleur bore his fall like a French christian, saying neither more or less upon it, than, Diable! so presently got up and came to the charge again astride his bidet, beat|ing him up to it as he would have beat his drum.</p>
<p>The bidet flew from one side of the road to the other, then back again—then this way—then that way, and in short every way but by the dead ass.—La Fleur insisted upon the thing—and the bidet threw him.</p>
<p><pb n="119"/>
What's the matter, La Fleur, said I, with this bidet of thine?—<hi>Mon|sieur,</hi> said he, <hi>c'est un cheval le plus opiniatré du monde</hi>—Nay, if he is a conceited beast, he must go his own way, replied I—so La Fleur got off him, and giving him a good sound lash, the bidet took me at my word, and away he scamper'd back to Montriul.—<hi>Peste!</hi> said La Fleur.</p>
<p>It is not <hi>mal a propos</hi> to take no|tice here, that tho' La Fleur availed himself but of two different terms of exclamation in this encounter—namely, <hi>Diable!</hi> and <hi>Peste!</hi> that there are nevertheless three, in the French language; like the positive, comparative, and superlative, one or
<pb n="120"/>
the other of which serve for every unexpected throw of the dice in life.</p>
<p><hi>Le Diable!</hi> which is the first, and positive degree, is generally used upon ordinary emotions of the mind, where small things only fall out contrary to your expectations—such as—the throwing once doublets—La Fleur's being kick'd off his horse, and so forth—cuckoldom, for the same reason, is always—<hi>Le Diable!</hi></p>
<p>But in cases where the cast has something provoking in it, as in that of the bidet's running away after, and leaving La Fleur aground in jack-boots—'tis the second degree.</p>
<p><pb n="121" />
'Tis then <hi>Peste!</hi></p>
<p>And for the third—</p>
<p>—But here my heart is wrung with pity and fellow-feeling, when I reflect what miseries must have been their lot, and how bitterly so refined a people must have smarted, to have forced them upon the use of it.—</p>
<p>Grant me, O ye powers which touch the tongue with eloquence in distress!—whatever is my <hi>cast,</hi> Grant me but decent words to exclaim in, and I will give my nature way.</p>
<p>—But as these were not to be had in France, I resolved to take every

evil just as it befell me without any exclamation at all.</p>
<p>La Fleur, who had made no such covenant with himself, followed the bidet with his eyes till it was got out of sight—and then, you may imagine, if you please, with what word he closed the whole affair.</p>
<p>As there was no hunting down a frighten'd horse in jack-boots, there remained no alternative but taking La Fleur either behind the chaise, or into it.—</p>
<p>I preferred the latter, and in half an hour we got to the post-house at Nampont.</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<pb n="123" />
<head>NAMPONT.</head>
<head>THE DEAD ASS.</head>
<p>—AND this, said he, putting the remains of a crust into his wallet—and this, should have been thy portion, said he, hadst thou been alive to have shared it with me. I thought by the accent, it had been an apostrophe to his child; but 'twas to his ass, and to the very ass we had seen dead in the road, which had occasioned La Fleur's misadventure. The man seemed to lament it much; and it instantly brought into my mind Sancho's la|mentation
<pb n="124" />
for his; but he did it with more true touches of nature.</p>
<p>The mourner was sitting upon a stone bench at the door, with the ass's pannel and its bridle on one side, which he took up from time to time—then laid them down—look'd at them and shook his head. He then took his crust of bread out of his wallet again, as if to eat it; held it some time in his hand—then laid it upon the bit of his ass's bridle—looked wistfully at the little arrange|ment he had made—and then gave a sigh.</p>
<p>The simplicity of his grief drew numbers about him, and La Fleur
<pb n="125"/>
amongst the rest, whilst the horses were getting ready; as I continued sitting in the post-chaise, I could see and hear over their heads.</p>
<p>—He said he had come last from Spain, where he had been from the furthest borders of Franconia; and had got so far on his return home, when his ass died. Every one seem'd desirous to know what business could have taken so old and poor a man so far a journey from his own home.</p>
<p>It had pleased heaven, he said, to bless him with three sons, the finest lads in all Germany; but having in one week lost two of the eldest of them by the small-pox, and the
<pb n="126"/>
youngest falling ill of the same di|stemper, he was afraid of being bereft of them all; and made a vow, if Heaven would not take him from him also, he would go in gratitude to St. Iago in Spain.</p>
<p>When the mourner got thus far on his story, he stopp'd to pay nature her tribute—and wept bitterly.</p>
<p>He said, Heaven had accepted the conditions; and that he had set out from his cottage with this poor crea|ture, who had been a patient partner of his journey—that it had eat the same bread with him all the way, and was unto him as a friend.</p>
<p><pb n="127"/>
Every body who stood about, heard the poor fellow with concern——La Fleur offered him money.—The mourner said, he did not want it—it was not the value of the ass—but the loss of him.—The ass, he said, he was assured loved him—and upon this told them a long story of a mischance upon their passage over the Pyrenean mountains which had separated them from each other three days; during which time the ass had sought him as much as he had sought the ass, and that they had neither scarce eat or drank till they met.</p>
<p>Thou hast one comfort, friend, said I, at least in the loss of thy poor beast; I'm sure thou hast been a mer|ciful
<pb n="128"/>
master to him.—Alas! said the mourner, I thought so, when he was alive—but now that he is dead I think otherwise.—I fear the weight of myself and my afflictions together have been too much for him—they have shortened the poor creature's days, and I fear I have them to answer for.—Shame on the world! said I to myself—Did we love each other, as this poor soul but loved his ass—'twould be something.—</p>

<head>NAMPONT.</head>
<head>THE POSTILLION.</head>
<p>THE concern which the poor fellow's story threw me into, required some attention: the po|stillion paid not the least to it, but set off upon the <hi>pavè</hi> in a full gallop.</p>
<p>The thirstiest soul in the most sandy desert of Arabia could not have wished more for a cup of cold water, than mine did for grave and quiet movements; and I should have had an high opinion of the postillion had he but stolen off with me in some|thing like a pensive pace.—On the
<pb n="130"/>
contrary, as the mourner finished his lamentation, the fellow gave an un|feeling lash to each of his beasts, and set off clattering like a thousand devils.</p>
<p>I called to him as loud as I could, for heaven's sake to go slower—and the louder I called the more unmer|cifully he galloped.—The deuce take him and his galloping too—said I—he'll go on tearing my nerves to pieces till he has worked me into a foolish passion, and then he'll go slow, that I may enjoy the sweets of it.</p>
<p>The postillion managed the point to a miracle: by the time he had got
<pb n="131"/>
to the foot of a steep hill about half a league from Nampont,—he had put me out of temper with him—and then with myself, for being so.</p>
<p>My case then required a different treatment; and a good rattling gallop would have been of real service to me.—</p>
<p>—Then, prithee get on—get on, my good lad, said I.</p>
<p>The postillion pointed to the hill—I then tried to return back to the story of the poor German and his ass—but I had broke the clue—and could no more get into it again, than the postillion could into a trot.—</p>
<p><pb n="132"/>
—The deuce go, said I, with it all! Here am I sitting as candidly disposed to make the best of the worst, as ever wight was, and all runs counter.</p>
<p>There is one sweet lenitive at least for evils, which nature holds out to us; so I took it kindly at her hands, and fell asleep; and the first word which roused me was <hi>Amiens.</hi></p>
<p>—Bless me! said I, rubbing my eyes—this is the very town where my poor lady is to come.</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<pb n="133"/>
<head>AMIENS.</head>
<p>THE words were scarce out of my mouth, when the Count de L***'s post-chaise, with his sister in it, drove hastily by: she had just time to make me a bow of re|cognition—and of that particular kind of it, which told me she had not yet done with me. She was as good as her look; for, before I had quite finished my supper, her bro|ther's servant came into the room with a billet, in which she said, she had taken the liberty to charge me with a letter, which I was to present myself to Madame R*** the first
<pb n="134"/>
morning I had nothing to do at Paris. There was only added, she was sorry, but from what <hi>penchant</hi> she had not considered, that she had been pre|vented telling me her story—that she still owed it me; and if my rout should ever lay through Brussels, and I had not by then forgot the name of Ma|dame de L***—that Madame de L*** would be glad to discharge her obligation.</p>
<p>Then I will meet thee, said I, fair spirit! at Brussels—'tis only return|ing from Italy through Germany to Holland, by the rout of Flanders, home—'twill scarce be ten posts out of my way; but were it ten thou|sand! with what a moral delight will
<pb n="135"/>
it crown my journey, in sharing in the sickening incidents of a tale of misery told to me by such a sufferer? to see her weep! and though I can|not dry up the fountain of her tears, what an exquisite sensation is there still left, in wiping them away from off the cheeks of the first and fairest of women, as I'm sitting with my handkerchief in my hand in silence the whole night besides her.</p>
<p>There was nothing wrong in the sentiment; and yet I instantly re|proached my heart with it in the bit|terest and most reprobate of expres|sions.</p>
<p><pb n="136" />
It had ever, as I told the reader, been one of the singular blessings of my life, to be almost every hour of it miserably in love with some one; and my last flame happening to be blown out by a whiff of jealousy on the sudden turn of a corner, I had lighted it up afresh at the pure taper of Eliza but about three months be|fore—swearing as I did it, that it should last me through the whole journey—Why should I dissemble the matter? I had sworn to her eternal fidelity—she had a right to my whole heart—to divide my affections was to lessen them—to expose them, was to risk them: where there is risk, there may be loss—and what wilt
<pb n="137"/>
thou have, Yorick! to answer to a heart so full of trust and confidence—so good, so gentle and unreproach|ing?</p>
<p>—I will not go to Brussels, replied I, interrupting myself—but my imagi|nation went on—I recall'd her looks at that crisis of our separation when neither of us had power to say Adieu! I look'd at the picture she had tied in a black ribband about my neck—and blush'd as I look'd at it—I would have given the world to have kiss'd it,—but was ashamed—And shall this tender flower, said I, pressing it be|tween my hands—shall it be smitten to its very root—and smitten, Yorick!
<pb n="138"/>
by thee, who hast promised to shelter it in thy breast?</p>
<p>Eternal fountain of happiness! said I, kneeling down upon the ground—be thou my witness—and every pure spirit which tastes it, be my witness also, That I would not travel to Brussels, unless Eliza went along with me, did the road lead me to|wards heaven.</p>
<p>In transports of this kind, the heart, in spite of the understanding, will always say too much.</p>

<head>THE LETTER.</head>
<head>AMIENS.</head>
<p>FORTUNE had not smiled upon La Fleur; for he had been unsuccessful in his feats of chivalry—and not one thing had offer'd to signalize his zeal for my service from the time he had enter'd into it, which was almost four and twenty hours. The poor soul burn'd with impa|tience; and the Count de L***'s servant's coming with the letter, be|ing the first practicable occasion which offered, La Fleur had laid hold of it; and in order to do honour to his
<pb n="140"/>
master, had taken him into a back parlour in the Auberge, and treated him with a cup or two of the best wine in Picardy; and the Count de L***'s servant in return, and not to be behind hand in politeness with La Fleur, had taken him back with him to the Count's hôtel. La Fleur's <hi>prevenancy</hi> (for there was a passport in his very looks) soon set every ser|vant in the kitchen at ease with him; and as a Frenchman, whatever be his talents, has no sort of prudery in shewing them, La Fleur, in less than five minutes, had pull'd out his fife, and leading off the dance himself with the first note, set the <hi>fille de chambre,</hi> the <hi>maitre d'hotel,</hi> the cook,
<pb n="141"/>
the scullion, and all the houshold, dogs and cats, besides an old monkey, a dancing: I suppose there never was a merrier kitchen since the flood.</p>
<p>Madame de L***, in passing from her brother's apartments to her own, hearing so much jollity below stairs, rung up her <hi>fille de chambre</hi> to ask about it; and hearing it was the English gentleman's servant who had set the whole house merry with his pipe, she order'd him up.</p>
<p>As the poor fellow could not pre|sent himself empty, he had loaden'd himself in going up stairs with a thou|sand compliments to Madame de L***, on the part of his master—
<pb n="140" />
added a long apocrypha of inquiries after Madame de L***'s health—told her, that Monsieur his master was <hi>au desespoire</hi> for her re-establish|ment from the fatigues of her jour|ney—and, to close all, that Mon|sieur had received the letter which Madame had done him the honour—And he has done me the ho|nour, said Madame de L***, inter|rupting La Fleur, to send a billet in return.</p>
<p>Madame de L*** had said this with such a tone of reliance upon the fact, that La Fleur had not power to disappoint her expectations—he trembled for my honour—and pos|sibly might not altogether be uncon|cerned
<pb n="143"/>
for his own, as a man capable of being attach'd to a master who could be a wanting <hi>en egards vis a vis d'une femme;</hi> so that when Ma|dame de L*** asked La Fleur if he had brought a letter—<hi>O qu'oui,</hi> said La Fleur: so laying down his hat upon the ground, and taking hold of the flap of his right side pocket with his left hand, he began to search for the letter with his right—then contrary-wise—<hi>Diable!</hi>—then sought every pocket—pocket by pocket, round, not forgetting his fob—<hi>Peste!</hi>—then La Fleur emptied them upon the floor—pulled out a dirty cravat—a handkerchief—a comb—a whip lash—a night-cap—then gave a peep
<pb n="144" />
into his hat—<hi>Quelle etourderie!</hi> He had left the letter upon the table in the Auberge—he would run for it, and be back with it in three minutes.</p>
<p>I had just finished my supper when La Fleur came in to give me an ac|count of his adventure: he told the whole story simply as it was; and only added, that if Monsieur had forgot <hi>(par hazard)</hi> to answer Ma|dame's letter, the arrangement gave him an opportunity to recover the <hi>faux pas</hi>—and if not, that things were only as they were.</p>
<p>Now I was not altogether sure of my <hi>etiquette,</hi> whether I ought to have wrote or no; but if I had—a devil
<pb n="145" />
himself could not have been angry 'twas but the officious zeal of a well|meaning creature for my honour; and however he might have mistook the road—or embarrassed me in so doing—his heart was in no fault—I was under no necessity to write—and what weighed more than all—he did not look as if he had done amiss.</p>
<p>—'Tis all very well, La Fleur, said I.—'Twas sufficient. La Fleur flew out of the room like lightening, and return'd with pen, ink, and paper, in his hand; and coming up to the table, laid them close before me, with such a delight in his coun|tenance, that I could not help taking up the pen.</p>
<p><pb n="146"/>
I begun and begun again; and though I had nothing to say, and that nothing might have been express'd in half a dozen lines, I made half a dozen different beginnings, and could no way please myself.</p>
<p>In short, I was in no mood to write.</p>
<p>La Fleur stepp'd out and brought a little water in a glass to dilute my ink—then fetch'd sand and seal-wax—It was all one: I wrote, and blot|ted, and tore off, and burnt, and wrote again—<hi>Le Diable l'emporte!</hi> said I half to myself—I cannot write this self-same letter; throwing the pen down despairingly as I said it.</p>
<p><pb n="147"/>
As soon as I had cast down the pen, La Fleur advanced with the most respectful carriage up to the table, and making a thousand apolo|gies for the liberty he was going to take, told me he had a letter in his pocket wrote by a drummer in his regiment to a corporal's wife, which, he durst say, would suit the occasion.</p>
<p>I had a mind to let the poor fellow have his humour—Then prithee, said I, let me see it.</p>
<p>La Fleur instantly pull'd out a little dirty pocket-book cramm'd full of small letters and billet-doux in a sad condition, and laying it upon the table, and then untying the string
<pb n="148" />
which held them all together, run them over one by one, till he came to the letter in question—<hi>La voila!</hi> said he, clapping his hands: so un|folding it first, he laid it before me, and retired three steps from the table whilst I read it.</p>

<div><p>It was but changing the Corporal into the Count—and saying nothing about mounting guard on Wednes|day—and the letter was neither right or wrong—so to gratify the poor fel|low, who stood trembling for my honour, his own, and the honour of his letter,—I took the cream gently off it, and whipping it up in my own way—I seal'd it up and sent him with it to Madame de L***—and the next morning we pursued our jour|ney to Paris.</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<pb n="152" />
<head>PARIS.</head>
<p>WHEN a man can contest the point by dint of equipage, and carry all on floundering before him with half a dozen lackies and a couple of cooks—'tis very well in such a place as Paris—he may drive in at which end of a street he will.</p>
<p>A poor prince who is weak in cavalry, and whose whole infantry does not exceed a single man, had best quit the field; and signalize himself in the cabinet, if he can get up into it—I say <hi>up into it</hi>—for there is no descending perpendicular amongst 'em with a <q rend="inline, marginal quotes">"<hi>Me voici!</hi>
<pb n="153" />
<hi>mes enfans</hi>"</q>—here I am—whatever many may think.</p>
<p>I own my first sensations, as soon as I was left solitary and alone in my own chamber in the hotel, were far from being so flattering as I had pre|figured them. I walked up gravely to the window in my dusty black coat, and looking through the glass saw all the world in yellow, blue, and green, running at the ring of pleasure.—The old with broken lances, and in helmets which had lost their vizards—the young in ar|mour bright which shone like gold, beplumed with each gay feather of the east—all—all tilting at it like
<pb n="154"/>
fascinated knights in tournaments of yore for fame and love.—</p>
<p>Alas, poor Yorick! cried I, what art thou doing here? On the very first onset of all this glittering clatter, thou art reduced to an atom—seek—seek some winding alley, with a tourniquet at the end of it, where chariot never rolled or flambeau shot its rays—there thou mayest solace thy soul in converse sweet with some kind <hi>grisset</hi> of a barber's wife, and get into such coteries!—</p>
<p>—May I perish! if I do, said I, pulling out the letter which I had to present to Madame de R***.—I'll
<pb n="155"/>
wait upon this lady, the very first thing I do. So I called La Fleur to go seek me a barber directly—and come back and brush my coat.</p>

<pb n="156" />
   <div type="section">
<head>THE WIG.</head>
<head>PARIS.</head>
<p>WHEN the barber came, he absolutely refused to have any thing to do with my wig: 'twas either above or below his art: I had nothing to do, but to take one ready made of his own recom|mendation.</p>
<p>—But I fear, friend! said I, this buckle won't stand.—You may im|merge it, replied he, into the ocean, and it will stand—</p>
<p>What a great scale is every thing upon in this city! thought I—The
<pb n="157"/>
utmost stretch of an English periwig|maker's ideas could have gone no further than to have <q rend="inline, marginal quotes">"dipped it into a pail of water"</q>—What difference! 'tis like time to eternity.</p>
<p>I confess I do hate all cold con|ceptions, as I do the puny ideas which engender them; and am ge|nerally so struck with the great works of nature, that for my own part, if I could help it, I never would make a comparison less than a mountain at least. All that can be said against the French sublime in this instance of it, is this—that the grandeur is <hi>more</hi> in the <hi>word;</hi> and <hi>less</hi> in the <hi>thing.</hi> No doubt the ocean fills the mind with vast ideas;

but Paris being so far inland, it was not likely I should run post a hundred miles out of it, to try the experiment—the Parisian barber meant nothing.—</p>
<p>The pail of water standing besides the great deep, makes certainly but a sorry figure in speech—but 'twill be said—it has one advantage—'tis in the next room, and the truth of the buckle may be tried in it without more ado, in a single moment.</p>
<p>In honest truth, and upon a more candid revision of the matter, <hi>The French expression professes more than it performs.</hi></p>
<p><pb n="159"/>
I think I can see the precise and distinguishing marks of national cha|racters more in these nonsensical <hi>mi|nutiae,</hi> than in the most important matters of state; where great men of all nations talk and stalk so much alike, that I would not give nine|pence to chuse amongst them.</p>
<p>I was so long in getting from under my barber's hands, that it was too late of thinking of going with my letter to Madame R*** that night: but when a man is once dressed at all points for going out, his reflections turn to little account, so taking down the name of the Hotel de Modene where I lodged, I
<pb n="160" />
walked forth without any determi|nation where to go—I shall consider of that, said I, as I walk along.</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<pb n="161" />
<head>THE PULSE.</head>
<head>PARIS.</head>
<p>HAIL ye small sweet courtesies of life, for smooth do ye make the road of it! like grace and beauty which beget inclinations to love at first sight; 'tis ye who open this door and let the stranger in.</p>
<p>—Pray, Madame, said I, have the goodness to tell me which way I must turn to go to the Opera comique:—Most willingly, Monsieur, said she, laying aside her work—</p>
<p>I had given a cast with my eye into half a dozen shops as I came
<pb n="162" />
along in search of a face not likely to be disordered by such an interrup|tion; till at last, this hitting my fancy, I had walked in.</p>
<p>She was working a pair of ruffles as she sat in a low chair on the far side of the shop facing the door—</p>
<p>—<hi>Tres volentieres;</hi> most willingly, said she, laying her work down upon a chair next her, and rising up from the low chair she was sitting in, with so chearful a movement and so chearful a look, that had I been laying out fifty louis d'ors with her, I should have said—<q rend="inline, marginal quotes">"This woman is grateful."</q></p>
<p><pb n="163"/>
You must turn, Monsieur, said she, going with me to the door of the shop, and pointing the way down the street I was to take—you must turn first to your left hand—<hi>mais prenez guarde</hi>—there are two turns; and be so good as to take the second—then go down a little way and you'll see a church, and when you are past it, give yourself the trouble to turn directly to the right, and that will lead you to the foot of the <hi>pont neuf,</hi> which you must cross—and there, any one will do himself the pleasure to shew you—</p>
<p>She repeated her instructions three times over to me with the same good natur'd patience the third time
<pb n="164" />
as the first;—and if <hi>tones and manners</hi> have a meaning, which certainly they have, unless to hearts which shut them out—she seem'd really interested, that I should not lose myself.</p>
<p>I will not suppose it was the wo|man's beauty, notwithstanding she was the handsomest grisset, I think, I ever saw, which had much to do with the sense I had of her courtesy; only I remember, when I told her how much I was obliged to her, that I looked very full in her eyes,—and that I repeated my thanks as often as she had done her instructions.</p>
<p>I had not got ten paces from the door, before I found I had forgot
<pb n="165" />
every tittle of what she had said—so looking back, and seeing her still standing in the door of the shop as if to look whether I went right or not—I returned back, to ask her whether the first turn was to my right or left—for that I had absolutely forgot.—Is it possible! said she, half laughing.—'Tis very possible, replied I, when a man is thinking more of a woman, than of her good advice.</p>
<p>As this was the real truth—she took it, as every woman takes a matter of right, with a slight courtesy.</p>
<p>—<hi>Attendez!</hi> said she, laying her hand upon my arm to detain me, whilst she called a lad out of the

back-shop to get ready a parcel of gloves. I am just going to send him, said she, with a packet into that quarter, and if you will have the complaisance to step in, it will be ready in a moment, and he shall attend you to the place.—So I walk'd in with her to the far side of the shop, and taking up the ruffle in my hand which she laid upon the chair, as if I had a mind to sit, she sat down herself in her low chair, and I instantly sat myself down besides her.</p>
<p>—He will be ready, Monsieur, said she, in a moment—And in that mo|ment, replied I, most willingly would I say something very civil to you for
<pb n="167"/>
all these courtesies. Any one may do a casual act of good nature, but a continuation of them shews it is a part of the temperature; and certainly, added I, if it is the same blood which comes from the heart, which de|scends to the extremes (touching her wrist) I am sure you must have one of the best pulses of any woman in the world—Feel it, said she, holding out her arm. So laying down my hat, I took hold of her fingers in one hand, and applied the two fore-fingers of my other to the artery—</p>
<p>—Would to heaven! my dear Eu|genius, thou hadst passed by, and beheld me sitting in my black coat, and in my lack-a-day-sical manner,
<pb n="168"/>
counting the throbs of it, one by one, with as much true devotion as if I had been watching the critical ebb or flow of her fever—How wouldst thou have laugh'd and mo|ralized upon my new profession?—and thou shouldst have laugh'd and moralized on—Trust me, my dear Eugenius, I should have said, <q rend="inline, marginal quotes">"there are worse occupations in this world <hi>than feeling a woman's pulse.</hi>"</q>—But a Grisset's! thou wouldst have said—and in an open shop! Yorick—</p>
<p>—So much the better: for when my views are direct, Eugenius, I care not if all the world saw me feel it.</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<pb n="169"/>
<head>THE HUSBAND.</head>
<head>PARIS.</head>
<p>I HAD counted twenty pulsations, and was going on fast towards the fortieth, when her husband com|ing unexpected from a back parlour into the shop, put me a little out in my reckoning—'Twas no body but her husband, she said—so I began a fresh score—Monsieur is so good, quoth she, as he pass'd by us, as to give himself the trouble of feeling my pulse—The husband took off his hat, and making me a bow, said, I did him too much honour—and hav|ing
<pb n="170" />
said that, he put on his hat and walk'd out.</p>
<p>Good God! said I to myself, as he went out—and can this man be the husband of this woman?</p>
<p>Let it not torment the few who know what must have been the grounds of this exclamation, if I ex|plain it to those who do not.</p>
<p>In London a shopkeeper and a shopkeeper's wife seem to be one bone and one flesh: in the several endowments of mind and body, some|times the one, sometimes the other has it, so as in general to be upon a par, and to tally with each other as nearly as man and wife need to do.</p>
<p><pb n="171"/>
In Paris, there are scarce two or|ders of beings more different: for the legislative and executive powers of the shop not resting in the hus|band, he seldom comes there—in some dark and dismal room behind, he sits commerceless in his thrum night-cap, the same rough son of Nature that Nature left him.</p>
<p>The genius of a people where no|thing but the monarchy is <hi>salique,</hi> having ceded this department, with sundry others, totally to the women—by a continual higgling with cus|tomers of all ranks and sizes from morning to night, like so many rough pebbles shook long together in a
<pb n="172"/>
bag, by amicable collisions, they have worn down their asperities and sharp angles, and not only become round and smooth, but will receive, some of them, a polish like a bril|liant—Monsieur <hi>le Mari</hi> is little bet|ter than the stone under your foot—</p>
<p>—Surely—surely man! it is not good for thee to sit alone—thou wast made for social intercourse and gentle greetings, and this improvement of our natures from it, I appeal to, as my evidence.</p>
<p>—And how does it beat, Mon|sieur? said she.—With all the be|nignity, said I, looking quietly in
<pb n="173"/>
her eyes, that I expected—She was going to say something civil in re|turn—but the lad came into the shop with the gloves—<hi>A propos,</hi> said I; I want a couple of pair myself.</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<pb n="174"/>
<head>THE GLOVES.</head>
<head>PARIS.</head>
<p>THE beautiful Grisset rose up when I said this, and going behind the counter, reach'd down a parcel and untied it: I advanced to the side over-against her: they were all too large. The beautiful Grisset measured them one by one across my hand—It would not alter the dimen|sions—She begg'd I would try a single pair, which seemed to be the least—She held it open—my hand slipp'd into it at once—It will not do, said I,
<pb n="175" />
shaking my head a little—No, said she, doing the same thing.</p>
<p>There are certain combined looks of simple subtlety—where whim, and sense, and seriousness, and nonsense, are so blended, that all the languages of Babel set loose together could not express them—they are communi|cated and caught so instantaneously, that you can scarce say which party is the infecter. I leave it to your men of words to swell pages about it—it is enough in the present to say again, the gloves would not do; so folding our hands within our arms, we both loll'd upon the counter—it was narrow, and there was just room for the parcel to lay between us.</p>
<p><pb n="176" />
The beautiful Grisset look'd some|times at the gloves, then side-ways to the window, then at the gloves—and then at me. I was not disposed to break silence—I follow'd her ex|ample: so I look'd at the gloves, then to the window, then at the gloves, and then at her—and so on alternately.</p>
<p>I found I lost considerably in every attack—she had a quick black eye, and shot through two such long and silken eye-lashes with such penetra|tion, that she look'd into my very heart and reins—It may seem strange, but I could actually feel she did—</p>
<p><pb n="177" />
—It is no matter, said I, taking up a couple of the pairs next me, and putting them into my pocket.</p>
<p>I was sensible the beautiful Grisset had not ask'd above a single livre above the price—I wish'd she had ask'd a livre more, and was puzzling my brains how to bring the matter about—Do you think, my dear Sir, said she, mistaking my embarrass|ment, that I could ask a <hi>sous</hi> too much of a stranger—and of a stranger whose politeness, more than his want of gloves, has done me the honour to lay himself at my mercy?—<hi>Men croyez capable?</hi>—Faith! not I, said I; and if you were, you are welcome—
<pb n="178" />
So counting the money into her hand, and with a lower bow than one gene|rally makes to a shopkeeper's wife, I went out, and her lad with his parcel followed me.</p>
</div>

<head>THE TRANSLATION.</head>
<head>PARIS.</head>
<p>THERE was no body in the box I was let into but a kindly old French officer. I love the cha|racter, not only because I honour the man whose manners are softened by a profession which makes bad men worse; but that I once knew one—for he is no more—and why should I not rescue one page from violation by writing his name in it, and telling the world it was Captain Tobias Shandy, the dearest of my flock and friends, whose philanthropy I never
<pb n="180" />
think of at this long distance from his death—but my eyes gush out with tears. For his sake, I have a predilection for the whole corps of veterans; and so I strode over the two back rows of benches, and placed myself beside him.</p>
<p>The old officer was reading atten|tively a small pamphlet, it might be the book of the opera, with a large pair of spectacles. As soon as I sat down, he took his spectacles off, and putting them into a shagreen case, return'd them and the book into his pocket together. I half rose up, and made him a bow.</p>
<p><pb n="181"/>
Translate this into any civilized language in the world—the sense is this:</p>
<p><q rend="inline, marginal quotes">"Here's a poor stranger come in to the box—he seems as if he knew no body; and is never likely, was he to be seven years in Paris, if every man he comes near keeps his spectacles upon his nose—'tis shutting the door of conversation absolutely in his face—and using him worse than a German."</q></p>
<p>The French officer might as well have said it all aloud; and if he had, I should in course have put the bow I made him into French too, and told him, <q rend="inline, marginal quotes">"I was sensible of his at|tention,

and return'd him a thou|sand thanks for it."</q></p>
<p>There is not a secret so aiding to the progress of sociality, as to get master of this <hi>short hand,</hi> and be quick in rendering the several turns of looks and limbs, with all their inflections and delineations, into plain words. For my own part, by long habitude, I do it so mechanically, that when I walk the streets of Lon|don, I go translating all the way; and have more than once stood be|hind in the circle, where not three words have been said, and have brought off twenty different dialogues with me, which I could have fairly wrote down and sworn to.</p>

I was going one evening to Mar|tini's concert at Milan, and was just entering the door of the hall, when the Marquesina di F*** was coming out in a sort of a hurry—she was al|most upon me before I saw her; so I gave a spring to one side to let her pass—She had done the same, and on the same side too; so we ran our heads together: she instantly got to the other side to get out: I was just as unfortunate as she had been; for I had sprung to that side, and op|posed her passage again—We both flew together to the other side, and then back—and so on—it was ridi|culous; we both blush'd intolerably; so I did at last the thing I should have
<pb n="184" />
done at first—I stood stock still, and the Marquesina had no more diffi|culty. I had no power to go into the room, till I had made her so much reparation as to wait and fol|low her with my eye to the end of the passage—She look'd back twice, and walk'd along it rather side-ways, as if she would make room for any one coming up stairs to pass her—No, said I—that's a vile translation: the Marquesina has a right to the best apology I can make her; and that opening is left for me to do it in—so I ran and begg'd pardon for the embarrassment I had given her, saying it was my intention to have made her way. She answered, she
<pb n="185" />
was guided by the same intention to|wards me—so we reciprocally thank'd each other. She was at the top of the stairs; and seeing no <hi>chichesbee</hi> near her, I begg'd to hand her to her coach—so we went down the stairs, stopping at every third step to talk of the concert and the adventure—Upon my word, Madame, said I when I had handed her in, I made six different efforts to let you go out—And I made six efforts, replied she, to let you enter—I wish to heaven you would make a seventh, said I—With all my heart, said she, making room—Life is too short to be long about the forms of it—so I instantly stepp'd in, and she carried me home with her—And
<pb n="186" />
what became of the concert, St. Ce|cilia, who, I suppose, was at it, knows more than I.</p>
<p>I will only add, that the connec|tion which arose out of that transla|tion, gave me more pleasure than any one I had the honour to make in Italy.</p>

<head>THE DWARF.</head>
<head>PARIS.</head>
<p>I HAD never heard the remark made by any one in my life, ex|cept by one; and who that was, will probably come out in this chapter; so that being pretty much unprepos|sessed, there must have been grounds for what struck me the moment I cast my eyes over the <hi>parterre</hi>—and that was, the unaccountable sport of nature in forming such numbers of dwarfs—No doubt, she sports at cer|tain times in almost every corner of the world; but in Paris, there is no
<pb n="188" />
end to her amusements—The god|dess seems almost as merry as she is wise.</p>
<p>As I carried my idea out of the <hi>opera comique</hi> with me, I measured every body I saw walking in the streets by it—Melancholy application! espe|cially where the size was extremely little—the face extremely dark—the eyes quick—the nose long—the teeth white—the jaw prominent—to see so many miserables, by force of acci|dents driven out of their own proper class into the very verge of another, which it gives me pain to write down—every third man a pigmy!—some by ricketty heads and hump backs—
<pb n="189" />
others by bandy legs—a third set ar|rested by the hand of Nature in the sixth and seventh years of their growth—a fourth, in their perfect and natural state, like dwarf apple|trees; from the first rudiments and stamina of their existence, never meant to grow higher.</p>
<p>A medical traveller might say, 'tis owing to undue bandages—a splene|tic one, to want of air—and an in|quisitive traveller, to fortify the sys|tem, may measure the height of their houses—the narrowness of their streets, and in how few feet square in the sixth and seventh stories such num|bers of the <hi>Bourgoisie</hi> eat and sleep
<pb n="190" />
together; but I remember, Mr. Shandy the elder, who accounted for nothing like any body else, in speak|ing one evening of these matters, averred, that children, like other ani|mals, might be increased almost to any size, provided they came right into the world; but the misery was, the citizens of Paris were so coop'd up, that they had not actually room enough to get them—I do not call it getting any thing, said he—'tis get|ting nothing—Nay, continued he, rising in his argument, 'tis getting worse than nothing, when all you have got, after twenty or five and twenty years of the tenderest care and most nutritious aliment bestowed up|on
<pb n="191" />
it, shall not at last be as high as my leg. Now, Mr. Shandy being very short, there could be nothing more said upon it.</p>
<p>As this is not a work of reasoning, I leave the solution as I found it, and content myself with the truth only of the remark, which is verified in every lane and by-lane of Paris. I was walking down that which leads from the Carousal to the Palais Royal, and observing a little boy in some distress at the side of the gutter, which ran down the middle of it, I took hold of his hand, and help'd him over. Upon turning up his face to look at him after, I perceived he was about
<pb n="192"/>
forty—Never mind, said I; some good body will do as much for me when I am ninety.</p>
<p>I feel some little principles within me, which incline me to be merciful towards this poor blighted part of my species, who have neither size or strength to get on in the world—I cannot bear to see one of them trod upon; and had scarce got seated be|side my old French officer, ere the disgust was exercised, by seeing the very thing happen under the box we sat in.</p>
<p>At the end of the orchestra, and betwixt that and the first side-box,
<pb n="193"/>
there is a small esplanade left, where, when the house is full, numbers of all ranks take sanctuary. Though you stand, as in the parterre, you pay the same price as in the orchestra. A poor defenceless being of this order had got thrust some how or other in|to this luckless place—the night was hot, and he was surrounded by be|ings two feet and a half higher than himself. The dwarf suffered inex|pressibly on all sides; but the thing which incommoded him most, was a tall corpulent German, near seven feet high, who stood directly betwixt him and all possibility of his seeing either the stage or the actors. The poor dwarf did all he could to get a
<pb n="194" />
peep at what was going forwards, by seeking for some little opening be|twixt the German's arm and his body, trying first one side, then the other; but the German stood square in the most unaccommodating posture that can be imagined—the dwarf might as well have been placed at the bottom of the deepest draw-well in Paris; so he civilly reach'd up his hand to the German's sleeve, and told him his distress—The German turn'd his head back, look'd down-upon him as Go|liah did upon David—and unfeel|ingly resumed his posture.</p>
<p>I was just then taking a pinch of snuff out of my monk's little horn box—And how would thy meek and
<pb n="195" />
courteous spirit, my dear monk! so temper'd to <hi>bear and forbear!</hi>—how sweetly would it have lent an ear to this poor soul's complaint!</p>
<p>The old French officer seeing me lift up my eyes with an emotion, as I made the apostrophe, took the li|berty to ask me what was the matter—I told him the story in three words; and added, how inhuman it was.</p>
<p>By this time the dwarf was driven to extremes, and in his first trans|ports, which are generally unreason|able, had told the German he would cut off his long queue with his knife—The German look'd back coolly,
<pb n="196"/>
and told him he was welcome if he could reach it.</p>
<p>An injury sharpened by an insult, be it to who it will, makes every man of sentiment a party: I could have leaped out of the box to have redressed it.—The old French officer did it with much less confusion; for leaning a little over, and nodding to a centinel, and pointing at the same time with his finger to the distress—the centinel made his way up to it.—There was no occasion to tell the grievance—the thing told itself; so thrusting back the German instantly with his musket—he took the poor dwarf by the hand, and placed him
<pb n="197" />
before him.—This is noble! said I, clapping my hands together—And yet you would not permit this, said the old officer, in England.</p>
<p>—In England, dear Sir, said I, <hi>we sit all at our ease.</hi></p>
<p>The old French officer would have set me at unity with myself, in case I had been at variance,—by saying it was a <hi>bon mot</hi>—and as a <hi>bon mot</hi> is always worth something at Paris, he offered me a pinch of snuff.</p>

<head>THE ROSE.</head>
<head>PARIS.</head>
<p>IT was now my turn to ask the old French officer <q rend="inline">"What was the matter?"</q> for a cry of <q rend="inline, marginal quotes">"<hi>Haussez les mains, Monsieur l'Abbe,</hi>"</q> re|echoed from a dozen different parts of the parterre, was as unintellgible to me, as my apostrophe to the monk had been to him.</p>
<p>He told me, it was some poor Abbe in one of the upper loges, who he supposed had got planted perdu behind a couple of grissets in
<pb n="199"/>
order to see the opera, and that the parterre espying him, were insisting upon his holding up both his hands during the representation.—And can it be supposed, said I, that an ec|clesiastick would pick the Griffer's pockets? The old French officer smiled, and whispering in my car, open'd a door of knowledge which I had no idea of—</p>
<p>Good God! said I, turning pale with astonishment—is it possible, that a people so smit with sentiment should at the same time be so unclean, and so unlike themselves—<hi>Quelle gros|sierte!</hi> added I.</p>

<p>The French officer told me, it was an illiberal sarcasm at the church, which had begun in the theatre about the time the Tartuffe was given in it, by Moliere—but, like other remains os Gothic manners, was declining—Every nation, continued he, have their refinements and <hi>grossiertes,</hi> in which they take the lead, and lose it of one another by turns—that he had been in most countries, but never in one where he found not some deli|cacies, which others seemed to want. <hi>Le</hi> POUR, <hi>et le</hi> CONTRE <hi>se trouvent en chaque nation;</hi> there is a balance, said he, of good and bad every where; and nothing but the knowing it is so can emancipate one half of the world
<pb n="201" />
from the prepossessions which it holds against the other—that the advan|tage of travel, as it regarded the <hi>sça|voir vivre,</hi> was by seeing a great deal both of men and manners; it taught us mutual toleration; and mutual toleration, concluded he, making me a bow, taught us mutual love.</p>
<p>The old French officer delivered this with an air of such candour and good sense, as coincided with my first favourable impressions of his charac|ter—I thought I loved the man; but I fear I mistook the object—'twas my own way of thinking—the dif|ference was, I could not have ex|pressed it half so well.</p>
<p><pb n="202" />
It is alike troublesome to both the rider and his beast—if the latter goes pricking up his ears, and starting all the way at every object which he never saw before—I have as little torment of this kind as any creature alive; and yet I honestly confess, that many a thing gave me pain, and that I blush'd at many a word the first month—which I found inconsequent and perfectly innocent the second.</p>
<p>Madame de Ramboulict, after an acquaintance of about six weeks with her, had done me the honour to take me in her coach about two leagues out of town—Of all women, Ma|dame de Rambouliet is the most cor|rect; and I never wish to see one of
<pb n="203"/>
more virtues and purity of heart—In our return back, Madame de Ram|bouliet desired me to pull the cord—I ask'd her if she wanted any thing—<hi>Rien que pisser,</hi> said Madame de Rambouliet—</p>
<p>Grieve not, gentle traveller, to let Madame de Rambouliet p—ss on—And, ye fair mystic nymphs! go each one <hi>pluck your rose,</hi> and scatter them in your path—for Madame de Ram|bouliet did no more—I handed Ma|dame de Rambouliet out of the coach; and had I been the priest of the chaste CASTALIA, I could not have served at her fountain with a more respectful decorum.</p>

The bookſeller ſaid he had not a ſet in the world—<hi>Comment!</hi> ſaid I; taking one up out of a ſet which lay upon the counter betwixt us.—He ſaid, they were ſent him only to be got bound, and were to be ſent back to Verſailles in the morning to the Count de B****.</p>
            <p>—And does the Count de B**** ſaid I, read Shakeſpear? <hi>C'eſt un Eſprit fort;</hi> replied the bookſeller.—He loves Engliſh books; and what is more to his honour, Monſieur, he love the Engliſh too. You ſpeak this ſo civilly, ſaid I, that 'tis enough to oblige an Engliſhman to lay out a Louis d'or or two at your ſhop—the bookſeller made a bow, and was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1269300202:5"/>
going to ſay ſomething, when a young decent girl of about twenty, who by her air and dreſs, ſeemed to be <hi>fille de chambre</hi> to ſome devout woman of faſhion, came into the ſhop and aſked for <hi>Les Egarments du Coeur &amp; de l'Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prit:</hi> the bookſeller gave her the book directly; ſhe pulled out a little green ſattin purſe run round with a ribband of the ſame colour, and putting her finger and thumb into it, ſhe took out the money, and paid for it. As I had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to ſtay me in the ſhop, we both walked out at the door together.</p>
            <p>—And what have you to do, my dear, ſaid I, with <hi>The Wanderings of the Heart,</hi> who ſcarce know yet you have one? nor till love has
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1269300202:6"/>
firſt told you it, or ſome faithleſs ſhepherd has made it ache, can'ſt thou ever be ſure it is ſo.—<hi>Le Dieu m'en guard!</hi> ſaid the girl.—With reaſon, ſaid I—for if is a good one, 'tis pity it ſhould be ſtolen: 'tis a little trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to thee, and gives a better air to your face, than if it was dreſs'd out with pearls.</p>
            <p>The young girl liſtened with a ſubmiſſive attention, holding her ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin purſe by its ribband in her hand all the time—'Tis a very ſmall one, ſaid I, taking hold of the bottom of it—ſhe held it towards me—and there is very little in it, my dear, ſaid I; but be but as good as thou art hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and heaven will fill it: I had a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1269300202:7"/>
parcel of crowns in my hand to pay for Shakeſpear; and as ſhe had let go the purſe intirely, I put a ſingle one in; and tying up the ribband in a bow-knot, returned it to her.</p>
            <p>The young girl made me more a humble courteſy than a low one—'twas one one of thoſe quiet, thankful ſinkings where the ſpirit bows itſelf down—the body does no more than tell it. I never gave a girl a crown in my life which gave me half the pleaſure.</p>
            <p>My advice, my dear, would not have been worth a pin to you, ſaid I, if I had not given this along with it: but now, when you ſee the crown,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1269300202:8"/>
you'll remember it—ſo don't, my dear, lay it out in ribbands.</p>
            <p>Upon my word, Sir, ſaid the girl, earneſtly, I am incapable—in ſaying which, as is uſual in little bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains of honour, ſhe gave me her hand—<hi>En verite, Monſieur, je met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trai cet argent apart,</hi> ſaid ſhe.</p>
            <p>When a virtuous convention is made betwixt man and woman, it ſanctifies their moſt private walks: ſo notwithſtanding it was duſky, yet as both our roads lay the ſame way, we made no ſcruple of walking along the Quai de Conti together</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:1269300202:9"/>
She made me a ſecond courteſy in ſetting off, and before we got twenty yards from the door, as if ſhe had not done enough before, ſhe made a ſort of a little ſtop to tell me again,—ſhe thank'd me.</p>
            <p>It was a ſmall tribute, I told her, which I could not avoid paying to virtue, and would not be miſtaken in the perſon I had been rendering it to for the world—but I ſee innocence, my dear, in your face—and foul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal the man who ever lays a ſnare in its way!</p>
            <p>The girl ſeem'd affected ſome way or other with what I ſaid—ſhe gave a low ſigh—I found I was not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1269300202:10"/>
to enquire at all after it—ſo ſaid nothing more till I got to the corner of the Rue de Nevers, where we were to part.</p>
            <p>—But is this the way, my dear, ſaid I, to the hotel de Modene? ſhe told me it was—or, that I might go by the Rue de Guineygaude, which was the next turn.—Then I'll go, my dear, by the Rue de Guineygaude, ſaid I, for two reaſons; firſt I ſhall pleaſe myſelf, and next I ſhall give you the protection of my company as far on your way as I can. The girl was ſenſible I was civil—and ſaid, ſhe wiſh'd the hotel de Modene was in the Rue de St. Pierre—You live there? ſaid I.—She told me ſhe was <hi>fille de chambre</hi> to Madame
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1269300202:11"/>
R****—Good God! ſaid I, 'tis the very lady for whom I have brought a letter from Amiens—The girl told me that Madame R****, ſhe believed expected a ſtranger with a letter, and was impatient to ſee him—ſo I deſired the girl to preſent my compliments to Madame R****, and ſay I would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly wait upon her in the morning.</p>
            <p>We ſtood ſtill at the corner of the Rue de Nevers whilſt this paſs'd—We then ſtopp'd a moment whilſt ſhe diſpoſed of her <hi>Egarments de Coeur,</hi> &amp;c. more commodiouſly than carrying them in her hand—they were two volumes; ſo I held the ſecond for her whilſt ſhe put the firſt into her pocket; and then
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1269300202:12"/>
ſhe held her pocket, and I put in the other after it.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſweet to feel by what fine-ſpun threads our affections are drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>We ſet off a-freſh, and as ſhe took her third ſtep, the girl put her hand within my arm—I was juſt bidding her—but ſhe did it of herſelf with that undeliberating ſimplicity, which ſhew'd it was out of her head that ſhe had never ſeen me before. For my own part, I felt the conviction of conſanguinity ſo ſtrongly, that I could not help turning half round to look in her face, and ſee if I could trace out
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1269300202:13"/>
any thing in it of a family likeneſs—Tut! ſaid I, are we not all relations?</p>
            <p>When we arrived at the turning up of the Rue de Guineygaude, I ſtopp'd to bid her adieu for good an all: the girl would thank me again for my company and kindneſs—She bid me adieu twice—I repeated it as often; and ſo cordial was the parting between us, that had it happen'd any where elſe, I'm not ſure but I ſhould have ſigned it with a kiſs of charity, as warm and holy as an apoſtle.</p>
            <p>But in Paris, as none kiſs each other but the men—I did, what amounted to the ſame thing—</p>

            <p>WHEN I got home to my hotel, La Fleur told me I had been enquired after by the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant de Police—The duce take it! ſaid I—I know the reaſon. It is time the reader ſhould know it, for in the order of things in which it happened, it was omitted; not that it was out of my head; but that had I told it then, it might have been forgot now—and now is the time I want it.</p>
            <p>I had left London with ſo much precipitation, that it never enter'd my
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1269300202:15"/>
mind that we were at war with France; and had reach'd Dover, and look'd through my glaſs at the hills beyond Boulogne, before the idea preſented itſelf; and with this in its train, that there was no getting there without a paſſport. Go but to the end of a ſtreet, I have a mortal averſion for returning back no wiſer than I ſat out; and as this was one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt efforts I had ever made for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, I could leſs bear the thoughts of it: ſo hearing the Count de **** had hired the packet, I begg'd he would take me in his <hi>ſuite.</hi> The Count had ſome little knowledge of me, ſo made little or no difficulty—only ſaid, his inclination to ſerve me could reach no further than Calais;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1269300202:16"/>
as he was to return by way of Bruſſels to Paris: however, when I had once paſs'd there, I might get to Paris without interruption; but that in Paris I muſt make friends and ſhift for myſelf.—Let me get to Paris, Monſieur le Count, ſaid I—and I ſhall do very well. So I embark'd, and never thought more of the matter.</p>
            <p>When Le Fleur told me the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant de Police had been enquiring after me—the thing inſtantly recurred—and by the time Le Fleur had well told me, the maſter of the hotel came into my room to tell me the ſame thing, with this addition to it, that my paſſport had been particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1269300202:17"/>
aſk'd after: the maſter of the hotel concluded with ſaying, He hoped I had one.—Not I, faith! ſaid I.</p>
            <p>The maſter of the hotel retired three ſteps from me, as from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected perſon, as I declared this—and poor Le Fleur advanced three ſteps towards me, and with that ſort of movement which a good ſoul makes to ſuccour a diſtreſs'd one—the fellow won my heart by it; and from that ſingle <hi>trait,</hi> I knew his character as perfectly, and could rely upon it as firmly, as if he had ſerved me with fidelity for ſeven years.</p>

Mon ſeignior! cried the maſter of the hotel—but recollecting himſelf as he made the exclamation, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly changed the tone of it—If Monſieur, ſaid he, has not a paſſport <hi>(apparament)</hi> in all likelihood he has friends in Paris who can procure him one.—Not that I know of, quoth I, with an air of indifference.—Then <hi>certes,</hi> replied he, you'll be ſent to the Baſtile or the Chatelet, <hi>au moins.</hi> Poo! ſaid I, the king of France is a good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured ſoul—he'll hurt no body.—<hi>Cela n'empeche pas,</hi> ſaid he—you will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be ſent to the Baſtile to-morrow morning.—But I've taken your lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for a month, anſwer'd I, and I'll not quit them a day before the time for all the kings of France in the

            <head>The Hotel at Paris.</head>
            <p>I COULD not find in my heart to torture La Fleur's with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious look upon the ſubject of my embarraſſment, which was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I had treated it ſo cavalierly: and to ſhew him how light it lay upon my mind, I dropt the ſubject en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely; and whilſt he waited upon me at ſupper, talk'd to him with more than uſual gaiety about Paris, and of the opera comique.—La Fleur had been there himſelf, and had followed me through the ſtreets as far as the bookſeller's ſhop; but ſeeing me come
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1269300202:21"/>
out with the young <hi>fille de chambre,</hi> and that we walk'd down the Quai de Conti together, La Fleur deem'd it unneceſſary to follow me a ſtep fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—ſo making his own reflections upon it, he took a ſhorter cut—and got to the hotel in time to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of the affair of the Police againſt my arrival.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the honeſt creature had taken away, and gone down to ſup himſelf, I then began to think a little ſeriouſly about my ſituation.—</p>
            <p>—And here, I know, Eugenius, thou wilt ſmile at the remembrance of a ſhort dialogue which paſs'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1269300202:22"/>
us the moment I was going to ſet out—I muſt tell it here.</p>
            <p>Eugenius, knowing that I was as little ſubject to be overburthen'd with money as thought, had drawn me aſide to interrogate me how much I had taken care for; upon telling him the exact ſum, Eugenius ſhook his head, and ſaid it would not do; ſo pull'd out his purſe in order to empty it into mine.—I've enough in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, Eugenius, ſaid I.—Indeed, Yorick, you have not, replied Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius—I know France and Italy better than you.—But you don't conſider, Eugenius, ſaid I, refuſing his offer, that before I have been three days in Paris, I ſhall take care
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1269300202:23"/>
to ſay or do ſomething or other for which I ſhall get clapp'd up into the Baſtile, and that I ſhall live there a couple of months entirely at the king of France's expence.—I beg pardon, ſaid Eugenius, drily: really, I had forgot that reſource.</p>
            <p>Now the event I treated gaily came ſeriouſly to my door.</p>
            <p>Is it folly, or nonchalance, or phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, or pertinacity—or what is it in me, that, after all, when La Fleur had gone down ſtairs, and I was quite alone, that I could not bring down my mind to think of it otherwiſe than I had then ſpoken of it to Eugenius?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:1269300202:24"/>
—And as for the Baſtile! the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror is in the word—Make the moſt of it you can, ſaid I to myſelf, the Baſtile is but another word for a tower—and a tower is but another word for a houſe you can't get out of—Mercy on the gouty! for they are in it twice a year—but with nine livres a day, and pen and ink and paper and patience, albeit a man can't get out, he may do very well within—at leaſt for a month or ſix weeks; at the end of which, if he is a harmleſs fellow his innocence appears, and he comes out a better and wiſer man than he went in.</p>
            <p>I had ſome occaſion (I forget what) to ſtep into the court-yard, as I ſettled
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1269300202:25"/>
this account; and remember I walk'd down ſtairs in no ſmall triumph with the conceit of my reaſoning—Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhrew the <hi>ſombre</hi> pencil! ſaid I vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly—for I envy not its powers, which paints the evils of life with ſo hard and deadly a colouring. The mind ſits terrified at the objects ſhe has magnified herſelf, and blackened: reduce them to their proper ſize and hue ſhe overlooks them—'Tis true, ſaid I, correcting the propoſition—the Baſtile is not an evil to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed—but ſtrip it of its towers—fill up the foſsè—unbarricade the doors—call it ſimply a confinement, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe 'tis ſome tyrant of a diſtemper—and not of a man which holds you in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1269300202:26"/>
it—the evil vaniſhes, and you bear the other half without complaint.</p>
            <p>I was interrupted in the hey-day of this ſoliloquy, with a voice which I took to be of a child, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained <q rend="inline">"it could not get out."</q>—I look'd up and down the paſſage, and ſeeing neither man, woman, or child, I went out without further attention.</p>
            <p>In my return back through the paſſage, I heard the ſame words re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated twice over; and looking up, I ſaw it was a ſtarling hung in a little cage.—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"I can't get out—I can't get out,"</q> ſaid the ſtarling.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:1269300202:27"/>
I ſtood looking at the bird: and to every perſon who came through the paſſage it ran fluttering to the ſide to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards which they approach'd it, with the ſame lamentation of its captivity—<q rend="inline">"I can't get out",</q> ſaid the ſtarling—God help thee! ſaid I, but I'll let thee out, coſt what it will; ſo I turn'd about the cage to get to the door; it was twiſted and double twiſted ſo faſt with wire, there was no getting it open without pulling the cage to pieces—I took both hands to it.</p>
            <p>The bird flew to the place where I was attempting his deliverance, and thruſting his head through the trellis, preſs'd his breaſt againſt it, as if im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient—I fear, poor creature! ſaid I,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1269300202:28"/>
I cannot ſet thee at liberty—"No," ſaid the ſtarling—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"I can't get out—I can't get out,"</q> ſaid the ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
            <p>I vow, I never had my affections more tenderly awakened; or do I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member an incident in my life, where the diſſipated ſpirits, to which my reaſon had been a bubble, were ſo ſuddenly call'd home. Mechanical as the notes were, yet ſo true in tune to nature were they chanted, that in one moment they overthrew all my ſyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic reaſonings upon the Baſtile; and I heavily walk'd up ſtairs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying every word I had ſaid in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:1269300202:29"/>
Diſguiſe thyſelf as thou wilt, ſtill ſlavery! ſaid I—ſtill thou art a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter draught; and though thouſands in all ages have been made to drink of thee, thou art no leſs bitter on that account.—'tis thou, thrice ſweet and gracious goddeſs, addreſſing my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to LIBERTY, whom all in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic or in private worſhip, whoſe taſte is grateful, and ever wilt be ſo, till NATURE herſelf ſhall change—no <hi>tint</hi> of words can ſpot thy ſnowy mantle, or chymic power turn thy ſceptre into iron—with thee to ſmile upon him as he eats his cruſt, the ſwain is happier than his monarch, from whoſe court thou art exiled—Gracious heaven! cried I, kneeling down upon the laſt ſtep but one in my aſcent—
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1269300202:30"/>
grant me but health, thou great Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtower of it, and give me but this fair goddeſs as my companion—and ſhower down thy mitres, if it ſeems good unto thy divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, upon thoſe heads which are aching for them.</p>

            <head>THE CAPTIVE.</head>
            <head>PARIS.</head>
            <p>THE bird in his cage purſued me into my room; I ſat down cloſe to my table, and leaning my head upon my hand, I begun to figure to myſelf the miſeries of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement. I was in a right frame for it, and ſo I gave full ſcope to my imagination.</p>
            <p>I was going to begin with the millions of my fellow creatures born to no inheritance but ſlavery; but finding, however affecting the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was, that I could not bring it
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1269300202:32"/>
near me, and that the multitude of of ſad groups in it did but diſtract me.—</p>
            <p>—I took a ſingle captive, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt ſhut him up in his dungeon, I then look'd through the twilight of his grated door to take his picture.</p>
            <p>I beheld his body half waſted away with long expectation and confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and felt what kind of ſickneſs of the heart it was which ariſes from hope deferr'd. Upon looking nearer I ſaw him pale and feveriſh: in thirty years the weſtern breeze had not once fann'd his blood—he had ſeen no ſun, no moon in all that time—nor had the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1269300202:33"/>
voice of friend or kinſman breathed through his lattice—his children—</p>
            <p>—But here my heart began to bleed—and I was forced to go on with another part of the portrait.</p>
            <p>He was ſitting upon the ground upon a little ſtraw, in the furtheſt corner of his dungeon, which was alternately his chair and bed: a little calender of ſmall ſticks were laid at the head notch'd all over with the diſmal days and nights he had paſs'd there—he had one of theſe little ſticks in his hand, and with a ruſty nail he was etching another day of miſery to add to the heap. As I darkened the little light he had, he lifted up a hopeleſs
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1269300202:34"/>
eye towards the door, then caſt it down—ſhook his head, and went on with his work of affliction. I heard his chains upon his legs, as he turn'd his body to lay his little ſtick upon the bundle—He gave a deep ſigh—I ſaw the iron enter into his ſoul—I burſt into tears—I could not ſuſtain the picture of confinement which my fancy had drawn—I ſtartled up from my chair, and calling La Fleur, I bid him beſpeak me a <hi>remiſe,</hi> and have it ready at the door of the hotel by nine in the morning.</p>
            <p>—I'll go directly, ſaid I, myſelf to Monſieur Le Duke de Choiſeul.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:1269300202:35"/>
La Fleur would have put me to bed; but not willing he ſhould ſee any thing upon my cheek, which would coſt the honeſt fellow a heart ache—I told him I would go to bed by himſelf—and bid him go do the ſame.</p>

            <head>THE STARLING.</head>
            <head>ROAD TO VERSAILLES.</head>
            <p>I GOT into my <hi>remiſe</hi> the hour I propoſed: La Fleur got up behind, and I bid the coachman make the beſt of his way to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailles.</p>
            <p>As there was nothing in this road, or rather nothing which I look for in travelling, I cannot fill up the blank better than with a ſhort hiſtory of this ſelf-ſame bird, which became the ſubject of the laſt chapter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:1269300202:37"/>
Whilſt the Honourable Mr. **** was waiting for a wind at Dover it had been caught upon the cliffs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it could well fly, by an Engliſh lad who was his groom; who not caring to deſtroy it, had taken it in his breaſt into the packet—and by courſe of feeding it. and taking it once under his protection, in a day or two grew fond of it, and got it ſafe along with him to Paris.</p>
            <p>At Paris the lad had laid out a a livre in a little cage for the ſtarling, and as he had little to do better the five months his maſter ſtay'd there, he taught it in his mother's tongue the four ſimple words—(and no more)—
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1269300202:38"/>
to which I own'd myſelf ſo much it's debtor.</p>
            <p>Upon his maſter's going on for Italy—the lad had given it to the maſter of the hotel—But his little ſong for liberty, being in an <hi>unknown</hi> language at Paris—the bird had little or no ſtore ſet by him—ſo La Fleur bought both him and his cage for me for a bottle of Burgundy.</p>
            <p>In my return from Italy I brought him with me to the country in whoſe language he had learn'd his notes—and telling the ſtory of him to Lord A—Lord A begg'd the bird of me—in a week Lord A gave him to Lord B—Lord B made a preſent of him to Lord C—and Lord's C's
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1269300202:39"/>
gentleman ſold him to Lord D's for a ſhilling—Lord D gave him to Lord E—and ſo on—half round the alphabet—From that rank he paſs'd into the lower houſe, and paſs'd the hands of as many commoners—But as all theſe wanted to <hi>get in</hi>—and my bird wanted to get out—he had almoſt as little ſtore ſet by him in London as in Paris.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible but many of my readers muſt have heard of him; and if any by mere chance have ever ſeen him—I beg leave to inform them, that that bird was my bird—or ſome vile copy ſet up to repreſent him.</p>
            <p>I have nothing further to add upon him, but that from that time to this,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1269300202:40"/>
I have borne this poor ſtarling as the creſt to my arms.—Thus:</p>

            <head>THE ADDRESS.</head>
            <head>VERSAILLES.</head>
            <p>I SHOULD not like to have my enemy take a view of my mind, when I am going to aſk protection of any man: for which reaſon I ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally endeavour to protect myſelf; but this going to Monſieur Le Duc de C***** was an act of compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion—had it been an act of choice, I ſhould have done it, I ſuppoſe, like other people.</p>
            <p>How many mean plans of dirty addreſs, as I went along, did my
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1269300202:42"/>
ſervile heart form! I deſerved the Baſtile for every one of them.</p>
            <p>Then nothing would ſerve me, when I got within ſight of Verſailles, but putting words and ſentences toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and conceiving attitudes and tones to wreath myſelf into Monſieur Le Duc de C*****'s good graces—This will do—ſaid I—Juſt as well, retorted I again, as a coat carried up to him by an adventurous taylor, without taking his meaſure—Fool! continued I—ſee Monſieur Le Duc's face firſt—obſerve what cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is written in it; take notice in what poſture he ſtands to hear you—mark the turns and expreſſions of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1269300202:43"/>
his body and limbs—And for the tone—the firſt ſound which comes from his lips will give it you; and from all theſe together you'll compound an addreſs at once upon the ſpot, which cannot diſguſt the Duke—the ingredients are his own, and moſt likely to go down.</p>
            <p>Well! ſaid I, I wiſh it well over—Coward again! as if man to man was not equal, throughout the whole ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the globe; and if in the field—why not face to face in the cabinet too? And truſt me, Yorick, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is not ſo, man is falſe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and betrays his own ſuccours ten times, where nature does it once.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1269300202:44"/>
Go to the Duc de C**** with the Baſtile in thy looks—My life for it, thou wilt be ſent back to Paris in half an hour, with an eſcort.</p>
            <p>I believe ſo, ſaid I—Then I'll go to the Duke, by heaven! with all the gaity and debonairneſs in the world.—</p>
            <p>—And there you are wrong again, replied I—A heart at eaſe, Yorick, flies into no extremes—'tis ever on its center.—Well! well! cried I, as the coachman turn'd in at the gates—I find I ſhall do very well: and by the time he had wheel'd round the court, and brought me up to the door, I found myſelf ſo much the better for my own lecture, that I
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1269300202:45"/>
neither aſcended the ſteps like a victim to juſtice, who was to part with life upon the topmoſt,—nor did I mount them with a ſkip and a couple of ſtrides, as I do when I fly up, Eliza! to thee, to meet it.</p>
            <p>As I enter'd the door of the ſaloon, I was met by a perſon who poſſibly might be the maitre d'hotel, but had more the air of one of the under ſecretaries, who told me the Duc de C**** was buſy—I am utterly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, ſaid I, of the forms of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining an audience, being an abſolute ſtranger, and what is worſe in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent conjuncture of affairs, being an Engliſhman too.—He replied, that did not increaſe the difficulty.—I made
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1269300202:46"/>
him a ſlight bow, and told him, I had ſomething of importance to ſay to Monſieur Le Duc. The ſecretary look'd towards the ſtairs, as if he was about to leave me to carry up this account to ſome one—But I muſt not miſlead you, ſaid I—for what I have to ſay is of no manner of importance to Monſieur Le Duc de C****—but of great import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to myſelf.—<hi>C'eſt une autre affaire,</hi> replied he—Not at all, ſaid I, to a man of gallantry.—But pray, good ſir, continued I, when can a ſtranger hope to have <hi>acceſſe?</hi> In not leſs than two hours, ſaid he, looking at his watch. The number of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pages in the court-yard ſeem'd to juſtify the calculation, that I could
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1269300202:47"/>
have no nearer a proſpect—and as walking backwards and forwards in the ſaloon, without a ſoul to commune with, was for the time as bad as being in the Baſtile itſelf, I inſtantly went back to my <hi>remiſe,</hi> and bid the coachman drive me to the <hi>cordon bleu,</hi> which was the neareſt hotel.</p>
            <p>I think there is a fatality in it—I ſeldom go to the place I ſet out for.</p>

            <head>LE PATISSER.</head>
            <head>VERSAILLES.</head>
            <p>BEFORE I had got half-way down the ſtreet, I changed my mind: as I am at Verſailles, thought I, I might as well take a view of the town; ſo I pull'd the cord, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the coachman to drive round ſome of the principal ſtreets—I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the town is not very large, ſaid I.—The coachmen begg'd pardon for ſetting me right, and told me it was very ſuperb, and that numbers of the firſt dukes and marquiſes and counts had hotels—The Count de B****, of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1269300202:49"/>
whom the bookſeller at the Quai de Conti had ſpoke ſo handſomely the night before, came inſtantly into my mind.—And why ſhould I not go, thought I, to the Count de B****, who has ſo high an idea of Engliſh books, and Engliſhmen—and tell him my ſtory? ſo I changed my mind a ſecond time—In truth it was the third; for I had intended that day for Madame de R**** in the Rue St. Pierre, and had devoutly ſent her word by her <hi>fille de chambre</hi> that I would aſſuredly wait upon her—but I am govern'd by circumſtances—I cannot govern them: ſo ſeeing a man ſtanding with a baſket on the other ſide of the ſtreet, as if he had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſell, I bid La Fleur go up
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1269300202:50"/>
to him and enquire for the Count's hotel.</p>
            <p>La Fleur return'd a little pale; and told me it was a Chevalier de St. Louis ſelling <hi>patès</hi>—It is impoſſible, La Fleur! ſaid I.—La Fleur could no more account for the phenomenon than myſelf; but perſiſted in his ſtory: he had ſeen the croix ſet in gold, with its red ribband, he ſaid, tied to his button-hole—and had look'd into the baſket and ſeen the <hi>patès</hi> which the Chevalier was ſelling; ſo could not be miſtaken in that.</p>
            <p>Such a reverſe in man's life awakens a better principle than curioſity: I could not help looking for ſome time
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1269300202:51"/>
at him as I ſat in the <hi>remiſe</hi>—the more I look'd at him—his croix and his baſket, the ſtronger they wove themſelves into my brain—I got out of the <hi>remiſe</hi> and went towards him.</p>
            <p>He was begirt with a clean linen apron which fell below his knees, and with a ſort of a bib went half way up his breaſt; upon the top of this, but a little below the hem, hung his croix. His baſket of little <hi>patès</hi> was cover'd over with a white damaſk napkin; another of the ſame kind was ſpread at the bottom; and there was a look of <hi>propreté</hi> and neatneſs throughout; that one might have bought his <hi>patès</hi> of him, as much from appetite as ſentiment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:1269300202:52"/>
He made an offer of them to nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but ſtood ſtill with them at the corner of a hotel, for thoſe to buy who choſe it, without ſolicitation.</p>
            <p>He was about forty-eight—of a ſedate look, ſomething approaching to gravity. I did not wonder.—I went up rather to the baſket than him, and having lifted up the nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin and taken one of his <hi>patès</hi> into my hand—I begg'd he would explain the appearance which affected me.</p>
            <p>He told me in a few words, that the beſt part of his life had paſs'd in the ſervice, in which, after ſpending a ſmall patrimony, he had obtain'd a company and the croix with it;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1269300202:53"/>
but that at the concluſion of the laſt peace, his regiment being reformed, and the whole corps, with thoſe of ſome other regiments, left without any proviſion—he found himſelf in a wide world without friends, without a livre—and indeed, ſaid he, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any thing but this—(pointing, as he ſaid it, to his croix)—The poor chevalier won my pity, and he finiſh'd the ſcene, with winning my eſteem too.</p>
            <p>The king, he ſaid, was the moſt generous of princes, but his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity could neither relieve or reward every one, and it was only his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to be amongſt the number. He had a little wife, he ſaid, whom
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1269300202:54"/>
he loved, who did the <hi>patiſſerie;</hi> and added, he felt no diſhonour in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her and himſelf from want in this way—unleſs Providence had offer'd him a better.</p>
            <p>It would be wicked to with-hold a pleaſure from the good, in paſſing over what happen'd to this poor Chevalier of St. Louis about nine months after.</p>
            <p>It ſeems he uſually took his ſtand near the iron gates which lead up to the palace, and as his croix had caught the eye of numbers, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers had made the ſame enquiry which I had done—He had told them the ſame ſtory, and always with

ſo much modeſty and good ſenſe, that it had reach'd at laſt the king's ears—who hearing the Chevalier had been a gallant officer, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected by the whole regiment as a man of honour and integrity—he broke up his little trade by a penſion of fifteen hundred livres a year.</p>

            <head>RENNES.</head>
            <p>WHEN ſtates and empires have their periods of declenſion, and feel in their turns what diſtreſs and poverty is—I ſtop not to tell the cauſes which gradually brought the houſe d'E**** in Britany into decay. The Marquis d'E**** had fought up againſt his condition with great firmneſs; wiſhing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and ſtill ſhew to the world ſome little fragments of what his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors had been—their indiſcretions had put it out of his power. There
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1269300202:57"/>
was enough left for the little exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of <hi>obſcurity</hi>—But he had two boys who look'd up to him for <hi>light</hi>—he thought they deſerved it. He had tried his ſword—it could not open the way—the <hi>mounting</hi> was too ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive—and ſimple oeconomy was not a match for it—there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource but commerce.</p>
            <p>In any other province in France, ſave Britany, this was ſmiting the root for ever of the little tree his pride and affection wiſh'd to ſee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloſſom—But in Britany, there being a proviſion for this, he avail'd himſelf of it; and taking an occaſion when the ſtates were aſſembled at Rennes,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1269300202:58"/>
the Marquis, attended with his two boys, enter'd the court; and having pleaded the right of an ancient law of the duchy, which, though ſeldom claim'd, he ſaid, was no leſs in force; he took his ſword from his ſide—Here—ſaid he—take it; and be truſty guardians of it, till better times put me in condition to reclaim it.</p>
            <p>The preſident accepted the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis's ſword—he ſtay'd a few minutes to ſee it depoſited in the archives of his houſe—and departed.</p>
            <p>The Marquis and his whole family embarked the next day for Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nico, and in about nineteen or twenty years of ſucceſsful application to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1269300202:59"/>
with ſome unlook'd for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts from diſtant branches of his houſe—return'd home to reclaim his nobility and to ſupport it.</p>
            <p>It was an incident of good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune which will never happen to any traveller, but a ſentimental one, that I ſhould be at Rennes at the very time of this ſolemn requiſition: I call it ſolemn—it was ſo to me.</p>
            <p>The Marquis enter'd the court with his whole family: he ſupported his lady—his eldeſt ſon ſupported his ſiſter, and his youngeſt was at the other extreme of the line next his mother.—he put his handkerchief to his face twice—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:1269300202:60"/>
—There was a dead ſilence. When the Marquis had approach'd within ſix paces of the tribunal, he gave the Marchioneſs to his youngeſt ſon, and advancing three ſteps before his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily—he reclaim'd his ſword. His ſword was given him, and the moment he got it into his hand he drew it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt out of the ſcabbard—'twas the ſhining face of a friend he had once given up—he look'd attentively along it, beginning at the hilt, as if to ſee whether it was the ſame—when ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving a little ruſt which it had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted near the point, he brought it near his eye, and bending his head down over it—I think I ſaw a tear fall upon the place: I could not be deceived by what followed.</p>

               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I ſhall find, ſaid he, ſome <hi>other way,</hi> to get it off."</q>
            </p>
            <p>When the Marquis had ſaid this, he return'd his ſword into its ſcabbard, made a bow to the guardians of it—and, with his wife and daughter and his two ſons following him, walk'd out.</p>

            <p>I FOUND no difficulty in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting admittance to Monſieur Le Count de B****. The ſet of Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpears was laid upon the table; and he was tumbling them over. I walk'd up cloſe to the table, and giving firſt ſuch a look at the books as to make him conceive I knew what they were—I told him I had come without any one to preſent me, knowing I ſhould meet with a friend in his apartment who, I truſted, would do it for me—it is my countryman
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1269300202:63"/>
the great Shakeſpear, ſaid I, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his works—<hi>et ayez la bontè, mon cher ami,</hi> apoſtrophizing his ſpirit, added I, <hi>de me faire cet hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neur la.</hi>—</p>
            <p>The Count ſmil'd at the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of the introduction; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I look'd a little pale and ſickly, inſiſted upon my taking an arm-chair: ſo I ſat down; and to ſave him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures upon a viſit ſo out of all rule, I told him ſimply of the inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the bookſeller's ſhop, and how that had impell'd me rather to go to him with the ſtory of a little embarraſſment I was under, than to any other man in France—And what
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1269300202:64"/>
is your embarraſſment? let me hear it, ſaid the Count. So I told him the ſtory juſt as I have told it the reader—</p>
            <p>—And the maſter of my hotel, ſaid I, as I concluded it, will needs have it, Monſieur le Count, that I ſhall be ſent to the Baſtile—but I have no apprehenſions, continued I—for in falling into the hands of the moſt poliſh'd people in the world, and being conſcious I was a true man, and not come to ſpy the nakedneſs of the land, I ſcarce thought I laid at their mercy.—It does not ſuit the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry of the French, Monſieur le Count, ſaid I, to ſhew it againſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valids.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:1269300202:65"/>
An animated bluſh came into the Count de B****'s cheeks, as I ſpoke this—<hi>Ne craignez rien</hi>—Don't fear, ſaid he—Indeed I don't, replied I again—beſides, continued I a little ſportingly—I have come laughing all the way from London to Paris, and I do not think Monſieur le Duc de Choiſeul is ſuch an enemy to mirth, as to ſend me back crying for my pains.</p>
            <p>—My application to you, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur le Compte de B**** (mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him a low bow) is to deſire he will not.</p>
            <p>The Count heard me with great good nature, or I had not ſaid half
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1269300202:66"/>
as much—and once or twice ſaid—<hi>C'eſt bien dit.</hi> So I reſted my cauſe there—and determined to ſay no more about it.</p>
            <p>The Count led the diſcourſe: we talk'd of indifferent things;—of books and politicks, and men—and then of women—God bleſs them all! ſaid I, after much diſcourſe about them—there is not a man upon earth who loves them ſo much as I do: after all the foibles I have ſeen, and all the ſatires I have read againſt them, ſtill I love them; being firmly perſuaded that a man who has not a ſort of an affection for the whole ſex, is incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ever loving a ſingle one as he ought.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:1269300202:67"/>
               <hi>Hèh bien! Monſieur l'Anglois,</hi> ſaid the Count, gaily—You are not come to ſpy the nakedneſs of the land—I believe you—<hi>ni encore,</hi> I dare ſay, <hi>that</hi> of our women—But permit me to conjecture—if, <hi>par hazard,</hi> they fell in your way—that the proſpect would not affect you.</p>
            <p>I have ſomething within me which cannot bear the ſhock of the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent inſinuation: in the ſportability of chit-chat I have often endeavoured to conquer it, and with infinite pain have hazarded a thouſand things to a dozen of the ſex together—the leaſt of which I could not venture to a ſingle one, to gain heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:1269300202:68"/>
Excuſe me, Monſieur Le Count, ſaid I—as for the nakedneſs of your land, if I ſaw it, I ſhould caſt my eyes over it with tears in them—and for that of your women (bluſhing at the idea he had excited in me) I am ſo evangelical in this, and have ſuch a fellow-feeling for what ever is <hi>weak</hi> about them, that I would cover it with a garment, if I knew how to throw it on—But I could wiſh, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued I, to ſpy the <hi>nakedneſs</hi> of their hearts, and through the different diſguiſes of cuſtoms, climates, and religion, find out what is good in them, to faſhion my own by—and therefore am I come.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:1269300202:69"/>
It is for this reaſon, Monſieur le Compte, continued I, that I have not ſeen the Palais royal—nor the Luxembourg—nor the Façade of the Louvre—nor have attempted to ſwell the catalogues we have of pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſtatues, and churches—I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive every fair being as a temple, and would rather enter in, and ſee the original drawings and looſe ſketches hung up in it, than the transfigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Raphael itſelf.</p>
            <p>The thirſt of this, continued I, as impatient as that which inflames the breaſt of the connoiſſeur, has led me from my own home into France—and from France will lead me through Italy—'tis a quiet journey
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1269300202:70"/>
of the heart in purſuit of NATURE, and thoſe affections which riſe out of her, which make us love each other—and the world, better than we do.</p>
            <p>The Count ſaid a great many civil things to me upon the occaſion; and added very politely how much he ſtood obliged to Shakeſpear for making me known to him—but, <hi>a-propos,</hi> ſaid he—Shakeſpear is full of great things—He forgot a ſmall punctillio of announcing your name—it puts you under a neceſſity of doing it yourſelf.</p>

            <p>THERE is not a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing affair in life to me, than to ſet about telling any one who I am—for there is ſcarce any body I cannot give a better account of than of myſelf; and I have often wiſh'd I could do it in a ſingle word—and have an end of it. It was the only time and occaſion in my life, I could accompliſh this to any purpoſe—for Shakeſpear lying upon the table, and recollecting I was in his books, I took up Hamlet, and turning imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to the grave-diggers ſcene in

the fifth act, I lay'd my finger upon YORICK, and advancing the book to the Count, with my finger all the way over the name—Me, <hi>Voici!</hi> ſaid I.</p>
            <p>Now whether the idea of poor Yorick's ſkull was put out of the Count's mind, by the reality of my own, or by what magic he could drop a period of ſeven or eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, makes nothing in this account—'tis certain the French con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive better than they combine—I wonder at nothing in this world, and the leſs at this; inaſmuch as one of the firſt of our own church, for whoſe candour and paternal ſentiments I have the higheſt veneration, fell

into the ſame miſtake in the very ſame caſe.—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"He could not bear, he ſaid, to look into ſermons wrote by the king of Denmark's jeſter."</q>—Good, my lord! ſaid I—but there are two Yorick's.

            <p>—If Alexander king of Macedon could have tranſlated your lordſhip,

            </p>

            <p>I COULD not conceive why the Count de B**** had gone ſo abruptly out of the room, any more than I could conceive why he had put the Shakeſpear into his pocket—<hi>Myſteries which muſt explain themſelves, are not worth the loſs of time, which a conjecture about them takes up:</hi> 'twas bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to read Shakeſpear; ſo taking up, "<hi>Much Ado about Nothing,</hi>" I tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported myſelf inſtantly from the chair I ſat in to Meſſina in Sicily, and got ſo buſy with Don Pedro and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedick
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1269300202:76"/>
and Beatrice, that I thought not of Verſailles, the Count, or the Paſſport.</p>
            <p>Sweet pliability of man's ſpirit, that can at once ſurrender itſelf to illuſions, which cheat expectation and ſorrow of their weary moments!——long—long ſince had ye number'd out my days, had I not trod ſo great a part of them upon this enchanted ground: when my way is too rough for my feet, or too ſteep for my ſtrength, I get off it, to ſome ſmooth velvet path which fancy has ſcattered over with roſe-buds of delights; and having taken a few turns in it, come back ſtrengthen'd and refreſh'd—When evils preſs ſore upon me, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1269300202:77"/>
there is no retreat from them in this world, then I take a new courſe—I leave it—and as I have a clearer idea of the elyſian fields than I have of heaven, I force myſelf, like Eneas, into them—I ſee him meet the penſive ſhade of his forſaken Dido—and wiſh to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognize it—I ſee the injured ſpirit wave her head, and turn off ſilent from the author of her miſeries and diſhonours—I loſe the feelings for myſelf in hers—and in thoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections which were wont to make me mourn for her when I was at ſchool.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Surely this is not walking in a vain ſhadow—nor does man diſquiet himſelf</hi> in vain, <hi>by it</hi>—he oftener does ſo in

truſting the iſſue of his commotions to reaſon only.—I can ſafely ſay for myſelf, I was never able to conquer any one ſingle bad ſenſation in my heart ſo deciſively, as by beating up as faſt as I could for ſome kindly and gentle ſenſation, to fight it upon its own ground.</p>
            <p>When I had got to the end of the third act, the Count de B**** en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with my Paſſport in his hand. Monſ. le Duc de C****, ſaid the Count, is as good a prophet, I dare ſay, as he is a ſtateſman—<hi>Un homme qui rit,</hi> ſaid the duke, <hi>ne ſera jamais dangereuz.</hi>—Had it been for any one but the king's jeſter, added the Count, I

            <p>We have no jeſter at court, Monſ.

            <p>—'Tis ſtrange! writes Bevoriſkius; but the facts are certain, for I have

had the curioſity to mark them down one by one with my pen—but the cock-ſparrow during the little time that I could have finiſhed the other half this note, has actually interrupted me with the reiteration of his careſſes three and twenty times and a half.</p>

            <p>AND how do you find the French? ſaid the Count de B****, after he had given me the Paſsport.</p>
            <p>The reader may ſuppoſe that after ſo obliging a proof of courteſy, I could not be at a loſs to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing handſome to the enquiry.</p>
            <p>—<hi>Mais paſſe, pour cela</hi>—Speak frankly, ſaid he; do you find all the urbanity in the French which the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1269300202:86"/>
world give us the honour of?—I had found every thing, I ſaid, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it—<hi>Vraiment,</hi> ſaid the count.—<hi>Les Francois ſont poli. s</hi>—To an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, replied I.</p>
            <p>The count took notice of the word <hi>exceſſe;</hi> and would have it I meant more than I ſaid. I defended myſelf a long time as well as I could againſt it—he inſiſted I had a reſerve, and that I would ſpeak my opinion frankly.</p>
            <p>I believe, Monſ. Le Compte, ſaid I, that man has a certain compaſs, as well as an inſtrument; and that the ſocial and other calls have occaſion by turns for every key in him; ſothat
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1269300202:87"/>
if you begin a note too high or too low, there muſt be a want either in the upper or under part, to fill up the ſyſtem of harmony.—The Count de B**** did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand muſic, ſo deſired me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it ſome other way. A poliſh'd nation, my dear Count, ſaid I, makes every one its debtor; and beſides urbanity itſelf, like the fair ſex, has ſo many charms; it goes againſt the the heart to ſay it can do ill; and yet, I believe, there is but a certain line of perfection, that man, take him altogether, is empower'd to arrive at—if he gets beyond, he rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes qualities, than gets them. I muſt not preſume to ſay, how far this has affected the French in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:1269300202:88"/>
we are ſpeaking of—but ſhould it ever be the caſe of the Engliſh, in the progreſs of their reſentments, to arrive at the ſame poliſh which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes the French, if we did not loſe the <hi>politeſſe de coeur,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines men more to human actions, than courteous ones—we ſhould at leaſt loſe that diſtinct variety and originality of character, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes them, not only from each other, but from all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.</p>
            <p>I had a few king William's ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings as ſmooth as glaſs in my pocket; and foreſeeing they would be of uſe in the illuſtration of my hypotheſis,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:1269300202:89"/>
I had got them into my hand, when I had proceeded ſo far—</p>

            <p>The Engliſh, like antient medais, kept more apart, and paſſing but few peoples hands, preſerve the firſt ſharpneſſes which the fine hand of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has given them—they are not ſo pleaſant to feel—but in return,

            <head>THE TEMPTATION.</head>
            <head>PARIS.</head>
            <p>WHEY I alighted at the hotel, the porter told me a young woman with a band-box had been that moment enquiring for me.—I do not know, ſaid the porter, whether ſhe is gone away or no. I took the key of my chamber of him, and went up ſtairs; and when I had got with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ten ſteps of the top of the landing before my door, I met her coming eaſily down.</p>
            <p>It was the fair <hi>fille de chambre</hi> I had walked along the Quai de Conti
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:1269300202:94"/>
with: Madame de R**** had ſent her upon ſome commiſſions to a <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chande de modes</hi> within a ſtep or two of the hotel de Modene; and as I had fail'd in waiting upon her, had bid her enquire if I had left Paris; and if ſo, whether I had not left a letter addreſs'd to her.</p>
            <p>As the fair <hi>fille de chambre</hi> was ſo near my door ſhe turned back, and went into the room with me for a moment or two whilſt I wrote a card.</p>
            <p>It was a fine ſtill evening in the latter end of the month of May—the crimſon window curtains (which were of the ſame colour of thoſe of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1269300202:95"/>
the bed) were drawn cloſe—the ſun was ſetting and reflected through them ſo warm a tint into the fair <hi>fille de chambre</hi>'s face—I thought ſhe bluſh'd—the idea of it made me bluſh myſelf—we were quite alone; and that ſuper-induced a ſecond bluſh before the firſt could get off.</p>
            <p>There is a ſort of a pleaſing half guilty bluſh, where the blood is more in fault than the man—'tis ſent impetuous from the heart, and virtue flies after it—not to call it back, but to make the ſenſation of it more delicious to the nerves—'tis aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated.—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:1269300202:96"/>
But I'll not deſcribe it.—I felt ſomething at firſt within me which was not in ſtrict uniſon with the leſſon of virtue I had given her the night before—I ſought five mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes for a card—I knew I had not one.—I took up a pen—I laid it down again—my hand trembled—the devil was in me.</p>
            <p>I know as well as any one, he is an adverſary, whom if we reſiſt, he will fly from us—but I ſeldom reſiſt him at all; from a terror, that though I may conquer, I may ſtill get a hurt in the combat—ſo I give up the triumph, for ſecurity; and inſtead of thinking to make him fly, I ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally fly myſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:1269300202:97"/>
The fair <hi>fille de chambre</hi> came cloſe up to the bureau where I was looking for a card—took up firſt the pen I caſt down, then offered to hold me the ink: ſhe offer'd it ſo ſweetly, I was going to accept it—but I durſt not—I have nothing, my dear, ſaid I, to write upon.—Write it, ſaid ſhe, ſimply, upon any thing.—</p>
            <p>I was juſt going to cry out, Then I will write it, fair girl! upon thy lips.—</p>
            <p>If I do, ſaid I, I ſhall periſh—ſo I took her by the hand, and led her to the door, and begg'd ſhe would not forget the leſſon I had given her—She ſaid, Indeed ſhe would not—
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:1269300202:98"/>
and as ſhe utter'd it with ſome ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs, ſhe turned about, and gave me both her hands, cloſed together, into mine—it was impoſſible not to compreſs them in that ſituation—I wiſh'd to let them go; and all the time I held them, I kept arguing within myſelf againſt it—and ſtill I held them on.—In two minutes I found I had all the battle to fight over again—and I felt my legs and every limb about me tremble at the idea.</p>
            <p>The foot of the bed was within a yard and a half of the place where we were ſtandingg—I had ſtill hold of her hands—and how it happened I can give no account, but I neither
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:1269300202:99"/>
aſk'd her—nor drew her—nor did I think of the bed—but ſo it did hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, we both ſat down.</p>
            <p>I'll juſt ſhew you, ſaid the fair <hi>fille de chambre,</hi> the little purſe I have been making to-day to hold your crown. So ſhe put her hand into her right pocket, which was next me, and felt for it for ſometime—then into into the left—<q rend="inline">"She had loſt it."</q>—I never bore expectation more quietly—it was in her right pocket at laſt—ſhe pulled it out; it was of green taffeta, lined with a little bit of white quilted ſattin, and juſt big enough to hold the crown—ſhe put it into my hand—it was pretty; and I held it ten minutes with the back of my hand
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1269300202:100"/>
reſting upon her lap—looking ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at the purſe, ſometimes on one ſide of it.</p>
            <p>A ſtitch or two had broke out in the gathers of my ſtock—the fair <hi>fille de chambre,</hi> without ſaying a word, took out her little huſſive, threaded a ſmall needle, and ſew'd it up—I foreſaw it would hazard the glory of the day; and as ſhe paſſed her hand in ſilence acroſs and acroſs my neck in the manoeuvre, I felt the laurels ſhake which fancy had wreath'd about my head.</p>
            <p>A ſtrap had given way in her walk, and the buckle of her ſhoe was juſt falling off—See, ſaid the <hi>fille de</hi>

               <hi>chambre,</hi> holding up her foot—I could not for my ſoul but faſten the buckle in return, and putting in the ſtrap—and lifting up the other foot with it, when I had done, to ſee both were right—in doing it too ſuddenly—it unavoidably threw the fair <hi>fille de chambre</hi> off her center—and then—</p>

            <p>If nature has ſo wove her web of kindneſs, that ſome threads of love and deſire are entangled with the piece—muſt the whole web be rent in drawing them out?—Whip me ſuch ſtoics, great governor of nature!

            <p>As I finiſh'd my addreſs, I raiſed the fair <hi>fille de chambre</hi> up by the hand, and led her out of the room—ſhe ſtood by me till I lock'd the door and put the key in my pocket—<hi>and then</hi>—the victory being quite deciſive—and not till then, I

            <head>THE MYSTERY.</head>
            <head>PARIS.</head>
            <p>IF a man knows the heart, he will know it was impoſſible to go back inſtantly to my chamber—it was touching a cold key with a flat third to it, upon the cloſe of a piece of muſick, which had call'd forth my affections—therefore, when I let go the hand of the <hi>fille de chambre,</hi> I remain'd at the gate of the hotel for ſome time, looking at every one who paſs'd by, and forming conjectures upon them, till my attention got fix'd
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:1269300202:106"/>
upon a ſingle object which confounded all kind of reaſoning upon him.</p>
            <p>It was a tall figure of a philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phic ſerious, aduſt look, which paſs'd and repaſs'd ſedately along the ſtreet, making a turn of about ſixty paces on each ſide of the gate of the hotel—the man was about fifty-two—had a ſmall cane under his arm—was dreſs'd in a dark drab-colour'd coat, waiſtcoat, and breeches, which ſeem'd to have ſeen ſome years ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice—they were ſtill clean, and there was a little air of frugal <hi>propretè</hi> throughout him. By his pulling off his hat, and his attitude of accoſting a good many in his way, I ſaw he was aſking charity; ſo I got a ſous or
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1269300202:107"/>
two out of my pocket ready to give him, as he took me in his turn—he paſs'd by me without aſking any thing—and yet did not go five ſteps further before he aſk'd charity of a little woman—I was much more likely to have given of the two—He had ſcarce done with the woman, when he pull'd off his hat to another who was coming the ſame way.—An ancient gentleman came ſlowly—and, after him, a young ſmart one—He let them both paſs, and aſk'd nothing: I ſtood obſerving him half an hour, in which time he had made a dozen turns backwards and forwards, and found that he invariably purſued the ſame plan.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:1269300202:108"/>
There were two things very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular in this, which ſet my brain to work, and to no purpoſe—the firſt was, why the man ſhould <hi>only</hi> tell his ſtory to the ſex—and ſecondly—what kind of ſtory it was, and what ſpecies of eloquence it could be, which ſoften'd the hearts of the women, which he knew 'twas to no purpoſe to practiſe upon the men.</p>
            <p>There were two other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which entangled this myſtery—the one was, he told every woman what he had to ſay in her ear, and in a way which had much more the air of a ſecret than a petition—the other was, it was always ſucceſsful—he never ſtopp'd a woman, but ſhe
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1269300202:109"/>
pull'd out her purſe, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately gave him ſomething.</p>
            <p>I could form no ſyſtem to explain the phenomenon.</p>
            <p>I had got a riddle to amuſe me for the reſt of the evening, ſo I walk'd up ſtairs to my chamber.</p>

            <head>PARIS.</head>
            <p>I WAS immediately followed up by the maſter of the hotel, who came into my room to tell me I muſt provide lodgings elſe where.—How ſo, friend? ſaid I.—He anſwer'd, I had had a young woman lock'd up with me two hours that evening in my bed-chamber, and 'twas againſt the rules of his houſe.—Very well, ſaid I, we'll all part friends then—for the girl is no worſe—and I am no worſe—and you will be juſt as I found you.—It was enough, he ſaid, to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:1269300202:111"/>
overthrow the credit of his hotel.—<hi>Voyez vous, Monſieur,</hi> ſaid he, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the foot of the bed we had been ſitting upon.—I own it had ſomething of the appearance of an evidence; but my pride not ſuffering me to enter into any detail of the caſe, I exhorted him to let his ſoul ſleep in peace, as I reſolved to let mine do that night, and that I would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge what I owed him at break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt.</p>
            <p>I ſhould not have minded, <hi>Monſieur,</hi> ſaid he, if you had had twenty girls—'Tis a ſcore more, replied I, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting him, than I ever reckon'd upon—Provided, added he, it hadbeen
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:1269300202:112"/>
but in a morning.—And does the difference of the time of the day at Paris make a difference in the ſin?—It made a difference, he ſaid, in the ſcandal.—I like a good diſtinction in my heart; and cannot ſay I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerably out of temper with the man.—I own it is neceſſary, re-aſſumed the maſter of the hotel, that a ſtranger at Paris ſhould have the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties preſented to him of buying lace and ſilk ſtockings and ruffles, <hi>et tout cela</hi>—and 'tis nothing if a woman comes with a band box.—O' my conſcience, ſaid I, ſhe had one; but I never look'd into it.—Then, <hi>Monſieur,</hi> ſaid he, has bought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.—Not one earthly thing, replied I.—Becauſe, ſaid he, I could recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:1269300202:113"/>
one to you who would uſe you <hi>en conſcience.</hi>—But I muſt ſee her this night, ſaid I.—He made me a low bow and walk'd down.</p>
            <p>Now ſhall I triumph over this <hi>maitre d'hotel,</hi> cried I—and what then?—Then I ſhall let him ſee I know he is a dirty fellow.—And what then?—What then!—I was too near myſelf to ſay it was for the ſake of others.—I had no good anſwer left—there was more of ſpleen than principle in my project, and I was ſick of it before the execution.</p>
            <p>In a few minutes the Griſſet came in with her box of lace—I'll buy
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:1269300202:114"/>
nothing however, ſaid I, within my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>The Griſſet would ſhew me every thing—I was hard to pleaſe: ſhe would not ſeem to ſee it; ſhe open'd her little magazine, laid all her laces one after another before me—un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded and folded them up again one by one with the moſt patient ſweetneſs—I might buy—or not—ſhe would let me have every thing at my own price—the poor creature ſeem'd anxious to get a penny; and laid her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out to win me, and not ſo much in a manner which ſeem'd artful, as in one I felt ſimple and careſſing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:1269300202:115"/>
If there is not a fund of honeſt cullibility in man, ſo much the worſe—my heart relented, and I gave up my ſecond reſolution as quietly as the firſt—Why ſhould I chaſtiſe one for the treſpaſs of another? if thou art tributary to this tyrant of an hoſt, thought I, looking up in her face, ſo much harder is thy bread.</p>
            <p>If I had not had more than four <hi>Louis d'ors</hi> in my purſe, there was no ſuch thing as riſing up and ſhewing her the door, till I had firſt laid three of them out in a pair of ruffles.</p>

            <head>PARIS.</head>
            <p>WHEN La Fleur came up to wait upon me at ſupper, he told me how ſorry the maſter of the hotel was for his affront to me in bidding me change my lodgings.</p>
            <p>A man who values a good night's reſt will not lay down with enmity in his heart if he can help it—So I bid La Fleur tell the maſter of the hotel, that I was ſorry on my ſide for the occaſion I had given him—
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:1269300202:118"/>
and you may tell him, if you will, La Fleur, added I, that if the young woman ſhould call again, I ſhall not ſee her.</p>
            <p>This was a ſacrifice not to him, but myſelf, having reſolved, after ſo narrow an eſcape, to run no more riſks, but to leave Paris, if it was poſſible, with all the virtue I enter'd in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>C'eſt deroger à nobleſſe, Monſieur,</hi> ſaid La Fleur, making me a bow down to the ground as he ſaid it—<hi>Et encore Monſieur,</hi> ſaid he, may change his ſentiments—and if <hi>(par hazard)</hi> he ſhould like to amuſe himſelf—
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:1269300202:119"/>
I find no amuſement in it, ſaid I, interrupting him—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mon Dieu!</hi> ſaid La Fleur—and took away.</p>
            <p>In an hour's time he came to put me to bed, and was more than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly officious—ſomething hung upon his lips to ſay to me, or aſk me, which he could not get off: I could not conceive what it was; and indeed gave myſelf little trouble to find it out, as I had another riddle ſo much more intereſting upon my mind, which was that of the man's aſking charity before the door of the hotel—I would have given any thing to have got to the bottom of it; and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:1269300202:120"/>
that, not out of curioſity—'tis ſo low a principle of enquiry, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, I would not purchaſe the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of it with a two-ſous piece—but a ſecret, I thought, which ſo ſoon and ſo certainly ſoften'd the heart of every woman you came near, was a ſecret at leaſt equal to the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher's ſtone: had I had both the Indies, I would have given up one to have been maſter of it.</p>
            <p>I toſs'd and turn'd it almoſt all night long in my brains to no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of purpoſe; and when I awoke in the morning, I found my ſpirit as much troubled with my <hi>dreams,</hi> as ever the king of Babylon had been

            <head>PARIS.</head>
            <p>IT was Sunday; and when La Fleur came in, in the morning, with my coffee and role and butter, he had got himſelf ſo gallantly array'd, I ſcarce knew him.</p>
            <p>I had convenanted at Montreal to give him a new hat with a ſilver but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and loop, and four Louis d'ors <hi>pour s'adoniſer,</hi> when we got to Paris; and the poor fellow, to do him juſtice, had done wonders with it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:1269300202:123"/>
He had bought a bright, clean, good ſcarlet coat and a pair of breeches of the ſame—They were not a crown worſe, he ſaid, for the wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—I wiſh'd him hang'd for telling me—they look'd ſo freſh, that tho' I knew the thing could not be done, yet I would rather have impoſed upon my fancy with thinking I had bought them new for the fellow, than that they had come out of the <hi>Rue de friperie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a nicety which makes not the heart ſore at Paris.</p>
            <p>He had purchaſed moreover a handſome blue ſattin waiſtcoat, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully enough embroidered—this
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:1269300202:124"/>
was indeed ſomething the worſe for the ſervices it had done, but 'twas clean ſcour'd—the gold had been touch'd up, and upon the whole was rather ſhowy than otherwiſe—and as the blue was not violent, it ſuited with the coat and breeches very well: he had ſqueez'd out of the money, moreover, a new bag and a ſolitaire; and had inſiſted with the <hi>fripier,</hi> upon a gold pair of garters to his breeches knees—He had purchaſed muſlin ruffles, <hi>bien brodées,</hi> with four livres of his own money—and a pair of white ſilk ſtockings for five more—and, to top all, nature had given him a handſome figure, without coſting him a ſous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:1269300202:125"/>
He enter'd the room thus ſet off, with his hair dreſs'd in the firſt ſtile, and with a handſome <hi>bouquet</hi> in his breaſt—in a word, there was that look of feſtivity in every thing about him, which at once put me in mind it was Sunday—and by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bining both together, it inſtantly ſtruck me, that the favour he wiſh'd to aſk of me the night before, was to ſpend the day, as every body in Paris ſpent it, beſides. I had ſcarce made the conjecture, when La Fleur, with infinite humility, but with a look of truſt, as if I ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe him, begg'd I would grant him the day, <hi>pour faire le galant vis à vis de ſa maitreſſe.</hi>

            <p>LA Fleur had left me ſomething to amuſe myſelf with for the day more than I had bargain'd for, or could have enter'd either into his head or mine.</p>
            <p>He had brought the little print of butter upon a currant leaf; and as the morning was warm, and he had a good ſtep to bring it, he had begg'd a ſheet of waſte paper to put betwixt the currant leaf and his hand—As that was plate ſufficient, I bad him lay it upon the table as it was,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:1269300202:133"/>
and as I reſolved to ſtay within all day I ordered him to call upon the <hi>traileur</hi> to beſpeak my dinner, and leave me to breakfaſt by myſelf.</p>
            <p>When I had finiſh'd the butter, I threw the currant leaf out of the window, and was going to do the ſame by the waſte paper—but ſtopping to read a line firſt, and that drawing me on to a ſecond and third—I thought it better worth; ſo I ſhut the window, and drawing a chair up to it, I ſat down to read it.</p>
            <p>It was in the old French of Rabelais's time, and for ought I know might have been wrote by him—it was moreover in a Gothic letter, and that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:1269300202:134"/>
ſo faded and gone off by damps and length of time, it coſt me infinite trouble to make any thing of it—I threw it down; and then wrote a letter to Eugenius—then I took it up again, and embroiled my patience with it afreſh—and then to cure that, I wrote a letter to Eliza.—Still it kept hold of me; and the difficulty of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding it increaſed but the deſire.</p>
            <p>I got my dinner; and after I had enlightened my mind with a bottle of Burgundy, I at it again—and after two or three hours poring upon it, with almoſt as deep attention as ever Gruter or Jacob Spon did upon a nonſenſical inſcription, I thought I
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:1269300202:135"/>
made ſenſe of it; but to make ſure of it, the beſt way, I imagined, was to turn it into Engliſh, and ſee how it would look then—ſo I went on leiſurely, as a trifling man does, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times writing a ſentence—then taking a turn or two—and then looking how the world went, out of the window; ſo that it was nine o'clock at night before I had done it—I then begun and read it as follows.</p>

            <p>—Now as the notary's wife diſputed the point with the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary with too much heat—I wiſh, ſaid the notary, throwing down the parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that there was another notary here only to ſet down and atteſt all this—</p>
            <p>—And what would you do then, Monſieur? ſaid ſhe, riſing haſtily up—the notary's wife was a little fume of a woman, and the notary thought it
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:1269300202:137"/>
well to avoid a hurricane by a mild reply—I would go, anſwer'd he, to bed.—You may go to the devil, anſwer'd the notary's wife.</p>
            <p>Now there happening to be but one bed in the houſe, the other two rooms being unfurniſh'd, as is the cuſtom at Paris, and the notary not caring to lie in the ſame bed with a woman who had but that moment ſent him pell-mell to the devil, went forth with his hat and cane and ſhort cloak, the night being very windy, and walk'd out ill at eaſe towards the <hi>pont neuf.</hi>

            <p>Of all the bridges which ever were built, the whole world who have

            <p>The worſt fault which divines and the doctors of the Sorbonne can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege againſt it, is, that if there is but a cap-full of wind in or about Paris, 'tis more blaſphemouſly <hi>ſacre Dieu'd</hi> there than in any other aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the whole city—and with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,

            <p>The poor notary, juſt as he was paſſing by the ſentry, inſtinctively clapp'd his cane to the ſide of it, but in raiſing it up the point of his cane catching hold of the loop of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel's hat hoiſted it over the ſpikes of the balluſtrade clear into the Seine—</p>

            </p>
            <p>The ſentry being a gaſcon incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently twirl'd up his whiſkers, and levell'd his harquebuſs.</p>
            <p>Harquebuſſes in thoſe days went off with matches; and an old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's paper lanthorn at the end of the bridge happening to be blown out, ſhe had borrow'd the ſentry's match to light it—it gave a moment's time for the gaſcon's blood to run cool, and turn the accident better to his advantage—<hi>'Tis an ill wind,</hi> ſaid he, catching off the notary's caſtor, and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:1269300202:141"/>
legitimating the capture with the boatman's adage.</p>
            <p>The poor notary croſs'd the bridge, and paſſing along the rue de Dauphine into the fauxbourgs of St. Germain, lamented himſelf as he walk'd along in this manner:</p>

            <head>PARIS.</head>
            <p>THE man who either diſdains or fears to walk up a dark entry may be an excellent good man, and fit for a hundred things; but he will not do to make a good ſentimental traveller. I count little of the many things I ſee paſs at broad noon day, in large and open ſtreets.—Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſhy, and hates to act before ſpectators; but in ſuch an unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved corner, you ſometimes ſee a ſingle ſhort ſcene of her's worth all the ſentiments of a dozen French plays compounded together—and yet
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:1269300202:154"/>
they are <hi>abſolutely</hi> fine;—and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I have a more brilliant affair upon my hands than common, as they ſuit a preacher juſt as well as a hero, I generally make my ſermon out of 'em—and for the text—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padoſia, Pontus and Aſia, Phrygia and Pamphilia"</q>—is as good as any one in the Bible.</p>
            <p>There is a long dark paſſage iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out from the opera comique into a narrow ſtreet; 'tis trod by a few who humbly wait for a <hi>fiacre</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Hackney-coach.</note>, or wiſh to get off quietly o'foot when the opera is done. At the end of it, towards the theatre, 'tis lighted by a ſmall candle,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:1269300202:155"/>
the light of which is almoſt loſt before you get half-way down, but near the door—'tis more for ornament than uſe: you ſee it as a fix'd ſtar of the leaſt magnitude; it burns—but does little good to the world, that we know of.</p>
            <p>In returning along this paſſage, I diſcern'd, as I approach'd within five or ſix paces of the door, two ladies ſtanding arm in arm, with their backs againſt the wall, waiting, as I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, for a <hi>fiacre</hi>—as they were next the door, I thought they had a prior right; ſo edged myſelf up within a yard or little more of them, and quietly took my ſtand—I was in black, and ſcarce ſeen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:1269300202:156"/>
The lady next me was a tall lean figure of a woman of about thirty-ſix; the other of the ſame ſize and make, of about forty; there was no mark of wife or widow in any one part of either of them—they ſeem'd to be two upright veſtal ſiſters, unſapp'd by careſſes, unbroke in upon by tender ſalutations: I could have wiſh'd to have made them happy—their happineſs was deſtin'd, that night, to come from another quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>A low voice, with a good turn of expreſſion, and ſweet cadence at the end of it, begg'd for a twelve-ſous piece betwixt them, for the love of heaven. I thought it ſingular, that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:1269300202:157"/>
a beggar ſhould fix the quota of an alms—and that the ſum ſhould be twelve times as much as what is uſually given in the dark. They both ſeemed aſtoniſh'd at it as much as myſelf.—Twelve ſous! ſaid one—a twelve-ſous piece! ſaid the other—and made no reply.</p>
            <p>The poor man ſaid, He knew not how to aſk leſs of ladies of their rank; and bow'd down his head to the ground.</p>
            <p>Poo! ſaid they—we have no money.</p>
            <p>The beggar remained ſilent for a moment or two, and renew'd his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:1269300202:158"/>
Do not, my fair young ladies, ſaid he, ſtop your good ears againſt me—Upon my word, honeſt man! ſaid the younger, we have no change—Then God bleſs you, ſaid the poor man, and multiply thoſe joys which you can give to others without change!—I obſerved the elder ſiſter put her hand into her pocket—I'll ſee, ſaid ſhe, if I have a ſous.—A ſous! give twelve, ſaid the ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant; Nature has been bountiful to you, be bountiful to a poor man.</p>
            <p>I would, friend, with all my heart, ſaid the younger, if I had it.</p>

The poor man, as he was not ſtraighten'd for time, had given it here in a larger doſe: 'tis certain he had a way of bringing it into leſs form, for the many ſudden caſes he had to do with in the ſtreets; but how he contrived to correct, ſweeten, concentre, and qualify it—I vex not my ſpirit with the inquiry—it is enough, the beggar gain'd two twelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſous pieces—and they can beſt tell the reſt, who have gain'd much greater matters by it.</p>

            <p>WE get forwards in the world not ſo much by doing ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, as receiving them: you take a withering twig, and put it in the ground; and then you water it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have planted it.</p>
            <p>Monſ. Le Compte de B****, merely becauſe he had done me one kindneſs in the affair of my paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, would go on and do me another, the few days he was at Paris, in making me known to a few people of rank; and they were to preſent me to others, and ſo on.</p>

I had got maſter of my <hi>ſecret,</hi> juſt in time to turn theſe honours to ſome little account; otherwiſe, as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the caſe, I ſhould have din'd or ſupp'd a ſingle time or two round, and then by <hi>tranſlating</hi> French looks and attitudes into plain Engliſh, I ſhould preſently have ſeen, that I had got hold of the <hi>couvert</hi>

            <p>I had the honour of being intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the old Marquis de B****:
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:1269300202:167"/>
in days of yore he had ſignaliz'd himſelf by ſome ſmall feats of chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry in the <hi>Cour d'amour,</hi> and had dreſs'd himſelf out to the idea of tilts and tournaments ever ſince—the Marquis de B**** wiſh'd to have it thought the affair was ſomewhere elſe than in his brain. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"He could like to take a trip to England,"</q> and aſk'd much of the Engliſh ladies. Stay where you are, I beſeech you, Monſ. le Marquiſe, ſaid I—Les Meſſrs. Angloiſe can ſcarce get a kind look from them as it is.—The Marquis invited me to ſupper.</p>
            <p>Monſ. P**** the farmer-general was juſt as inquiſitive about our taxes.—They were very conſiderable,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:1269300202:168"/>
he heard—If we knew but how to collect them, ſaid I, making him a low bow.</p>
            <p>I could never have been invited to Monſ. P****'s concerts upon any other terms.</p>
            <p>I had been miſrepreſented to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame de Q*** as an <hi>eſprit</hi>—Madam de Q*** was an <hi>eſprit</hi> her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; ſhe burnt with impatience to ſee me, and hear me talk. I had not taken my ſeat, before I ſaw ſhe did not care a ſous whether I had any wit or no—I was let in, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced ſhe had.—I call heaven to witneſs I never once open'd the door of my lips.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:1269300202:169"/>
Madame de Q*** vow'd to every creature ſhe met, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"She had never had a more improving conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with a man in her life."</q>
            </p>
            <p>There are three epochas in the empire of a French-woman—She is coquette—then deiſt—then <hi>devôte:</hi> the empire during theſe is never loſt—ſhe only changes her ſubjects: when thirty-five years and more have unpeopled her dominions of the ſlaves of love, ſhe re-peoples it with ſlaves of infidelity—and then with the ſlaves of the Church.</p>
            <p>Madame de V*** was vibrating betwixt the firſt of theſe epochas: the colour of the roſe was ſhading
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:1269300202:170"/>
faſt away—ſhe ought to have been a deiſt five years before the time I had the honour to pay my firſt viſit.</p>
            <p>She placed me upon the ſame ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha with her, for the ſake of diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the point of religion more cloſely.—In ſhort, Madame de V*** told me ſhe believed nothing.</p>
            <p>I told Madame de V*** it might be her principle; but I was ſure it could not be her intereſt to level the outworks, without which I could not conceive how ſuch a citadel as hers could be defended—that there was not a more dangerous thing in the world, than for a beauty to be a deiſt—that it was a debt I owed my
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:1269300202:171"/>
creed, not to conceal it from her—that I had not been five minutes ſat upon the ſopha beſides her, but I had begun to form deſigns—and what is it, but the ſentiments of religion, and the perſuaſion they had exiſted in her breaſt, which could have check'd them as they roſe up.</p>
            <p>We are not adamant, ſaid I, taking hold of her hand—and there is need of all reſtraints, till age in her own time ſteals in and lays them on us—but, my dear lady, ſaid I, kiſſing her hand—'tis too—too ſoon—</p>
            <p>I declare I had the credit all over Paris of unperverting Madame de V***.—She affirmed to Monſ.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:1269300202:172"/>
D*** and the Abbe M***, that in one half hour I had ſaid more for revealed religion, than all their Ency<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clopedia had ſaid againſt it—I was liſted directly into Madame de V***'s <hi>Coterie</hi>—and ſhe put off the epocha of deiſm for two years.</p>
            <p>I remember it was in this <hi>Coterie,</hi> in the middle of a diſcourſe, in which I was ſhewing the neceſſity of a <hi>firſt cauſe,</hi> that the young Count de Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neant took me by the hand to the furtheſt corner of the room, to tell me my <hi>ſolitaire</hi> was pinn'd too ſtrait about my neck—It ſhould be <hi>plus badinant,</hi> ſaid the Count, looking down upon his own—but a word, Monſ.

            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:1269300202:173"/>
—And from the wiſe, Monſ. Le Compte, replied I, making him a bow—<hi>is enough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Count de Faineant embraced me with more ardour than ever I was embraced by mortal man.</p>
            <p>For three weeks together, I was of every man's opinion I met.—<hi>Pardi! ce Monſ.

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:1269300202:174"/>
every ſentiment of honour revolted againſt it—the higher I got, the more was I forced upon my <hi>beggarly ſyſtem</hi>—the better the <hi>Coterie</hi>—the more children of Art—I languiſh'd for thoſe of Nature: and one night, after a moſt vile proſtitution of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to half a dozen different people, I grew ſick—went to bed—order'd La Fleur to get me horſes in the morning to ſet out for Italy.</p>

            <p>I NEVER felt what the diſtreſs of plenty was in any one ſhape till now—to travel it through the Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonnois, the ſweeteſt part of France—in the hey-day of the vintage, when Nature is pouring her abundance into every one's lap, and every eye is lifted up—a journey through each ſtep of which muſic beats time to <hi>Labour,</hi> and all her children are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing as they carry in their cluſters—to paſs through this with my affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions flying out, and kindling at every
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:1269300202:176"/>
group before me—and every one of 'em was pregnant with adventures.</p>
            <p>Juſt heaven!—it would fill up twenty volumes—and alas! I have but a few ſmall pages left of this to croud it into—and half of theſe muſt be taken up with the poor Maria my friend, Mr. Shandy, met with near Moulines.</p>
            <p>The ſtory he had told of that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd maid affect'd me not a little in the reading; but when I got with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the neighbouthood where ſhe lived, it returned ſo ſtrong into my mind, that I could not reſiſt an impulſe which prompted me to go half a league out of the road to the village
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:1269300202:177"/>
where her parents dwelt to enquire after her.</p>
            <p>'Tis going, I own, like the Knight of the Woeful Countenance, in queſt of melancholy adventures—but I know not how it is, but I am never ſo perfectly conſcious of the exiſtence of a ſoul within me, as when I am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in them.</p>
            <p>The old mother came to the door, her looks told me the ſtory before ſhe open'd her mouth—She had loſt her huſband; he had died, ſhe ſaid, of anguiſh, for the loſs of Maria's ſenſes about a month before.—She had feared at firſt, ſhe added, that it would have plunder'd her poor girl
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:1269300202:178"/>
of what little underſtanding was left—but, on the contrary, it had brought her more to herſelf—ſtill ſhe could not reſt—her poor daughter, ſhe ſaid, crying, was wandering ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where about the road—</p>
            <p>—Why does my pulſe beat languid as I write this? and what made La Fleur, whoſe heart ſeem'd only to be tuned to joy, to paſs the back of his hand twice acroſs his eyes, as the woman ſtood and told it? I beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd to the poſtilion to turn back into the road.</p>
            <p>When we had got within half a league of Moulines, at a little opening in the road leading to a thicket, I
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:1269300202:179"/>
diſcovered poor Maria ſitting under a poplar—ſhe was ſitting with her elbow in her lap, and her head lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on one ſide within her hand—a ſmall brook ran at the foot of the tree.</p>
            <p>I bid the poſtilion go on with the chaiſe to Moulines—and La Fleur to beſpeak my ſupper—and that I would walk after him.</p>
            <p>She was dreſs'd in white, and much as my friend deſcribed her, except that her hair hung looſe, which before was twiſted within a ſilk net.—She had, ſuperadded likewiſe to her jacket, a pale green ribband which fell acroſs her ſhoulder to the waiſt; at the end
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:1269300202:180"/>
of which hung her pipe.—Her goat had been as faithleſs as her lover; and ſhe had got a little dog in lieu of him, which ſhe had kept tied by a ſtring to her girdle; as I look'd at her dog, ſhe drew him towards her with the ſtring.—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Thou ſhalt not leave me, Sylvio,"</q> ſaid ſhe. I look'd in Maria's eyes, and ſaw ſhe was thinking more of her father than of her lover or her little goat; for as ſhe utter'd them the tears trickled down her cheeks.</p>
            <p>I ſat down cloſe by her; and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria let me wipe them away as they fell with my handkerchief.—I then ſleep'd it in my own—and then in hers—and then in mine—and then

I wip'd hers again—and as I did it, I felt ſuch undeſcribable emotions within me, as I am ſure could not be accounted for from any combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of matter and motion.</p>
            <p>I am poſitive I have a ſoul; nor can all the books with which mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts have peſter'd the world ever convince me of the contrary.</p>

            <p>WHEN Maria had come a little to herſelf, I aſk'd her if ſhe remember'd a pale thin perſon of a man who had ſat down betwixt her and her goat about two years before? She ſaid, ſhe was unſettled much at that time, but remember'd it upon two accounts—that ill as ſhe was ſhe ſaw the perſon pitied her; and next, that her goat had ſtolen his handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and ſhe had beat him for the theft—ſhe had waſh'd it, ſhe ſaid, in the brook, and kept it ever ſince in her pocket to reſtore it to him in caſe ſhe ſhould ever ſee him again, which,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:1269300202:183"/>
ſhe added, he had half promiſed her. As ſhe told me this, ſhe took the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief out of her pocket to let me ſee it; ſhe had folded it up neatly in a couple of vine leaves, tied round with a tendril—on opening it, I ſaw an S mark'd in one of the corners.</p>
            <p>She had ſince that, ſhe told me, ſtray'd as far as Rome, and walk'd round St Peter's once—and return'd back—that ſhe found her way alone acroſs the Apennines—had travell'd over all Lombardy without money—and through the flinty roads of Savoy without ſhoes—how ſhe had borne it, and how ſhe had got ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, ſhe could not tell—but <hi>God</hi>

               <hi>tempers the wind,</hi> ſaid Maria, to the ſhorn lamb.</p>
            <p>Shorn indeed! and to the quick, ſaid I; and waſt thou in my own land, where I have a cottage, I would take thee to it and ſhelter thee: thou ſhouldſt eat of my own bread, and drink of my own cup—I would be kind to thy Sylvio—in all thy weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and wanderings I would ſeek after thee and bring thee back—when the ſun went down I would ſay my prayers, and when I had done thou ſhouldſt play thy evening ſong upon thy pipe, nor would the incenſe of my ſacrifice be worſe accepted for entering heaven along with that of a broken heart.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:1269300202:185"/>
Nature melted within me, as I utter'd this; and Maria obſerving, as I took out my handkerchief, that it was ſteep'd to much already to be of uſe, would needs go waſh it in the ſtream.—And where will you dry it, Maria? ſaid I—I'll dry it in my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, ſaid ſhe—'twill do me good.</p>
            <p>And is your heart ſtill ſo warm, Maria? ſaid I.</p>
            <p>I touch'd upon the ſtring on which hung all her ſorrows—ſhe look'd with wiſtful diſorder for ſome time in my face; and then, without ſaying any thing, took her pipe, and play'd her ſervice to the Virgin—The ſtring I had touch'd ceaſed to vibrate—in a

            <p>A SHOE coming looſe from the fore-foot of the thill-horſe, at the beginning of the aſcent of mount Taurira, the poſtilion diſmounted, twiſted the ſhoe off, and put it in his pocket; as the aſcent was of five or ſix miles, and that horſe our main dependence, I made a point of having the ſhoe faſten'd on again, as well as we could; but the poſtilion had thrown away the nails, and the ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in the chaiſe-box, being of no great uſe without them, I ſubmitted to go on.</p>

He had not mounted half a mile higher, when coming to a flinty piece of road, the poor devil loſt a ſecond ſhoe, and from off his other fore-foot; I then got out of the chaiſe in good earneſt; and ſeeing a houſe about a quarter of a mile to the left-hand, with a great deal to do, I prevailed upon the poſtilion to turn up to it. The look of the houſe, and of every thing about it, as we drew nearer, ſoon reconciled me to the diſaſter.—It was a little farm-houſe ſurrounded with about twenty acres of vineyard, about as much corn—and cloſe to the houſe, on one ſide, was a <hi>potagerie</hi> of an acre and a half, full of every thing
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:1269300202:195"/>
which could make plenty in a French peaſant's houſe—and on the other ſide was a little wood which furniſhed wherewithal to dreſs it. It was about eight in the evening when I got to the houſe—ſo I left the poſtilion to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage his point as he could—and for mine, I walk'd directly into the houſe.</p>
            <p>The family conſiſted of an old grey-headed man and his wife, with five or ſix ſons and ſons-in-law and their ſeveral wives, and a joyous ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy out of 'em.</p>
            <p>They were all ſitting down to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to their lentil-ſoup; a large wheaten loaf was in the middle of the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:1269300202:196"/>
table; and a flaggon of wine at each end of it promiſed joy thro' the ſtages of the repaſt—'twas a feaſt of love.</p>
            <p>The old man roſe up to meet me, and with a reſpectful cordiality would have me ſit down at the table; my heart was ſat down the moment I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd the room; ſo I ſat down at once like a ſon of the family; and to inveſt myſelf in the character as ſpeedily as I could, I inſtantly borrowed the old man's knife, and taking up the loaf cut myſelf a hearty luncheon; and as I did it I ſaw a teſtimony in every eye, not only of an honeſt welcome, but of a welcome mix'd with thanks that I had not ſeem'd to doubt it.</p>

               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:1269300202:199"/>
The old man had ſome fifty years ago been no mean performer upon the vielle—and at the age he was then of, touch'd it well enough for the purpoſe. His wife ſung now-and-then a little to the tune—then inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted—and joined her old man again as their children and grand-children danced before them.</p>
            <p>It was not till the middle of the ſecond dance, when, from ſome pauſes in the movement wherein they all ſeemed to look up, I fancied I could diſtinguiſh an elevation of ſpirit dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that which is the cauſe or the effect of ſimple jollity.—In a word, I thought I beheld <hi>Religion</hi> mixing in the dance—but as I had never ſeen
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:1269300202:200"/>
her ſo engaged, I ſhould have look'd upon it now, as one of the illuſions of an imagination which is eternally miſleading me, had not the old man, as ſoon as the dance ended, ſaid, that this was their conſtant way; and that all his life long he had made it a rule, after ſupper was over, to call out his family to dance and rejoice; believing, he ſaid, that a chearful and contented mind was the beſt ſort of thanks to heaven that an illiterate peaſant could pay—</p>
            <p>—Or a learned prelate either, ſaid I.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF DELICACY.</head>
            <p>WHEN you have gained the top of mount Taurira, you run preſently down to Lyons—adieu then to all rapid movements! 'Tis a journey of caution; and it fares better with ſentiments, not to be in a hurry with them; ſo I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with a Voiturin to take his time with a couple of mules, and convey me in my own chaiſe ſafe to Turin through Savoy.</p>
            <p>Poor, patient, quiet, honeſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple! fear not; your poverty, the treaſury of your ſimple virtues, will
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:1269300202:202"/>
not be envied you by the world, nor will your vallies be invaded by it.—Nature! in the midſt of thy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, thou art ſtill friendly to the ſcantineſs thou haſt created—with all thy great works about thee, little haſt thou left to give, either to the ſcithe or to the ſickle—but to that little, thou granteſt ſafety and protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and ſweet are the dwellings which ſtand ſo ſhelter'd.</p>
            <p>Let the way-worn traveller vent his complaints upon the ſudden turns and dangers of your roads—your rocks—your precipices—the difficulties of getting up—the horrors of getting down—mountains impracticable—and cataracts, which roll down great
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:1269300202:203"/>
ſtones from their ſummits, and block his up road.—The peaſants had been all day at work in removing a fragment of this kind between St. Michael and Madane; and by the time my Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turin got to the place, it wanted full two hours of compleating be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a paſſage could any how be gain'd: there was nothing but to wait with patience—'twas a wet and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous night; ſo that by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, and that together, the Voiturin found himſelf obliged to take up five miles ſhort of his ſtage at a little decent kind of an inn by the road ſide.</p>
            <p>I forthwith took poſſeſſion of my bed-chamber—got a good fire—or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:1269300202:204"/>
ſupper; and was thanking heaven it was no worſe—when a voiture arrived with a lady in it and her ſervant-maid.</p>
            <p>As there was no other bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the houſe, the hoſteſs, without much nicety, led them into mine, telling them, as ſhe uſher'd them in, that there was no body in it but an Engliſh gentleman—that there were two good beds, in it and a cloſet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the room which held another—the accent in which ſhe ſpoke of this third bed did not ſay much for it—however, ſhe ſaid, there were three beds, and but three people—and ſhe durſt ſay, the gentleman would do
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:1269300202:205"/>
any thing to accommodate matters.—I left not the lady a moment to make a conjecture about it—ſo inſtantly made a declaration I would do any thing in my power.</p>
            <p>As this did not amount to an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute ſurrender of my bed-chamber, I ſtill felt myſelf ſo much the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor, as to have a right to do the honours of it—ſo I deſired the lady to ſit down—preſſed her into the warmeſt ſeat—call'd for more wood—deſired the hoſteſs to enlarge the plan of the ſupper, and to favour us with the very beſt wine.</p>
            <p>The lady had ſcarce warm'd her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf five minutes at the fire, before
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:1269300202:206"/>
ſhe began to turn her head back, and give alook at the beds; and the oftener ſhe caſt her eyes that way, the more they return'd perplex'd—I felt for her—and for myſelf; for in a few minutes, what by her looks, and the caſe itſelf, I found my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as much embarraſſed as it was poſſible the lady could be herſelf.</p>
            <p>That the beds we were to lay in were in one and the ſame room, was enough ſimply by itſelf to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited all this—but the poſition of them, for they ſtood parallel, and ſo very cloſe to each other as only to allow ſpace for a ſmall wicker chair betwixt them, render'd the affair
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:1269300202:207"/>
ſtill more oppreſſive to us—they were fixed up moreover near the fire, and the projection of the chimney on one ſide, and a large beam which croſs'd the room on the other, form'd a kind of receſs for them that was no way favourable to the nicety of our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations—if any thing could have added to it, it was, that the two beds were both of 'em ſo very ſmall, as to cut us off from every idea of the lady and the maid lying together; which in either of them, could it have been feaſible, my lying beſides them, tho' a thing not to be wiſh'd, yet there was nothing in it ſo terrible which the imagination might not have paſs'd over without torment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:1269300202:208"/>
As for the little room within, it offer'd little or no conſolation to us; 'twas a damp cold cloſet, with a half diſmantled window ſhutter, and with a window which had neither glaſs or oil paper in it to keep out the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt of the night. I did not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſtifle my cough when the lady gave a peep into it; ſo it reduced the caſe in courſe to this alternative—that the lady ſhould ſacrifice her health to her feelings, and take up with the cloſet herſelf, and abandon the bed next mine to her maid—or that the girl ſhould take the cloſet, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The lady was a Piedmonteſe of about thirty, with a glow of health
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:1269300202:209"/>
in her cheeks.—The maid was a Lyonoiſe of twenty, and as briſk and lively a French girl as ever moved.—There were difficulties every way—and the obſtacle of the ſtone in the road, which brought us into the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, great as it appeared whilſt the peaſants were removing it, was but a pebble to what lay in our ways now—I have only to add, that it did not leſſen the weight which hung upon our ſpirits, that we were both too delicate to communicate what we felt to each other upon the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
            <p>We ſat down to ſupper; and had we not had more generous wine to it than a little inn in Savoy could have

furniſh'd, our tongues had been tied up, till neceſſity herſelf had ſet them at liberty—but the lady having a few bottles of Burgundy in her voiture ſent down her Fille de Chambre for a couple of them; ſo that by the time ſupper was over, and we were left alone, we felt ourſelves inſpired with a ſtrength of mind ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to talk, at leaſt, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve upon our ſituation. We turn'd it every way, and debated and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered it in all kind of lights in the courſe of a two hours negociation; at the end of which the articles were ſettled finally betwixt us, and ſtipulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for in form and manner of a treaty of peace—and I believe with as much
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:1269300202:213"/>
religion and good faith on both ſides, as in any treaty which as yet had the honour of being handed down to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity.</p>
            <p>They were as follows:</p>
            <p>Firſt. As the right of the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber is in Monſieur—and he thinking the bed next to the fire to be the warmeſt, he inſiſts upon the conceſſion on the lady's ſide of tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up with it.</p>
            <p>Granted, on the part of Madame; with a proviſo, That as the curtains of that bed are of a flimſy tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent cotton, and appear likewiſe too ſcanty to draw cloſe, that the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:1269300202:214"/>
Fille de Chambre, ſhall faſten up the opening, either by corking pins, or needle and thread, in ſuch manner as ſhall be deemed a ſufficient barrier on the ſide of Monſieur.</p>
            <p>2dly. It is required on the part of Madame, that Monſieur ſhall lay the whole night through in his robe de chambre.</p>
            <p>Rejected: inaſmuch Monſieur is not worth a robe de chambre; he having nothing in his portmanteau but ſix ſhirts and a black ſilk pair of breeches.</p>
            <p>The mentioning the ſilk pair of breeches made an entire change of the article—for the breeches were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:1269300202:215"/>
as an equivalent for the robe de chambre, and ſo it was ſtipulated and agreed upon that I ſhould lay in my black ſilk breeches all night.</p>
            <p>3dly. It was inſiſted upon, and ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated for by the lady, that after Monſieur was got to bed, and the candle and fire extinguiſhed, that Monſieur ſhould not ſpeak one ſingle word the whole night.</p>
            <p>Granted; provided Monſieur's ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his prayers might not be deem'd an infraction of the treaty.</p>
            <p>There was but one point forgot in this treaty, and that was the manner in which the lady and myſelf ſhould
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:1269300202:216"/>
be obliged to undreſs and get to bed—there was but one way of doing it, and that I leave to the reader to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe; proteſting as I do it, that if it is not the moſt delicate in nature, 'tis the fault of his own imagination—againſt which this is not my firſt complaint.</p>
            <p>Now when we were got to bed, whether it was the novelty of the ſituation, or what it was, I know not; but ſo it was, I could not ſhut my eyes; I tried this ſide and that, and turn'd and turn'd again, till a full hour after midnight; when Nature and patience both wearing out—O my God! ſaid I—</p>
            <p>—You have broke the treaty, Monſieur, ſaid the lady, who had no
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:1269300202:217"/>
more ſlept than myſelf.—I begg'd a thouſand pardons—but inſiſted it was no more than en ejaculation—ſhe main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd 'twas an entire infraction of the treaty—I maintain'd it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for in the clauſe of the third article.</p>
            <p>The lady would by no means give up her point, tho' ſhe weakened her barrier by it; for in the warmth of the diſpute, I could hear two or three corking pins fall out of the curtain to the ground.</p>
            <p>Upon my word and honour, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, ſaid I—ſtretching my arm out of bed, by way aſſeveration—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:1269300202:218"/>
—(I was going to have added, that I would not have treſpaſs'd againſt the remoteſt idea of decorum for the world)—</p>
            <p>—But the Fille de Chambre hearing there were words between us, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that hoſtilities would enſue in courſe, had crept ſilently out of her clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, and it being totally dark, had ſtolen ſo cloſe to our beds, that ſhe had got herſelf into the narrow paſſage which ſeparated them, and had advanc'd ſo far up as to be in a line betwixt her miſtreſs and me—</p>
            <p>So that when I ſtretch'd out my hand, I caught hold of the Fille de Chambre's</p>
