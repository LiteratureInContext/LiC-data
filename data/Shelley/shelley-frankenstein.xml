                        xml:id="darwinA">Darwin</ref></rs></persName>, and some of the physiological
               writers of <placeName type="tgn" key="7000084">Germany</placeName>, as not of
               impossible occurrence. I shall not be supposed as according the remotest degree of
               serious faith to such an imagination; yet, in assuming it as the basis of a work of
               fancy, I have not considered myself as merely weaving a series of supernatural
               terrors. The event on <pb n="[viii]" facs="images/viii.jpg"/> which the interest of
               the story depends is exempt from the disadvantages of a mere tale of spectres or
               enchantment. It was recommended by the novelty of the situations which it developes;
               and, however impossible as a physical fact, affords a point of view to the
               imagination for the delineating of human passions more comprehensive and commanding
               than any which the ordinary relations of existing events can yield.</p>
            <p>I have thus endeavoured to preserve the truth of the elementary principles of human
               nature, while I have not scrupled to innovate upon their combinations. <hi

                     circumstance on which my story rests was suggested in casual

               partly as an expedient for exercising any untried resources of mind. Other motives
               were mingled with these as the work <pb n="[x - page breaks after 'pro-']"
                  facs="images/x.jpg"/> proceeded. I am by no means indifferent to the manner in
               which whatever moral tendencies exist in the sentiments or characters it contains
               shall affect the reader; yet my chief concern in this respect has been limited to the
               avoiding the enervating effects of the novels of the present day, and to the
               exhibition of the amiableness of domestic affection, and the excellence of universal
               virtue. The opinions which naturally spring from the character and situation of the
               hero are by no means to be conceived as existing always in my own conviction; nor is
               any inference justly to be drawn from the following pages as prejudicing any
               philosophical doctrine of whatever kind.</p>
            <pb n="[xi]" facs="images/xi.jpg"/>
            <p>It is a subject also of additional interest to the author that this story was begun
               in the majestic region where the scene is principally laid, and in society which
               cannot cease to be regretted. I passed the summer of <date>1816</date> in the
               environs of <placeName type="tgn" key="7003746">Geneva</placeName>. The season was
               cold and rainy, and in the evenings we crowded around a blazing wood fire, and
               occasionally amused ourselves with some German stories of ghosts, which happened to
               fall into our hands. These tales excited in us a playful desire of imitation. Two
               other friends (a tale from the pen of one of whom would be far more acceptable to the
               public than any thing I can ever hope to produce) and <pb n="[xii]"
                  facs="images/xii.jpg"/> myself agreed to write each a story founded on some
               supernatural occurrence.</p>
            <p>The weather, however, suddenly became serene; and my two friends left me on a journey
               among the <placeName type="tgn" key="7007746">Alps</placeName>, and lost, in the
               magnificent scenes which they present, all memory of their ghostly visions. The
               following tale is the only one which has been completed.</p>

               <p>YOU will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement of an
                  enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings. I arrived here
                  yesterday; and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare, and
                  increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking.</p>
               <p>I am already far north of <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName>;
                  and as I walk in the streets of <pb n="[2 - page breaks after 'Peters-']"
                     facs="images/2.jpg"/>
                  <placeName type="tgn" key="7010273">Petersburgh</placeName>, I feel a cold
                  northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves, and fills me with
                  delight. Do you understand this feeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the
                  regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.
                  Inspirited by this wind of promise, my day dreams become more fervent and vivid. I
                  try in vain to be persuaded that <rs content="#arctic_exploration"><ref
                        target="#arctic_exploration" xml:id="arctic_explorationA">the pole is the
                        seat of frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as
                        the region of beauty and delight</ref></rs>. There,
                     <persName>Margaret</persName>, the sun is for ever visible; its broad disk just
                  skirting the horizon, and diffusing a perpetual splendour. There—for with your
                  leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and
                  frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land
                  surpassing in wonders <pb n="[3]" facs="images/3.jpg"/> and in beauty every region
                  hitherto discovered on the habitable globe. Its productions and features may be
                  without example, as the phænomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those
                  undiscovered solitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I
                  may there discover <rs content="#electromagnetism"><ref target="#electromagnetism"
                        xml:id="electromagnetismA">the wondrous power which attracts the
                        needle</ref></rs>; and may regulate a thousand celestial observations, that
                  require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for
                  ever. I shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world
                  never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of
                  man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of
                  danger or death, and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a
                  child feels when he embarks <pb n="[4]" facs="images/4.jpg"/> in a little boat,
                  with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his native river. But,
                  supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the inestimable
                  benefit which I shall confer on all mankind to the last generation, by discovering
                  a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many
                  months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at
                  all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.</p>
               <p>These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my letter, and I
                  feel my heart glow with an <rs content="#enthusiasm"><ref target="#enthusiasm"
                        xml:id="enthusiasmA">enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven</ref></rs>; for
                  nothing contributes so much to tranquillize the mind as a steady purpose,—a point
                  on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye. This expedition has been the
                  favourite dream of my <pb n="[5]" facs="images/5.jpg"/> early years. I have read
                  with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the
                  prospect of arriving at the <placeName type="tgn" key="7029367">North Pacific
                     Ocean</placeName> through the seas which surround the pole. You may remember
                  that <rs content="#history_voyages"><ref target="#history_voyages"
                        xml:id="history_voyagesA">a history of all the voyages made for purposes of
                        discovery</ref></rs> composed the whole of our good uncle
                     <persName>Thomas</persName>'s library. My education was neglected, yet I was
                  passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study day and night, and my
                  familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt, as a child, on
                  learning that my father's dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to
                  embark in a sea-faring life.</p>
               <p>These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets whose
                  effusions entranced my soul, and lifted it to heaven. I also became a poet, <pb
                     n="[6]" facs="images/6.jpg"/> and for one year lived in a Paradise of my own
                  creation; I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the
                  names of <persName type="lccn" key="n78095639"><rs content="#homer"><ref
                           target="#homer" xml:id="homerA">Homer</ref></rs></persName> and <persName
                     type="lccn" key="n78095332">Shakespeare</persName> are consecrated. You are well acquainted
                  with my failure, and how heavily I bore the disappointment. But just at that time
                  I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my thoughts were turned into the channel
                  of their earlier bent.</p>
               <p>Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I can, even now,
                  remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great enterprise. I
                  commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I accompanied the whale-fishers on
                  several expeditions to the <placeName type="tgn" key="7015931">North
                     Sea</placeName>; I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep;
                  I often worked harder than the common sailors during the day, and devoted my <pb
                     n="[7]" facs="images/7.jpg"/> nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of
                  medicine, and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer
                  might derive the greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as an
                  under-mate in a <placeName type="tgn" key="7024573">Greenland</placeName> whaler,
                  and acquitted myself to admiration. I must own I felt a little proud, when my
                  captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel, and entreated me to remain
                  with the greatest earnestness; so valuable did he consider my services.</p>
               <p>And now, dear <persName>Margaret</persName>, do I not deserve to accomplish some
                  great purpose? My life might have been passed in ease and luxury; but I preferred
                  glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging
                  voice would answer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is firm; but
                  my hopes fluctuate, <pb n="[8]" facs="images/8.jpg"/> and my spirits are often
                  depressed. I am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies
                  of which will demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits
                  of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when their's are failing.</p>
               <p>This is the most favourable period for travelling in <placeName type="tgn"
                     key="7002435">Russia</placeName>. They fly quickly over the snow in their
                  sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in my opinion, far more agreeable than that
                  of an English stage-coach. The cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs,
                  a dress which I have already adopted; for there is a great difference between
                  walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise
                  prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins. I have no ambition to
                  lose my life on the post-road between <placeName type="tgn" key="7010273">St.
                     Petersburgh</placeName> and <placeName type="tgn" key="7011546"
                     >Archangel</placeName>.</p>
               <pb n="[9]" facs="images/9.jpg"/>
               <p>I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my intention
                  is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the insurance for the
                  owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary among those who are
                  accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to sail until the month of
                     <date>June</date>: and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how can I answer
                  this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years, will pass before
                  you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon, or never.</p>
               <p>Farewell, my dear, excellent <persName>Margaret</persName>. Heaven shower down
                  blessings on you, and save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for
                  all your love and kindness.</p>

               <p>HOW slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow! yet a
                  second step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a vessel, and am occupied
                  in collecting my sailors; those whom I have already engaged appear to be men on
                  whom I can depend, and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage.</p>
               <p>But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy; and the absence
                  of the object of which I <pb n="[11]" facs="images/11.jpg"/> now feel as a most
                  severe evil. I have no friend, <persName>Margaret</persName>: when I am glowing
                  with the <rs content="#enthusiasm">enthusiasm</rs> of success, there will be none
                  to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no one will endeavour
                  to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but
                  that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling. I desire the company of a
                  man who could sympathize with me; whose eyes would reply to mine. You may deem me
                  romantic, my dear sister, but I bitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one
                  near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a
                  capacious mind, whose tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How
                  would such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in
                  execution, and too impatient of <pb n="[12 - page breaks after 'difficul-']"
                     facs="images/12.jpg"/> difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me that
                  I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild on a
                  common, and read nothing but our uncle <persName>Thomas</persName>'s books of
                  voyages. At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own
                  country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most
                  important benefits from such a conviction, that I perceived the necessity of
                  becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native country. Now I am
                  twenty-eight, and am in reality more illiterate than many school-boys of fifteen.
                  It is true that I have thought more, and that my day dreams are more extended and
                  magnificent; but they want (as the painters call it) keeping; and I greatly need a
                  friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as <rs content="#romanticism"
                        ><ref target="#romanticism" xml:id="romanticismA">romantic</ref></rs>, and
                  affection <pb n="[13]" facs="images/13.jpg"/> enough for me to endeavour to
                  regulate my mind.</p>
               <p>Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the wide
                  ocean, nor even here in <placeName type="tgn" key="7011546">Archangel</placeName>,
                  among merchants and seamen. Yet some feelings, unallied to the dross of human
                  nature, beat even in these rugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of
                  wonderful courage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory. He is an
                  Englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices, unsoftened
                  by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity. I first became
                  acquainted with him on board a whale vessel: finding that he was unemployed in
                  this city, I easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise.</p>
               <p>The master is a person of an excellent disposition, and is remarkable in <pb
                     n="[14]" facs="images/14.jpg"/> the ship for his gentleness, and the mildness
                  of his discipline. He is, indeed, of so amiable a nature, that he will not hunt (a
                  favourite, and almost the only amusement here), because he cannot endure to spill
                  blood. He is, moreover, heroically generous. Some years ago he loved a young
                  Russian lady, of moderate fortune; and having amassed a considerable sum in
                  prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw his mistress
                  once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and, throwing
                  herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same time that
                  she loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father would never consent
                  to the union. My generous friend reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of
                  the name of her lover instantly abandoned his pursuit. He had <pb n="[15]"
                     facs="images/15.jpg"/> already bought a farm with his money, on which he had
                  designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he bestowed the whole on his
                  rival, together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock, and then
                  himself solicited the young woman's father to consent to her marriage with her
                  lover. But the old man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my
                  friend; who, when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor
                  returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her
                  inclinations. <said>"What a noble fellow!"</said> you will exclaim. He is so; but
                  then he has passed all his life on board a vessel, and has scarcely an idea beyond
                  the rope and the shroud.</p>
               <p>But do not suppose that, because I complain a little, or because I can conceive a
                  consolation for my toils which I <pb n="[16]" facs="images/16.jpg"/> may never
                  know, that I am wavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate; and my
                  voyage is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. The
                  winter has been dreadfully severe; but the spring promises well, and it is
                  considered as a remarkably early season; so that, perhaps, I may sail sooner than
                  I expected. I shall do nothing rashly; you know me sufficiently to confide in my
                  prudence and considerateness whenever the safety of others is committed to my
                  care.</p>
               <p>I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking. It
                  is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation, half
                  pleasurable and half fearful, with which I am preparing to depart. I am going to
                  unexplored regions, to <quote>"the land of mist and <pb n="[17]"
                        facs="images/17.jpg"/> snow;"</quote> but <rs content="#rime1"><ref

                  therefore do not be alarmed for my safety.</p>
               <p>Shall I meet you again, after having traversed immense seas, and returned by
                     <placeName type="tgn" key="7002445">the most southern cape of
                     Africa</placeName> or <placeName type="tgn" key="8698314">America</placeName>?
                  I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to look on the reverse of the
                  picture. Continue to write to me by every opportunity; I may receive your letters
                  (though the chance is very doubtful) on some occasions when I need them most to
                  support my spirits. I love you very tenderly. Remember me with affection, should

               </opener>

               <p>I WRITE a few lines in haste, to say that I am safe, and well advanced on my
                  voyage. This letter will reach <placeName type="tgn" key="7002445"
                     >England</placeName> by a merchant-man now on its homeward voyage from
                     <placeName type="tgn" key="7011546">Archangel</placeName>; more fortunate than
                  I, who may not see my native land, perhaps, for many years. I am, however, in good
                  spirits: my men are bold, and apparently firm of purpose; nor do the floating
                  sheets of ice that continually pass us, <pb n="[19 - page breaks after 'indi-']"
                     facs="images/19.jpg"/> indicating the dangers of the region towards which we
                  are advancing, appear to dismay them. We have already reached a very high
                  latitude; but it is the height of summer, and although not so warm as in
                     <placeName type="tgn" key="7002445">England</placeName>, the southern gales,
                  which blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire to attain,
                  breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not expected.</p>
               <p>No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a letter. One
                  or two stiff gales, and the breaking of a mast, are accidents which experienced
                  navigators scarcely remember to record; and I shall be well content, if nothing
                  worse happen to us during our voyage.</p>
               <p>Adieu, my dear <persName>Margaret</persName>. Be assured, that for my own sake, as
                  well as your's, I will not rashly encounter <pb
                     n="[20 - page breaks after 'dan-']" facs="images/20.jpg"/> danger. I will be
                  cool, persevering, and prudent.</p>
               <p>Remember me to all my English friends.</p>

                  <placeName type="tgn" key="7002445">ENGLAND</placeName>. <dateline>August 5th,
                     17--.</dateline>
               </opener>

               <p>So strange an accident has happened to us, that I cannot forbear recording it,
                  although it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come
                  into your possession.</p>
               <p>Last <date>Monday (July 31st)</date>, we were nearly surrounded by ice, which
                  closed in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the searoom in which she
                  floated. Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we were compassed
                  round by a very thick fog. We accordingly lay to, hoping that some <pb n="[22]"
                     facs="images/22.jpg"/> change would take place in the atmosphere and
                  weather.</p>
               <p>About two o'clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out in every
                  direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to have no end. Some of
                  my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts,
                  when a strange sight suddenly attracted our attention, and diverted our solicitude
                  from our own situation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn
                  by dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile: a being which
                  had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature, sat in the sledge, and
                  guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our
                  telescopes, until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the ice.</p>
               <pb n="[23]" facs="images/23.jpg"/>
               <p>This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed, many
                  hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not,
                  in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by ice, it was
                  impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the greatest
                  attention.</p>
               <p>About two hours after this occurrence, we heard the ground sea; and before night
                  the ice broke, and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the morning, fearing
                  to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which float about after the
                  breaking up of the ice. I profited of this time to rest for a few hours.</p>
               <p>In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon the deck, and found
                  all the sailors busy on one side <pb n="[24]" facs="images/24.jpg"/> of the
                  vessel, apparently talking to some one in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like
                  that we had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night, on a large
                  fragment of ice. Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human being within
                  it, whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel. He was not, as the other
                  traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island, but an
                  European. When I appeared on deck, the master said, <said>"Here is our captain,
                     and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea."</said></p>
               <p>On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a foreign
                  accent. <said>"Before I come on board your vessel,"</said> said he, <said>"will
                     you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?"</said></p>
               <p>You may conceive my astonishment <pb n="[25]" facs="images/25.jpg"/> on hearing
                  such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction, and to
                  whom I should have supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he
                  would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. I
                  replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the <placeName
                     type="tgn" key="1112230">northern pole</placeName>.</p>
               <p>Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied, and consented to come on board. Good God!
                     <persName>Margaret</persName>, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for
                  his safety, your surprise would have been boundless. His limbs were nearly frozen,
                  and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering. I never saw a man in
                  so wretched a condition. We attempted to carry him into the cabin; but as soon as
                  he had quitted the fresh air, he fainted. We accordingly brought him back to the
                  deck, and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy, and forcing him to
                  swallow a small quantity. As soon as he shewed signs of life, we wrapped him up in
                  blankets, and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen-stove. By slow degrees he
                  recovered, and ate a little soup, which restored him wonderfully.</p>
               <p>Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak; and I often feared
                  that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When he had in some measure
                  recovered, I removed him to my own cabin, and attended on him as much as my duty
                  would permit. I never saw a more interesting creature: his eyes have generally an
                  expression of wildness, and even madness; but there are moments when, if any-one
                  performs an act of kindness <pb n="[27]" facs="images/27.jpg"/> towards him, or
                  does him any the most trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it
                  were, with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he
                  is generally melancholy and despairing; and sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if
                  impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.</p>
               <p>When my guest was a little recovered, I had great trouble to keep off the men, who
                  wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow him to be tormented
                  by their idle curiosity, in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently
                  depended upon entire repose. Once, however, the lieutenant asked, <said>"Why he
                     had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle?"</said></p>
               <p>His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom; and he <pb
                     n="[28]" facs="images/28.jpg"/> replied, <said>"To seek one who fled from
                     me."</said></p>
               <p><said>"And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?"</said></p>
               <p><said>"Yes."</said></p>
               <p><said>"Then I fancy we have seen him; for, the day before we picked you up, we saw
                     some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice."</said></p>
               <p>This aroused the stranger's attention; and he asked a multitude of questions
                  concerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had pursued. Soon after,
                  when he was alone with me, he said, <said>"I have, doubtless, excited your
                     curiosity, as well as that of these good people; but you are too considerate to
                     make inquiries."</said></p>
               <p><said>"Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble
                     you with any inquisitiveness of mine."</said></p>
               <pb n="[29]" facs="images/29.jpg"/>
               <p><said>"And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have
                     benevolently restored me to life."</said></p>
               <p>Soon after this <said aloud="false">he inquired, if I thought that the breaking up
                     of the ice had destroyed the other sledge?</said>
                  <said aloud="false">I replied, that I could not answer with any degree of
                     certainty; for the ice had not broken until near midnight, and the traveller
                     might have arrived at a place of safety before that time; but of this I could
                     not judge.</said></p>
               <p>From this time the stranger seemed very eager to be upon deck, to watch for the
                  sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in the cabin,
                  for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere. But I have
                  promised that some one should watch for him, and give him instant notice if any
                  new object should appear in sight.</p>
               <pb n="[30]" facs="images/30.jpg"/>
               <p>Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present
                  day. The stranger has gradually improved in health, but is very silent, and
                  appears uneasy when any one except myself enters his cabin. Yet his manners are so
                  conciliating and gentle, that the sailors are all interested in him, although they
                  have had very little communication with him. For my own part, I begin to love him
                  as a brother; and his constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and
                  compassion. He must have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now
                  in wreck so attractive and amiable.</p>
               <p>I said in one of my letters, my dear <persName>Margaret</persName>, that I should
                  find no friend on the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit
                  had been broken by misery, I should have been <pb n="[31]" facs="images/31.jpg"/>
                  happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart.</p>
               <p>I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, should I have
                  any fresh incidents to record.</p>

               <opener><dateline>August 13th, 17--.</dateline></opener>
               <!-- question -->
               <p>My affection for my guest increases every day. He excites at once my admiration
                  and my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so noble a creature destroyed
                  by misery without feeling the most poignant grief? He is so gentle, yet so wise;
                  his mind is so cultivated; and when he speaks, although his words are culled with
                  the choicest art, yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.</p>
               <p>He is now much recovered from his illness, and is continually on the deck,
                  apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although <pb
                     n="[32 - page breaks after 'un-']" facs="images/32.jpg"/> unhappy, he is not so
                  utterly occupied by his own misery, but that he interests himself deeply in the
                  employments of others. He has asked me many questions concerning my design; and I
                  have related my little history frankly to him. He appeared pleased with the
                  confidence, and suggested several alterations in my plan, which I shall find
                  exceedingly useful. There is no pedantry in his manner; but all he does appears to
                  spring solely from the interest he instinctively takes in the welfare of those who
                  surround him. He is often overcome by gloom, and then he sits by himself, and
                  tries to overcome all that is sullen or unsocial in his humour. These paroxysms
                  pass from him like a cloud from before the sun, though his dejection never leaves
                  him. I have endeavoured to win his confidence; and I trust that I have <pb
                     n="[33 - page breaks after 'suc-']" facs="images/33.jpg"/> succeeded. One day I
                  mentioned to him the desire I had always felt of finding a friend who might
                  sympathize with me, and direct me by his counsel. I said, I did not belong to that
                  class of men who are offended by advice. <said>"I am self-educated, and perhaps I
                     hardly rely sufficiently upon my own powers. I wish therefore that my companion
                     should be wiser and more experienced than myself, to confirm and support me;
                     nor have I believed it impossible to find a true friend."</said></p>
               <p><said>"I agree with you,"</said> replied the stranger, <said>"in believing that
                     friendship is not only a desirable, but a possible acquisition. I once had a
                     friend, the most noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge
                     respecting friendship. You have hope, and the world before you, and have no
                     cause for despair. But I—I have lost <pb n="[34]" facs="images/34.jpg"/> every
                     thing, and cannot begin life anew."</said></p>
               <p>As he said this, his countenance became expressive of a calm settled grief, that
                  touched me to the heart. But he was silent, and presently retired to his
                  cabin.</p>
               <p>Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does the
                  beauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight afforded by these
                  wonderful regions, seems still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth.
                  Such a man has a double existence: he may suffer misery, and be overwhelmed by
                  disappointments; yet when he has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial
                  spirit, that has a halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly
                  ventures.</p>
               <p>Will you laugh at the <rs content="#enthusiasm">enthusiasm</rs> I express
                  concerning this divine <pb n="[35 - page breaks after 'wan-']"
                     facs="images/35.jpg"/> wanderer? If you do, you must have certainly lost that
                  simplicity which was once your characteristic charm. Yet, if you will, smile at
                  the warmth of my expressions, while I find every day new causes for repeating
                  them.</p>
               <p><dateline>August 19th, 17--</dateline>.Yesterday the stranger said to me,
                     <said>"You may easily perceive, Captain <persName>Walton</persName>, that I
                     have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had determined, once, that
                     the memory of these evils should die with me; but you have won me to alter my
                     determination. <rs content="#PL_knowledge">You seek for knowledge and wisdom,
                        as I once did; and I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may
                        not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been.</rs> I do not know that the
                     relation of my misfortunes will be useful to you, yet, if you are inclined, <pb
                        n="[36]" facs="images/36.jpg"/>

                     You will hear of powers and occurrences, such as you have been accustomed to
                     believe impossible: but I do not doubt that my tale conveys in its series
                     internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is
                  composed."</said></p>
               <p>You may easily conceive that I was much gratified by the offered communication;
                  yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his
                  misfortunes. I felt the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative, partly
                  from curiosity, and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate, if it were
                  in my power. I expressed these feelings in my answer.</p>
               <p><said>"I thank you,"</said> he replied, <said>"for <pb n="[37]"
                        facs="images/37.jpg"/> your sympathy, but it is useless; my fate is nearly
                     fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then I shall repose in peace. I
                     understand your feeling,"</said> continued he, perceiving that I wished to
                  interrupt him; <said>"but you are mistaken, my friend, if thus you will allow me
                     to name you; nothing can alter my destiny: listen to my history, and you will
                     perceive how irrevocably it is determined."</said></p>
               <p>He then told me, that he would commence his narrative the next day when I should
                  be at leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I have resolved every
                  night, when I am not engaged, to record, as nearly as possible in his own words,
                  what he has related during the day. If I should be engaged, I will at least make
                  notes. This manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure: but to me,
                     <pb n="[38]" facs="images/38.jpg"/> who know him, and who hear it from his own
                  lips, with what interest and sympathy shall I read it in some future day!</p>

               <head>Chapter I</head>
               <said><p>I AM by birth a Genevese; and my family is one of the most distinguished of
                     that republic. My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics;
                     and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation.
                     He was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable
                     attention to public business. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied
                     by the affairs of <pb n="[40]" facs="images/40.jpg"/> his country; and it was
                     not until the decline of life that he thought of marrying, and bestowing on the
                     state sons who might carry his virtues and his name down to posterity.</p>
                  <p>As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain
                     from relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a merchant, who, from
                     a flourishing state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty. This man,
                     whose name was <pb n="[41 - page breaks after 'Beau-']" facs="images/41.jpg"/>
                     <persName>Beaufort</persName>, was of a proud and unbending disposition, and
                     could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had
                     formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his
                     debts, therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter
                     to the town of <placeName type="tgn" key="7007280">Lucerne</placeName>, where
                     he lived unknown and in wretchedness. My father loved
                        <persName>Beaufort</persName> with the truest friendship, and was deeply
                     grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances. He grieved also for
                     the loss of his society, and resolved to seek him out and endeavour to persuade
                     him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance.</p>
                  <p><persName>Beaufort</persName> had taken effectual measures to conceal himself;
                     and it was ten months before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this
                     discovery, he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street, near
                     the <placeName type="tgn" key="1129085">Reuss</placeName>. But when he entered,
                     misery and despair alone welcomed him. <persName>Beaufort</persName> had saved
                     but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes; but it was
                     sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in the meantime
                     he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a <pb
                        n="[42 - page breaks after 'mer-']" facs="images/42.jpg"/> merchant's house.
                     The interval was consequently spent in inaction; his grief only became more
                     deep and rankling, when he had leisure for reflection; and at length it took so
                     fast hold of his mind, that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of
                     sickness, incapable of any exertion.</p>
                  <p>His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness; but she saw with
                     despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing, and that there was no
                     other prospect of support. But <persName>Caroline Beaufort</persName> possessed
                     a mind of an uncommon mould; and her courage rose to support her in her
                     adversity. She <rs content="#plain_work">procured plain work</rs>; she plaited
                     straw; and by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to
                     support life.</p>
                  <p>Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time <pb
                        n="[43]" facs="images/43.jpg"/> was more entirely occupied in attending him;
                     her means of subsistence decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in
                     her arms, leaving her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her; and
                     she knelt by <persName>Beaufort</persName>'s coffin, weeping bitterly, when my
                     father entered the chamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl,
                     who committed herself to his care, and after the interment of his friend he
                     conducted her to <placeName type="tgn" key="7003746">Geneva</placeName>, and
                     placed her under the protection of a relation. Two years after this event
                        <persName>Caroline</persName> became his wife.</p>
                  <p>When my father became a husband and a parent, he found his time so occupied by
                     the duties of his new situation, that he relinquished many of his public
                     employments, and devoted himself to the education of his children. Of these I
                     was the eldest, and the destined <pb n="[44 - page breaks after 'suc-']"
                        facs="images/44.jpg"/> successor to all his labours and utility. No creature
                     could have more tender parents than mine. My improvement and health were their
                     constant care, especially as I remained for several years their only child. But
                     before I continue my narrative, I must record an incident which took place when
                     I was four years of age.</p>
                  <p>My father had a sister, whom he tenderly loved, and who had married early in
                     life an Italian gentleman. Soon after her marriage, she had accompanied her
                     husband into his native country, and for some years my father had very little
                     communication with her. About the time I mentioned she died; and a few months
                     afterwards he received a letter from her husband, acquainting him with his
                     intention of marrying an Italian lady, and requesting my father to take charge
                     of the <pb n="[45 - page breaks after 'in-']" facs="images/45.jpg"/> infant
                        <persName>Elizabeth</persName>, the only child of his deceased sister.
                        <said>"It is my wish,"</said> he said, <said>"that you should consider her
                        as your own daughter, and educate her thus. Her mother's fortune is secured
                        to her, the documents of which I will commit to your keeping. Reflect upon
                        this proposition; and decide whether you would prefer educating your niece
                        yourself to her being brought up by a stepmother."</said></p>
                  <p>My father did not hesitate, and immediately went to <placeName type="tgn"
                        key="1000080">Italy</placeName>, that he might accompany the little
                        <persName>Elizabeth</persName> to her future home. I have often heard my
                     mother say, that she was at that time the most beautiful child she had ever
                     seen, and shewed signs even then of a gentle and affectionate disposition.
                     These indications, and a desire to bind as closely as possible the ties of
                     domestic love, determined my mother to consider <pb n="[46]"
                        facs="images/46.jpg"/>
                     <persName>Elizabeth</persName> as <rs content="#marriage_cousins"><ref target="#marriage_cousins" xml:id="marriage_cousinsA">my future
                        wife</ref></rs>; a design which she never found reason to repent.</p>
                  <p>From this time <persName>Elizabeth Lavenza</persName> became my playfellow,
                     and, as we grew older, my friend. She was docile and good tempered, yet gay and
                     playful as a summer insect. Although she was lively and animated, her feelings
                     were strong and deep, and her disposition uncommonly affectionate. No one could
                     better enjoy liberty, yet no one could submit with more grace than she did to
                     constraint and caprice. Her imagination was luxuriant, yet her capability of
                     application was great. Her person was the image of her mind; her hazel eyes,
                     although as lively as a bird's, possessed an attractive softness. Her figure
                     was light and airy; and, though capable of enduring great fatigue, she appeared
                     the most fragile creature in the world. While I <pb
                        n="[47 - page breaks after 'ad-']" facs="images/47.jpg"/> admired her
                     understanding and fancy, I loved to tend on her, as I should on a favourite
                     animal; and I never saw so much grace both of person and mind united to so
                     little pretension.</p>
                  <p>Every one adored <persName>Elizabeth</persName>. If the servants had any
                     request to make, it was always through her intercession. We were strangers to
                     any species of disunion and dispute; for although there was a great
                     dissimilitude in our characters, there was an harmony in that very
                     dissimilitude. I was more calm and philosophical than my companion; yet my
                     temper was not so yielding. My application was of longer endurance; but it was
                     not so severe whilst it endured. I delighted in investigating the facts
                     relative to the actual world; she busied herself in following the aërial
                     creations of the poets. The world was to me a secret, which I desired to <pb
                        n="[48]" facs="images/48.jpg"/> discover; to her it was a vacancy, which she
                     sought to people with imaginations of her own.</p>
                  <p>My brothers were considerably younger than myself; but I had a friend in one of
                     my schoolfellows, who compensated for this deficiency. <persName>Henry
                        Clerval</persName> was the son of a merchant of <placeName type="tgn"
                        key="7003746">Geneva</placeName>, an intimate friend of my father. He was a
                     boy of singular talent and <rs content="#fancy">fancy</rs>. I remember, when he
                     was nine years old, he wrote a fairy tale, which was the delight and amazement
                     of all his companions. His favourite study consisted in <rs

                     when very young, I can remember, that we used to act plays composed by him out
                     of these favourite books, the principal characters of which were <persName><rs

                  <p>No youth could have passed more <pb n="[49]" facs="images/49.jpg"/> happily
                     than mine. My parents were indulgent, and my companions amiable. Our studies
                     were never forced; and by some means we always had an end placed in view, which
                     excited us to ardour in the prosecution of them. It was by this method, and not
                     by emulation, that we were urged to application. <persName>Elizabeth</persName>
                     was not incited to apply herself to drawing, that her companions might not
                     outstrip her; but through the desire of pleasing her aunt, by the
                     representation of some favourite scene done by her own hand. We learned Latin
                     and English, that we might read the writings in those languages; and so far
                     from study being made odious to us through punishment, we loved application,
                     and our amusements would have been the labours of other children. Perhaps we
                     did not read so many books, or learn languages so <pb n="[50]"
                        facs="images/50.jpg"/> quickly, as those who are disciplined according to
                     the ordinary methods; but what we learned was impressed the more deeply on our
                     memories.</p>
                  <p>In this description of our domestic circle I include <persName>Henry
                        Clerval</persName>; for he was constantly with us. He went to school with
                     me, and generally passed the afternoon at our house: for being an only child,
                     and destitute of companions at home, his father was well pleased that he should
                     find associates at our house; and we were never completely happy when
                        <persName>Clerval</persName> was absent.</p>
                  <p>I feel pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before
                     misfortune had tainted my mind, and changed its bright visions of extensive
                     usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. But, in drawing the
                     picture of my early days, I must not omit to record those events which led, by
                        <pb n="[51 - page breaks after 'in-']" facs="images/51.jpg"/> insensible
                     steps to my after tale of misery: for when I would account to myself for the
                     birth of that passion, which afterwards ruled my destiny, I find it arise, like
                     a mountain river, from ignoble and almost forgotten sources; but, swelling as
                     it proceeded, it became the torrent which, in its course, has swept away all my
                     hopes and joys.</p>
                  <p><ref target="#natural_philosophy" xml:id="natural_philosophyA"><rs content="#natural_philosophy">Natural philosophy</rs></ref> is the genius that
                     has regulated my fate; I desire therefore, in this narration, to state those
                     facts which led to my predilection for that science. When I was thirteen years
                     of age, we all went on a party of pleasure to the baths near <placeName
                        type="tgn" key="1035867">Thonon</placeName>: the inclemency of the weather
                     obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In this house I chanced to find
                     a volume of the works of <persName type="lccn" key="n80043375"><rs
                           content="#agrippa" xml:id="agrippaA">Cornelius Agrippa</rs></persName>. I
                     opened it with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate, and the <pb
                        n="[52]" facs="images/52.jpg"/> wonderful facts which he relates, soon
                     changed this feeling into <rs content="#enthusiasm">enthusiasm</rs>. A new
                     light seemed to dawn upon my mind; and, bounding with joy, I communicated my
                     discovery to my father. I cannot help remarking here the many opportunities
                     instructors possess of directing the attention of their pupils to useful
                     knowledge, which they utterly neglect. My father looked carelessly at the
                     title-page of my book, and said, <said>"Ah! <persName type="lccn"
                           key="n80043375"><rs content="#agrippa">Cornelius Agrippa</rs></persName>!
                        My dear <persName>Victor</persName>, do not waste your time upon this; it is
                        sad trash."</said></p>
                  <p>If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me,
                     that the principles of <persName type="lccn" key="n80043375"><rs
                           content="#agrippa">Agrippa</rs></persName> had been entirely exploded,
                     and that a modern system of science had been introduced, which possessed much
                     greater powers than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were
                     <ref target="#chimerical" xml:id="chimericalA">chimerical</ref>, while <pb n="[53]" facs="images/53.jpg"/> those of the former were
                     real and practical; under such circumstances, I should certainly have thrown
                        <persName type="lccn" key="n80043375"><rs content="#agrippa"
                        >Agrippa</rs></persName> aside, and, with my imagination warmed as it was,
                     should probably have applied myself to the more rational theory of chemistry
                     which has resulted from modern discoveries. It is even possible, that the train
                     of my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin.
                     But the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me
                     that he was acquainted with its contents; and I continued to read with the
                     greatest avidity.</p>
                  <p>When I returned home, my first care was to procure the whole works of this
                     author, and afterwards of <persName type="lccn" key="n80120959"><rs
                        content="#paracelsus"><ref target="#paracelsus" xml:id="paracelsusA">Paracelsus</ref></rs></persName> and <persName
                        type="lccn" key="n81007973"><rs content="#albertus_magnus"><ref
                              target="#albertus_magnus" xml:id="albertus_magnusA">Albertus
                              Magnus</ref></rs></persName>. I read and studied the wild fancies of
                     these writers with delight; they appeared to me <pb
                        n="[54 - page breaks after 'trea-']" facs="images/54.jpg"/> treasures known
                     to few beside myself; and although I have often wished to communicate these
                     secret stores of knowledge to my father, yet his indefinite censure of my
                     favourite <persName type="lccn" key="n80043375"><rs content="#agrippa"
                           >Agrippa</rs></persName> always withheld me. I disclosed my discoveries
                     to <persName>Elizabeth</persName>, therefore, under a promise of strict
                     secrecy; but she did not interest herself in the subject, and I was left by her
                     to pursue my studies alone.</p>
                  <p>It may appear very strange, that a disciple of <persName type="lccn"
                        key="n81007973"><rs content="#albertus_magnus">Albertus
                        Magnus</rs></persName> should arise in the eighteenth century; but our
                     family was not scientifical, and I had not attended any of the lectures given
                     at the schools of <placeName type="tgn" key="7003746">Geneva</placeName>. My
                     dreams were therefore undisturbed by reality; and I entered with the greatest
                     diligence into the search of the <ref target="#philosophers_stone" xml:id="philosophers_stoneA">philosopher's stone and the elixir of life</ref>.
                     But the latter obtained my <pb n="[55 - page breaks after 'undi-']"
                        facs="images/55.jpg"/> undivided attention: wealth was an inferior object;
                     but what glory would attend the discovery, if I could banish disease from the
                     human frame, and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death!</p>
                  <p>Nor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or devils was a promise
                     liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfillment of which I most
                     eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I attributed
                     the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a want of skill
                     or fidelity in my instructors.</p>
                  <p>The natural phænomena that take place every day before our eyes did not escape
                     my examinations. Distillation, and the wonderful effects of <ref target="#steam" xml:id="steamA">steam</ref>, processes of
                     which my favourite authors were utterly ignorant, excited my astonishment; but
                     my utmost wonder was <pb n="[56]" facs="images/56.jpg"/> engaged by some
                        <ref target="#air_pump" xml:id="air_pumpA">experiments on an air-pump</ref>, which I saw employed by a gentleman whom we were in
                     the habit of visiting.</p>
                  <p>The ignorance of the early philbosophers on these and several other points
                     served to decrease their credit with me: but I could not entirely throw them
                     aside, before some other system should occupy their place in my mind.</p>
                  <p>When I was about fifteen years old, we had retired to our house near <placeName
                        type="tgn" key="8703247">Belrive</placeName>, when we witnessed a most
                     violent and terrible thunder-storm. It advanced from behind <ref target="#swiss_alps" xml:id="swiss_alpsA"><placeName
                        type="tgn" key="1109172">the mountains of Jura</placeName></ref>; and the thunder
                     burst at once with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I
                     remained, while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and
                     delight. As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue
                     from an old and beautiful oak, <pb n="[57]" facs="images/57.jpg"/> which stood
                     about twenty yards from our house; and so soon as the dazzling light vanished,
                     the oak had disappeared, and nothing remained but a blasted stump. When we
                     visited it the next morning, we found the tree shattered in a singular manner.
                     It was not splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbands of
                     wood. I never beheld anything so utterly destroyed.</p>
                  <p>The catastrophe of this tree excited my extreme astonishment; and I eagerly
                     inquired of my father the nature and origin of thunder and lightning. He
                     replied, <said>"Electricity;"</said> describing at the same time the various
                     effects of that power. He constructed a small electrical machine, and exhibited
                     a few experiments; he made also a <ref target="#kite" xml:id="kiteA">kite</ref>, with a wire and string, which drew down
                     that fluid from the clouds.</p>
                  <p>This last stroke completed the <pb n="[58 - page breaks after 'over-']"
                        facs="images/58.jpg"/> overthrow of <persName type="lccn" key="n80043375"

                     the lords of my imagination. But by some fatality I did not feel inclined to
                     commence the study of any modern system; and this disinclination was influenced
                     by the following circumstance.</p>
                  <p>My father expressed a wish that I should attend a course of lectures upon <rs
                        content="#natural_philosophy">natural philosophy</rs>, to which I cheerfully
                     consented. Some accident prevented my attending these lectures until the course
                     was nearly finished. The lecture, being therefore one of the last, was entirely
                     incomprehensible to me. The professor discoursed with the greatest fluency of
                     potassium and boron, of sulphates and oxyds, terms to which I could affix no
                     idea; and I became disgusted with the science of <rs
                        content="#natural_philosophy">natural philosophy</rs>, although I still read
                        <pb n="[59]" facs="images/59.jpg"/>
                     <persName type="lccn" key="n79042075">Pliny</persName> and <persName
                        type="lccn" key="n50041361">Buffon</persName> with delight, authors, in my
                     estimation, of nearly equal interest and utility.</p>
                  <p>My occupations at this age were principally the mathematics, and most of the
                     branches of study appertaining to that science. I was busily employed in
                     learning languages; Latin was already familiar to me, and I began to read some
                     of the easiest Greek authors without the help of a lexicon. I also perfectly
                     understood English and German. This is the list of my accomplishments at the
                     age of seventeen; and you may conceive that my hours were fully employed in
                     acquiring and maintaining a knowledge of this various literature.</p>
                  <p>Another task also devolved upon me, when I became the instructor of my
                     brothers. <persName>Ernest</persName> was six years younger than myself, and
                     was my principal <pb n="[60 - page breaks after 'pu']" facs="images/60.jpg"/>
                     pupil. He had been afflicted with ill health from his infancy, through which
                        <persName>Elizabeth</persName> and I had been his constant nurses: his
                     disposition was gentle, but he was incapable of any severe application.
                        <persName>William</persName>, the youngest of our family, was yet an infant,
                     and the most beautiful little fellow in the world; his lively blue eyes,
                     dimpled cheeks, and endearing manners, inspired the tenderest affection.</p>
                  <p>Such was our domestic circle, from which care and pain seemed for ever
                     banished. My father directed our studies, and my mother partook of our
                     enjoyments. Neither of us possessed the slightest pre-eminence over the other;
                     the voice of command was never heard amongst us; but mutual affection engaged
                     us all to comply with and obey the slightest desire of each other.</p></said>

               <head>Chapter II</head>
               <said><p>WHEN I had attained the age of seventeen, my parents resolved that I should
                     become a student at the university of <rs content="#ingolstadt"
                        xml:id="ingolstadtA"><placeName type="tgn" key="7017035"
                           >Ingolstadt</placeName></rs>. I had hitherto attended the schools of
                        <placeName type="tgn" key="7003746">Geneva</placeName>; but my father
                     thought it necessary, for the completion of my education, that I should be made
                     acquainted with other customs than those of my native country. My departure was
                     therefore fixed at an early date; but, before the day resolved upon could
                     arrive, the first misfortune of my life occurred— an omen, as it were, of my
                     future misery.</p>
                  <pb n="[62]" facs="images/62.jpg"/>
                  <p><persName>Elizabeth</persName> had caught the scarlet fever; but her illness
                     was not severe, and she quickly recovered. During her confinement, many
                     arguments had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon
                     her. She had, at first, yielded to our entreaties; but when she heard that her
                     favourite was recovering, she could no longer debar herself from her society,
                     and entered her chamber long before the danger of infection was past. The
                     consequences of this imprudence were fatal. On the third day my mother
                     sickened; her fever was very malignant, and the looks of her attendants
                     prognosticated the worst event. On her death-bed the fortitude and benignity of
                     this admirable woman did not desert her. She joined the hands of
                        <persName>Elizabeth</persName> and myself: <said>"My children,"</said> she
                     said, <said>"my firmest hopes of future <pb n="[63]" facs="images/63.jpg"/>
                        happiness were placed on the prospect of your union. This expectation will
                        now be the consolation of your father. <persName>Elizabeth</persName>, my
                        love, you must supply my place to your younger cousins. Alas! I regret that
                        I am taken from you; and, happy and beloved as I have been, is it not hard
                        to quit you all? But these are not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour
                        to resign myself cheerfully to death, and will indulge a hope of meeting you
                        in another world."</said></p>
                  <p>She died calmly; and her countenance expressed affection even in death. I need
                     not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by that most
                     irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the soul, and the despair
                     that is exhibited on the countenance. It is so long before the mind can
                     persuade itself that she, whom we saw every day, and whose very existence <pb
                        n="[64]" facs="images/64.jpg"/> appeared a part of our own, can have
                     departed for ever—that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been
                     extinguished, and the sound of a voice so familiar, and dear to the ear, can be
                     hushed, never more to be heard. These are the reflections of the first days;
                     but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil, then the actual
                     bitterness of grief commences. Yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away
                     some dear connexion; and why should I describe a sorrow which all have felt,
                     and must feel? The time at length arrives, when grief is rather an indulgence
                     than a necessity; and the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be
                     deemed a sacrilege, is not banished. My mother was dead, but we had still
                     duties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the rest,
                     and learn to think <pb n="[65]" facs="images/65.jpg"/> ourselves fortunate,
                     whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized.</p>
                  <p>My journey to <placeName type="tgn" key="7017035">Ingolstadt</placeName>, which
                     had been deferred by these events, was now again determined upon. I obtained
                     from my father a respite of some weeks. This period was spent sadly; my
                     mother's death, and my speedy departure, depressed our spirits; but
                        <persName>Elizabeth</persName> endeavoured to renew the spirit of
                     cheerfulness in our little society. Since the death of her aunt, her mind had
                     acquired new firmness and vigour. She determined to fulfil her duties with the
                     greatest exactness; and she felt that that most imperious duty, of rendering
                     her uncle and cousins happy, had devolved upon her. She consoled me, amused her
                     uncle, instructed my brothers; and I never beheld her so enchanting as at this
                     time, when she was continually endeavouring to <pb
                        n="[66 - page breaks after 'con-']" facs="images/66.jpg"/> contribute to the
                     happiness of others, entirely forgetful of herself.</p>
                  <p>The day of my departure at length arrived. I had taken leave of all my friends,
                     excepting <persName>Clerval</persName>, who spent the last evening with us. He
                     bitterly lamented that he was unable to accompany me: but his father could not
                     be persuaded to part with him, intending that he should become a partner with
                     him in business, in compliance with his favourite theory, that learning was
                     superfluous in the commerce of ordinary life. <persName>Henry</persName> had a
                     refined mind; he had no desire to be idle, and was well pleased to become his
                     father's partner, but he believed that a man might become a very good trader,
                     and yet possess a cultivated understanding.</p>
                  <p>We sat late, listening to his complaints, and making many little arrangements
                     for the future. The next <pb n="[67]" facs="images/67.jpg"/> morning early I
                     departed. Tears gushed from the eyes of <persName>Elizabeth</persName>; they
                     proceeded partly from sorrow at my departure, and partly because she reflected
                     that the same journey was to have taken place three months before, when a
                     mother's blessing would have accompanied me.</p>
                  <p>I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away, and indulged in the
                     most melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by amiable
                     companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasure, I
                     was now alone. In the university, whither I was going, I must form my own
                     friends, and be my own protector. My life had hitherto been remarkably secluded
                     and domestic; and this had given me invincible repugnance to new countenances.
                     I loved my brothers, <persName>Elizabeth</persName>, and
                        <persName>Clerval</persName>; <pb n="[68]" facs="images/68.jpg"/> these were
                     <ref target="#faces" xml:id="facesA"><quote>"old familiar faces;"</quote></ref> but I believed myself totally unfitted
                     for the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as I commenced my
                     journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. I ardently desired the
                     acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at home, thought it hard to remain
                     during my youth cooped up in one place, and had longed to enter the world, and
                     take my station among other human beings. Now my desires were complied with,
                     and it would, indeed, have been folly to repent.</p>
                  <p>I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey
                     to <placeName type="tgn" key="7017035">Ingolstadt</placeName>, which was long
                     and fatiguing. At length the high white steeple of the town met my eyes. I
                     alighted, and was conducted to my solitary apartment, to spend the evening as I
                     pleased.</p>
                  <pb n="[69]" facs="images/69.jpg"/>
                  <p>The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction, and paid a visit to
                     some of the principal professors, and among others to <persName>M.
                        Krempe</persName>, professor of <rs content="#natural_philosophy">natural
                        philosophy</rs>. He received me with politeness, and asked me several
                     questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science
                     appertaining to <rs content="#natural_philosophy">natural philosophy</rs>. I
                     mentioned, it is true, with fear and trembling, the only authors I had ever
                     read upon those subjects. The professor stared: <said>"Have you,"</said> he
                     said, <said>"really spent your time in studying such nonsense?"</said></p>
                  <p>I replied in the affirmative. <said>"Every minute,"</said> continued
                        <persName>M. Krempe</persName> with warmth, <said>"every instant that you
                        have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost. You have burdened
                        your memory with exploded systems, and useless names. Good God! in what <pb
                           n="[70]" facs="images/70.jpg"/> desert land have you lived, where no one
                        was kind enough to inform you that these fancies, which you have so greedily
                        imbibed, are a thousand years old, and as musty as they are ancient? I
                        little expected in this enlightened and scientific age to find a disciple of
                           <persName type="lccn" key="n81007973"><rs content="#albertus_magnus"
                              >Albertus Magnus</rs></persName> and <persName type="lccn"
                           key="n80120959"><rs content="#paracelsus">Paracelsus</rs></persName>. My
                        dear Sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew."</said></p>
                  <p>So saying, he stepped aside, and wrote down a list of several books treating of
                        <rs content="#natural_philosophy">natural philosophy</rs>, which he desired
                     me to procure, and dismissed me, after mentioning that in the beginning of the
                     following week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon <rs
                        content="#natural_philosophy">natural philosophy</rs> in its general
                     relations, and that <persName>M. Waldman</persName>, a fellow-professor, would
                     lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he missed.</p>
                  <p>I returned home, not disappointed, <pb n="[71]" facs="images/71.jpg"/> for I
                     had long considered those authors useless whom the professor had so strongly
                     reprobated; but I did not feel much inclined to study the books which I had
                     procured at his recommendation. <persName>M. Krempe</persName> was a little
                     squat man, with a gruff voice and repulsive countenance; the teacher,
                     therefore, did not prepossess me in favour of his doctrine. Besides, I had a
                     contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy. It was very different, when
                     the masters of the science sought immortality and power; such views, although
                     futile, were grand: but now the scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer
                     seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my
                     interest in science was chiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of
                     boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.</p>
                  <p>Such were my reflections during the <pb n="[72]" facs="images/72.jpg"/> first
                     two or three days spent almost in solitude. But as the ensuing week commenced,
                     I thought of the information which <persName>M. Krempe</persName> had given me
                     concerning the lectures. And although I could not consent to go and hear that
                     little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what
                     he had said of <persName>M. Waldman</persName>, whom I had never seen, as he
                     had hitherto been out of town.</p>
                  <p>Partly from curiosity, and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing
                     room, which <persName>M. Waldman</persName> entered shortly after. <rs
                        content="#davy"><ref target="#davy" xml:id="davyA">This professor was very
                           unlike his colleague.</ref></rs> He appeared about fifty years of age,
                     but with an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs
                     covered his temples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black. His
                     person was short, but remarkably erect; and his <pb n="[73]"
                        facs="images/73.jpg"/> voice the sweetest I had ever heard. He began his
                     lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry, and the various
                     improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing with fervour the
                     names of the most distinguished discoverers. He then took a cursory view of the
                     present state of the science, and explained many of its elementary terms. After
                     having made a few preparatory experiments, he concluded with a panegyric upon
                     modern chemistry, the terms of which I shall never forget:—</p>
                  <p><said><ref target="#ancient_teachers" xml:id="ancient_teachersA">"The ancient
                           teachers of this science,"</ref></said> said he, <said>"promised
                        impossibilities, and performed nothing. The modern masters promise very
                        little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted, and that the elixir of
                        life is a chimera. But these philosophers, whose hands seem only made to
                        dabble <pb n="[74]" facs="images/74.jpg"/> in dirt, and their eyes to pore
                              over the <ref target="#microscope" xml:id="microscopeA">microscope</ref> or crucible, have indeed performed miracles. <ref
                           target="penetrate" xml:id="penetrateA">They penetrate into the recesses
                           of nature, and shew how she works in her hiding places</ref>. They ascend

                        can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the
                        invisible world with its own shadows."</said></p>
                  <p>I departed highly pleased with the professor and his lecture, and paid him a
                     visit the same evening. His manners in private were even more mild and
                     attractive than in public; for there was a certain dignity in his mien during
                     his lecture, which in his own house was replaced by the greatest <pb n="[75]"
                        facs="images/75.jpg"/> affability and kindness. He heard with attention my
                     little narration concerning my studies, and smiled at the names of <persName
                        type="lccn" key="n80043375"><rs content="#agrippa">Cornelius

                           content="#paracelsus">Paracelsus</rs></persName>, but without the
                     contempt that <persName>M. Krempe</persName> had exhibited. He said, that
                        <said>"these were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were
                        indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge. They had left to
                        us, as an easier task, to give new names, arrange in connected
                        classifications, the facts which they in a great degree had been the
                        instruments of bringing to light. The labours of men of genius, however
                        erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid
                        advantage of mankind."</said> I listened to his statement, which was
                     delivered without any presumption or affectation; and then added, that his
                     lecture had removed my prejudices against modern <pb n="[76]"
                        facs="images/76.jpg"/> chemists; and I, at the same time, requested his
                     advice concerning the books I ought to procure.</p>
                  <p><said>"I am happy,"</said> said <persName>M. Waldman</persName>, <said>"to have
                        gained a disciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no
                        doubt of your success. <rs content="#chemistry">Chemistry</rs> is that

                        that I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time I have not
                        neglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry
                        chemist, if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your
                        wish is to become really a man of science, and not merely a petty
                        experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of <rs

                  <p>He then took me into his laboratory, and explained to me the uses of his
                     various machines; instructing me as to what I ought to procure, and promising
                     me the use of his own, when I should have advanced far enough in the science
                     not to derange their mechanism. He also gave me the list of books which I had
                     requested; and I took my leave.</p>

               <head>Chapter III</head>
               <said><p>FROM this day <rs content="#natural_philosophy">natural philosophy</rs>, and
                     particularly <rs content="#chemistry">chemistry</rs>, in the most comprehensive
                     sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation. I read with ardour those
                     works, so full of genius and discrimination, which modern inquirers have
                     written on these subjects. I attended the lectures, and cultivated the
                     acquaintance, of the men of science of the university; and I found even in
                        <persName>M. Krempe</persName> a great deal of sound sense and real
                     information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive physiognomy and manners,
                     but not on that account the less valuable. In <persName>M. Waldman</persName> I
                     found <pb n="[79]" facs="images/79.jpg"/> a true friend. His gentleness was
                     never tinged by dogmatism; and his instructions were given with an air of
                     frankness and good nature that banished every idea of pedantry. It was,
                     perhaps, the amiable character of this man that inclined me more to that branch
                     of <rs content="#natural_philosophy">natural philosophy</rs> which he
                     professed, than an intrinsic love for the science itself. But this state of
                     mind had place only in the first steps towards knowledge: the more fully I
                     entered into the science, the more exclusively I pursued it for its own sake.
                     That application, which at first had been a matter of duty and resolution, now
                     became so ardent and eager, that the stars often disappeared in the light of
                     morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.</p>
                  <p>As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that I improved <pb
                        n="[80 - page breaks after 'ra-']" facs="images/80.jpg"/> rapidly. My ardour
                     was indeed the astonishment of the students; and my proficiency, that of the
                     masters. Professor <persName>Krempe</persName> often asked me, with a sly
                     smile, how <persName type="lccn" key="n80043375"><rs content="#agrippa"
                           >Cornelius Agrippa</rs></persName> went on? whilst <persName>M.
                        Waldman</persName> expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress.
                     Two years passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to <placeName
                        type="tgn" key="7003746">Geneva</placeName>, but was engaged, heart and
                     soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries, which I hoped to make. None but those
                     who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements of science. In other
                     studies you go as far as others have gone before you, and there is nothing more
                     to know; but in a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and
                     wonder. A mind of moderate capacity, which closely pursues one study, must
                     infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who <pb
                        n="[81 - page breaks after 'con-']" facs="images/81.jpg"/> continually
                     sought the attainment of one object of pursuit, and was solely wrapped up in
                     this, improved so rapidly, that, at the end of two years, I made some
                     discoveries in the improvement of some chemical instruments, which procured me
                     great esteem and admiration at the university. When I had arrived at this
                     point, and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of <rs
                        content="#natural_philosophy">natural philosophy</rs> as depended on the
                     lessons of any of the professors at <placeName type="tgn" key="7017035"
                        >Ingolstadt</placeName>, my residence there being no longer conducive to my
                     improvements, I thought of returning to my friends and my native town, when an
                     incident happened that protracted my stay.</p>
                  <p>One of the phænomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the
                     structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with life. Whence,
                     I often asked myself, did the <pb n="[82]" facs="images/82.jpg"/> principle of
                     life proceed? It was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as
                     a mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming
                     acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our inquiries. I
                     revolved these circumstances in my mind, and determined thenceforth to apply
                     myself more particularly to those branches of <rs content="#natural_philosophy"
                        >natural philosophy</rs> which relate to physiology. Unless I had been
                     animated by <rs content="#enthusiasm">an almost supernatural enthusiasm</rs>,
                     my application to this study would have been irksome, and almost intolerable.
                     To examine the causes of life, we must first have recourse to death. I became
                     acquainted with the science of anatomy: but this was not sufficient; I must
                     also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body. In my
                     education my father had taken the <pb n="[83]" facs="images/83.jpg"/> greatest
                     precautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do
                     not ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition, or to have feared
                     the apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy; and a
                     churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life, which,
                     from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become food for the worm. Now I
                     was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay, and forced to spend
                     days and nights in vaults and charnel houses. My attention was fixed upon every
                     object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw how
                     the fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of death
                     succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm inherited the wonders
                     of the eye and brain. I <pb n="[84]" facs="images/84.jpg"/> paused, examining
                     and analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change from
                     life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this darkness a
                     sudden light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant and wondrous, yet so simple,
                     that while I became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect which it
                     illustrated, I was surprised that among so many men of genius, who had directed
                     their inquiries towards the same science, that I alone should be reserved to
                     discover so astonishing a secret.</p>
                  <p>Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun does not more
                     certainly shine in the heavens, than that which I now affirm is true. Some
                     miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the discovery were distinct
                     and probable. After days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue, <pb
                        n="[85]" facs="images/85.jpg"/> I succeeded in discovering the cause of
                     generation and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing animation
                     upon lifeless matter.</p>
                  <p>The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery soon gave
                     place to delight and rapture. After so much time spent in painful labour, to
                     arrive at once at the summit of my desires, was the most gratifying
                     consummation of my toils. But this discovery was so great and overwhelming,
                     that all the steps by which I had been progressively led to it were
                     obliterated, and I beheld only the result. What had been the study and desire
                     of the wisest men since the creation of the world, was now within my grasp. Not
                     that, like a magic scene, it all opened upon me at once: the information I had
                     obtained was of a nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should
                     point them towards <pb n="[86]" facs="images/86.jpg"/> the object of my search,
                     than to exhibit that object already accomplished. I was like the Arabian who
                     had been buried with the dead, and found a passage to life aided only by one
                     glimmering, and seemingly ineffectual, light.</p>
                  <p>I see by your eagerness, and the wonder and hope which your eyes express, my
                     friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with which I am
                     acquainted; that cannot be: listen patiently until the end of my story, and you
                     will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that subject. I will not lead you
                     on, unguarded and ardent as I then was, to your destruction and infallible
                     misery. Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how
                     dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge, and how much happier that man is who
                     believes his <pb n="[87]" facs="images/87.jpg"/> native town to be the world,
                     than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow.</p>
                  <p>When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated a long
                     time concerning the manner in which I should employ it. Although I possessed
                     the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to prepare a frame for the reception
                     of it, with all its intricacies of fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a
                     work of inconceivable difficulty and labour. I doubted at first whether I
                     should attempt the creation of a being like myself or one of simpler
                     organization; but my imagination was too much exalted by my first success to
                     permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and
                     wonderful as man. The materials at present within my command hardly appeared
                     adequate to so arduous an <pb n="[88]" facs="images/88.jpg"/> undertaking; but
                     I doubted not that I should ultimately succeed. I prepared myself for a
                     multitude of reverses; my operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last
                     my work be imperfect: yet, when I considered the improvement which every day
                     takes place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present
                     attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success. Nor could I
                     consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any argument of its
                     impracticability. It was with these feelings that I began the creation of a
                     human being. As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my
                     speed, I resolved, contrary to my first intention, to make the being of a
                     gigantic stature; that is to say, about eight feet in height, and
                     proportionably large. After having formed this <pb
                        n="[89 - page breaks after 'de-']" facs="images/89.jpg"/> determination, and
                     having spent some months in successfully collecting and arranging my materials,
                     I began.</p>
                  <p>No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like a
                     hurricane, in the first <rs content="#enthusiasm">enthusiasm of success</rs>.
                     Life and death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through,
                     and pour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new species would bless me
                     as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would owe their
                     being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as
                     I should deserve their's. Pursuing these reflections, I thought, that if I
                     could bestow animation upon lifeless matter, I might in process of time
                     (although I now found it impossible) renew life where death had apparently
                     devoted the body to corruption.</p>
                  <pb n="[90]" facs="images/90.jpg"/>
                  <p>These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking with
                     unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and my person had
                     become emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very brink of certainty, I
                     failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might
                     realise. One secret which I alone possessed was the hope to which I had
                     dedicated myself; and the moon gazed on my midnight labours, while, with
                     unrelaxed and breathless eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places. Who
                     shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil, as I dabbled among the unhallowed
                     damps of the grave, or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay?
                     My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but then a
                     resistless, and almost frantic impulse, urged me forward; I seemed to <pb
                        n="[91]" facs="images/91.jpg"/> have lost all soul or sensation but for this
                     one pursuit. It was indeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with
                     renewed acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had
                     returned to my old habits. I collected bones from charnel houses; and
                     disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human frame. In
                     a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house, and separated from
                     all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase, I kept my workshop of
                     filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from their sockets in attending to
                     the details of my employment. The dissecting room and the slaughter-house
                     furnished many of my materials; and often did my human nature turn with
                     loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which
                     perpetually increased, <pb n="[92]" facs="images/92.jpg"/> I brought my work
                     near to a conclusion.</p>
                  <p>The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in one
                     pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields bestow a more
                     plentiful harvest, or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage: but my eyes
                     were insensible to the charms of nature. And the same feelings which made me
                     neglect the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so
                     many miles absent, and whom I had not seen for so long a time. I knew my
                     silence disquieted them; and I well remembered the words of my father: <said>"I
                        know that while you are pleased with yourself, you will think of us with
                        affection, and we shall hear regularly from you. You must pardon me, if I
                        regard any interruption in your correspondence as a proof <pb n="[93]"
                           facs="images/93.jpg"/> that your other duties are equally
                        neglected."</said></p>
                  <p>I knew well therefore what would be my father's feelings; but I could not tear
                     my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which had taken an
                     irresistible hold of my imagination. I wished, as it were, to procrastinate all
                     that related to my feelings of affection until the great object, which
                     swallowed up every habit of my nature, should be completed.</p>
                  <p>I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect to
                     vice, or faultiness on my part; but I am now convinced that he was justified in
                     conceiving that I should not be altogether free from blame. A human being in
                     perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind, and never to
                     allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity. <pb n="[94]"
                        facs="images/94.jpg"/> I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an
                     exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency
                     to weaken your affections, and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures
                     in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful, that
                     is to say, not befitting the human mind. If this rule were always observed; if
                     no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his
                     domestic affections, <placeName type="tgn" key="1000074">Greece</placeName> had
                     not been enslaved; <persName type="lccn" key="n79021400">Caesar</persName>
                     would have spared his country; <placeName type="tgn" key="8698314"
                        >America</placeName> would have been discovered more gradually; and the
                     empires of <placeName type="tgn" key="7005560">Mexico</placeName> and
                        <placeName type="tgn" key="1000056">Peru</placeName> had not been
                     destroyed.</p>
                  <p>But I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my tale; and
                     your looks remind me to proceed.</p>
                  <p>My father made no reproach in his <pb n="[95]" facs="images/95.jpg"/> letters;
                     and only took notice of my silence by inquiring into my occupations more
                     particularly than before. Winter, spring, and summer passed away during my
                     labours; but I did not watch the blossom or the expanding leaves—sights which
                     before always yielded me supreme delight, so deeply was I engrossed in my
                     occupation. The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near to a
                     close; and now every day shewed me more plainly how well I had succeeded. But
                     my <rs content="#enthusiasm">enthusiasm</rs> was checked by my anxiety, and I
                     appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other
                     unwholesome trade, than an artist occupied by his favourite employment. Every
                     night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most painful
                     degree; a disease that I regretted the more because I had hitherto <pb
                        n="[96 - page breaks after 'en-']" facs="images/96.jpg"/> enjoyed most
                     excellent health, and had always boasted of the firmness of my nerves. But I
                     believed that exercise and amusement would soon drive away such symptoms; and I
                     promised myself both of these, when my creation should be complete.</p></said>

            <div n="1.4" type="chapter">
               <pb n="[97]" facs="images/97.jpg"/>
               <head>Chapter IV</head>
               <said><p>IT was on a dreary night of <date>November</date>, that I beheld the
                     accomplishment of my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I
                     collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of
                     being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was already one in the
                     morning; the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was nearly
                     burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull
                     yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed <pb n="[98]" facs="images/98.jpg"
                     /> hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.</p>
                  <p>How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch
                     whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form? His limbs
                     were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful.
                     Beautiful!—Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and
                     arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a
                     pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with
                     his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets
                     in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion, and straight black lips.</p>
                  <p>The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human
                     nature. I had worked hard for <pb n="[99]" facs="images/99.jpg"/> nearly two
                     years, for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I
                     had deprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour that
                     far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty of the dream
                     vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart. Unable to endure
                     the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of the room, and continued
                     a long time traversing my bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep. At
                     length lassitude succeeded to the tumult I had before endured; and I threw
                     myself on the bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of
                     forgetfulness. But it was in vain: I slept indeed, but I was disturbed by the
                     wildest dreams. I thought I saw <persName>Elizabeth</persName>, in the bloom of
                     health, walking in the streets of <placeName type="tgn" key="7017035"
                        >Ingolstadt</placeName>. Delighted and surprised, I <pb
                        n="[100 - page breaks after 'em-']" facs="images/100.jpg"/> embraced her;
                     but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with the hue
                     of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I held the corpse
                     of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her form, and I saw the
                     grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel. I started from my sleep with
                     horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my teeth chattered, and every limb
                     became convulsed; when, by the dim and yellow light of the moon, as it forced
                     its way through the window-shutters, I beheld the wretch—the miserable monster
                     whom I had created. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes
                     they may be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some
                     inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have spoken,
                     but I did not hear; one hand was <pb n="[101]" facs="images/101.jpg"/>
                     stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped, and rushed down stairs. I
                     took refuge in the court-yard belonging to the house which I inhabited; where I
                     remained during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest
                     agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if it were
                     to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I had so miserably
                     given life.</p>
                  <p>Oh! no mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy again
                     endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I had gazed on
                     him while unfinished; he was ugly then; but when those muscles and joints were
                     rendered capable of motion, it became a thing such as even <persName
                        type="lccn" key="n78095495"><rs content="#dante">Dante</rs></persName> could
                     not have conceived.</p>
                  <p>I passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and <pb
                        n="[102]" facs="images/102.jpg"/> hardly, that I felt the palpitation of
                     every artery; at others, I nearly sank to the ground through languor and
                     extreme weakness. Mingled with this horror, I felt the bitterness of
                     disappointment: dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a
                     space, were now become a hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow
                     so complete!</p>
                  <p>Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned, and discovered to my sleepless and
                     aching eyes the church of <placeName type="tgn" key="7017035"
                        >Ingolstadt</placeName>, its white steeple and clock, which indicated the
                     sixth hour. The porter opened the gates of the court, which had that night been
                     my asylum, and I issued into the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I
                     sought to avoid the wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would
                     present to my view. I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited,
                     but felt <pb n="[103]" facs="images/103.jpg"/> impelled to hurry on, although
                     wetted by the rain, which poured from a black and comfortless sky.</p>
                  <p>I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring, by bodily
                     exercise, to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I traversed the streets,
                     without any clear conception of where I was, or what I was doing. My heart
                     palpitated in the sickness of fear; and I hurried on with irregular steps, not
                     daring to look about me:</p>

                  <p>Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various
                     diligences and carriages usually stopped. <pb n="[104]" facs="images/104.jpg"/>
                     Here I paused, I knew not why; but I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed
                     on a coach that was coming towards me from the other end of the street. As it
                     drew nearer, I observed that it was the Swiss diligence: it stopped just where
                     I was standing; and, on the door being opened, I perceived <persName>Henry
                        Clerval</persName>, who, on seeing me, instantly sprung out. <said>"My dear
                           <persName>Frankenstein</persName>,"</said> exclaimed he, <said>"how glad
                        I am to see you! how fortunate that you should be here at the very moment of
                        my alighting!"</said></p>
                  <p>Nothing could equal my delight on seeing <persName>Clerval</persName>; his
                     presence brought back to my thoughts my father, <persName>Elizabeth</persName>,
                     and all those scenes of home so dear to my recollection. I grasped his hand,
                     and in a moment forgot my horror and misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the
                     first time during many months, <pb n="[105]" facs="images/105.jpg"/> calm and
                     serene joy. I welcomed my friend therefore, in the most cordial manner, and we
                     walked towards my college. <persName>Clerval</persName> continued talking for
                     some time about our mutual friends, and his own good fortune in being permitted
                     to come to <placeName type="tgn" key="7017035">Ingolstadt</placeName>.
                        <said>"You may easily believe,"</said> said he, <said>"how great was the
                        difficulty to persuade my father that it was not absolutely necessary for a
                        merchant not to understand any thing except book-keeping; and, indeed, I
                        believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constant answer to my
                        unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch school-master in the
                           <title>Vicar of Wakefield</title>: <said>"I have ten thousand florins a
                           year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek."</said> But his
                        affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has
                        permitted me to undertake <pb n="[106]" facs="images/106.jpg"/> a voyage of
                        discovery to the land of knowledge."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left my
                        father, brothers, and <persName>Elizabeth</persName>."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from you
                        so seldom. By the bye, I mean to lecture you a little upon their account
                        myself.—But, my dear <persName>Frankenstein</persName>,"</said> continued
                     he, stopping short, and gazing full in my face, <said>"I did not before remark
                        how very ill you appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been
                        watching for several nights."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one
                        occupation, that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see: but
                        I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an end, and
                        that I am at length free."</said></p>
                  <pb n="[107]" facs="images/107.jpg"/>
                  <p>I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to allude
                     to the occurrences of the preceding night. I walked with a quick pace, and we
                     soon arrived at my college. I then reflected, and the thought made me shiver,
                     that the creature whom I had left in my apartment might still be there, alive,
                     and walking about. I dreaded to behold this monster; but I feared still more
                     that <persName>Henry</persName> should see him. Entreating him therefore to
                     remain a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs, I darted up towards my own
                     room. My hand was already on the lock of the door before I recollected myself.
                     I then paused; and a cold shivering came over me. I threw the door forcibly
                     open, as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in
                     waiting for them on the other side; but nothing <pb n="[108]"
                        facs="images/108.jpg"/> appeared. I stepped fearfully in: the apartment was
                     empty; and my bed-room was also freed from its hideous guest. I could hardly
                     believe that so great a good-fortune could have befallen me; but when I became
                     assured that my enemy had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy, and ran down
                     to <persName>Clerval</persName>.</p>
                  <p>We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast; but I
                     was unable to contain myself. It was not joy only that possessed me; I felt my
                     flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse beat rapidly. I was
                     unable to remain for a single instant in the same place; I jumped over the
                     chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud. <persName>Clerval</persName> at
                     first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival; but when he observed
                     me more attentively, he saw a wildness in <pb n="[109]" facs="images/109.jpg"/>
                     my eyes for which he could not account; and my loud, unrestrained, heartless
                     laughter, frightened and astonished him.</p>
                  <p><said>"My dear <persName>Victor</persName>,"</said> cried he, <said>"what, for
                        God's sake, is the matter? Do not laugh in that manner. How ill you are!
                        What is the cause of all this?"</said></p>
                  <p><said>"Do not ask me,"</said> cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I
                     thought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; <said>"he can tell. —Oh,
                        save me! save me!"</said> I imagined that the monster seized me; I struggled
                     furiously, and fell down in a fit.</p>
                  <p>Poor <persName>Clerval</persName>! what must have been his feelings? A meeting,
                     which he anticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness. But I
                     was not the witness of his grief; for I was lifeless, and did not recover my
                     senses for a long, long time.</p>
                  <pb n="[110]" facs="images/110.jpg"/>
                  <p>This was the commencement of a nervous fever, which confined me for several
                     months. During all that time <persName>Henry</persName> was my only nurse. I
                     afterwards learned that, knowing my father's advanced age, and unfitness for so
                     long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make
                        <persName>Elizabeth</persName>, he spared them this grief by concealing the
                     extent of my disorder. He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive
                     nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he did not
                     doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest action that he
                     could towards them.</p>
                  <p>But I was in reality very ill; and surely nothing but the unbounded and
                     unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life. The form of
                     the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever before <pb n="[111]"
                        facs="images/111.jpg"/> my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him.
                     Doubtless my words surprised <persName>Henry</persName>: he at first believed
                     them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination; but the pertinacity with
                     which I continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder
                     indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.</p>
                  <p>By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and grieved my
                     friend, I recovered. I remember the first time I became capable of observing
                     outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I perceived that the fallen leaves
                     had disappeared, and that the young buds were shooting forth from the trees
                     that shaded my window. It was a divine spring; and the season contributed
                     greatly to my convalescence. I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive
                     in my bosom; my <pb n="[112]" facs="images/112.jpg"/> gloom disappeared, and in
                     a short time I became as cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal
                     passion.</p>
                  <p><said>"Dearest <persName>Clerval</persName>,"</said> exclaimed I, <said>"how
                        kind, how very good you are to me. This whole winter, instead of being spent
                        in study, as you promised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room. How
                        shall I ever repay you? I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment
                        of which I have been the occasion; but you will forgive me."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"You will repay me entirely, if you do not discompose yourself, but get
                        well as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I may
                        speak to you on one subject, may I not?"</said></p>
                  <p>I trembled. One subject! what could it be? Could he allude to an object on whom
                     I dared not even think?</p>
                  <pb n="[113]" facs="images/113.jpg"/>
                  <p><said>"Compose yourself,"</said> said <persName>Clerval</persName>, who
                     observed my change of colour, <said>"I will not mention it, if it agitates you;
                        but your father and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter
                        from you in your own handwriting. They hardly know how ill you have been,
                        and are uneasy at your long silence."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"Is that all? my dear <persName>Henry</persName>. How could you suppose
                        that my first thought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I
                        love, and who are so deserving of my love."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad to
                        see a letter that has been lying here some days for you: it is from your
                        cousin, I believe."</said></p></said>

                           <salute>MY DEAR COUSIN</salute></opener>
                        <p>I cannot describe to you the uneasiness we have all felt concerning your
                           health. We cannot help imagining that your friend
                              <persName>Clerval</persName> conceals the extent of your disorder: for
                           it is now several months since we have seen your hand-writing; and all
                           this time you have been obliged to dictate your letters to
                              <persName>Henry</persName>. Surely, <persName>Victor</persName>, you
                           must have <pb n="[115]" facs="images/115.jpg"/> been exceedingly ill; and
                           this makes us all very wretched, as much so nearly as after the death of
                           your dear mother. My uncle was almost persuaded that you were indeed
                           dangerously ill, and could hardly be restrained from undertaking a
                           journey to <placeName type="tgn" key="7017035">Ingolstadt</placeName>.
                              <persName>Clerval</persName> always writes that you are getting
                           better; I eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in
                           your own hand-writing; for indeed, indeed, <persName>Victor</persName>,
                           we are all very miserable on this account. Relieve us from this fear, and
                           we shall be the happiest creatures in the world. Your father's health is
                           now so vigorous, that he appears ten years younger since last winter.
                              <persName>Ernest</persName> also is so much improved, that you would
                           hardly know him: he is now nearly sixteen, and has lost that sickly
                           appearance which he had some years ago; he is grown quite robust and
                           active.</p>
                        <pb n="[116]" facs="images/116.jpg"/>
                        <p>My uncle and I conversed a long time last night about what profession
                              <persName>Ernest</persName> should follow. His constant illness when
                           young has deprived him of the habits of application; and now that he
                           enjoys good health, he is continually in the open air, climbing the
                           hills, or rowing on the lake. I therefore proposed that he should be a
                           farmer; which you know, Cousin, is a favourite scheme of mine. A farmer's
                           is a very healthy happy life; and the least hurtful, or rather the most
                           beneficial profession of any. My uncle had an idea of his being educated
                           as an advocate, that through his interest he might become a judge. But,
                           besides that he is not at all fitted for such an occupation, it is
                           certainly more creditable to cultivate the earth for the sustenance of
                           man, than to be the confidant, and sometimes the accomplice, of his
                           vices; which is <pb n="[117]" facs="images/117.jpg"/> the profession of a
                           lawyer. I said, that the employments of a prosperous farmer, if they were
                           not a more honourable, they were at least a happier species of occupation
                           than that of a judge, whose misfortune it was always to meddle with the
                           dark side of human nature. My uncle smiled, and said, that I ought to be
                           an advocate myself, which put an end to the conversation on that
                           subject.</p>
                        <p>And now I must tell you a story that will please, and perhaps amuse you.
                           Do you not remember <persName>Justine Moritz</persName>? Probably you do
                           not; I will relate her history, therefore, in a few words. Madame
                              <persName>Moritz</persName>, her mother, was a widow with four
                           children, of whom <persName>Justine</persName> was the third. This girl
                           had always been the favourite of her father; but, through a strange
                           perversity, her mother could not endure <pb n="[118]"
                              facs="images/118.jpg"/> her, and, after the death of M.
                              <persName>Moritz</persName>, treated her very ill. My aunt observed
                           this; and, when <persName>Justine</persName> was twelve years of age,
                           prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at her house. The republican
                           institutions of our country have produced simpler and happier manners
                           than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it. Hence
                           there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants;
                           and the lower orders being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners
                           are more refined and moral. A servant in <placeName type="tgn"
                              key="7003746">Geneva</placeName> does not mean the same thing as a
                           servant in <placeName type="tgn" key="1000070">France</placeName> and
                              <placeName type="tgn" key="7002445">England</placeName>.
                              <persName>Justine</persName>, thus received in our family, learned the
                           duties of a servant; a condition which, in our fortunate country, does
                           not include the idea of ignorance, and a sacrifice of the dignity of a
                           human being.</p>
                        <pb n="[119]" facs="images/119.jpg"/>
                        <p>After what I have said, I dare say you well remember the heroine of my
                           little tale: for <persName>Justine</persName> was a great favourite of
                           your's; and I recollect you once remarked, that if you were in an ill
                           humour, one glance from <persName>Justine</persName> could dissipate it,
                           for the same reason that <persName type="n79041715" key="n79041715"
                              >Ariosto</persName> gives concerning the beauty of
                           <ref target="#angelica" xml:id="angelicaA"><persName>Angelica</persName></ref>—she looked so frank-hearted and happy.
                           My aunt conceived a great attachment for her, by which she was induced to
                           give her an education superior to that which she had at first intended.
                           This benefit was fully repaid; <persName>Justine</persName> was the most
                           grateful little creature in the world: I do not mean that she made any
                           professions, I never heard one pass her lips; but you could see by her
                           eyes that she almost adored her protectress. Although her disposition was
                           gay, and in many respects inconsiderate, yet she paid the <pb n="[120]"
                              facs="images/120.jpg"/> greatest attention to every gesture of my
                           aunt. She thought her the model of all excellence, and endeavoured to
                           imitate her phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds
                           me of her.</p>
                        <p>When my dearest aunt died, everyone was too much occupied in their own
                           grief to notice poor <persName>Justine</persName>, who had attended her
                           during her illness with the most anxious affection. Poor
                              <persName>Justine</persName> was very ill; but other trials were
                           reserved for her.</p>
                        <p>One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the
                           exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless. The conscience
                           of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the deaths of her
                           favourites was a judgment from heaven to chastise her partiality. She was
                           a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor confirmed <pb n="[121]"
                              facs="images/121.jpg"/> the idea which she had conceived. Accordingly,
                           a few months after your departure for <placeName type="tgn" key="7017035"
                              >Ingolstadt</placeName>, <persName>Justine</persName> was called home
                           by her repentant mother. Poor girl! she wept when she quitted our house:
                           she was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness
                           and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable
                           for vivacity. Nor was her residence at her mother's house of a nature to
                           restore her gaiety. The poor woman was very vacillating in her
                           repentance. She sometimes begged <persName>Justine</persName> to forgive
                           her unkindness, but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths
                           of her brothers and sister. Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame
                              <persName>Moritz</persName> into a decline, which at first increased
                           her irritability, but she is now at peace forever. She died on the first
                           approach of cold <pb n="[122 - page breaks after 'wea']"
                              facs="images/122.jpg"/> weather, at the beginning of this last winter.
                              <persName>Justine</persName> has returned to us; and I assure you I
                           love her tenderly. She is very clever and gentle, and extremely pretty;
                           as I mentioned before, her mien and her expressions continually remind me
                           of my dear aunt.</p>
                        <p>I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling
                              <persName>William</persName>. I wish you could see him; he is very
                           tall of his age, with sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eye-lashes, and
                           curling hair. When he smiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek,
                           which are rosy with health. He has already had one or two little wives,
                           but <persName>Louisa Biron</persName> is his favourite, a pretty little
                           girl of five years of age.</p>
                        <p>Now, dear <persName>Victor</persName>, I dare say you wish to be indulged
                           in a little gossip concerning the good people of <placeName type="tgn"
                              key="7003746">Geneva</placeName>. The pretty Miss

                              facs="images/123.jpg"/> received the congratulatory visits on her
                           approaching marriage with a young Englishman, <persName>John
                              Melbourne</persName>, Esq. Her ugly sister,
                           <persName>Manon</persName>, married M. <persName>Duvillard</persName>,
                           the rich banker, last autumn. Your favourite schoolfellow,
                              <persName>Louis Manoir</persName>, has suffered several misfortunes
                           since the departure of <persName>Clerval</persName> from Geneva. But he
                           has already recovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of
                           marrying a very lively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame
                              <persName>Tavernier</persName>. She is a widow, and much older than
                              <persName>Manoir</persName>; but she is very much admired, and a
                           favourite with every body.</p>
                        <p>I have written myself into good spirits, dear cousin; yet I cannot
                           conclude without again anxiously inquiring concerning your health. Dear
                              <persName>Victor</persName>, if you are not very ill, write yourself,
                           and make your father and all <pb n="[124]" facs="images/124.jpg"/> of us
                           happy; or -- I cannot bear to think of the other side of the question; my
                           tears already flow. Adieu, my dearest cousin.</p>

                  <p><said>"Dear, dear <persName>Elizabeth</persName>!"</said> I exclaimed when I
                     had read her letter, <said>"I will write instantly, and relieve them from the
                        anxiety they must feel."</said> I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued
                     me; but my convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly. In another
                     fortnight I was able to leave my chamber.</p>
                  <p>One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce
                        <persName>Clerval</persName> to the several professors of the university. In
                     doing this, I underwent a kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my
                     mind had sustained. Ever since the <pb n="[125]" facs="images/125.jpg"/> fatal
                     night, the end of my labours, and the beginning of my misfortunes, I had
                     conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of <rs
                        content="#natural_philosophy">natural philosophy</rs>. When I was otherwise
                     quite restored to health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all
                     the agony of my nervous symptoms. <persName>Henry</persName> saw this, and had
                     removed all my apparatus from my view. He had also changed my apartment; for he
                     perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been
                     my laboratory. But these cares of <persName>Clerval</persName> were made of no
                     avail when I visited the professors. M. <persName>Waldman</persName> inflicted
                     torture when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I
                     had made in the sciences. He soon perceived that I disliked the subject; but,
                     not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to modesty, and <pb
                        n="[126]" facs="images/126.jpg"/> changed the subject from my improvement to
                     the science itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out. What
                     could I do? He meant to please, and he tormented me. I felt as if he had placed
                     carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards
                     used in putting me to a slow and cruel death. I writhed under his words, yet
                     dared not exhibit the pain I felt. <persName>Clerval</persName>, whose eyes and
                     feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of others, declined the
                     subject, alleging, in excuse, his total ignorance; and the conversation took a
                     more general turn. I thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak. I
                     saw plainly that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret
                     from me; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence
                     that knew no <pb n="[127]" facs="images/127.jpg"/> bounds, yet I could never
                     persuade myself to confide to him that event which was so often present to my
                     recollection, but which I feared the detail to another would only impress more
                     deeply.</p>
                  <p>M. <persName>Krempe</persName> was not equally docile; and in my condition at
                     that time, of almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums
                     gave me even more pain than the benevolent approbation of M.
                        <persName>Waldman</persName>. <said>"D--n the fellow!"</said> cried he;
                        <said>"why, M. <persName>Clerval</persName>, I assure you he has outstript
                        us all. Aye, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true. A youngster
                        who, but a few years ago, believed <persName type="lccn" key="n80043375"><rs
                              content="#agrippa">Cornelius Agrippa</rs></persName> as firmly as the
                        gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if he is not
                        soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.—Aye, aye,"</said>
                     continued he, <pb n="[128 - page breaks after 'ob-']" facs="images/128.jpg"/>
                     observing my face expressive of suffering, <said>"M.
                           <persName>Frankenstein</persName> is modest; an excellent quality in a
                        young man. Young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M.
                           <persName>Clerval</persName>; I was myself when young; but that wears out
                        in a very short time."</said></p>
                  <p>M. <persName>Krempe</persName> had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which
                     happily turned the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.</p>
                  <p><persName>Clerval</persName> was no natural philosopher. His imagination was
                     too vivid for the minutiae of science. Languages were his principal study; and
                     he sought, but acquiring their elements, to open a field for self-instruction
                     on his return to <placeName type="tgn" key="7003746">Geneva</placeName>.
                     Persian, Arabic, and Hebrew, gained his attention, after he had made himself
                     perfectly master of Greek and Latin. For my own part, idleness had ever been
                     irksome to me, and now that I wished <pb n="[129]" facs="images/129.jpg"/> to
                     fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt great relief in being
                     the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not only instruction but consolation
                     in the works of the orientalists. Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy
                     elevating to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of any other
                     country. When you read their writings, life appears to consist in a warm sun
                     and garden of roses, in the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy, and the fire
                     that consumes your own heart. How different from the manly and heroical poetry
                     of <placeName type="tgn" key="1000074">Greece</placeName> and <placeName
                        type="tgn" key="7000874">Rome</placeName>.</p>
                  <p>Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to <placeName type="tgn"
                        key="7003746">Geneva</placeName> was fixed for the latter end of autumn; but
                     being delayed by several accidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were
                     deemed impassable, and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring. <pb
                        n="[130]" facs="images/130.jpg"/> I felt this delay very bitterly; for I
                     longed to see my native town, and my beloved friends. My return had only been
                     delayed so long from an unwillingness to leave <persName>Clerval</persName> in
                     a strange place, before he had become acquainted with any of its inhabitants.
                     The winter, however, was spent cheerfully; and although the spring was
                     uncommonly late, when it came, its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.</p>
                  <p>The month of <date>May</date> had already commenced, and I expected the letter
                     daily which was to fix the date of my departure, when
                        <persName>Henry</persName> proposed a pedestrian tour in the environs of
                        <placeName type="tgn" key="7017035">Ingolstadt</placeName> that I might bid
                     a personal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited. I acceded with
                     pleasure to this proposition: I was fond of exercise, and
                        <persName>Clerval</persName> had always been my favourite companion in the
                     rambles of this nature that I had <pb n="[131]" facs="images/131.jpg"/> taken
                     among the scenes of my native country.</p>
                  <p>We passed a fortnight in these perambulations; my health and spirits had long
                     been restored, and they gained additional strength from the salubrious air I
                     breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and the conversation of my
                     friend. Study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my
                     fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but <persName>Clerval</persName>
                     called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught me to love the
                     aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children. Excellent friend! how
                     sincerely did you love me, and endeavour to elevate my mind, until it was on a
                     level with your own. A selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your
                     gentleness and affection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy
                     creature who, <pb n="[132]" facs="images/132.jpg"/> a few years ago, loving and
                     beloved by all, had no sorrow or care. When happy, inanimate nature had the
                     power of bestowing on me the most delightful sensations. A serene sky and
                     verdant fields filled me with ecstasy. The present season was indeed divine;
                     the flowers of spring bloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already
                     in bud: I was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had
                     pressed upon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an
                     invincible burden.</p>
                  <p><persName>Henry</persName> rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathized in
                     my feelings: he exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations
                     that filled his soul. The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly
                     astonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in
                     imitation <pb n="[133]" facs="images/133.jpg"/> of the Persian and Arabic
                     writers, he invented tales of wonderful fancy and passion. At other times he
                     repeated my favourite poems, or drew me out into arguments, which he supported
                     with great ingenuity.</p>
                  <p>We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were dancing,
                     and every one we met appeared gay and happy. My own spirits were high, and I
                     bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.</p></said>

                  <floatingText>
                     <body>
                        <opener>To <persName>V. FRANKENSTEIN.</persName>
                           <salute>MY DEAR VICTOR,</salute></opener>

                        <p>You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your
                           return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few lines,
                           merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you. But that would be
                           a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it. What would be your surprise, my
                           son, when <pb n="[135]" facs="images/135.jpg"/> you expected a happy and
                           gay welcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness? And how,
                              <persName>Victor</persName>, can I relate our misfortune? Absence
                           cannot have rendered you callous to our joys and griefs; and how shall I
                           inflict pain on an absent child? I wish to prepare you for the woeful
                           news, but I know it is impossible; even now your eye skims over the page,
                           to seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings.</p>
                        <p><persName>William</persName> is dead!—that sweet child, whose smiles
                           delighted and warmed my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay!
                              <persName>Victor</persName>, he is murdered!</p>
                        <p>I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the
                           circumstances of the transaction.</p>
                        <p>Last Thursday (<date>May 7th</date>) I, my niece, and your two brothers,
                           went to walk in <placeName type="tgn" key="4012616"
                              >Plainpalais</placeName>. The evening was <pb n="[136]"
                              facs="images/136.jpg"/> warm and serene, and we prolonged our walk
                           farther than usual. It was already dusk before we thought of returning;
                           and then we discovered that <persName>William</persName> and
                              <persName>Ernest</persName>, who had gone on before, were not to be
                           found. We accordingly rested on a seat until they should return.
                           Presently <persName>Ernest</persName> came, and inquired if we had seen
                           his brother: he said, that they had been playing together, that
                              <persName>William</persName> had run away to hide himself, and that he
                           vainly sought for him, and afterwards waited for him a long time, but
                           that he did not return.</p>
                        <p>This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him until
                           night fell, when <persName>Elizabeth</persName> conjectured that he might
                           have returned to the house. He was not there. We returned again, with
                           torches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet <pb n="[137]"
                              facs="images/137.jpg"/> boy had lost himself, and was exposed to all
                           the damps and dews of night; <persName>Elizabeth</persName> also suffered
                           extreme anguish. About five in the morning I discovered my lovely boy,
                           whom the night before I had seen blooming and active in health, stretched
                           on the grass livid and motionless: the print of the murderer's finger was
                           on his neck.</p>
                        <p>He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my countenance
                           betrayed the secret to <persName>Elizabeth</persName>. She was very
                           earnest to see the corpse. At first I attempted to prevent her; but she
                           persisted, and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck
                           of the victim, and clasping her hands, exclaimed, O God! I have murdered
                           my darling infant!</p>
                        <p>She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she again
                           lived, it was only to weep and sigh. <pb n="[138]" facs="images/138.jpg"
                           /> She told me that that same evening <persName>William</persName> had
                           teazed her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that she possessed
                           of your mother. This picture is gone, and was doubtless the temptation
                           which urged the murderer to the deed. We have no trace of him at present,
                           although our exertions to discover him are unremitted; but they will not
                           restore my beloved <persName>William</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Come, dearest <persName>Victor</persName>; you alone can console
                              <persName>Elizabeth</persName>. She weeps continually, and accuses
                           herself unjustly as the cause of his death; her words pierce my heart. We
                           are all unhappy; but will not that be an additional motive for you, my
                           son, to return and be our comforter? Your dear mother! Alas,
                              <persName>Victor</persName>! I now say, Thank God she did not live to
                           witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!</p>
                        <p>Come, <persName>Victor</persName>; not brooding thoughts <pb n="[139]"
                              facs="images/139.jpg"/> of vengeance against the assassin, but with
                           feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of festering
                           the wounds of our minds. Enter the house of mourning, my friend, but with
                           kindness and affection for those who love you, and not with hatred for
                           your enemies.</p>

                  <p><persName>Clerval</persName>, who had watched my countenance as I read this
                     letter, was surprised to observe the despair that succeeded to the joy I at
                     first expressed on receiving news from my friends. I threw the letter on the
                     table, and covered my face with my hands.</p>
                  <p><said>"My dear <persName>Frankenstein</persName>,"</said> exclaimed
                        <persName>Henry</persName>, when he perceived me weep with bitterness,
                        <said>"are you always to be <pb n="[140]" facs="images/140.jpg"/> unhappy?
                        My dear friend, what has happened?"</said></p>
                  <p>I motioned to him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the room in
                     the extremest agitation. Tears also gushed from the eyes of
                        <persName>Clerval</persName>, as he read the account of my misfortune.</p>
                  <p><said>"I can offer you no consolation, my friend,"</said> said he; <said>"your
                        disaster is irreparable. What do you intend to do?"</said></p>
                  <p><said>"To go instantly to <placeName type="tgn" key="7003746"
                           >Geneva</placeName>: come with me, <persName>Henry</persName>, to order
                        the horses."</said></p>
                  <p>During our walk, <persName>Clerval</persName> endeavoured to raise my spirits.
                     He did not do this by common topics of consolation, but by exhibiting the
                     truest sympathy. <said>"Poor <persName>William</persName>!"</said> said he,
                        <said>"that dear child; he now sleeps with his angel mother. His friends
                        mourn and weep, but he is at rest: he does not <pb n="[141]"
                           facs="images/141.jpg"/> now feel the murderer's grasp; a sod covers his
                        gentle form, and he knows no pain. He can no longer be a fit subject for
                        pity; the survivors are the greatest sufferers, and for them time is the
                        only consolation. Those maxims of the Stoics, that death was no evil, and
                        that the mind of man ought to be superior to despair on the eternal absence
                        of a beloved object, ought not to be urged. <rs content="#cato"
                           xml:id="catoA">Even Cato wept over the dead body of his
                        brother</rs>."</said></p>
                  <p><persName>Clerval</persName> spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the
                     words impressed themselves on my mind, and I remembered them afterwards in
                     solitude. But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a cabriole,
                     and bade farewell to my friend.</p>
                  <p>My journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed to
                     console and sympathize with <pb n="[142]" facs="images/142.jpg"/> my loved and
                     sorrowing friends; but when I drew near my native town, I slackened my
                     progress. I could hardly sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my
                     mind. I passed through scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen
                     for nearly six years. How altered every thing might be during that time? One
                     sudden and desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little
                     circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although
                     they were done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. Fear overcame
                     me; I dared not advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me
                     tremble, although I was unable to define them.</p>
                  <p>I remained two days at <placeName type="tgn" key="7007299"
                     >Lausanne</placeName>, in this painful state of mind. I contemplated the lake:
                     the waters were placid; all around was calm, and the snowy <pb n="[143]"
                        facs="images/143.jpg"/> mountains, <said>"the palaces of nature,"</said>
                     were not changed. By degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I
                     continued my journey towards <placeName type="tgn" key="7003746"
                        >Geneva</placeName>.</p>
                  <p>The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I approached my
                     native town. I discovered more distinctly the black sides of <placeName
                        type="tgn" key="1109172">Jura</placeName>, and the bright summit of
                        <placeName type="tgn" key="7617157">Mont Blanc</placeName>; I wept like a
                     child: <said>"Dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your
                        wanderer? Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and placid. Is
                        this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?"</said></p>
                  <p>I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on these
                     preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative happiness, and I
                     think of them with pleasure. My <pb n="[144]" facs="images/144.jpg"/> country,
                     my beloved country! who but a native can tell the delight I took in again
                     beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely lake!</p>
                  <p>Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night also closed
                     around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still more
                     gloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I foresaw
                     obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human beings.
                     Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single circumstance, that in
                     all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not conceive the hundredth part of
                     the anguish I was destined to endure.</p>
                  <p>It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of <placeName type="tgn"
                        key="7003746">Geneva</placeName>; the gates of the town were already shut;
                     and I was obliged to pass the night at <pb n="[145]" facs="images/145.jpg"/>
                     <placeName type="tgn" key="8703954">Secheron</placeName>, a village half a
                     league to the east of the city. The sky was serene; and, as I was unable to
                     rest, I resolved to visit the spot where my poor <persName>William</persName>
                     had been murdered. As I could not pass through the town, I was obliged to cross
                     the lake in a boat to arrive at <placeName type="tgn" key="4012616"
                        >Plainpalais</placeName>. During this short voyage I saw the lightnings
                     playing on the summit of <placeName type="tgn" key="7617157">Mont
                        Blanc</placeName> in the most beautiful figures. The storm appeared to
                     approach rapidly; and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe
                     its progress. It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain
                     coming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.</p>
                  <p>I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm increased
                     every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head. It was
                     echoed from <placeName type="tgn" key="1106285">Salêve</placeName>, the <pb

                     <placeName type="tgn" key="1109172">Juras</placeName>, and the <placeName
                        type="tgn" key="7007768">Alps of Savoy</placeName>; vivid flashes of
                     lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the lake, making it appear like a vast
                     sheet of fire; then for an instant everything seemed of a pitchy darkness,
                     until the eye recovered itself from the preceding flash. The storm, as is often
                     the case in <ref target="#switzerland" xml:id="switzerlandA"><placeName type="tgn" key="7011731">Switzerland</placeName></ref>,
                     appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The most violent storm hung
                     exactly north of the town, over that part of the lake which lies between the
                     promontory of <placeName type="tgn" key="8703247">Belrive</placeName> and the
                     village of <placeName type="tgn" key="1064001" cert="medium">Copêt</placeName>.
                     Another storm enlightened <placeName type="tgn" key="1109172">Jura</placeName>
                     with faint flashes; and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the <placeName
                        type="tgn" key="7631625">Môle</placeName>, a peaked mountain to the east of
                     the lake.</p>
                  <p><ref target="#lightning" xml:id="lightningA">While I watched the storm, so beautiful yet terrific</ref>, I wandered on with a
                     hasty step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my hands,
                        <pb n="[147]" facs="images/147.jpg"/> and exclaimed aloud,
                           <said>"<persName>William</persName>, dear angel! this is thy funeral,
                        this thy dirge!"</said> As I said these words, I perceived in the gloom a
                     figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood fixed, gazing
                     intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning illuminated the object,
                     and discovered its shape plainly to me; its gigantic stature, and the deformity
                     of its aspect, more hideous than belongs to humanity, instantly informed me
                     that it was the wretch, the filthy dæmon, to whom I had given life. What did he
                     there? Could he be (I shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother?
                     No sooner did that idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its
                     truth; my teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support.
                     The figure passed me quickly, and I lost <pb n="[148]" facs="images/148.jpg"/>
                     it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could have destroyed that fair child.
                     He was the murderer! I could not doubt it. The mere presence of the idea was an
                     irresistible proof of the fact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would
                     have been in vain, for another flash discovered him to me hanging among the
                     rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of <placeName type="tgn" key="1106285"
                        >Mont Salêve</placeName>, a hill that bounds <placeName type="tgn"
                        key="4012616">Plainpalais</placeName> on the south. He soon reached the
                     summit, and disappeared.</p>
                  <p>I remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain still continued, and
                     the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I revolved in my mind the
                     events which I had until now sought to forget: the whole train of my progress
                     towards the creation; the appearance of the work of my own hands alive at my
                     bed-side; its <pb n="[149 - page breaks after 'depar-']" facs="images/149.jpg"
                     /> departure. Two years had now nearly elapsed since the night on which he
                     first received life; and was this his first crime? Alas! I had turned loose
                     into the world a depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had
                     he not murdered my brother?</p>
                  <p>No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the night,
                     which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not feel the
                     inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and
                     despair. I considered the being whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with
                     the will and power to effect purposes of horror, such as the deed which he had
                     now done, nearly in the light of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from
                     the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to me.</p>
                  <p>Day dawned; and I directed my steps <pb n="[150]" facs="images/150.jpg"/>
                     towards the town. The gates were open; and I hastened to my father's house. My
                     first thought was to discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant
                     pursuit to be made. But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to
                     tell. A being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at
                     midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain. I remembered also
                     the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at the time that I dated my
                     creation, and which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so
                     utterly improbable. I well knew that if any other had communicated such a
                     relation to me, I should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity.
                     Besides, the strange nature of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I
                     were so far credited as to persuade my relatives to commence it. <pb n="[151]"
                        facs="images/151.jpg"/> Besides, of what use would be pursuit? Who could
                     arrest a creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of <placeName
                        type="tgn" key="1106285">Mont Salêve</placeName>? These reflections
                     determined me, and I resolved to remain silent.</p>
                  <p>It was about five in the morning when I entered my father's house. I told the
                     servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library to attend their
                     usual hour of rising.</p>
                  <p>Six years had elapsed, passed as a dream but for one indelible trace, and I
                     stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my departure
                     for <placeName type="tgn" key="7017035">Ingolstadt</placeName>. Beloved and
                     respectable parent! He still remained to me. I gazed on the picture of my
                     mother, which stood over the mantlepiece. It was an historical subject, painted
                     at my father's desire, and represented <persName>Caroline Beaufort</persName>
                     in an <pb n="[152 - page breaks after 'ago-']" facs="images/152.jpg"/> agony of
                     despair, kneeling by the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and
                     her cheek pale; but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly
                     permitted the sentiment of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of
                        <persName>William</persName>; and my tears flowed when I looked upon it.
                     While I was thus engaged, <persName>Ernest</persName> entered: he had heard me
                     arrive, and hastened to welcome me. He expressed a sorrowful delight to see me:
                        <said>"Welcome, my dearest <persName>Victor</persName>,"</said> said he.
                        <said>"Ah! I wish you had come three months ago, and then you would have
                        found us all joyous and delighted. But we are now unhappy; and, I am afraid,
                        tears instead of smiles will be your welcome. Our father looks so sorrowful:
                        this dreadful event seems to have revived in his mind his grief on the death
                        of Mamma. Poor <persName>Elizabeth</persName> also is quite
                        inconsolable."</said>
                     <pb n="[153 - page breaks after 'Er-']" facs="images/153.jpg"/>
                     <persName>Ernest</persName> began to weep as he said these words.</p>
                  <p><said>"Do not,"</said> said I, <said>"welcome me thus; try to be more calm,
                        that I may not be absolutely miserable the moment I enter my father's house
                        after so long an absence. But, tell me, how does my father support his
                        misfortunes? and how is my poor <persName>Elizabeth</persName>?"</said></p>
                  <p><said>"She indeed requires consolation; she accused herself of having caused
                        the death of my brother, and that made her very wretched. But since the
                        murderer has been discovered—"</said></p>
                  <p><said>"The murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be? who could attempt to
                        pursue him? it is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the winds,
                        or confine a mountain-stream with a straw."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"I do not know what you mean; but we were all very unhappy when <pb
                           n="[153]" facs="images/153.jpg"/> she was discovered. No one would
                        believe it at first; and even now <persName>Elizabeth</persName> will not be
                        convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed, who would credit that
                           <persName>Justine Moritz</persName>, who was so amiable, and fond of all
                        the family, could all at once become so extremely wicked?"</said></p>
                  <p><said>"<persName>Justine Moritz</persName>! Poor, poor girl, is she the
                        accused? But it is wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it,
                        surely, <persName>Ernest</persName>?"</said></p>
                  <p><said>"No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have
                        almost forced conviction upon us: and her own behaviour has been so
                        confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear, leaves
                        no hope for doubt. But she will be tried to-day, and you will then hear
                        all."</said></p>
                  <p>He related that, the morning on which the murder of poor
                        <persName>William</persName> had <pb n="[155]" facs="images/155.jpg"/> been
                     discovered, <persName>Justine</persName> had been taken ill, and confined to
                     her bed; and, after several days, one of the servants, happening to examine the
                     apparel she had worn on the night of the murder, had discovered in her pocket
                     the picture of my mother, which had been judged to be the temptation of the
                     murderer. The servant instantly shewed it to one of the others, who, without
                     saying a word to any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their
                     deposition, <persName>Justine</persName> was apprehended. On being charged with
                     the fact, the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her
                     extreme confusion of manner.</p>
                  <p>This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied
                     earnestly, <said>"You are all mistaken; I know the murderer.
                           <persName>Justine</persName>, poor, good <persName>Justine</persName>, is
                        innocent."</said></p>
                  <pb n="[156]" facs="images/156.jpg"/>
                  <p>At that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness deeply impressed on his
                     countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and, after we had
                     exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced some other topic than
                     that of our disaster, had not <persName>Ernest</persName> exclaimed,
                        <said>"Good God, Papa! <persName>Victor</persName> says that he knows who
                        was the murderer of poor William."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"We do also, unfortunately,"</said> replied my father; <said>"for indeed
                        I had rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much
                        depravity and ingratitude in one I valued so highly."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"My dear father, you are mistaken; <persName>Justine</persName> is
                        innocent."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is to be
                        tried to-day, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be
                        acquitted."</said></p>
                  <pb n="[157]" facs="images/157.jpg"/>
                  <p>This speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind that
                        <persName>Justine</persName>, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of
                     this murder. I had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could
                     be brought forward strong enough to convict her; and, in this assurance, I
                     calmed myself, expecting the trial with eagerness, but without prognosticating
                     an evil result.</p>
                  <p>We were soon joined by <persName>Elizabeth</persName>. Time had made great
                     alterations in her form since I had last beheld her. Six years before she had
                     been a pretty, good-humoured girl, whom every one loved and caressed. She was
                     now a woman in stature and expression of countenance, which was uncommonly
                     lovely. An open and capacious forehead gave indications of a good
                     understanding, joined to great frankness of disposition. Her eyes were hazel,
                     and <pb n="[158]" facs="images/158.jpg"/> expressive of mildness, now through
                     recent affliction allied to sadness. Her hair was of a rich dark auburn, her
                     complexion fair, and her figure slight and graceful. She welcomed me with the
                     greatest affection. <said>"Your arrival, my dear cousin,"</said> said she,
                        <said>"fills me with hope. You perhaps will find some means to justify my
                        poor guiltless <persName>Justine</persName>. Alas! who is safe, if she be
                        convicted of crime? I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do upon my
                        own. Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only lost that lovely
                        darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely love, is to be torn away
                        by even a worse fate. If she is condemned, I never shall know joy more. But
                        she will not, I am sure she will not; and then I shall be happy again, even
                        after the sad death of my little <persName>William</persName>."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"She is innocent, my <persName>Elizabeth</persName>,"</said>
                     <pb n="[159]" facs="images/159.jpg"/> said I, <said>"and that shall be proved;
                        fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her
                        acquittal."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"How kind you are! every one else believes in her guilt, and that made me
                        wretched; for I knew that it was impossible: and to see every one else
                        prejudiced in so deadly a manner, rendered me hopeless and
                        despairing."</said> She wept.</p>
                  <p><said>"Sweet niece,"</said> said my father, <said>"dry your tears. If she is,
                        as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our judges, and the
                        activity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of
                        partiality."</said></p></said>

               <said><p>WE passed a few sad hours, until eleven o'clock, when the trial was to
                     commence. My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as
                     witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of this wretched
                     mockery of justice, I suffered living torture. It was to be decided, whether
                     the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would cause the death of two of
                     my fellow-beings: one a smiling babe, full of innocence and joy; the other far
                     more dreadfully murdered, with every aggravation of <pb
                        n="[161 - page breaks after 'in-']" facs="images/161.jpg"/> infamy that
                     could make the murder memorable in horror. <persName>Justine</persName> also
                     was a girl of merit, and possessed qualities which promised to render her life
                     happy: now all was to be obliterated in an ignominious grave; and I the cause!
                     A thousand times rather would I have confessed myself guilty of the crime
                     ascribed to <persName>Justine</persName>; but I was absent when it was
                     committed, and such a declaration would have been considered as the ravings of
                     a madman, and would not have exculpated her who suffered through me.</p>
                  <p>The appearance of <persName>Justine</persName> was calm. She was dressed in
                     mourning; and her countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity
                     of her feelings, exquisitely beautiful. Yet she appeared confident in
                     innocence, and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by thousands;
                     for all the <pb n="[162]" facs="images/162.jpg"/> kindness which her beauty
                     might otherwise have excited, was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by
                     the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. She was
                     tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as her confusion
                     had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she worked up her mind to an
                     appearance of courage. When she entered the court, she threw her eyes round it,
                     and quickly discovered where we were seated. A tear seemed to dim her eye when
                     she saw us; but she quickly recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful
                     affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness.</p>
                  <p>The trial began; and after the advocate against her had stated the charge,
                     several witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined against her,
                     which might have staggered any one <pb n="[163]" facs="images/163.jpg"/> who
                     had not such proof of her innocence as I had. She had been out the whole of the
                     night on which the murder had been committed, and towards morning had been
                     perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the
                     murdered child had been afterwards found. The woman asked her what she did
                     there; but she looked very strangely, and only returned a confused and
                     unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about eight o'clock; and when
                     one inquired where she had passed the night, she replied, that she had been
                     looking for the child, and demanded earnestly, if any thing had been heard
                     concerning him. When shewn the body, she fell into violent hysterics, and kept
                     her bed for several days. The picture was then produced, which the servant had
                     found in her pocket; and when <persName>Elizabeth</persName>, in <pb n="[164]"
                        facs="images/164.jpg"/> a faltering voice, proved that it was the same
                     which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round his neck,
                     a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.</p>
                  <p><persName>Justine</persName> was called on for her defence. As the trial had
                     proceeded, her countenance had altered. Surprise, horror, and misery, were
                     strongly expressed. Sometimes she struggled with her tears; but when she was
                     desired to plead, she collected her powers, and spoke in an audible although
                     variable voice:—</p>
                  <p><said>"God knows,"</said> she said, <said>"how entirely I am innocent. But I do
                        not pretend that my protestations should acquit me: I rest my innocence on a
                        plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced against
                        me; and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my judges to a
                        favourable interpretation, where <pb n="[165]" facs="images/165.jpg"/> any
                        circumstance appears doubtful or suspicious."</said></p>
                  <p>She then related that, by the permission of <persName>Elizabeth</persName>, she
                     had passed the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed, at
                     the house of an aunt at <placeName type="tgn" key="8700245">Chêne</placeName>,
                     a village situated at about a league from <placeName type="tgn" key="7003746"
                        >Geneva</placeName>. On her return, at about nine o'clock, she met a man,
                     who asked her if she had seen any thing of the child who was lost. She was
                     alarmed by this account, and passed several hours in looking for him, when the
                     gates of <placeName type="tgn" key="7003746">Geneva</placeName> were shut, and
                     she was forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a
                     cottage, being unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well
                     known. Unable to rest or sleep, she quitted her asylum early, that she might
                     again endeavour to find my brother. If she had gone near the spot <pb n="[166]"
                        facs="images/166.jpg"/> where his body lay, it was without her knowledge.
                     That she had been bewildered when questioned by the market-woman, was not
                     surprising, since she had passed a sleepless night, and the fate of poor
                        <persName>William</persName> was yet uncertain. Concerning the picture she
                     could give no account.</p>
                  <p><said>"I know,"</said> continued the unhappy victim, <said>"how heavily and
                        fatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of
                        explaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left
                        to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been
                        placed in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe that I have no
                        enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me
                        wantonly. Did the murderer place it there? I know of no opportunity afforded
                        him <pb n="[167]" facs="images/167.jpg"/> for so doing; or if I had, why
                        should he have stolen the jewel, to part with it again so soon?"</said></p>
                  <p><said>"I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for
                        hope. I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my
                        character; and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt, I
                        must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my
                        innocence."</said></p>
                  <p>Several witnesses were called, who had known her for many years, and they spoke
                     well of her; but fear, and hatred of the crime of which they supposed her
                     guilty, rendered them timorous, and unwilling to come forward.
                        <persName>Elizabeth</persName> saw even this last resource, her excellent
                     dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused, when,
                     although violently <pb n="[168 - page breaks after 'agi']"
                        facs="images/168.jpg"/> agitated, she desired permission to address the
                     court.</p>
                  <p><said>"I am,"</said> said she, <said>"the cousin of the unhappy child who was
                        murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have lived with
                        his parents ever since and even long before his birth. It may therefore be
                        judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion; but when I see a
                        fellow-creature about to perish through the cowardice of her pretended
                        friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I know of her
                        character. I am well acquainted with the accused. I have lived in the same
                        house with her, at one time for five, and at another for nearly two years.
                        During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and benevolent of
                        human creatures. She nursed Madame <persName>Frankenstein</persName>, my
                        aunt, in her last illness with the greatest affection and care; and <pb
                           n="[169]" facs="images/169.jpg"/> afterwards attended her own mother
                        during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited the admiration of all who
                        knew her. After which she again lived in my uncle's house, where she was
                        beloved by all the family. She was warmly attached to the child who is now
                        dead, and acted towards him like a most affectionate mother. For my own
                        part, I do not hesitate to say, that, notwithstanding all the evidence
                        produced against her, I believe and rely on her perfect innocence. She had
                        no temptation for such an action: as to the bauble on which the chief proof
                        rests, if she had earnestly desired it, I should have willingly given it to
                        her; so much do I esteem and value her."</said></p>
                  <p>Excellent <persName>Elizabeth</persName>! A murmur of approbation was heard;
                     but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in favor of poor
                        <persName>Justine</persName>, on whom <pb n="[170]" facs="images/170.jpg"/>
                     the public indignation was turned with renewed violence, charging her with the
                     blackest ingratitude. She herself wept as <persName>Elizabeth</persName> spoke,
                     but she did not answer. My own agitation and anguish was extreme during the
                     whole trial. I believed in her innocence; I knew it. Could the dæmon, who had
                     (I did not for a minute doubt) murdered my brother, also in his hellish sport
                     have betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy? I could not sustain the
                     horror of my situation; and when I perceived that the popular voice, and the
                     countenances of the judges, had already condemned my unhappy victim, I rushed
                     out of the court in agony. The tortures of the accused did not equal mine; she
                     was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of remorse tore my bosom, and would
                     not forego their hold.</p>
                  <p>I passed a night of unmingled <pb n="[171 - page breaks after 'wretch-']"
                        facs="images/171.jpg"/> wretchedness. In the morning I went to the court; my
                     lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the fatal question; but I was
                     known, and the officer guessed the cause of my visit. The ballots had been
                     thrown; they were all black, and <persName>Justine</persName> was
                     condemned.</p>
                  <p>I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before experienced
                     sensations of horror; and I have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate
                     expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the heart-sickening despair
                     that I then endured. The person to whom I addressed myself added, that
                        <persName>Justine</persName> had already confessed her guilt. <said>"That
                        evidence,"</said> he observed, <said>"was hardly required in so glaring a
                        case, but I am glad of it; and, indeed, none of our judges like to condemn a
                        criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so decisive."</said></p>
                  <pb n="[172]" facs="images/172.jpg"/>
                  <p>When I returned home, <persName>Elizabeth</persName> eagerly demanded the
                     result.</p>
                  <p><said>"My cousin,"</said> replied I, <said>"it is decided as you may have
                        expected; all judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer, than that
                        one guilty should escape. But she has confessed."</said></p>
                  <p>This was a dire blow to poor <persName>Elizabeth</persName>, who had relied
                     with firmness upon <persName>Justine</persName>'s innocence.
                        <said>"Alas!"</said> said she, <said>"how shall I ever again believe in
                        human benevolence? <persName>Justine</persName>, whom I loved and esteemed
                        as my sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray;
                        her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or ill-humour, and yet she
                        has committed a murder."</said></p>
                  <p>Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a wish to see my cousin.
                     My father wished her not to go; but said, that he left it to her own <pb
                        n="[173]" facs="images/173.jpg"/> judgment and feelings to decide.
                        <said>"Yes,"</said> said <persName>Elizabeth</persName>, <said>"I will go,
                        although she is guilty; and you, <persName>Victor</persName>, shall
                        accompany me: I cannot go alone."</said> The idea of this visit was torture
                     to me, yet I could not refuse.</p>
                  <p>We entered the gloomy prison-chamber, and beheld <persName>Justine</persName>
                     sitting on some straw at the further end; her hands were manacled, and her head
                     rested on her knees. She rose on seeing us enter; and when we were left alone
                     with her, she threw herself at the feet of <persName>Elizabeth</persName>,
                     weeping bitterly. My cousin wept also.</p>
                  <p><said>"Oh, <persName>Justine</persName>!"</said> said she, <said>"why did you
                        rob me of my last consolation? I relied on your innocence; and although I
                        was then very wretched, I was not so miserable as I am now."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked? Do you also <pb
                           n="[174]" facs="images/174.jpg"/> join with my enemies to crush
                        me?"</said> Her voice was suffocated with sobs.</p>
                  <p><said>"Rise, my poor girl,"</said> said <persName>Elizabeth</persName>,
                        <said>"why do you kneel, if you are innocent? I am not one of your enemies;
                        I believed you guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that
                        you had yourself declared your guilt. That report, you say, is false; and be
                        assured, dear <persName>Justine</persName>, that nothing can shake my
                        confidence in you for a moment, but your own confession."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"I did confess; but I confessed a lie. I confessed, that I might obtain
                        absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than all my
                        other sins. The God of heaven forgive me! Ever since I was condemned, my
                        confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced, until I almost began
                        to think that I was the monster that he <pb n="[175]" facs="images/175.jpg"
                        /> said I was. He threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last
                        moments, if I continued obdurate. Dear lady, I had none to support me; all
                        looked on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition. What could I do?
                        In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly
                        miserable."</said></p>
                  <p>She paused, weeping, and then continued—<said>"I thought with horror, my sweet
                        lady, that you should believe your <persName>Justine</persName>, whom your
                        blessed aunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature
                        capable of a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated.
                        Dear <persName>William</persName>! dearest blessed child! I soon shall see
                        you again in heaven, where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me,
                        going as I am to suffer ignominy and death."</said></p>
                  <pb n="[176]" facs="images/176.jpg"/>
                  <p><said>"Oh, <persName>Justine</persName>! forgive me for having for one moment
                        distrusted you. Why did you confess? But do not mourn, my dear girl; I will
                        every where proclaim your innocence, and force belief. Yet you must die;
                        you, my playfellow, my companion, my more than sister. I never can survive
                        so horrible a misfortune."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"Dear, sweet <persName>Elizabeth</persName>, do not weep. You ought to
                        raise me with thoughts of a better life, and elevate me from the petty cares
                        of this world of injustice and strife. Do not you, excellent friend, drive
                        me to despair."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"I will try to comfort you; but this, I fear, is an evil too deep and

                        when one creature is murdered, another is immediately deprived of life in a
                        slow torturing manner; then the executioners, their hands yet reeking with
                        the blood of innocence, believe that they have done a great deed. They call
                        this retribution . Hateful name! When that word is pronounced, I know
                        greater and more horrid punishments are going to be inflicted than the
                        gloomiest tyrant has ever invented to satiate his utmost revenge. Yet this
                        is not consolation for you, my <persName>Justine</persName>, unless indeed
                        that you may glory in escaping from so miserable a den. Alas! I would I were
                        in peace with my aunt and my lovely <persName>William</persName>, escaped
                        from a world which is hateful to me, and the visages of men which I
                        abhor."</said></p>
                  <p><persName>Justine</persName> smiled languidly. <said>"This, dear lady, is
                        despair, and not resignation. I must not learn the lesson that <pb n="[178]"
                           facs="images/178.jpg"/> you would teach me. Talk of something else,
                        something that will bring peace, and not increase of misery."</said></p>
                  <p>During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison-room, where I
                     could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me. Despair! Who dared talked
                     of that? The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass the dreary boundary
                     between life and death, felt not as I did, such deep and bitter agony. I
                     gnashed my teeth, and ground them together, uttering a groan that came from my
                     inmost soul. <persName>Justine</persName> started. When she saw who it was, she
                     approached me, and said, <said>"Dear Sir, you are very kind to visit me; you, I
                        hope, do not believe that I am guilty."</said></p>
                  <p>I could not answer. <said>"No, <persName>Justine</persName>,"</said> said
                        <persName>Elizabeth</persName>; <said>"he is more convinced of your
                        innocence than I was; for <pb n="[179]" facs="images/179.jpg"/> even when he
                        heard that you had confessed, he did not credit it."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerest gratitude
                        towards those who think of me with kindness. How sweet is the affection of
                        others to such a wretch as I am! It removes more than half my misfortune;
                        and I feel as if I could die in peace, now that my innocence is acknowledged
                        by you, dear lady, and your cousin."</said></p>
                  <p>Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. She indeed gained
                     the resignation she desired. But I, the true murderer, felt the <rs
                        content="#worm" xml:id="wormA">never-dying worm</rs> alive in my bosom,
                     which allowed of no hope or consolation. <persName>Elizabeth</persName> also
                     wept, and was unhappy; but her's also was the misery of innocence, which, like
                     a cloud that passes over the fair moon, for a while hides, <pb n="[180]"
                        facs="images/180.jpg"/> but cannot tarnish its brightness. Anguish and
                     despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; <rs content="#hell_within_me"
                        ><ref target="#hell_within" xml:id="hell_withinA">I bore a hell within me, which nothing could extinguish</ref></rs>. We staid
                     several hours with <persName>Justine</persName>; and it was with great
                     difficulty that <persName>Elizabeth</persName> could tear herself away.
                        <said>"I wish,"</said> cried she, <said>"that I were to die with you; I
                        cannot live in this world of misery."</said></p>
                  <p><persName>Justine</persName> assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with
                     difficulty repressed her bitter tears. She embraced
                        <persName>Elizabeth</persName>, and said, in a voice of half-suppressed
                     emotion, <said>"Farewell, sweet lady, dearest <persName>Elizabeth</persName>,
                        my beloved and only friend; may heaven in its bounty bless and preserve you;
                        may this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer. Live, and be
                        happy, and make others so."</said></p>
                  <p>As we returned, <persName>Elizabeth</persName> said, <said>"You <pb n="[181]"
                           facs="images/181.jpg"/> know not, my dear <persName>Victor</persName>,
                        how much I am relieved, now that I trust in the innocence of this
                        unfortunate girl. I never could again have known peace, if I had been
                        deceived in my reliance on her. For the moment that I did believe her
                        guilty, I felt an anguish that I could not have long sustained. Now my heart
                        is lightened. The innocent suffers; but she whom I thought amiable and good
                        has not betrayed the trust I reposed in her, and I am consoled."</said></p>
                  <p>Amiable cousin! such were your thoughts, mild and gentle as your own dear eyes
                     and voice. But I—I was a wretch, and none ever conceived of the misery that I
                     then endured.</p></said>

               <said><p>NOTHING is more painful to the human mind, than, after the feelings have
                     been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of inaction
                     and certainty which follows, and deprives the soul both of hope and fear.
                        <persName>Justine</persName> died; she rested; and I was alive. The blood
                     flowed freely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my
                     heart, which <pb n="[2.2]" facs="images/2.2.jpg"/> nothing could remove. Sleep
                     fled from my eyes; I wandered like an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of
                     mischief beyond description horrible, and more, much more, (I persuaded myself)
                     was yet behind. Yet my heart overflowed with kindness, and the love of virtue.
                     I had begun life with benevolent intentions, and thirsted for the moment when I
                     should put them in practice, and make myself useful to my fellow-beings. Now
                     all was blasted: instead of that serenity of conscience, which allowed me to
                     look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and from thence to gather
                     promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and the sense of guilt, which
                     hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures, such as no language can
                     describe.</p>
                  <p>This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had entirely recovered <pb
                        n="[2.3]" facs="images/2.3.jpg"/> from the first shock it had sustained. I
                     shunned the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me;
                     solitude was my only consolation—deep, dark, death-like solitude.</p>
                  <p>My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition and
                     habits, and endeavoured to reason with me on the folly of giving way to
                     immoderate grief. <said>"Do you think, <persName>Victor</persName>,"</said>
                     said he, <said>"that I do not suffer also? No one could love a child more than
                        I loved your brother"</said>; (tears came into his eyes as he spoke);
                        <said>"but is it not a duty to the survivors, that we should refrain from
                        augmenting their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief? It is
                        also a duty owed to yourself; for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or
                        enjoyment, or even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man
                        is fit for society."</said></p>
                  <pb n="[2.4]" facs="images/2.4.jpg"/>
                  <p>This advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I should have
                     been the first to hide my grief, and console my friends, if remorse had not
                     mingled its bitterness with my other sensations. Now I could only answer my
                     father with a look of despair, and endeavour to hide myself from his view.</p>
                  <p>About this time we retired to our house at <placeName type="tgn" key="8703247"
                        >Belrive</placeName>. This change was particularly agreeable to me. The
                     shutting of the gates regularly at ten o'clock, and the impossibility of
                     remaining on the lake after that hour, had rendered our residence within the
                     walls of <placeName type="tgn" key="7003746">Geneva</placeName> very irksome to
                     me. I was now free. Often, after the rest of the family had retired for the
                     night, I took the boat, and passed many hours upon the water. Sometimes, with
                     my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and sometimes, after rowing into the
                     middle of the lake, I <pb n="[2.5]" facs="images/2.5.jpg"/> left the boat to
                     pursue its own course, and gave way to my own miserable reflections. I was
                     often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only unquiet thing
                     that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and heavenly, if I except some
                     bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and interrupted croaking was heard only when I
                     approached the shore—often, I say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent
                     lake, that the waters might close over me and my calamities for ever. But I was
                     restrained, when I thought of the heroic and suffering
                        <persName>Elizabeth</persName>, whom I tenderly loved, and whose existence
                     was bound up in mine. I thought also of my father, and surviving brother:
                     should I by my base desertion leave them exposed and unprotected to the malice
                     of the fiend whom I had let loose among them?</p>
                  <p>At these moments I wept bitterly, <pb n="[2.6]" facs="images/2.6.jpg"/> and
                     wished that peace would revisit my mind only that I might afford them
                     consolation and happiness. But that could not be. Remorse extinguished every
                     hope. I had been the author of unalterable evils; and I lived in daily fear,
                     lest the monster whom I had created should perpetrate some new wickedness. I
                     had an obscure feeling that all was not over, and that he would still commit
                     some signal crime, which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection
                     of the past. There was always scope for fear, so long as anything I loved
                     remained behind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. When I
                     thought of him, I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently
                     wished to extinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When I
                     reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and <pb n="[2.7]"
                        facs="images/2.7.jpg"/> revenge burst all bounds of moderation. I would have
                     made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the <placeName type="tgn"
                        key="1108861">Andes</placeName>, could I, when there, have precipitated him
                     to their base. I wished to see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent
                     of anger on his head, and avenge the deaths of <persName>William</persName> and
                        <persName>Justine</persName>.</p>
                  <p>Our house was the house of mourning. My father's health was deeply shaken by
                     the horror of the recent events. <persName>Elizabeth</persName> was sad and
                     desponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all
                     pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she
                     then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted and
                     destroyed. She was no longer that happy creature, who in earlier youth wandered
                     with me on the banks of the lake, and talked with ecstasy of our future
                     prospects. She <pb n="[2.8]" facs="images/2.8.jpg"/> had become grave, and
                     often conversed of the inconstancy of fortune, and the instability of human
                     life.</p>
                  <p><said>"When I reflect, my dear cousin,"</said> said she, <said>"on the
                        miserable death of <persName>Justine Moritz</persName>, I no longer see the
                        world and its works as they before appeared to me. Before, I looked upon the
                        accounts of vice and injustice, that I read in books or heard from others,
                        as tales of ancient days, or imaginary evils; at least they were remote, and
                        more familiar to reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come
                        home, and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other's blood. Yet
                        I am certainly unjust. Every body believed that poor girl to be guilty; and
                        if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly she
                        would have been the most depraved of human creatures. For the sake of a few
                        jewels, <pb n="[2.9]" facs="images/2.9.jpg"/> to have murdered the son of
                        her benefactor and friend, a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and
                        appeared to love as if it had been her own! I could not consent to the death
                        of any human being; but certainly I should have thought such a creature
                        unfit to remain in the society of men. Yet she was innocent. I know, I feel
                        she was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me. Alas!
                           <persName>Victor</persName>, when falsehood can look so like the truth,
                        who can assure themselves of certain happiness? I feel if I were walking on
                        the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding, and
                        endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. <persName>William</persName> and
                           <persName>Justine</persName> were assassinated, and the murderer escapes;
                        he walks about the world free, and perhaps respected. But even if I were
                        condemned to suffer on the scaffold <pb n="[2.10]" facs="images/2.10.jpg"/>
                        for the same crimes, I would not change places with such a
                     wretch."</said></p>
                  <p>I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony. I, not in deed, but in
                     effect, was the true murderer. <persName>Elizabeth</persName> read my anguish
                     in my countenance, and kindly taking my hand said, <said>"My dearest cousin,
                        you must calm yourself. These events have affected me, God knows how deeply;
                        but I am not so wretched as you are. There is an expression of despair, and
                        sometimes of revenge, in your countenance, that makes me tremble. Be calm,
                        my dear <persName>Victor</persName>; I would sacrifice my life to your
                        peace. We surely shall be happy: quiet in our native country, and not
                        mingling in the world, what can disturb our tranquillity?"</said></p>
                  <p>She shed tears as she said this, distrusting the very solace that she gave; but
                     at the same time she smiled, that <pb n="[2.11]" facs="images/2.11.jpg"/> she
                     might chase away the fiend that lurked in my heart. My father, who saw in the
                     unhappiness that was painted in my face only an exaggeration of that sorrow
                     which I might naturally feel, thought that an amusement suited to my taste
                     would be the best means of restoring to me my wonted serenity. It was from this
                     cause that he had removed to the country; and, induced by the same motive, he
                     now proposed that we should all make an excursion to the valley of <placeName
                        type="tgn" key="1032562">Chamounix</placeName>. I had been there before, but
                        <persName>Elizabeth</persName> and <persName>Ernest</persName> never had;
                     and both had often expressed an earnest desire to see the scenery of this
                     place, which had been described to them as so wonderful and sublime.
                     Accordingly we departed from <placeName type="tgn" key="7003746"
                        >Geneva</placeName> on this tour about the middle of the month of August,
                     nearly two months after the death of <persName>Justine</persName>.</p>
                  <pb n="[2.12]" facs="images/2.12.jpg"/>
                  <p>The weather was uncommonly fine; and if mine had been a sorrow to be chased
                     away by any fleeting circumstance, this excursion would certainly have had the
                     effect intended by my father. As it was, I was somewhat interested in the
                     scene; it sometimes lulled, although it could not extinguish my grief. During
                     the first day we travelled in a carriage. In the morning we had seen the
                     mountains at a distance, towards which we gradually advanced. We perceived that
                     the valley through which we wound, and which was formed by the river <placeName
                        type="tgn" key="1121418">Arve</placeName>, whose course we followed, closed
                     in upon us by degrees; and when the sun had set, we beheld immense mountains
                     and precipices overhanging us on every side, and heard the sound of the river
                     raging among rocks, and the dashing of waterfalls around.</p>
                  <pb n="[2.13]" facs="images/2.13.jpg"/>
                  <p>The next day we pursued our journey upon mules; and as we ascended still
                     higher, the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character. Ruined
                     castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains; the impetuous <placeName
                        type="tgn" key="1121418">Arve</placeName>, and cottages every here and there
                     peeping forth from among the trees, formed a scene of singular beauty. But it
                     was augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty <placeName type="tgn"
                        key="7007746">Alps</placeName>, whose white and shining pyramids and domes
                     towered above all, as belonging to another earth, the habitations of another
                     race of beings.</p>
                  <p>We passed the bridge of <placeName>Pelissier</placeName>, where the ravine,
                     which the river forms, opened before us, and we began to ascend the mountain
                     that overhangs it. Soon after we entered the valley of <placeName type="tgn"
                        key="1032562">Chamounix</placeName>. This valley is more wonderful and
                     sublime, but not so beautiful <pb n="[2.13]" facs="images/2.13.jpg"/> and
                     picturesque as that of <placeName type="tgn" key="1035711">Servox</placeName>,
                     through which we had just passed. The high and snowy mountains were its
                     immediate boundaries; but we saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields.
                     Immense glaciers approached the road; we heard the rumbling thunder of the
                     falling avelânche, and marked the smoke of its passage. <placeName type="tgn"
                        key="7617157">Mont Blanc</placeName>, the supreme and magnificent <placeName
                        type="tgn" key="7617157">Mont Blanc</placeName>, raised itself from the
                     surrounding aiguilles, and its tremendous <hi rend="italic">(dome)</hi>
                     overlooked the valley.</p>
                  <p>During this journey, I sometimes joined <persName>Elizabeth</persName>, and
                     exerted myself to point out to her the various beauties of the scene. I often
                     suffered my mule to lag behind, and indulged in the misery of reflection. At
                     other times I spurred on the animal before my companions, that I might forget
                     them, the world, and, more than all, myself. When at <pb n="[2.15]"
                        facs="images/2.15.jpg"/> a distance, I alighted, and threw myself on the
                     grass, weighed down by horror and despair. At eight in the evening I arrived at
                        <placeName type="tgn" key="1032562">Chamounix</placeName>. My father and
                        <persName>Elizabeth</persName> were very much fatigued;
                        <persName>Ernest</persName>, who accompanied us, was delighted, and in high
                     spirits: the only circumstance that detracted from his pleasure was the south
                     wind, and the rain it seemed to promise for the next day.</p>
                  <p>We retired early to our apartments, but not to sleep; at least I did not. I
                     remained many hours at the window, watching the pallid lightning that played
                     above <placeName type="tgn" key="7617157">Mont Blanc</placeName>, and listening
                     to the rushing of the <placeName type="tgn" key="1121418">Arve</placeName>,
                     which ran below my window.</p></said>

               <said><p>THE next day, contrary to the prognostications of our guides, was fine,
                     although clouded. We visited the source of the <placeName type="tgn"

                     >Arveiron</placeName><!-- see 1781 watercolor by Francis Towne http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/towne-the-source-of-the-arveyron-t08147 -->,
                     and rode about the valley until evening. These sublime and magnificent scenes
                     afforded me the greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving. They
                     elevated me from all littleness of feeling; and although they did not remove my
                     grief, they subdued and tranquillized it. In some degree, also, they diverted
                     my mind from the thoughts over which it had <pb n="[2.17]"
                        facs="images/2.17.jpg"/> brooded for the last month. I returned in the
                     evening, fatigued, but less unhappy, and conversed with my family with more
                     cheerfulness than had been my custom for some time. My father was pleased, and
                        <persName>Elizabeth</persName> overjoyed. <said>"My dear cousin,"</said>
                     said she, <said>"you see what happiness you diffuse when you are happy; do not
                        relapse again!"</said></p>
                  <p>The following morning the rain poured down in torrents, and thick mists hid the
                     summits of the mountains. I rose early, but felt unusually melancholy. The rain
                     depressed me; my old feelings recurred, and I was miserable. I knew how
                     disappointed my father would be at this sudden change, and I wished to avoid
                     him until I had recovered myself so far as to be enabled to conceal those
                     feelings that overpowered me. I knew that they would remain that day at the
                     inn; <pb n="[2.18]" facs="images/2.18.jpg"/> and as I had ever inured myself to
                     rain, moisture, and cold, I resolved to go alone to the summit of <placeName
                        type="tgn" key="7622466">Montanvert</placeName>. I remembered the effect
                     that the view of the tremendous and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my
                     mind when I first saw it. It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that
                     gave wings to the soul, and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light
                     and joy. The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the
                     effect of solemnizing my mind, and causing me to forget the passing cares of
                     life. I determined to go alone, for I was well acquainted with the path, and
                     the presence of another would destroy the solitary grandeur of the scene.</p>
                  <p>The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short
                     windings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the <pb
                        n="[2.19]" facs="images/2.19.jpg"/> mountain. It is a scene terrifically
                     desolate. In a thousand spots the traces of the winter avelânche may be
                     perceived, where trees lie broken and strewed on the ground; some entirely
                     destroyed, others bent, leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain, or
                     transversely upon other trees. The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected
                     by ravines of snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them
                     is particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking in a
                     loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw destruction upon
                     the head of the speaker. The pines are not tall or luxuriant, but they are
                     sombre, and add an air of severity to the scene. I looked on the valley
                     beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers which ran through it, and
                     curling in thick wreaths around the <pb n="[2.20 - page breaks after 'oppo-']"
                        facs="images/2.20.jpg"/> opposite mountains, whose summits were hid in the
                     uniform clouds, while rain poured from the dark sky, and added to the
                     melancholy impression I received from the objects around me. Alas! why does man
                     boast of sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders
                     them more necessary beings. If our impulses were confined to hunger, thirst,
                     and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by every wind that
                     blows, and a chance word or scene that that word may convey to us.</p>
                  <quote><lb/>We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep. <lb/>We rise; one
                     wand'ring thought pollutes the day. <lb/>We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh,

                     for, be it joy or sorrow, <lb/>The path of its departure still is free.

                  <pb n="[2.21]" facs="images/2.21.jpg"/>
                  <p>It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent. For some time I sat
                     upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist covered both that and the
                     surrounding mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated the cloud, and I descended
                     upon the glacier. The surface is very uneven, rising like the waves of a
                     troubled sea, descending low, and interspersed by rifts that sink deep. The
                     field of ice is almost a league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in
                     crossing it. The opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. From the side
                     where I now stood <placeName type="tgn" key="7622466">Montanvert</placeName>
                     was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league; and above it rose <placeName
                        type="tgn" key="7617157">Mont Blanc</placeName>, in awful majesty. I
                     remained in a recess of the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous
                     scene. The sea, or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent
                     mountains, <pb n="[2.22]" facs="images/2.22.jpg"/> whose aërial summits hung
                     over its recesses. Their icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight over
                     the clouds. My heart, which was before sorrowful, now swelled with something
                     like joy; I exclaimed—<said>"Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not
                        rest in your narrow beds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your
                        companion, away from the joys of life."</said></p>
                  <p>As I said this, I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance,
                     advancing towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded over the crevices in the
                     ice, among which I had walked with caution; his stature also, as he approached,
                     seemed to exceed that of man. I was troubled: a mist came over my eyes, and I
                     felt a faintness seize me; but I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the
                     mountains. I perceived, as the shape came nearer, (sight <pb n="[2.23]"
                        facs="images/2.23.jpg"/> tremendous and abhorred!) that it was the wretch
                     whom I had created. I trembled with rage and horror, resolving to wait his
                     approach, and then close with him in mortal combat. He approached; his
                     countenance bespoke bitter anguish, combined with disdain and malignity, while
                     its unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes. But I
                     scarcely observed this; anger and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance,
                     and I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious
                     detestation and contempt.</p>
                  <p><said>"Devil!"</said> I exclaimed, <said>"do you dare approach me? and do not
                        you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head?
                        Begone, vile insect! or rather stay, that I may trample you to dust! and,
                        oh, that I could, with the extinction of your miserable <pb n="[2.24]"
                           facs="images/2.24.jpg"/> existence, restore those victims whom you have
                        so diabolically murdered!"</said></p>
                  <p><said>"I expected this reception,"</said> said the dæmon. <said>"All men hate
                        the wretched; how then must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all living
                        things! Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature, to whom thou
                        art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of one of us. You
                        purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life? Do your duty towards
                        me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind. If you will
                        comply with my conditions, I will leave them and you at peace; but if you
                        refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it be satiated with the blood of
                        your remaining friends."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"Abhorred monster! fiend that thou art! the tortures of hell are too mild

                  <p>My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the feelings which
                     can arm one being against the existence of another.</p>
                  <p>He easily eluded me, and said,</p>
                  <p><said>"Be calm! I entreat you to hear me, before you give vent to your hatred
                        on my devoted head. Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to increase my
                        misery? Life, although it may only be an accumulation of anguish, is dear to
                        me, and I will defend it. Remember, thou hast made me more powerful than
                        thyself; my height is superior to thine; my joints more supple. But I will
                        not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee. I am thy creature, and I
                        will be even mild and docile to my natural <pb n="[2.26]"

                        equitable to every other, and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice,
                        and even thy clemency and affection, is most due. Remember that I am thy
                        creature: I ought to be thy <persName>Adam</persName>; but I am rather the

                        bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and

                        virtuous."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"Begone! I will not hear you. There can be no community between you and

                        Believe me, <persName>Frankenstein</persName>: I was benevolent; my soul
                        glowed with love and humanity: but am I not alone, miserably alone? You, my

                        owe me nothing? they spurn and hate me. The desert mountains and dreary
                        glaciers are my refuge. I have wandered here many days; the caves of ice,
                        which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the only one which man
                        does not grudge. These bleak skies I hail, for they are kinder to me than
                        your fellow-beings. If the multitude of mankind knew of my existence, they
                        would do as you do, and arm themselves for my destruction. Shall I not then
                        hate them who abhor me? I will keep no terms with my <pb n="[2.28]"
                           facs="images/2.28.jpg"/> enemies. I am miserable, and they shall share my
                        wretchedness. Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver them
                        from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that not only
                        you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be swallowed up in the
                        whirlwinds of its rage. Let your compassion be moved, and do not disdain me.
                        Listen to my tale: when you have heard that, abandon or commiserate me, as
                        you shall judge that I deserve. But hear me. The guilty are allowed, by
                        human laws, bloody as they may be, to speak in their own defence before they
                        are condemned. Listen to me, <persName>Frankenstein</persName> . You accuse
                        me of murder; and yet you would, with a satisfied conscience, destroy your
                        own creature. Oh, praise the eternal justice of man! Yet I ask you not to
                        spare me: listen to me; and <pb n="[2.29]" facs="images/2.29.jpg"/> then, if
                        you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"Why do you call to my remembrance circumstances of which I shudder to
                        reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and author? Cursed be the
                        day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw light! Cursed (although I curse
                        myself) be the hands that formed you! You have made me wretched beyond
                        expression. You have left me no power to consider whether I am just to you,
                        or not. Begone! relieve me from the sight of your detested form."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"Thus I relieve thee, my creator,"</said> he said, and placed his hated
                     hands before my eyes, which I flung from me with violence; <said>"thus I take
                        from thee a sight which you abhor. Still thou canst listen to me, and grant
                        me thy compassion. By the virtues that I <pb n="[2.30]"
                           facs="images/2.30.jpg"/> once possessed, I demand this from you. Hear my
                        tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of this place is not
                        fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon the mountain. The sun
                        is yet high in the heavens; before it descends to hide itself behind yon
                        snowy precipices, and illuminate another world, you will have heard my
                        story, and can decide. On you it rests, whether I quit forever the
                        neighbourhood of man, and lead a harmless life, or become the scourge of
                        your fellow-creatures, and the author of your own speedy ruin."</said></p>
                  <p>As he said this, he led the way across the ice: I followed. My heart was full,
                     and I did not answer him; but, as I proceeded, I weighed the various arguments
                     that he had used, and determined at least to listen to his tale. I was partly
                     urged by curiosity, and <pb n="[2.31]" facs="images/2.31.jpg"/> compassion
                     confirmed my resolution. I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my
                     brother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion. For the
                     first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards his creature
                     were, and that I ought to render him happy before I complained of his
                     wickedness. These motives urged me to comply with his demand. We crossed the
                     ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite rock. The air was cold, and the rain
                     again began to descend: we entered the hut, the fiend with an air of
                     exultation, I with a heavy heart, and depressed spirits. But I consented to
                     listen; and, seating myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted,
                     he thus began his tale.</p>"</said>

               <said><said>
                     <p>IT is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original æra of my
                        being: all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct. A
                        strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard, and
                        smelt, at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I learned to
                        distinguish between the operations of my various senses. By degrees, I
                        remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I was obliged to
                        shut my eyes. Darkness then came over me, and troubled me; but <pb
                           n="[2.33]" facs="images/2.33.jpg"/> hardly had I felt this, when, by
                        opening my eyes, as I now suppose, the light poured in upon me again. I
                        walked, and, I believe, descended; but I presently found a great alteration
                        in my sensations. Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me,
                        impervious to my touch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at
                        liberty, with no obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid. The
                        light became more and more oppressive to me; and, the heat wearying me as I
                        walked, I sought a place where I could receive shade. This was the forest
                        near <placeName type="tgn" key="7017035">Ingolstadt</placeName>; and here I
                        lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue, until I felt tormented
                        by hunger and thirst. This roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate
                        some berries which I found hanging on the trees, or lying on the ground. I
                        slaked my <pb n="[2.34]" facs="images/2.34.jpg"/> thirst at the brook; and
                        then lying down, was overcome by sleep.</p>
                     <p>It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half-frightened as it were
                        instinctively, finding myself so desolate. Before I had quitted your
                        apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some clothes;
                        but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night. I was a
                        poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could distinguish, nothing;
                        but, feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat down and wept.</p>
                     <p>Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens, and gave me a sensation of
                        pleasure. I started up, and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees.
                        I gazed with a kind of wonder. It moved slowly, but it enlightened my path;
                        and I again went out in search of berries. I was still cold, when under <pb
                           n="[2.35]" facs="images/2.35.jpg"/> one of the trees I found a huge
                        cloak, with which I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground. No
                        distinct ideas occupied my mind; all was confused. I felt light, and hunger,
                        and thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rung in my ears, and on all
                        sides various scents saluted me: the only object that I could distinguish
                        was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with pleasure.</p>
                     <p>Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had greatly
                        lessened when I began to distinguish my sensations from each other. I
                        gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink, and the
                        trees that shaded me with their foliage. I was delighted when I first
                        discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my ears, proceeded
                        from the throats of the little winged animals who <pb n="[2,36]"
                           facs="images/2.36.jpg"/> had often intercepted the light from my eyes. I
                        began also to observe, with greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me,
                        and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied
                        me. Sometimes I tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds, but was
                        unable. Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the
                        uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into
                        silence again.</p>
                     <p>The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened form,
                        shewed itself, while I still remained in the forest. My sensations had, by
                        this time, become distinct, and my mind received every day additional ideas.
                        My eyes became accustomed to the light, and to perceive objects in their
                        right forms; I distinguished the insect from the herb, and, by <pb
                           n="[2.37 - page breaks after 'de-']" facs="images/2.37.jpg"/> degrees,
                        one herb from another. I found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh
                        notes, whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and enticing.</p>
                     <p>One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been left by
                        some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the warmth I
                        experienced from it. In my joy I thrust my hand into the live embers, but
                        quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain. How strange, I thought, that
                        the same cause should produce such opposite effects! I examined the
                        materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be composed of wood. I
                        quickly collected some branches; but they were wet, and would not burn. I
                        was pained at this, and sat still watching the operation of the fire. The
                        wet wood which I had placed near the heat dried, and itself <pb n="[2.38]"
                           facs="images/2.38.jpg"/> became inflamed. I reflected on this; and, by
                        touching the various branches, I discovered the cause, and busied myself in
                        collecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it, and have a
                        plentiful supply of fire. When night came on, and brought sleep with it, I
                        was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished. I covered it
                        carefully with dry wood and leaves, and placed wet branches upon it; and
                        then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground, and sunk into sleep.</p>
                     <p>It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire. I
                        uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame. I observed
                        this also, and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the embers when
                        they were nearly extinguished. When night came again, I found, with
                        pleasure, that the fire gave light as <pb n="[2.39]" facs="images/2.39.jpg"
                        /> well as heat; and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in
                        my food; for I found some of the offals that the travellers had left had
                        been roasted, and tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from
                        the trees. I tried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing
                        it on the live embers. I found that the berries were spoiled by this
                        operation, and the nuts and roots much improved.</p>
                     <p>Food, however, became scarce; and I often spent the whole day searching in
                        vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. When I found this, I
                        resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto inhabited, to seek for one
                        where the few wants I experienced would be more easily satisfied. In this
                        emigration, I exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which I had obtained
                        through accident, and knew not how to <pb n="[2.40]" facs="images/2.40.jpg"
                        /> re-produce it. I gave several hours to the serious consideration of this
                        difficulty; but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply it; and,
                        wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood towards the setting
                        sun. I passed three days in these rambles, and at length discovered the open
                        country. A great fall of snow had taken place the night before, and the
                        fields were of one uniform white; the appearance was disconsolate, and I
                        found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that covered the
                        ground.</p>
                     <p>It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and shelter;
                        at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which had doubtless
                        been built for the convenience of some shepherd. This was a new sight to me;
                        and I examined the structure with great <pb
                           n="[2.41 - page breaks after 'cu-']" facs="images/2.41.jpg"/> curiosity.
                        Finding the door open, I entered. An old man sat in it, near a fire, over
                        which he was preparing his breakfast. He turned on hearing a noise; and,
                        perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and, quitting the hut, ran across the fields
                        with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable. His
                        appearance, different from any I had ever before seen, and his flight,
                        somewhat surprised me. But I was enchanted by the appearance of the hut:
                        here the snow and rain could not penetrate; the ground was dry; and it
                        presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as Pandæmonium
                        appeared to the dæmons of hell after their sufferings in the lake of fire. I
                        greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd's breakfast, which consisted
                        of bread, cheese, milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like. <pb
                           n="[2.42]" facs="images/2.42.jpg"/> Then overcome by fatigue, I lay down
                        among some straw, and fell asleep.</p>
                     <p>It was noon when I awoke; and, allured by the warmth of the sun, which shone
                        brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my travels; and,
                        depositing the remains of the peasant's breakfast in a wallet I found, I
                        proceeded across the fields for several hours, until at sunset I arrived at
                        a village. How miraculous did this appear! the huts, the neater cottages,
                        and stately houses, engaged my admiration by turns. The vegetables in the
                        gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw placed at the windows of some of the
                        cottages, allured my appetite. One of the best of these I entered; but I had
                        hardly placed my foot within the door, before the children shrieked, and one
                        of the women fainted. The whole village was roused; some fled, some <pb
                           n="[2.43 - page breaks after 'at-']" facs="images/2.43.jpg"/> attacked
                        me, until, grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile
                        weapons, I escaped to the open country, and fearfully took refuge in a low
                        hovel, quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had
                        beheld in the village. This hovel, however, joined a cottage of a neat and
                        pleasant appearance; but, after my late dearly-bought experience, I dared
                        not enter it. My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so low, that I
                        could with difficulty sit upright in it. No wood, however, was placed on the
                        earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and although the wind entered
                        it by innumerable chinks, I found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and
                        rain.</p>
                     <p>Here then I retreated, and lay down, happy to have found a shelter, however
                        miserable, from the inclemency <pb n="[2.44]" facs="images/2.44.jpg"/> of
                        the season, and still more from the barbarity of man.</p>
                     <p>As soon as morning dawned, I crept from my kennel, that I might view the
                        adjacent cottage, and discover if I could remain in the habitation I had
                        found. It was situated against the back of the cottage, and surrounded on
                        the sides which were exposed by a pig-stye and a clear pool of water. One
                        part was open, and by that I had crept in; but now I covered every crevice
                        by which I might be perceived with stones and wood, yet in such a manner
                        that I might move them on occasion to pass out: all the light I enjoyed came
                        through the stye, and that was sufficient for me.</p>
                     <p>Having thus arranged my dwelling, and carpeted it with clean straw, I
                        retired; for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered too
                           <pb n="[2.45]" facs="images/2.45.jpg"/> well my treatment the night
                        before, to trust myself in his power. I had first, however, provided for my
                        sustenance for that day, by a loaf of coarse bread, which I purloined, and a
                        cup with which I could drink, more conveniently than from my hand, of the
                        pure water which flowed by my retreat. The floor was a little raised, so
                        that it was kept perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the
                        cottage it was tolerably warm.</p>
                     <p>Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel, until something
                        should occur which might alter my determination. It was indeed a paradise,
                        compared to the bleak forest, my former residence, the rain-dropping
                        branches, and dank earth. I ate my breakfast with pleasure, and was about to
                        remove a plank to procure myself a little water, when I heard a step, and,
                        looking <pb n="[2.46]" facs="images/2.46.jpg"/> through a small chink, I
                        beheld a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel.
                        The girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found
                        cottagers and farm-house servants to be. Yet she was meanly dressed, a
                        coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair hair
                        was plaited, but not adorned; she looked patient, yet sad. I lost sight of
                        her; and in about a quarter of an hour she returned, bearing the pail, which
                        was now partly filled with milk. As she walked along, seemingly incommoded
                        by the burden, a young man met her, whose countenance expressed a deeper
                        despondence. Uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy, he took the
                        pail from her head, and bore it to the cottage himself. She followed, and
                        they disappeared. Presently I saw the young <pb n="[2.47]"
                           facs="images/2.47.jpg"/> man again, with some tools in his hand, cross
                        the field behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the
                        house, and sometimes in the yard.</p>
                     <p>On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the cottage had
                        formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been filled up with wood.
                        In one of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink, through which
                        the eye could just penetrate. Through this crevice, a small room was
                        visible, white-washed and clean, but very bare of furniture. In one corner,
                        near a small fire, sat an old man, leaning his head on his hands in a
                        disconsolate attitude. The young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage;
                        but presently she took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands,
                        and she sat down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began <pb
                           n="[2.48]" facs="images/2.48.jpg"/> to play, and to produce sounds,
                        sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale. It was a lovely
                        sight, even to me, poor wretch! who had never beheld aught beautiful before.
                        The silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager, won my
                        reverence; while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love. He played a
                        sweet mournful air, which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his
                        amiable companion, of which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed
                        audibly; he then pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her
                        work, knelt at his feet. He raised her, and smiled with such kindness and
                        affection, that I felt sensations of a peculiar and over-powering nature:
                        they were a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before
                        experienced, either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I <pb
                           n="[2.49]" facs="images/2.49.jpg"/> withdrew from the window, unable to
                        bear these emotions.</p>
                     <p>Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a load of
                        wood. The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of his burden,
                        and, taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on the fire; then
                        she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage, and he shewed her a
                        large loaf and a piece of cheese. She seemed pleased, and went into the
                        garden for some roots and plants, which she placed in water, and then upon
                        the fire. She afterwards continued her work, whilst the young man went into
                        the garden, and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots.
                        After he had been employed thus about an hour, the young woman joined him,
                        and they entered the cottage together.</p>
                     <p>The old man had, in the mean time, <pb n="[2.50]" facs="images/2.50.jpg"/>
                        been pensive; but, on the appearance of his companions, he assumed a more
                        cheerful air, and they sat down to eat. The meal was quickly dispatched. The
                        young woman was again occupied in arranging the cottage; the old man walked
                        before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the
                        youth. Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two
                        excellent creatures. One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance
                        beaming with benevolence and love: the younger was slight and graceful in
                        his figure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry; yet his
                        eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency. The old man
                        returned to the cottage; and the youth, with tools different from those he
                        had used in the morning, directed his steps across the fields.</p>
                     <pb n="[2.51]" facs="images/2.51.jpg"/>
                     <p>Night quickly shut in; but, to my extreme wonder, I found that the cottagers
                        had a means of prolonging light, by the use of tapers, and was delighted to
                        find, that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure I
                        experienced in watching my human neighbours. In the evening, the young girl
                        and her companion were employed in various occupations which I did not
                        understand; and the old man again took up the instrument, which produced the
                        divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning. So soon as he had
                        finished, the youth began, not to play, but to utter sounds that were
                        monotonous, and neither resembling the harmony of the old man's instrument
                        or the songs of the birds; I since found that he read aloud, but at that
                        time I knew nothing of the science of words or letters.</p>
                     <pb n="[2.52]" facs="images/2.52.jpg"/>
                     <p>The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time, extinguished
                        their lights, and retired, as I conjectured, to rest.</p>

               <said><said><p>I LAY on my straw, but I could not sleep. I thought of the occurrences
                        of the day. What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people;
                        and I longed to join them, but dared not. I remembered too well the
                        treatment I had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers, and
                        resolved, whatever course of conduct I might hereafter think it right to
                        pursue, that for the present I would remain quietly in my hovel, watching,
                        and endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions.</p>
                     <pb n="[2.54]" facs="images/2.54.jpg"/>
                     <p>The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun. The young woman
                        arranged the cottage, and prepared the food; and the youth departed after
                        the first meal.</p>
                     <p>This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it. The young
                        man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in various laborious
                        occupations within. The old man, whom I soon perceived to be blind, employed
                        his leisure hours on his instrument, or in contemplation. Nothing could
                        exceed the love and respect which the younger cottagers exhibited towards
                        their venerable companion. They performed towards him every little office of
                        affection and duty with gentleness; and he rewarded them by his benevolent
                        smiles.</p>
                     <p>They were not entirely happy. The young man and his companion often <pb
                           n="[2.55]" facs="images/2.55.jpg"/> went apart, and appeared to weep. I
                        saw no cause for their unhappiness; but I was deeply affected by it. If such
                        lovely creatures were miserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect
                        and solitary being, should be wretched. Yet why were these gentle beings
                        unhappy? They possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes), and
                        every luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill, and delicious viands
                        when hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more, they
                        enjoyed one another's company and speech, interchanging each day looks of
                        affection and kindness. What did their tears imply? Did they really express
                        pain? I was at first unable to solve these questions; but perpetual
                        attention, and time, explained to me many appearances which were at first
                        enigmatic.</p>
                     <pb n="[2.56]" facs="images/2.56.jpg"/>
                     <p>A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of the
                        uneasiness of this amiable family; it was poverty; and they suffered that
                        evil in a very distressing degree. Their nourishment consisted entirely of
                        the vegetables of their garden, and the milk of one cow, who gave very
                        little during the winter, when its masters could scarcely procure food to
                        support it. They often, I believe, suffered the pangs of hunger very
                        poignantly, especially the two younger cottagers; for several times they
                        placed food before the old man, when they reserved none for themselves.</p>
                     <p>This trait of kindness moved me sensibly. I had been accustomed, during the
                        night, to steal a part of their store for my own consumption; but when I
                        found that in doing this I inflicted pain on the cottagers, I abstained, <pb
                           n="[2.57]" facs="images/2.57.jpg"/> and satisfied myself with berries,
                        nuts, and roots, which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.</p>
                     <p>I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist their
                        labours. I found that the youth spent a great part of each day in collecting
                        wood for the family fire; and, during the night, I often took his tools, the
                        use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home firing sufficient for
                        the consumption of several days.</p>
                     <p>I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she opened
                        the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great pile
                        of wood on the outside. She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the
                        youth joined her, who also expressed surprise. I observed, with pleasure,
                        that he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in <pb
                           n="[2.58 - page breaks after 'repair-']" facs="images/2.58.jpg"/>
                        repairing the cottage, and cultivating the garden.</p>
                     <p>By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment. I found that these
                        people possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to
                        one another by articulate sounds. I perceived that the words they spoke
                        sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the minds and
                        countenances of the hearers. This was indeed a godlike science, and I
                        ardently desired to become acquainted with it. But I was baffled in every
                        attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick; and the
                        words they uttered, not having any apparent connexion with visible objects,
                        I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the mystery of
                        their reference. By great application, however, and after having <pb
                           n="[2.59 - page breaks after 're-']" facs="images/2.59.jpg"/> remained
                        during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I
                        discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of
                        discourse; I learned and applied the words <hi rend="italic">(fire)</hi>,
                           <hi rend="italic">(milk)</hi>, <hi rend="italic">(bread)</hi>, and <hi
                           rend="italic">(wood)</hi>. I learned also the names of the cottagers
                        themselves. The youth and his companion had each of them several names, but
                        the old man had only one, which was <hi rend="italic">(father)</hi>. The
                        girl was called <hi rend="italic">(sister)</hi>, or <persName><hi
                              rend="italic">(Agatha)</hi></persName>; and the youth <persName><hi
                              rend="italic">(Felix)</hi>
                        </persName>, <hi rend="italic">(brother)</hi>, or <hi rend="italic"
                           >(son)</hi>. I cannot describe the delight I felt when I learned the
                        ideas appropriated to each of these sounds, and was able to pronounce them.
                        I distinguished several other words, without being able as yet to understand
                        or apply them; such as <hi rend="italic">(good)</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
                           >(dearest)</hi>, <hi rend="italic">(unhappy)</hi>.</p>
                     <p>I spent the winter in this manner. The gentle manners and beauty of the <pb
                           n="[2.60]" facs="images/2.60.jpg"/> cottagers greatly endeared them to
                        me; when they were unhappy, I felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I
                        sympathized in their joys. I saw few human beings beside them; and if any
                        other happened to enter the cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only
                        enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my friends. The old man, I
                        could perceive, often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I
                        found that he called them, to cast off their melancholy. He would talk in a
                        cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even
                        upon me. <persName>Agatha</persName> listened with respect, her eyes
                        sometimes filled with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived;
                        but I generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after
                        having listened to the exhortations of her father. It was not thus with
                           <persName>Felix</persName>. He <pb n="[2.61]" facs="images/2.61.jpg"/>
                        was always the saddest of the groupe; and, even to my unpractised senses, he
                        appeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends. But if his
                        countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more cheerful than that of his
                        sister, especially when he addressed the old man.</p>
                     <p>I could mention innumerable instances, which, although slight, marked the
                        dispositions of these amiable cottagers. In the midst of poverty and want,
                           <persName>Felix</persName> carried with pleasure to his sister the first
                        little white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground. Early in
                        the morning before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that obstructed
                        her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and brought the wood
                        from the out-house, where, to his perpetual astonishment, he found his store
                        always <pb n="[2.62 - page breaks after 'reple-']" facs="images/2.62.jpg"/>
                        replenished by an invisible hand. In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes
                        for a neighbouring farmer, because he often went forth, and did not return
                        until dinner, yet brought no wood with him. At other times he worked in the
                        garden; but, as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the
                        old man and <persName>Agatha</persName>.</p>
                     <p>This reading had puzzled me extremely at first; but, by degrees, I
                        discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he
                        talked. I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs for
                        speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend these also;
                        but how was that possible, when I did not even understand the sounds for
                        which they stood as signs? I improved, however, sensibly in this science,
                        but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of <pb n="[2.63]"
                           facs="images/2.63.jpg"/> conversation, although I applied my whole mind
                        to the endeavour: for I easily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to
                        discover myself to the cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I
                        had first become master of their language; which knowledge might enable me
                        to make them overlook the deformity of my figure; for with this also the
                        contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.</p>
                     <p>I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers—their grace, beauty, and
                        delicate complexions: but how was I terrified, when I viewed myself in a
                        transparent pool! At first I started back, unable to believe that it was
                        indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became fully convinced
                        that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was filled with the bitterest
                           <pb n="[2.64 - page breaks after 'sen-']" facs="images/2.64.jpg"/>
                        sensations of despondence and mortification. Alas! I did not yet entirely
                        know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity.</p>
                     <p>As the sun became warmer, and the light of day longer, the snow vanished,
                        and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth. From this time
                           <persName>Felix</persName> was more employed; and the heart-moving
                        indications of impending famine disappeared. Their food, as I afterwards
                        found, was coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of
                        it. Several new kinds of plants sprung up in the garden, which they dressed;
                        and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced.</p>
                     <p>The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did not
                        rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters. <pb
                           n="[2.65]" facs="images/2.65.jpg"/> This frequently took place; but a
                        high wind quickly dried the earth, and the season became far more pleasant
                        than it had been.</p>
                     <p>My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the morning I attended the
                        motions of the cottagers; and when they were dispersed in various
                        occupations, I slept: the remainder of the day was spent in observing my
                        friends. When they had retired to rest, if there was any moon, or the night
                        was star-light, I went into the woods, and collected my own food and fuel
                        for the cottage. When I returned, as often as it was necessary, I cleared
                        their path of the snow, and performed those offices that I had seen done by
                           <persName>Felix</persName>. I afterwards found that these labours,
                        performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and once or twice I
                        heard them, on these <pb n="[2.66]" facs="images/2.66.jpg"/> occasions,
                        utter the words <hi rend="italic">(good spirit)</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
                           >(wonderful)</hi>; but I did not then understand the signification of
                        these terms.</p>
                     <p>My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the motives and
                        feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to know why
                           <persName>Felix</persName> appeared so miserable, and
                           <persName>Agatha</persName> so sad. I thought (foolish wretch!) that it
                        might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people. When I
                        slept, or was absent, the forms of the venerable blind father, the gentle
                           <persName>Agatha</persName>, and the excellent
                        <persName>Felix</persName>, flitted before me. I looked upon them as
                        superior beings, who would be the arbiters of my future destiny. I formed in
                        my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their
                        reception of me. I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my
                        gentle demeanour and conciliating <pb n="[2.67]" facs="images/2.67.jpg"/>
                        words, I should first win their favour, and afterwards their love.</p>
                     <p>These thoughts exhilarated me, and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the
                        acquiring the art of language. My organs were indeed harsh, but supple: and
                        although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones, yet I
                        pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease. It was as the ass
                        and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose intentions were
                        affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved better treatment than
                        blows and execration.</p>
                     <p>The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect
                        of the earth. Men, who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves,
                        dispersed themselves, and were employed in various arts of cultivation. The
                        birds sang in more <pb n="[2.68 - page breaks after 'cheer-']"
                           facs="images/2.68.jpg"/> cheerful notes, and the leaves began to bud
                        forth on the trees. Happy, happy earth! fit habitation for gods, which, so
                        short a time before, was bleak, damp, and unwholesome. My spirits were
                        elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature; the past was blotted from
                        my memory, the present was tranquil, and the future gilded by bright rays of
                        hope, and anticipations of joy.</p></said></said>

                  <said>
                     <p>I NOW hasten to the more moving part of my story. I shall relate events that
                        impressed me with feelings which, from what I was, have made me what I
                        am.</p>
                     <p>Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine, and the skies cloudless.
                        It surprised me, that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom
                        with the most beautiful flowers and verdure. My senses were gratified and
                        refreshed by a thousand scents of delight, and a thousand sights of
                        beauty.</p>
                     <pb n="[2.70]" facs="images/2.70.jpg"/>
                     <p>It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested from
                        labour—the old man played on his guitar, and the children listened to him—I
                        observed that the countenance of <persName>Felix</persName> was melancholy
                        beyond expression; he sighed frequently; and once his father paused in his
                        music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired the cause of his
                        son's sorrow. <persName>Felix</persName> replied in a cheerful accent, and
                        the old man was recommencing his music when some one tapped at the door.</p>
                     <p>It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a countryman as a guide. The lady
                        was dressed in a dark suit, and covered with a thick black veil.
                           <persName>Agatha</persName> asked a question; to which the stranger only
                        replied by pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of
                           <persName>Felix</persName>. Her voice was musical, but unlike that of <pb
                           n="[2.71]" facs="images/2.71.jpg"/> either of my friends. On hearing this
                        word, <persName>Felix</persName> came up hastily to the lady; who, when she
                        saw him, threw up her veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and
                        expression. Her hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her
                        eyes were dark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular
                        proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with a
                        lovely pink.</p>
                     <p><persName>Felix</persName> seemed ravished with delight when he saw her,
                        every trait of sorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a
                        degree of ecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable;
                        his eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I
                        thought him as beautiful as the stranger. She appeared affected by different
                        feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, <pb n="[2.72]"
                           facs="images/2.72.jpg"/> she held out her hand to
                           <persName>Felix</persName>, who kissed it rapturously, and called her, as
                        well as I could distinguish, his sweet <persName>Arabian</persName>. She did
                        not appear to understand him, but smiled. He assisted her to dismount, and,
                        dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage. Some conversation took
                        place between him and his father; and the young stranger knelt at the old
                        man's feet, and would have kissed his hand, but he raised her, and embraced
                        her affectionately.</p>
                     <p>I soon perceived, that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds, and
                        appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood by, or
                        herself understood, the cottagers. They made many signs which I did not
                        comprehend; but I saw that her presence diffused gladness through the
                        cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists.
                           <persName>Felix</persName> seemed <pb n="[2.73]" facs="images/2.73.jpg"/>
                        peculiarly happy, and with smiles of delight welcomed his
                           <persName>Arabian</persName>. <persName>Agatha</persName>, the
                        ever-gentle <persName>Agatha</persName>, kissed the hands of the lovely
                        stranger; and, pointing to her brother, made signs which appeared to me to
                        mean that he had been sorrowful until she came. Some hours passed thus,
                        while they, by their countenances, expressed joy, the cause of which I did
                        not comprehend. Presently I found, by the frequent recurrence of one sound
                        which the stranger repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn
                        their language; and the idea instantly occurred to me, that I should make
                        use of the same instructions to the same end. The stranger learned about
                        twenty words at the first lesson, most of them indeed were those which I had
                        before understood, but I profited by the others.</p>
                     <p>As night came on, <persName>Agatha</persName> and the <pb n="[2.74]"
                           facs="images/2.74.jpg"/>
                        <persName>Arabian</persName> retired early. When they separated,
                           <persName>Felix</persName> kissed the hand of the stranger, and said,
                        Good night, sweet <persName>Safie</persName>. He sat up much longer,
                        conversing with his father; and, by the frequent repetition of her name, I
                        conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their conversation. I
                        ardently desired to understand them, and bent every faculty towards that
                        purpose, but found it utterly impossible.</p>
                     <p>The next morning <persName>Felix</persName> went out to his work; and, after
                        the usual occupations of <persName>Agatha</persName> were finished, the
                           <persName>Arabian</persName> sat at the feet of the old man, and, taking
                        his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly beautiful, that they at once
                        drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes. She sang, and her voice
                        flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or dying away, like a nightingale of the
                        woods.</p>
                     <pb n="[2.75]" facs="images/2.75.jpg"/>
                     <p>When she had finished, she gave the guitar to <persName>Agatha</persName>,
                        who at first declined it. She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied
                        it in sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. The old
                        man appeared enraptured, and said some words, which
                           <persName>Agatha</persName> endeavoured to explain to
                           <persName>Safie</persName>, and by which he appeared to wish to express
                        that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.</p>
                     <p>The days now passed as peacefully as before, with the sole alteration that
                        joy had taken the place of sadness in the countenances of my friends.
                           <persName>Safie</persName> was always gay and happy; she and I improved
                        rapidly in the knowledge of language, so that in two months I began to
                        comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors.</p>
                     <p>In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and <pb
                           n="[2.76]" facs="images/2.76.jpg"/> the green banks interspersed with
                        innumerable flowers, sweet to the scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance
                        among the moonlight woods; the sun became warmer, the nights clear and
                        balmy; and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although
                        they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the
                        sun; for I never ventured abroad during day-light, fearful of meeting with
                        the same treatment as I had formerly endured in the first village which I
                        entered.</p>
                     <p>My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily master the
                        language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than the
                           <persName>Arabian</persName>, who understood very little, and conversed
                        in broken accents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word
                        that was spoken.</p>
                     <p>While I improved in speech, I also <pb n="[2.77]" facs="images/2.77.jpg"/>
                        learned the science of letters, as it was taught to the stranger; and this
                        opened before me a wide field for wonder and delight.</p>
                     <p>The book from which <persName>Felix</persName> instructed
                           <persName>Safie</persName> was <hi rend="italic"><title>Volney's Ruins of
                              Empires</title></hi> . I should not have understood the purport of
                        this book, had not <persName>Felix</persName>, in reading it, given very
                        minute explanations. He had chosen this work, he said, because the
                        declamatory style was framed in imitation of the eastern authors. Through
                        this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history, and a view of the
                        several empires at present existing in the world; it gave me an insight into
                        the manners, governments, and religions of the different nations of the
                        earth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics; of the stupendous genius and mental
                        activity of the Grecians; of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early
                        Romans— <pb n="[2.78]" facs="images/2.78.jpg"/> of their subsequent
                        degeneration—of the decline of that mighty empire; of chivalry,
                        Christianity, and kings. I heard of the discovery of the <placeName
                           type="tgn" key="8698314">American hemisphere</placeName>, and wept with
                           <persName>Safie</persName> over the hapless fate of its original
                        inhabitants.</p>
                     <p>These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. Was man,
                        indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous, and magnificent, yet so vicious
                        and base? He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle, and at
                        another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike. To be a great and
                        virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being;
                        to be base and vicious, as many on record have been, appeared the lowest
                        degradation, a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless
                        worm. For a long time I could not conceive how one man could go <pb
                           n="[2.79]" facs="images/2.79.jpg"/> forth to murder his fellow, or even
                        why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of vice and
                        bloodshed, my wonder ceased, and I turned away with disgust and
                        loathing.</p>
                     <p>Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me. While I
                        listened to the instructions which <persName>Felix</persName> bestowed upon
                        the <persName>Arabian</persName>, the strange system of human society was
                        explained to me. I heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and
                        squalid poverty; of rank, descent, and noble blood.</p>
                     <p>The words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the possessions
                        most esteemed by your fellow-creatures were, high and unsullied descent
                        united with riches. A man might be respected with only one of these
                        acquisitions; but without either he was considered, except in very rare
                        instances, <pb n="[2.80]" facs="images/2.80.jpg"/> as a vagabond and a
                        slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profit of the chosen few. And what
                        was I? Of my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant; but I knew that
                        I possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. I was, besides,
                        endowed with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even of
                        the same nature as man. I was more agile than they, and could subsist upon
                        coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my
                        frame; my stature far exceeded their's. When I looked around, I saw and
                        heard of none like me. Was I then a monster, a blot upon the earth, from
                        which all men fled, and whom all men disowned?</p>
                     <p>I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me;
                        I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with knowledge. Oh, that
                           <pb n="[2.81]" facs="images/2.81.jpg"/> I had forever remained in my
                        native wood, nor known or felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and
                        heat!</p>
                     <p>Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind, when it has
                        once seized on it, like a lichen on the rock. I wished sometimes to shake
                        off all thought and feeling; but I learned that there was but one means to
                        overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death—a state which I feared
                        yet did not understand. I admired virtue and good feelings, and loved the
                        gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers; but I was shut out
                        from intercourse with them, except through means which I obtained by
                        stealth, when I was unseen and unknown, and which rather increased than
                        satisfied the desire I had of becoming one among my fellows. The gentle
                        words of <persName>Agatha</persName>, <pb n="[2.82]" facs="images/2.82.jpg"
                        /> and the animated smiles of the charming <persName>Arabian</persName>,
                        were not for me. The mild exhortations of the old man, and the lively
                        conversation of the loved <persName>Felix</persName>, were not for me.
                        Miserable, unhappy wretch!</p>
                     <p>Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply. I heard of the
                        difference of sexes; of the birth and growth of children; how the father
                        doated on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the older
                        child; how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in the
                        precious charge; how the mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge; of
                        brother, sister, and all the various relationships which bind one human
                        being to another in mutual bonds.</p>
                     <p>But where were my friends and relations? No father had watched my infant
                        days, no mother had blessed me <pb n="[2.83]" facs="images/2.83.jpg"/> with
                        smiles and caresses; or if they had, all my past life was now a blot, a
                        blind vacancy in which I distinguished nothing. From my earliest remembrance
                        I had been as I then was in height and proportion. I had never yet seen a
                        being resembling me, or who claimed any intercourse with me. What was I? The
                        question again recurred, to be answered only with groans.</p>
                     <p>I will soon explain to what these feelings tended; but allow me now to
                        return to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various feelings of
                        indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated in additional
                        love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in an innocent, half
                        painful self-deceit, to call them).</p>

                  <said>
                     <p>SOME time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends. It was one
                        which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding as it
                        did a number of circumstances each interesting and wonderful to one so
                        utterly inexperienced as I was.</p>
                     <p>The name of the old man was <persName>De Lacey</persName>. He was descended
                        from a good family in <placeName type="tgn" key="1000070"
                        >France</placeName>, where he had lived for many years in affluence,
                        respected by his superiors, and beloved by his equals. His son was bred in
                        the <pb n="[2.85 - page breaks after 'ser-']" facs="images/2.85.jpg"/>
                        service of his country; and <persName>Agatha</persName> had ranked with
                        ladies of the highest distinction. A few months before my arrival, they had
                        lived in a large and luxurious city, called <placeName type="tgn"
                           key="7008038">Paris</placeName>, surrounded by friends, and possessed of
                        every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or taste, accompanied
                        by a moderate fortune, could afford.</p>
                     <p>The father of <persName>Safie</persName> had been the cause of their ruin.
                        He was a <foreign>Turkish</foreign> merchant, and had inhabited <placeName
                           type="tgn" key="7008038">Paris</placeName> for many years, when, for some
                        reason which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government. He
                        was seized and cast into prison the very day that <persName>Safie</persName>
                        arrived from <placeName type="tgn" key="7002473">Constantinople</placeName>
                        to join him. He was tried, and condemned to death. The injustice of his
                        sentence was very flagrant; all <placeName type="tgn" key="7008038"
                           >Paris</placeName> was indignant; and it was judged that his religion and
                        wealth, rather than the <pb n="[2.86]" facs="images/2.86.jpg"/> crime
                        alleged against him, had been the cause of his condemnation.</p>
                     <p><persName>Felix</persName> had been present at the trial; his horror and
                        indignation were uncontrollable, when he heard the decision of the court. He
                        made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him, and then looked around
                        for the means. After many fruitless attempts to gain admittance to the
                        prison, he found a strongly grated window in an unguarded part of the
                        building, which lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate Mahometan; who,
                        loaded with chains, waited in despair the execution of the barbarous
                        sentence. <persName>Felix</persName> visited the grate at night, and made
                        known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour. The
                           <persName>Turk</persName>, amazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle
                        the zeal of his deliverer by promises of reward and wealth.
                           <persName>Felix</persName> rejected his offers with contempt; yet <pb
                           n="[2.87]" facs="images/2.87.jpg"/> when he saw the lovely
                           <persName>Safie</persName>, who was allowed to visit her father, and who,
                        by her gestures, expressed her lively gratitude, the youth could not help
                        owning to his own mind, that the captive possessed a treasure which would
                        fully reward his toil and hazard.</p>
                     <p>The <persName>Turk</persName> quickly perceived the impression that his
                        daughter had made on the heart of <persName>Felix</persName>, and
                        endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his interests by the promise of
                        her hand in marriage, so soon as he should be conveyed to a place of safety.
                           <persName>Felix</persName> was too delicate to accept this offer; yet he
                        looked forward to the probability of the event as to that consummation of
                        his happiness.</p>
                     <p>During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for the
                        escape of the merchant, the zeal of <persName>Felix</persName> was warmed by
                        several letters <pb n="[2.88]" facs="images/2.88.jpg"/> that he received
                        from this lovely girl, who found means to express her thoughts in the
                        language of her lover by the aid of an old man, a servant of her father's,
                        who understood <foreign>French</foreign>. She thanked him in the most ardent
                        terms for his intended services towards her father; and at the same time
                        deeply deplored her own fate.</p>
                     <p>I have copies of these letters; for I found means, during my residence in
                        the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters were often
                        in the hands of <persName>Felix</persName> or <persName>Agatha</persName>.
                        Before I depart, I will give them to you, they will prove the truth of my
                        tale; but at present, as the sun is already far declined, I shall only have
                        time to repeat the substance of them to you.</p>
                     <p><persName>Safie</persName> related, that her mother was a Christian Arab,
                        seized and made a slave by the Turks; recommended by <pb n="[2.89]"
                           facs="images/2.89.jpg"/> her beauty, she had won the heart of the father
                        of <persName>Safie</persName>, who married her. The young girl spoke in high
                        and enthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom spurned the
                        bondage to which she was now reduced. She instructed her daughter in the
                        tenets of her religion, and taught her to aspire to higher powers of
                        intellect, and an independence of spirit, forbidden to the female followers
                        of <persName type="lccn" key="n79130881">Mahomet</persName>. This lady died;
                        but her lessons were indelibly impressed on the mind of
                           <persName>Safie</persName>, who sickened at the prospect of again
                        returning to <placeName type="tgn" key="1000004">Asia</placeName>, and the
                        being immured within the walls of a haram, allowed only to occupy herself
                        with puerile amusements, ill suited to the temper of her soul, now
                        accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation for virtue. The prospect of
                        marrying a Christian, and remaining in a country <pb n="[2.90]"
                           facs="images/2.90.jpg"/> where women were allowed to take a rank in
                        society, was enchanting to her.</p>
                     <p>The day for the execution of the <persName>Turk</persName> was fixed; but,
                        on the night previous to it, he had quitted prison, and before morning was
                        distant many leagues from <placeName type="tgn" key="7008038"
                           >Paris</placeName>. <persName>Felix</persName> had procured passports in
                        the name of his father, sister, and himself. He had previously communicated
                        his plan to the former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under
                        the pretence of a journey, and concealed himself, with his daughter, in an
                        obscure part of <placeName type="tgn" key="7008038">Paris</placeName>.</p>
                     <p><persName>Felix</persName> conducted the fugitives through <placeName

                           key="7006074">Leghorn</placeName>, where the merchant had decided to wait
                        a favourable opportunity of passing into some part of the

                     <p><persName>Safie</persName> resolved to remain with her father until the

                           facs="images/2.91.jpg"/> departure, before which time the
                           <persName>Turk</persName> renewed his promise that she should be united
                        to his deliverer; and <persName>Felix</persName> remained with them in
                        expectation of that event; and in the mean time he enjoyed the society of
                        the <persName>Arabian</persName>, who exhibited towards him the simplest and
                        tenderest affection. They conversed with one another through the means of an
                        interpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and
                           <persName>Safie</persName> sang to him the divine airs of her native
                        country.</p>
                     <p>The <persName>Turk</persName> allowed this intimacy to take place, and
                        encouraged the hopes of the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had
                        formed far other plans. He loathed the idea that his daughter should be
                        united to a Christian; but he feared the resentment of
                           <persName>Felix</persName> if he should appear lukewarm; for he knew that
                        he was still in the power of his deliverer, if he should choose to betray
                           <pb n="[2.92]" facs="images/2.92.jpg"/> him to the Italian state which
                        they inhabited. He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled
                        to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and secretly to
                        take his daughter with him when he departed. His plans were greatly
                        facilitated by the news which arrived from <placeName type="tgn"
                           key="7008038">Paris</placeName>.</p>
                     <p>The government of <placeName type="tgn" key="1000070">France</placeName>
                        were greatly enraged at the escape of their victim, and spared no pains to
                        detect and punish his deliverer. The plot of <persName>Felix</persName> was
                        quickly discovered, and <persName>De Lacey</persName> and
                           <persName>Agatha</persName> were thrown into prison. The news reached
                           <persName>Felix</persName>, and roused him from his dream of pleasure.
                        His blind and aged father, and his gentle sister, lay in a noisome dungeon,
                        while he enjoyed the free air, and the society of her whom he loved. This
                        idea was torture to him. He quickly arranged with the
                           <persName>Turk</persName>, that if the <pb
                           n="[2.93 - page breaks after 'lat-']" facs="images/2.93.jpg"/> latter
                        should find a favourable opportunity for escape before
                           <persName>Felix</persName> could return to Italy,
                           <persName>Safie</persName> should remain as a boarder at a convent at
                        Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely <persName>Arabian</persName>, he
                        hastened to <placeName type="tgn" key="7008038">Paris</placeName>, and
                        delivered himself up to the vengeance of the law, hoping to free
                           <persName>De Lacey</persName> and <persName>Agatha</persName> by this
                        proceeding.</p>
                     <p>He did not succeed. They remained confined for five months before the trial
                        took place; the result of which deprived them of their fortune, and
                        condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country.</p>
                     <p>They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in <placeName type="tgn"
                           key="7000084">Germany</placeName>, where I discovered them.
                           <persName>Felix</persName> soon learned that the treacherous
                           <persName>Turk</persName>, for whom he and his family endured such
                        unheard-of oppression, on discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to
                        poverty and <pb n="[2.94]" facs="images/2.94.jpg"/> impotence, became a
                        traitor to good feeling and honour, and had quitted <placeName type="tgn"
                           key="1000080">Italy</placeName> with his daughter, insultingly sending
                           <persName>Felix</persName> a pittance of money to aid him, as he said, in
                        some plan of future maintenance.</p>
                     <p>Such were the events that preyed on the heart of <persName>Felix</persName>,
                        and rendered him, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family. He
                        could have endured poverty, and when this distress had been the meed of his
                        virtue, he would have gloried in it: but the ingratitude of the
                           <persName>Turk</persName>, and the loss of his beloved
                           <persName>Safie</persName>, were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable.
                        The arrival of the <persName>Arabian</persName> now infused new life into
                        his soul.</p>
                     <p>When the news reached <placeName type="tgn" key="7006074"
                           >Leghorn</placeName>, that <persName>Felix</persName> was deprived of his
                        wealth and rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her
                           <pb n="[2.95]" facs="images/2.95.jpg"/> lover, but to prepare to return
                        with him to her native country. The generous nature of
                           <persName>Safie</persName> was outraged by this command; she attempted to
                        expostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his
                        tyrannical mandate.</p>
                     <p>A few days after, the <persName>Turk</persName> entered his daughter's
                        apartment, and told her hastily, that he had reason to believe that his
                        residence at <placeName type="tgn" key="7006074">Leghorn</placeName> had
                        been divulged, and that he should speedily be delivered up to the
                           <foreign>French</foreign> government; he had, consequently, hired a
                        vessel to convey him to <placeName type="tgn" key="7002473"
                           >Constantinople</placeName>, for which city he should sail in a few
                        hours. He intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential
                        servant, to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his property,
                        which had not yet arrived at Leghorn.</p>
                     <p>When alone, <persName>Safie</persName> resolved in her <pb n="[2.96]"
                           facs="images/2.96.jpg"/> own mind the plan of conduct that it would
                        become her to pursue in this emergency. A residence in <placeName type="tgn"
                           key="1000144">Turkey</placeName> was abhorrent to her; her religion and
                        her feelings were alike adverse to it. By some papers of her father's, which
                        fell into her hands, she heard of the exile of her lover, and learnt the
                        name of the spot where he then resided. She hesitated some time, but at
                        length she formed her determination. Taking with her some jewels that
                        belonged to her, and a small sum of money, she quitted Italy, with an
                        attendant, a native of <placeName type="tgn" key="7006074"
                           >Leghorn</placeName>, but who understood the common language of
                           <placeName type="tgn" key="1000144">Turkey</placeName>, and departed for
                           <placeName type="tgn" key="7000084">Germany</placeName>.</p>
                     <p>She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage of
                           <persName>De Lacey</persName>, when her attendant fell dangerously ill.
                           <persName>Safie</persName> nursed her with the most devoted affection;
                        but the <pb n="[2.97]" facs="images/2.97.jpg"/> poor girl died, and the
                           <persName>Arabian</persName> was left alone, unacquainted with the
                        language of the country, and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world.
                        She fell, however, into good hands. The Italian had mentioned the name of
                        the spot for which they were bound; and, after her death, the woman of the
                        house in which they had lived took care that <persName>Safie</persName>
                        should arrive in safety at the cottage of her lover.</p></said></said>

                  <said>
                     <p>SUCH was the history of my beloved cottagers. It impressed me deeply. I
                        learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admire their
                        virtues, and to deprecate the vices of mankind.</p>
                     <p>As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil; benevolence and generosity
                        were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to become an actor
                        in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities were called forth and
                        displayed. But, in giving an account of the progress of my intellect, I must
                           <pb n="[2.99]" facs="images/2.99.jpg"/> not omit a circumstance which
                        occurred in the beginning of the month of <date>August</date> of the same
                        year.</p>
                     <p>One night, during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood, where I
                        collected my own food, and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on
                        the ground a leathern portmanteau, containing several articles of dress and
                        some books. I eagerly seized the prize, and returned with it to my hovel.
                        Fortunately the books were written in the language the elements of which I
                        had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of <hi rend="italic"
                              ><title>Paradise Lost</title></hi>, a volume of <hi rend="italic"
                              ><title>Plutarch's Lives</title></hi>, and the <hi rend="italic"
                                 ><title><ref target="#werther" xml:id="wertherA">Sorrows of
                                 Werter</ref></title></hi>. The possession of these treasures gave
                        me extreme delight; I now continually studied and exercised my mind upon
                        these histories, whilst my friends were employed in their ordinary
                        occupations.</p>
                     <pb n="[2.100]" facs="images/2.100.jpg"/>
                     <p>I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. They produced in me
                        an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me to ecstasy,
                        but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. In the <hi
                           rend="italic"><title>Sorrows of Werter</title></hi>, besides the interest
                        of its simple and affecting story, so many opinions are canvassed, and so
                        many lights thrown upon what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects, that
                        I found in it a never-ending source of speculation and astonishment. The
                        gentle and domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and
                        feelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded well
                        with my experience among my protectors, and with the wants which were for
                        ever alive in my own bosom. But I thought <persName>Werter</persName>
                        himself a more divine being than I had ever beheld or <pb n="[2.101]"
                           facs="images/2.101.jpg"/> imagined; his character contained no
                        pretension, but it sunk deep. The disquisitions upon death and suicide were
                        calculated to fill me with wonder. I did not pretend to enter into the
                        merits of the case, yet I inclined towards the opinions of the hero, whose
                        extinction I wept, without precisely understanding it.</p>
                     <p>As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and
                        condition. I found myself similar, yet at the same time strangely unlike the
                        beings concerning whom I read, and to whose conversation I was a listener. I
                        sympathized with, and partly understood them, but I was unformed in mind; I
                        was dependent on none and related to none. The path of my departure was
                        free; and there was none to lament my annihilation. My person was hideous
                        and <pb n="[2.102]" facs="images/2.102.jpg"/> my stature gigantic: what did
                        this mean? Who was I? What was I? Whence did I come? What was my
                        destination? These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to solve
                        them.</p>
                     <p>The volume of <hi rend="italic"><title>Plutarch's Lives</title></hi>, which
                        I possessed, contained the histories of the first founders of the ancient
                        republics. This book had a far different effect upon me from the <hi
                           rend="italic"><title>Sorrows of Werter</title></hi>. I learned from <hi
                           rend="italic"><title>Werter's</title></hi> imaginations despondency and
                        gloom: but <persName type="lccn" key="n79026763" cert="medium"
                           >Plutarch</persName> taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the
                        wretched sphere of my own reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past
                        ages. Many things I read surpassed my understanding and experience. I had a
                        very confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers,
                        and boundless seas. But I was <pb n="[2.103]" facs="images/2.103.jpg"/>
                        perfectly unacquainted with towns, and large assemblages of men. The cottage
                        of my protectors had been the only school in which I had studied human
                        nature; but this book developed new and mightier scenes of action. I read of
                        men concerned in public affairs governing or massacring their species. I
                        felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice,
                        as far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they
                        were, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by these
                        feelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable law givers, <persName
                           type="lccn" key="n85202845">Numa</persName>, <persName type="lccn"
                           key="n79110932">Solon</persName>, and <persName type="lccn"
                           key="nr96035470" cert="medium">Lycurgus</persName>, in preference to
                           <persName type="lccn" key="n83206699">Romulus</persName> and <persName
                           type="lccn" key="no2014083772">Theseus</persName>. The patriarchal lives
                        of my protectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold on my mind;
                        perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a young
                        soldier, burning for glory and <pb n="[2.104]" facs="images/2.104.jpg"/>
                        slaughter, I should have been imbued with different sensations.</p>
                     <p>But <hi rend="italic"><title>Paradise Lost</title></hi> excited different
                        and far deeper emotions. I read it, as I had read the other volumes which
                        had fallen into my hands, as a true history. It moved every feeling of
                        wonder and awe, that the picture of an omnipotent <persName>God</persName>
                        warring with his creatures was capable of exciting. I often referred the
                        several situations, as their similarity struck me, to my own. Like
                           <persName>Adam</persName>, I was created apparently united by no link to
                        any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine in
                        every other respect. He had come forth from the hands of
                           <persName>God</persName> a perfect creature, happy and prosperous,
                        guarded by the especial care of his Creator; he was allowed to converse
                        with, and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature: but I was
                        wretched, <pb n="[2.105]" facs="images/2.105.jpg"/> helpless, and alone.
                        Many times I considered <persName>Satan</persName> as the fitter emblem of
                        my condition; for often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors,
                        the bitter gall of envy rose within me.</p>
                     <p>Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings. Soon after
                        my arrival in the hovel, I discovered some papers in the pocket of the dress
                        which I had taken from your laboratory. At first I had neglected them; but
                        now that I was able to decipher the characters in which they were written, I
                        began to study them with diligence. It was your journal of the four months
                        that preceded my creation. You minutely described in these papers every step
                        you took in the progress of your work; this history was mingled with
                        accounts of domestic occurrences. You, doubtless, recollect these papers.
                        Here they are. Every <pb n="[2.106]" facs="images/2.106.jpg"/> thing is
                        related in them which bears reference to my accursed origin; the whole
                        detail of that series of disgusting circumstances which produced it is set
                        in view; the minutest description of my odious and loathsome person is
                        given, in language which painted your own horrors, and rendered mine
                        ineffaceable. I sickened as I read.</p>
                     <p>Hateful day when I received life! I exclaimed in agony. Cursed creator! Why
                        did you form a monster so hideous that even you turned from me in disgust?
                           <persName>God</persName> in pity made man beautiful and alluring, after
                        his own image; but my form is a filthy type of your’s, more horrid from its
                        very resemblance. <persName>Satan</persName> had his companions,
                        fellow-devils, to admire and encourage him; but I am solitary and
                        detested.</p>
                     <p>These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude; <pb
                           n="[2.107]" facs="images/2.107.jpg"/> but when I contemplated the virtues
                        of the cottagers, their amiable and benevolent dispositions, I persuaded
                        myself that when they should become acquainted with my admiration of their
                        virtues, they would compassionate me, and overlook my personal deformity.
                        Could they turn from their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their
                        compassion and friendship? I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in
                        every way to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my
                        fate. I postponed this attempt for some months longer; for the importance
                        attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail.
                        Besides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every day's
                        experience, that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking until a few
                        more months should have added to my wisdom.</p>
                     <pb n="[2.108]" facs="images/2.108.jpg"/>
                     <p>Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage. The presence of
                           <persName>Safie</persName> diffused happiness among its inhabitants; and
                        I also found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there.
                           <persName>Felix</persName> and <persName>Agatha</persName> spent more
                        time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in their labours by
                        servants. They did not appear rich, but they were contented and happy; their
                        feelings were serene and peaceful, while mine became every day more
                        tumultuous. Increase of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a
                        wretched outcast I was. I cherished hope, it is true; but it vanished, when
                        I beheld my person reflected in water, or my shadow in the moon-shine, even
                        as that frail image and that inconstant shade.</p>
                     <p>I endeavoured to crush these fears, and to fortify myself for the trial
                        which <pb n="[2.109]" facs="images/2.109.jpg"/> in a few months I resolved
                        to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my thoughts, unchecked by reason, to
                        ramble in the fields of Paradise, and dared to fancy amiable and lovely
                        creatures sympathizing with my feelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic
                        countenances breathed smiles of consolation. But it was all a dream: no
                           <persName>Eve</persName> soothed my sorrows, or shared my thoughts; I was
                        alone. I remembered <persName>Adam's</persName> supplication to his Creator;
                        but where was mine? He had abandoned me; and, in the bitterness of my heart,
                        I cursed him.</p>
                     <p>Autumn passed thus. I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay and
                        fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it had worn
                        when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon. Yet I did not heed the
                        bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my conformation for the
                        endurance of cold than heat. But my chief <pb n="[2.110]"
                           facs="images/2.110.jpg"/> delights were the sight of the flowers, the
                        birds, and all the gay apparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned
                        with more attention towards the cottagers. Their happiness was not decreased
                        by the absence of summer. They loved, and sympathized with one another; and
                        their joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the casualties
                        that took place around them. The more I saw of them, the greater became my
                        desire to claim their protection and kindness; my heart yearned to be known
                        and loved by these amiable creatures: to see their sweet looks turned
                        towards me with affection, was the utmost limit of my ambition. I dared not
                        think that they would turn them from me with disdain and horror. The poor
                        that stopped at their door were never driven away. I asked, it is true, for
                        greater treasures than a little food or rest; I required <pb n="[2.111]"
                           facs="images/2.111.jpg"/> kindness and sympathy; but I did not believe
                        myself utterly unworthy of it.</p>
                     <p>The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken place
                        since I awoke into life. My attention, at this time, was solely directed
                        towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my protectors. I
                        revolved many projects; but that on which I finally fixed was, to enter the
                        dwelling when the blind old man should be alone. I had sagacity enough to
                        discover, that the unnatural hideousness of my person was the chief object
                        of horror with those who had formerly beheld me. My voice, although harsh,
                        had nothing terrible in it; I thought, therefore, that if, in the absence of
                        his children, I could gain the good-will and mediation of the old
                           <persName>De Lacey</persName>, I might, by his means, be tolerated by my
                        younger protectors.</p>
                     <pb n="[2.112]" facs="images/2.112.jpg"/>
                     <p>One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground, and
                        diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth,
                        <persName>Safie</persName>, <persName>Agatha</persName>, and
                           <persName>Felix</persName>, departed on a long country walk, and the old
                        man, at his own desire, was left alone in the cottage. When his children had
                        departed, he took up his guitar, and played several mournful, but sweet
                        airs, more sweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before. At
                        first his countenance was illuminated with pleasure, but, as he continued,
                        thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the
                        instrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.</p>
                     <p>My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which would
                        decide my hopes, or realize my fears. The servants were gone to a
                        neighbouring fair. All was silent in and around the cottage: it was an
                        excellent <pb n="[2.113 - page breaks after 'oppor-']"
                           facs="images/2.113.jpg"/> opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute
                        my plan, my limbs failed me, and I sunk to the ground. Again I rose; and,
                        exerting all the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I
                        had placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat. The fresh air revived me,
                        and, with renewed determination, I approached the door of their cottage.</p>
                     <p>I knocked. <said>"Who is there?"</said> said the old man—<said>"Come
                           in."</said></p>
                     <p>I entered; Pardon this intrusion, said I, I am a traveller in want of a
                        little rest; you would greatly oblige me, if you would allow me to remain a
                        few minutes before the fire.</p>
                     <p><said>"Enter,"</said> said <persName>De Lacey</persName>; <said>"and I will
                           try in what manner I can relieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my
                           children are from home, and, as I am blind, I am afraid I shall find it
                           difficult to procure food for you."</said></p>
                     <pb n="[2.114]" facs="images/2.114.jpg"/>
                     <p><said>"Do not trouble yourself, my kind host, I have food; it is warmth and
                           rest only that I need."</said></p>
                     <p>I sat down, and a silence ensued. I knew that every minute was precious to
                        me, yet I remained irresolute in what manner to commence the interview; when
                        the old man addressed me—</p>
                     <p><said>"By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman;—are you
                              <foreign>French</foreign>?"</said></p>
                     <p><said>"No; but I was educated by a <foreign>French</foreign> family, and
                           understand that language only. I am now going to claim the protection of
                           some friends, whom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some
                           hopes."</said></p>
                     <p><said>"Are these <foreign>Germans</foreign>?"</said></p>
                     <p><said>"No, they are <foreign>French</foreign>. But let us change the
                           subject. I am an unfortunate and deserted creature; I look around, and I
                           have no relation or friend <pb n="[2.115]" facs="images/2.115.jpg"/> upon
                           earth. These amiable people to whom I go have never seen me, and know
                           little of me. I am full of fears; for if I fail there, I am an outcast in
                           the world for ever."</said></p>
                     <p><said>"Do not despair. To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate; but the
                           hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest, are full
                           of brotherly love and charity. Rely, therefore, on your hopes; and if
                           these friends are good and amiable, do not despair."</said></p>
                     <p><said>"They are kind—they are the most excellent creatures in the world;
                           but, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me. I have good
                           dispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless, and in some degree
                           beneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they ought
                           to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestable
                           monster."</said></p>
                     <pb n="[2.116]" facs="images/2.116.jpg"/>
                     <p><said>"That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, cannot
                           you undeceive them?"</said></p>
                     <p><said>"I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that I
                           feel so many overwhelming terrors. I tenderly love these friends; I have,
                           unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily kindness
                           towards them; but they believe that I wish to injure them, and it is that
                           prejudice which I wish to overcome."</said></p>
                     <p><said>"Where do these friends reside?"</said></p>
                     <p><said>"Near this spot."</said></p>
                     <p>The old man paused, and then continued, <said>"If you will unreservedly
                           confide to me the particulars of your tale, I perhaps may be of use in
                           undeceiving them. I am blind, and cannot judge of your countenance, but
                           there is something in your words which persuades me that you are sincere.
                           I <pb n="[2.117]" facs="images/2.117.jpg"/> am poor, and an exile; but it
                           will afford me true pleasure to be in any way serviceable to a human
                           creature."</said></p>
                     <p><said>"Excellent man! I thank you, and accept your generous offer. You raise
                           me from the dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your aid, I shall
                           not be driven from the society and sympathy of your
                           fellow-creatures."</said></p>
                     <p><said>"Heaven forbid! even if you were really criminal; for that can only
                           drive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue. I also am
                           unfortunate; I and my family have been condemned, although innocent:
                           judge, therefore, if I do not feel for your misfortunes."</said></p>
                     <p><said>"How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor? From your lips
                           first have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I shall be
                           for ever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success <pb

                     <p>I paused. This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to rob me
                        of, or bestow happiness on me forever. I struggled vainly for firmness
                        sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my remaining
                        strength; I sank on the chair, and sobbed aloud. At that moment I heard the
                        steps of my younger protectors. I had not a moment to lose; but, seizing the
                        hand of the old man, I cried, <said>"Now is the time!—save and protect me!
                           You and your family are the friends whom I seek. Do not you desert me in
                           the hour of trial!"</said></p>
                     <p><said>"Great <persName>God</persName>!"</said> exclaimed the old man,
                           <said>"who are you?"</said></p>
                     <p>At that instant the cottage door <pb n="[2.119]" facs="images/2.119.jpg"/>
                        was opened, and <persName>Felix</persName>, <persName>Safie</persName>, and
                           <persName>Agatha</persName> entered. Who can describe their horror and
                        consternation on beholding me? <persName>Agatha</persName> fainted; and
                           <persName>Safie</persName>, unable to attend to her friend, rushed out of
                        the cottage. <persName>Felix</persName> darted forward, and with
                        supernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung: in a
                        transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently with a
                        stick. I could have torn him limb from limb, as a lion rends the antelope.
                        But my heart sunk within me as with bitter sickness, and I refrained. I saw
                        him on the point of repeating his blow, when, overcome by pain and anguish,
                        I quitted the cottage, and in the general tumult escaped unperceived to my
                        hovel.</p>

               <head>Chapter VIII</head>

               <said>
                  <said>
                     <p>CURSED, cursed creator! Why did I live? Why, in that instant, did I not
                        extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed? I know
                        not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my feelings were those of
                        rage and revenge. I could with pleasure have destroyed the cottage and its
                        inhabitants, and have glutted myself with their shrieks and misery.</p>
                     <p>When night came, I quitted my retreat, and wandered in the wood; and now, no
                        longer restrained by the <pb n="[2.121]" facs="images/2.121.jpg"/> fear of
                        discovery, I gave vent to my anguish in fearful howlings. I was like a wild
                        beast that had broken the toils; destroying the objects that obstructed me,
                        and ranging through the wood with a stag-like swiftness. Oh! what a
                        miserable night I passed! the cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare
                        trees waved their branches above me: now and then the sweet voice of a bird
                        burst forth amidst the universal stillness. All, save I, were at rest or in
                        enjoyment: I, like the arch fiend, bore a hell within me; and, finding
                        myself unsympathized with, wished to tear up the trees, spread havoc and
                        destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed the ruin.</p>
                     <p>But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became fatigued
                        with excess of bodily exertion, and sank on the damp grass in the <pb
                           n="[2.122]" facs="images/2.122.jpg"/> sick impotence of despair. There
                        was none among the myriads of men that existed who would pity or assist me;
                        and should I feel kindness towards my enemies? No: from that moment I
                        declared everlasting war against the species, and, more than all, against
                        him who had formed me, and sent me forth to this insupportable misery.</p>
                     <p>The sun rose; I heard the voices of men, and knew that it was impossible to
                        return to my retreat during that day. Accordingly I hid myself in some thick
                        underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours to reflection on my
                        situation.</p>
                     <p>The pleasant sunshine, and the pure air of day, restored me to some degree
                        of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the cottage, I
                        could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my conclusions. <pb
                           n="[2.123]" facs="images/2.123.jpg"/> I had certainly acted imprudently.
                        It was apparent that my conversation had interested the father in my behalf,
                        and I was a fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children.
                        I ought to have familiarized the old <persName>De Lacey</persName> to me,
                        and by degrees to have discovered myself to the rest of his family, when
                        they should have been prepared for my approach. But I did not believe my
                        errors to be irretrievable; and, after much consideration, I resolved to
                        return to the cottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him
                        to my party.</p>
                     <p>These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound sleep;
                        but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by peaceful dreams.
                        The horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever acting before my eyes;
                        the females were flying, <pb n="[2.124]" facs="images/2.124.jpg"/> and the
                        enraged <persName>Felix</persName> tearing me from his father's feet. I
                        awoke exhausted; and, finding that it was already night, I crept forth from
                        my hiding place, and went in search of food.</p>
                     <p>When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the well-known path
                        that conducted to the cottage. All there was at peace. I crept into my
                        hovel, and remained in silent expectation of the accustomed hour when the
                        family arose. That hour past, the sun mounted high in the heavens, but the
                        cottagers did not appear. I trembled violently, apprehending some dreadful
                        misfortune. The inside of the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I
                        cannot describe the agony of this suspence.</p>
                     <p>Presently two countrymen passed by; but, pausing near the cottage, they
                        entered into conversation, using violent <pb n="[2.125]"
                           facs="images/2.125.jpg"/> gesticulations; but I did not understand what
                        they said, as they spoke the language of the country, which differed from
                        that of my protectors. Soon after, however, <persName>Felix</persName>
                        approached with another man: I was surprised, as I knew that he had not
                        quitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover, from his
                        discourse, the meaning of these unusual appearances.</p>
                     <p><said>"Do you consider,"</said> said his companion to him, <said>"that you
                           will be obliged to pay three months' rent, and to lose the produce of
                           your garden? I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and I beg
                           therefore that you will take some days to consider of your
                           determination."</said></p>
                     <p><said>"It is utterly useless,"</said> replied <persName>Felix</persName>,
                           <said>"we can never again inhabit your cottage. The life of my father is
                           in the greatest danger, owing to the <pb n="[2.126]"
                              facs="images/2.126.jpg"/> dreadful circumstance that I have related.
                           My wife and my sister will never recover their horror. I entreat you not
                           to reason with me any more. Take possession of your tenement, and let me
                           fly from this place."</said></p>
                     <p><persName>Felix</persName> trembled violently as he said this. He and his
                        companion entered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and
                        then departed. I never saw any of the family of <persName>De
                           Lacey</persName> more.</p>
                     <p>I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of utter and
                        stupid despair. My protectors had departed, and had broken the only link
                        that held me to the world. For the first time the feelings of revenge and
                        hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to controul them; but, allowing
                        myself to be borne away by the stream, I bent my mind towards injury and <pb
                           n="[2.127]" facs="images/2.127.jpg"/> death. When I thought of my
                        friends, of the mild voice of <persName>De Lacey</persName>, the gentle eyes
                        of <persName>Agatha</persName>, and the exquisite beauty of the
                           <persName>Arabian</persName>, these thoughts vanished, and a gush of
                        tears somewhat soothed me. But again, when I reflected that they had spurned
                        and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger; and, unable to injure any
                        thing human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects. As night advanced,
                        I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage; and, after having
                        destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden, I waited with forced
                        impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my operations.</p>
                     <p>As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods, and quickly
                        dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens: the blast tore along
                        like a mighty avelanche, and produced <pb n="[2.128]"
                           facs="images/2.128.jpg"/> a kind of insanity in my spirits, that burst
                        all bounds of reason and reflection. I lighted the dry branch of a tree, and
                        danced with fury around the devoted cottage, my eyes still fixed on the
                        western horizon, the edge of which the moon nearly touched. A part of its
                        orb was at length hid, and I waved my brand; it sunk, and, with a loud
                        scream, I fired the straw, and heath, and bushes, which I had collected. The
                        wind fanned the fire, and the cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames,
                        which clung to it, and licked it with their forked and destroying
                        tongues.</p>
                     <p>As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of the
                        habitation, I quitted the scene, and sought for refuge in the woods.</p>
                     <p>And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps? I
                        resolved to fly far from the scene of my <pb n="[2.129]"
                           facs="images/2.129.jpg"/> misfortunes; but to me, hated and despised,
                        every country must be equally horrible. At length the thought of you crossed
                        my mind. I learned from your papers that you were my father, my creator; and
                        to whom could I apply with more fitness than to him who had given me life?
                        Among the lessons that <persName>Felix</persName> had bestowed upon
                           <persName>Safie</persName> geography had not been omitted: I had learned
                        from these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth.
                        You had mentioned <placeName type="tgn" key="7003746">Geneva</placeName> as
                        the name of your native town; and towards this place I resolved to
                        proceed.</p>
                     <p>But how was I to direct myself? I knew that I must travel in a
                        south-westerly direction to reach my destination; but the sun was my only
                        guide. I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass through, nor
                        could I ask information from a single human <pb n="[2.130]"
                           facs="images/2.130.jpg"/> being; but I did not despair. From you only
                        could I hope for succour, although towards you I felt no sentiment but that
                        of hatred. Unfeeling, heartless creator! you had endowed me with perceptions
                        and passions, and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of
                        mankind. But on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you
                        I determined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from any
                        other being that wore the human form.</p>
                     <p>My travels were long, and the sufferings I endured intense. It was late in
                        autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided. I travelled
                        only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a human being. Nature
                        decayed around me, and the sun became heatless; rain and snow poured around
                        me; mighty rivers were <pb n="[2.131]" facs="images/2.131.jpg"/> frozen; the
                        surface of the earth was hard, and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter.
                        Oh, earth! how often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being! The
                        mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall and
                        bitterness. The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more deeply did
                        I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. Snow fell, and the
                        waters were hardened, but I rested not. A few incidents now and then
                        directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I often wandered wide
                        from my path. The agony of my feelings allowed me no respite: no incident
                        occurred from which my rage and misery could not extract its food; but a
                        circumstance that happened when I arrived on the confines of <placeName
                           type="tgn" key="7011731">Switzerland</placeName>, when the sun had
                        recovered its warmth, and the earth again began to look <pb n="[2.132]"
                           facs="images/2.132.jpg"/> green, confirmed in an especial manner the
                        bitterness and horror of my feelings.</p>
                     <p>I generally rested during the day, and travelled only when I was secured by
                        night from the view of man. One morning, however, finding that my path lay
                        through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey after the sun had
                        risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring, cheered even me by the
                        loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of the air. I felt emotions of
                        gentleness and pleasure, that had long appeared dead, revive within me. Half
                        surprised by the novelty of these sensations, I allowed myself to be borne
                        away by them; and, forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy.
                        Soft tears again bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with
                        thankfulness towards the <pb n="[2.133]" facs="images/2.133.jpg"/> blessed
                        sun which bestowed such joy upon me.</p>
                     <p>I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its
                        boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many of
                        the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring. Here I
                        paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard the sound of
                        voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade of a cypress. I
                        was scarcely hid, when a young girl came running towards the spot where I
                        was concealed, laughing as if she ran from some one in sport. She continued
                        her course along the precipitous sides of the river, when suddenly her foot
                        slipt, and she fell into the rapid stream. I rushed from my hiding place,
                        and, with extreme labour from the force of the current, saved her, and
                        dragged her <pb n="[2.134]" facs="images/2.134.jpg"/> to shore. She was
                        senseless; and I endeavoured, by every means in my power, to restore
                        animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic, who
                        was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled. On seeing me, he
                        darted towards me, and, tearing the girl from my arms, hastened towards the
                        deeper parts of the wood. I followed speedily, I hardly knew why; but when
                        the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun, which he carried, at my body, and
                        fired. I sunk to the ground, and my injurer, with increased swiftness,
                        escaped into the wood.</p>
                     <p>This was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human being from
                        destruction, and, as a recompense, I now writhed under the miserable pain of
                        a wound, which shattered the flesh and bone. The <pb n="[2.135]"
                           facs="images/2.135.jpg"/> feelings of kindness and gentleness, which I
                        had entertained but a few moments before, gave place to hellish rage and
                        gnashing of teeth. Inflamed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to
                        all mankind. But the agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I
                        fainted.</p>
                     <p>For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to cure the
                        wound which I had received. The ball had entered my shoulder, and I knew not
                        whether it had remained there or passed through; at any rate I had no means
                        of extracting it. My sufferings were augmented also by the oppressive sense
                        of the injustice and ingratitude of their infliction. My daily vows rose for
                        revenge—a deep and deadly revenge, such as would alone compensate for the
                        outrages and anguish I had endured.</p>
                     <pb n="[2.136]" facs="images/2.136.jpg"/>
                     <p>After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey. The labours I
                        endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or gentle breezes
                        of spring; all joy was but a mockery, which insulted my desolate state, and
                        made me feel more painfully that I was not made for the enjoyment of
                        pleasure.</p>
                     <p>But my toils now drew near a close; and, two months from this time, I
                        reached the environs of <placeName type="tgn" key="7003746"
                           >Geneva</placeName>.</p>
                     <p>It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among the
                        fields that surround it, to meditate in what manner I should apply to you. I
                        was oppressed by fatigue and hunger, and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle
                        breezes of evening, or the prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous
                        mountains of <placeName type="tgn" key="1109172">Jura</placeName>.</p>
                     <p>At this time a slight sleep relieved <pb n="[2.137]" facs="images/2.137.jpg"
                        /> me from the pain of reflection, which was disturbed by the approach of a
                        beautiful child, who came running into the recess I had chosen with all the
                        sportiveness of infancy. Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me,
                        that this little creature was unprejudiced, and had lived too short a time
                        to have imbibed a horror of deformity. If, therefore, I could seize him, and
                        educate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in this
                        peopled earth.</p>
                     <p>Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed, and drew him
                        towards me. As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before his
                        eyes, and uttered a shrill scream: I drew his hand forcibly from his face,
                        and said, <said>"Child, what is the meaning of this? I do not intend to hurt
                           you; listen to me."</said></p>
                     <pb n="[2.138]" facs="images/2.138.jpg"/>
                     <p>He struggled violently; <said>"Let me go,"</said> he cried; <said>"monster!
                           ugly wretch! you wish to eat me, and tear me to pieces—You are an
                           ogre—Let me go, or I will tell my papa."</said></p>
                     <p><said>"Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with
                           me."</said></p>
                     <p><said>"Hideous monster! let me go; My papa is a Syndic—he is <persName>M.
                              Frankenstein</persName>—he would punish you. You dare not keep
                           me."</said></p>
                     <p><said>"<persName>Frankenstein</persName>! you belong then to my enemy—to him
                           towards whom I have sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first
                           victim."</said></p>
                     <p>The child still struggled, and loaded me with epithets which carried despair
                        to my heart: I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a moment he lay
                        dead at my feet.</p>
                     <p>I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and <pb
                           n="[2.139 - page breaks after 'hell-']" facs="images/2.139.jpg"/> hellish
                        triumph: clapping my hands, I exclaimed, <said>"I, too, can create
                           desolation; my enemy is not impregnable; this death will carry despair to
                           him, and a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy
                        him."</said></p>
                     <p>As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his breast. I
                        took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman. In spite of my malignity,
                        it softened and attracted me. For a few moments I gazed with delight on her
                        dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her lovely lips; but presently my
                        rage returned: I remembered that I was for ever deprived of the delights
                        that such beautiful creatures could bestow; and that she whose resemblance I
                        contemplated would, in regarding me, have changed that air of divine
                        benignity to one expressive of disgust and affright.</p>
                     <pb n="[2.140]" facs="images/2.140.jpg"/>
                     <p>Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage? I only wonder
                        that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in exclamations and
                        agony, I did not rush among mankind, and perish in the attempt to destroy
                        them.</p>
                     <p>While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had
                        committed the murder, and was seeking a more secluded hiding-place, when I
                        perceived a woman passing near me. She was young, not indeed so beautiful as
                        her whose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect, and blooming in the
                        loveliness of youth and health. Here, I thought, is one of those whose
                        smiles are bestowed on all but me; she shall not escape: thanks to the
                        lessons of <persName>Felix</persName>, and the sanguinary laws of man, I
                        have learned how to work mischief. I approached her unperceived, and placed
                           <pb n="[2.141]" facs="images/2.141.jpg"/> the portrait securely in one of
                        the folds of her dress.</p>
                     <p>For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place;
                        sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and its
                        miseries for ever. At length I wandered towards these mountains, and have
                        ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning passion which
                        you alone can gratify. We may not part until you have promised to comply
                        with my requisition. I am alone, and miserable; man will not associate with
                        me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself would not deny herself to me.
                        My companion must be of the same species, and have the same defects. This
                        being you must create.</p></said></said>

               <said>
                  <p>THE being finished speaking, and fixed his looks upon me in expectation of a
                     reply. But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to arrange my ideas
                     sufficiently to understand the full extent of his proposition. He
                     continued—</p>
                  <p><said>"You must create a female for me, with whom I can live in the interchange
                        of those sympathies necessary for my being. This you alone can do; and I
                        demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse."</said></p>
                  <p>The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had <pb
                        n="[2.143]" facs="images/2.143.jpg"/> died away while he narrated his
                     peaceful life among the cottagers, and, as he said this, I could no longer
                     suppress the rage that burned within me.</p>
                  <p><said>"I do refuse it,"</said> I replied; <said>"and no torture shall ever
                        extort a consent from me. You may render me the most miserable of men, but
                        you shall never make me base in my own eyes. Shall I create another like
                        yourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world. Begone! I have
                        answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"You are in the wrong,"</said> replied the fiend; <said>"and, instead of
                        threatening, I am content to reason with you. I am malicious because I am
                        miserable; am I not shunned and hated by all mankind? You, my creator, would
                        tear me to pieces, and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I should pity
                        man <pb n="[2.144]" facs="images/2.144.jpg"/> more than he pities me? You
                        would not call it murder, if you could precipitate me into one of those
                        ice-rifts, and destroy my frame, the work of your own hands. Shall I respect
                        man, when he contemns me? Let him live with me in the interchange of
                        kindness, and, instead of injury, I would bestow every benefit upon him with
                        tears of gratitude at his acceptance. But that cannot be; the human senses
                        are insurmountable barriers to our union. Yet mine shall not be the
                        submission of abject slavery. I will revenge my injuries: if I cannot
                        inspire love, I will cause fear; and chiefly towards you my arch-enemy,
                        because my creator, do I swear inextinguishable hatred. Have a care: I will
                        work at your destruction, nor finish until I desolate your heart, so that
                        you curse the hour of your birth."</said></p>
                  <pb n="[2.145]" facs="images/2.145.jpg"/>
                  <p>A fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled into
                     contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently he calmed
                     himself, and proceeded—</p>
                  <p><said>"I intended to reason. This passion is detrimental to me; for you do not
                        reflect that you are the cause of its excess. If any being felt emotions of
                        benevolence towards me, I should return them an hundred and an hundred fold;
                        for that one creature's sake, I would make peace with the whole kind! But I
                        now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realized. What I ask of you is
                        reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of another sex, but as hideous
                        as myself: the gratification is small, but it is all that I can receive, and
                        it shall content me. It is true, we shall be monsters, cut off from all the
                        world; but on that account we shall be <pb n="[2.146]"
                           facs="images/2.146.jpg"/> more attached to one another. Our lives will
                        not be happy, but they will be harmless, and free from the misery I now
                        feel. Oh! my creator, make me happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for
                        one benefit! Let me see that I excite the sympathy of some existing thing;
                        do not deny me my request!"</said></p>
                  <p>I was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences of my
                     consent; but I felt that there was some justice in his argument. His tale, and
                     the feelings he now expressed, proved him to be a creature of fine sensations;
                     and did I not, as his maker, owe him all the portion of happiness that it was
                     in my power to bestow? He saw my change of feeling, and continued—</p>
                  <p><said>"If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see us
                           <pb n="[2.147]" facs="images/2.147.jpg"/> again: I will go to the vast
                        wilds of <placeName type="tgn" key="1000002">South America</placeName>. My
                        food is not that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid, to glut my
                        appetite; acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment. My companion
                        will be of the same nature as myself, and will be content with the same
                        fare. We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on
                        man, and will ripen our food. The picture I present to you is peaceful and
                        human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the wantonness of
                        power and cruelty. Pitiless as you have been towards me, I now see
                        compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment, and persuade
                        you to promise what I so ardently desire."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"You propose,"</said> replied I, <said>"to fly from the habitations of
                        man, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the <pb n="[2.148]"
                           facs="images/2.148.jpg"/> field will be your only companions. How can
                        you, who long for the love and sympathy of man, persevere in this exile? You
                        will return, and again seek their kindness, and you will meet with their
                        detestation; your evil passions will be renewed, and you will then have a
                        companion to aid you in the task of destruction. This may not be; cease to
                        argue the point, for I cannot consent."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"How inconstant are your feelings! but a moment ago you were moved by my
                        representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints? I
                        swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me, that,
                        with the companion you bestow, I will quit the neighbourhood of man, and
                        dwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places. My evil passions will
                        have fled, for <pb n="[2.149]" facs="images/2.149.jpg"/> I shall meet with
                        sympathy; my life will flow quietly away, and, in my dying moments, I shall
                        not curse my maker."</said></p>
                  <p>His words had a strange effect upon me. I compassionated him, and sometimes
                     felt a wish to console him; but when I looked upon him, when I saw the filthy
                     mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened, and my feelings were altered to
                     those of horror and hatred. I tried to stifle these sensations; I thought,
                     that, as I could not sympathize with him, I had no right to withhold from him
                     the small portion of happiness which was yet in my power to bestow.</p>
                  <p><said>"You swear,"</said> I said, <said>"to be harmless; but have you not
                        already shewn a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust
                        you? May not even this be a feint that will increase <pb n="[2.150]"
                           facs="images/2.150.jpg"/> your triumph by affording a wider scope for
                        your revenge?"</said></p>
                  <p><said>"How is this? I thought I had moved your compassion, and yet you still
                        refuse to bestow on me the only benefit that can soften my heart, and render
                        me harmless. If I have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my
                        portion; the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I
                        shall become a thing, of whose existence every one will be ignorant. My
                        vices are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor; and my virtues
                        will necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal. I shall feel
                        the affections of a sensitive being, and become linked to the chain of
                        existence and events, from which I am now excluded."</said></p>
                  <p>I paused some time to reflect on all he had related, and the various <pb
                        n="[2.151 - page breaks after 'argu-']" facs="images/2.151.jpg"/> arguments
                     which he had employed. I thought of the promise of virtues which he had
                     displayed on the opening of his existence, and the subsequent blight of all
                     kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had manifested
                     towards him. His power and threats were not omitted in my calculations: a
                     creature who could exist in the ice caves of the glaciers, and hide himself
                     from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices, was a being
                     possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with. After a long pause of
                     reflection, I concluded, that the justice due both to him and my
                     fellow-creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request. Turning
                     to him, therefore, I said—</p>
                  <p><said>"I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit <placeName
                           type="tgn" key="1000003">Europe</placeName> for ever, and every other
                        place in the <pb n="[2.152 - page breaks after 'neighbour-']"
                           facs="images/2.152.jpg"/> neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall
                        deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your
                        exile."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"I swear,"</said> he cried, <said>"by the sun, and by the blue sky of
                        heaven, that if you grant my prayer, while they exist you shall never behold
                        me again. Depart to your home, and commence your labours: I shall watch
                        their progress with unutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are
                        ready I shall appear."</said></p>
                  <p>Saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in my
                     sentiments. I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than the flight
                     of an eagle, and quickly lost him among the undulations of the sea of ice.</p>
                  <p>His tale had occupied the whole day; and the sun was upon the verge of the
                     horizon when he departed. I knew <pb n="[2.153]" facs="images/2.153.jpg"/> that
                     I ought to hasten my descent towards the valley, as I should soon be
                     encompassed in darkness; but my heart was heavy, and my steps slow. The labour
                     of winding among the little paths of the mountains, and fixing my feet firmly
                     as I advanced, perplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the
                     occurrences of the day had produced. Night was far advanced, when I came to the
                     half-way resting-place, and seated myself beside the fountain. The stars shone
                     at intervals, as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines rose before
                     me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the ground: it was a scene of
                     wonderful solemnity, and stirred strange thoughts within me. I wept bitterly;
                     and, clasping my hands in agony, I exclaimed, <said>"Oh! stars, and clouds, and
                        winds, ye are all about to mock <pb n="[2.154]" facs="images/2.154.jpg"/>
                        me: if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as
                        nought; but if not, depart, depart and leave me in darkness."</said></p>
                  <p>These were wild and miserable thoughts; but I cannot describe to you how the
                     eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me, and how I listened to every
                     blast of wind, as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its way to consume me.</p>
                  <p>Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of <placeName type="tgn"
                        key="1032562">Chamounix</placeName>; but my presence, so haggard and
                     strange, hardly calmed the fears of my family, who had waited the whole night
                     in anxious expectation of my return.</p>
                  <p>The following day we returned to <placeName type="tgn" key="7003746"
                        >Geneva</placeName>. The intention of my father in coming had been to divert
                     my mind, and to restore me to my lost tranquillity; but the medicine had been
                     fatal. And, unable to account for the excess of <pb n="[2.155]"
                        facs="images/2.155.jpg"/> misery I appeared to suffer, he hastened to return
                     home, hoping the quiet and monotony of a domestic life would by degrees
                     alleviate my sufferings from whatsoever cause they might spring.</p>
                  <p>For myself, I was passive in all their arrangements; and the gentle affection
                     of my beloved <persName>Elizabeth</persName> was inadequate to draw me from the
                     depth of my despair. The promise I had made to the dæmon weighed upon my mind,
                     like <persName type="lccn" key="n78095495"><rs content="#dante"
                        >Dante</rs></persName>'s iron cowl on the heads of the hellish hypocrites.
                     All pleasures of earth and sky passed before me like a dream, and that thought
                     only had to me the reality of life. Can you wonder, that sometimes a kind of
                     insanity possessed me, or that I saw continually about me a multitude of filthy
                     animals inflicting on me incessant torture, that often extorted screams and
                     bitter groans?</p>
                  <pb n="[2.156]" facs="images/2.156.jpg"/>
                  <p>By degrees, however, these feelings became calmed. I entered again into the
                     every-day scene of life, if not with interest, at least with some degree of
                     tranquillity."</p>

               <said>
                  <p>DAY after day, week after week, passed away on my return to <placeName
                        type="tgn" key="7003746">Geneva</placeName>; and I could not collect the
                     courage to recommence my work. I feared the vengeance of the disappointed
                     fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task which was
                     enjoined me. I found that I could not compose a female without again devoting
                     several months to profound study and <pb n="[3.2 - page breaks after 'labo-']"
                        facs="images/3.2.jpg"/> laborious disquisition. I had heard of some
                     discoveries having been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which
                     was material to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my father's
                     consent to visit <placeName type="tgn" key="7002445">England</placeName> for
                     this purpose; but I clung to every pretence of delay, and could not resolve to
                     interrupt my returning tranquillity. My health, which had hitherto declined,
                     was now much restored; and my spirits, when unchecked by the memory of my
                     unhappy promise, rose proportionably. My father saw this change with pleasure,
                     and he turned his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains
                     of my melancholy, which every now and then would return by fits, and with a
                     devouring blackness overcast the approaching sunshine. At these moments I took
                     refuge in the most perfect solitude. I passed whole <pb n="[3.3]"
                        facs="images/3.3.jpg"/> days on the lake alone in a little boat, watching
                     the clouds, and listening to the rippling of the waves, silent and listless.
                     But the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of
                     composure; and, on my return, I met the salutations of my friends with a
                     readier smile and a more cheerful heart.</p>
                  <p>It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father, calling me
                     aside, thus addressed me:—</p>
                  <p><said>"I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former
                        pleasures, and seem to be returning to yourself. And yet you are still
                        unhappy, and still avoid our society. For some time I was lost in conjecture
                        as to the cause of this; but yesterday an idea struck me, and if it is well
                        founded, I conjure you to avow it. Reserve on such a point would be not only
                           <pb n="[3.4]" facs="images/3.4.jpg"/> useless, but draw down treble
                        misery on us all."</said></p>
                  <p>I trembled violently at this exordium, and my father continued—</p>
                  <p><said>"I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your marriage
                        with your cousin as the tie of our domestic comfort, and the stay of my
                        declining years. You were attached to each other from your earliest infancy;
                        you studied together, and appeared, in dispositions and tastes, entirely
                        suited to one another. But so blind is the experience of man, that what I
                        conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have entirely destroyed
                        it. You, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any wish that she might
                        become your wife. Nay, you may have met with another whom you may love; and,
                        considering yourself as bound in honour to your cousin, this struggle <pb
                           n="[3.5]" facs="images/3.5.jpg"/> may occasion the poignant misery which
                        you appear to feel."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"My dear father, re-assure yourself. I love my cousin tenderly and
                        sincerely. I never saw any woman who excited, as
                           <persName>Elizabeth</persName> does, my warmest admiration and affection.
                        My future hopes and prospects are entirely bound up in the expectation of
                        our union."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"The expression of your sentiments on this subject, my dear
                           <persName>Victor</persName>, gives me more pleasure than I have for some
                        time experienced. If you feel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however
                        present events may cast a gloom over us. But it is this gloom, which appears
                        to have taken so strong a hold of your mind, that I wish to dissipate. Tell
                        me, therefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the
                        marriage. We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us from <pb
                           n="[3.6]" facs="images/3.6.jpg"/> that every-day tranquillity befitting
                        my years and infirmities. You are younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed
                        as you are of a competent fortune, that an early marriage would at all
                        interfere with any future plans of honour and utility that you may have
                        formed. Do not suppose, however, that I wish to dictate happiness to you, or
                        that a delay on your part would cause me any serious uneasiness. Interpret
                        my words with candour, and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and
                        sincerity."</said></p>
                  <p>I listened to my father in silence, and remained for some time incapable of
                     offering any reply. I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of thoughts, and
                     endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion. Alas! to me the idea of an immediate
                     union with my cousin was one of horror and dismay. I was bound <pb n="[3.7]"
                        facs="images/3.7.jpg"/> by a solemn promise, which I had not yet fulfilled,
                     and dared not break; or, if I did, what manifold miseries might not impend over
                     me and my devoted family! Could I enter into a festival with this deadly weight
                     yet hanging round my neck, and bowing me to the ground. I must perform my
                     engagement, and let the monster depart with his mate, before I allowed myself
                     to enjoy the delight of an union from which I expected peace.</p>
                  <p>I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to
                        <placeName type="tgn" key="7002445">England</placeName>, or entering into a
                     long correspondence with those philosophers of that country, whose knowledge
                     and discoveries were of indispensable use to me in my present undertaking. The
                     latter method of obtaining the desired intelligence was dilatory and
                     unsatisfactory: besides, any variation was <pb n="[3.8]" facs="images/3.8.jpg"
                     /> agreeable to me, and I was delighted with the idea of spending a year or two
                     in change of scene and variety of occupation, in absence from my family; during
                     which period some event might happen which would restore me to them in peace
                     and happiness: my promise might be fulfilled, and the monster have departed; or
                     some accident might occur to destroy him, and put an end to my slavery for
                     ever.</p>
                  <p>These feelings dictated my answer to my father. I expressed a wish to visit
                        <placeName type="tgn" key="7002445">England</placeName>; but, concealing the
                     true reasons of this request, I clothed my desires under the guise of wishing
                     to travel and see the world before I sat down for life within the walls of my
                     native town.</p>
                  <p>I urged my entreaty with earnestness, and my father was easily induced to
                     comply; for a more indulgent and <pb n="[3.9]" facs="images/3.9.jpg"/> less
                     dictatorial parent did not exist upon earth. Our plan was soon arranged. I
                     should travel to <placeName type="tgn" key="7012346">Strasburgh</placeName>,
                     where <persName>Clerval</persName> would join me. Some short time would be
                     spent in the towns of Holland, and our principal stay would be in <placeName
                        type="tgn" key="7002445">England</placeName>. We should return by <placeName
                        type="tgn" key="1000070">France</placeName>; and it was agreed that the tour
                     should occupy the space of two years.</p>
                  <p>My father pleased himself with the reflection, that my union with
                        <persName>Elizabeth</persName> should take place immediately on my return to
                        <placeName type="tgn" key="7003746">Geneva</placeName>. <said>"These two
                        years,"</said> said he, <said>"will pass swiftly, and it will be the last
                        delay that will oppose itself to your happiness. And, indeed, I earnestly
                        desire that period to arrive, when we shall all be united, and neither hopes
                        or fears arise to disturb our domestic calm."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"I am content,"</said> I replied, <said>"with <pb n="[3.10]"
                           facs="images/3.10.jpg"/> your arrangement. By that time we shall both
                        have become wiser, and I hope happier, than we at present are."</said> I
                     sighed; but my father kindly forbore to question me further concerning the
                     cause of my dejection. He hoped that new scenes, and the amusement of
                     travelling, would restore my tranquillity.</p>
                  <p>I now made arrangements for my journey; but one feeling haunted me, which
                     filled me with fear and agitation. During my absence I should leave my friends
                     unconscious of the existence of their enemy, and unprotected from his attacks,
                     exasperated as he might be by my departure. But he had promised to follow me
                     wherever I might go; and would he not accompany me to <placeName type="tgn"
                        key="7002445">England</placeName>? This imagination was dreadful in itself,
                     but soothing, inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends. I was agonized
                     with the idea of the <pb n="[3.11 - page breaks after 'pos-']"
                        facs="images/3.11.jpg"/> possibility that the reverse of this might happen.
                     But through the whole period during which I was the slave of my creature, I
                     allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of the moment; and my present
                     sensations strongly intimated that the fiend would follow me, and exempt my
                     family from the danger of his machinations.</p>
                  <p>It was in the latter end of August that I departed, to pass two years of exile.
                        <persName>Elizabeth</persName> approved of the reasons of my departure, and
                     only regretted that she had not the same opportunities of enlarging her
                     experience, and cultivating her understanding. She wept, however, as she bade
                     me farewell, and entreated me to return happy and tranquil. <said>"We
                        all,"</said> said she, <said>"depend upon you; and if you are miserable,
                        what must be our feelings?"</said></p>
                  <pb n="[3.12]" facs="images/3.12.jpg"/>
                  <p>I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly knowing
                     whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around. I remembered
                     only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on it, to order that my
                     chemical instruments should be packed to go with me: for I resolved to fulfil
                     my promise while abroad, and return, if possible, a free man. Filled with
                     dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful and majestic scenes; but
                     my eyes were fixed and unobserving. I could only think of the bourne of my
                     travels, and the work which was to occupy me whilst they endured.</p>
                  <p>After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed many
                     leagues, I arrived at <placeName type="tgn" key="7012346"
                        >Strasburgh</placeName>, where I waited two days for
                        <persName>Clerval</persName>. He came. Alas, how great was the contrast
                     between <pb n="[3.13]" facs="images/3.13.jpg"/> us! He was alive to every new
                     scene; joyful when he saw the beauties of the setting sun, and more happy when
                     he beheld it rise, and recommence a new day. He pointed out to me the shifting
                     colours of the landscape, and the appearances of the sky. <said>"This is what
                        it is to live,"</said> he cried, <said>"now I enjoy existence! But you, my
                        dear Frankenstein, wherefore are you desponding and sorrowful?"</said> In
                     truth, I was occupied by gloomy thoughts, and neither saw the descent of the
                     evening star, nor the golden sun-rise reflected in the <placeName type="tgn"
                        key="7012611">Rhine</placeName>.—And you, my friend, would be far more
                     amused with the journal of <persName>Clerval</persName>, who observed the
                     scenery with an eye of feeling and delight, than to listen to my reflections.
                     I, a miserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to
                     enjoyment.</p>
                  <p>We had agreed to descend the <placeName type="tgn" key="7012611"
                        >Rhine</placeName><pb n="[3.14]" facs="images/3.14.jpg"/> in a boat from
                        <placeName type="tgn" key="7012346">Strasburgh</placeName> to Rotterdam,
                     whence we might take shipping for <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781"
                        >London</placeName>. During this voyage, we passed many willowy islands, and
                     saw several beautiful towns. We staid a day at <placeName type="tgn"
                        key="7129524">Manheim</placeName>, and, on the fifth from our departure from
                        <placeName type="tgn" key="7012346">Strasburgh</placeName>, arrived at
                        <placeName type="tgn" key="7004449">Mayence</placeName>. The course of the
                        <placeName type="tgn" key="7012611">Rhine</placeName> below <placeName
                        type="tgn" key="7004449">Mayence</placeName> becomes much more picturesque.
                     The river descends rapidly, and winds between hills, not high, but steep, and
                     of beautiful forms. We saw many ruined castles standing on the edges of
                     precipices, surrounded by black woods, high and inaccessible. This part of the
                        <placeName type="tgn" key="7012611">Rhine</placeName>, indeed, presents a
                     singularly variegated landscape. In one spot you view rugged hills, ruined
                     castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with the dark <placeName type="tgn"
                        key="7012611">Rhine</placeName> rushing beneath; and, on the sudden turn of
                     a promontory, flourishing vineyards, with <pb n="[3.15]" facs="images/3.15.jpg"
                     /> green sloping banks, and a meandering river, and populous towns, occupy the
                     scene.</p>
                  <p>We travelled at the time of the vintage, and heard the song of the labourers,
                     as we glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits
                     continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at the
                     bottom of the boat, and, as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to
                     drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And if these were
                     my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as if he had been
                     transported to Fairy-land, and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by man.
                        <said>"I have seen,"</said> he said, <said>"the most beautiful scenes of my
                        own country; I have visited the <placeName type="tgn" key="7007492">lakes of

                        perpendicularly to the water, casting black and impenetrable shades, which
                        would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance, were it not for the most
                        verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay appearance; I have seen
                        this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water,
                        and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be on the great ocean, and
                        the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain, where the priest and his
                        mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche, and where their dying voices are
                        still said to be heard amid the pauses of the nightly wind; I have seen the
                           <placeName type="tgn" key="7007843">mountains of La Valais</placeName>,
                        and the <placeName type="tgn" key="7003763">Pays de Vaud</placeName>: but
                        this country, <persName>Victor</persName>, pleases me more than all those
                        wonders. The mountains of <placeName type="tgn" key="7011731"
                           >Switzerland</placeName> are more majestic and strange; but there is a
                        charm in the banks of this divine river, <pb n="[3.17]"
                           facs="images/3.17.jpg"/> that I never before saw equalled. Look at that
                        castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the island, almost
                        concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now that group of
                        labourers coming from among their vines; and that village half-hid in the
                        recess of the mountain. Oh, surely, the spirit that inhabits and guards this
                        place has a soul more in harmony with man, than those who pile the glacier,
                        or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of our own
                        country."</said></p>
                  <p>
                     <persName>Clerval</persName>! beloved friend! even now it delights me to record
                     your words, and to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving.
                     He was a being formed in the <said>"very poetry of nature."</said> His wild and
                     enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the <pb

                     of his heart. His soul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship
                     was of that devoted and wondrous nature that the worldy-minded teach us to look
                     for only in the imagination. But even human sympathies were not sufficient to
                     satisfy his eager mind. The scenery of external nature, which others regard
                     only with admiration, he loved with ardour:</p>

                  <p>And where does he now exist? Is this gentle and lovely being lost forever? Has

                     imaginations fanciful and magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence
                     depended on the life of its creator; has this mind perished? Does it now only
                     exist in my memory? No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and
                     beaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and consoles
                     your unhappy friend.</p>
                  <p>Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight tribute to
                     the unexampled worth of <persName>Henry</persName>, but they soothe my heart,
                     overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates. I will proceed with
                     my tale.</p>
                  <p>Beyond <placeName type="tgn" key="7004446">Cologne</placeName> we descended to

                     resolved to post the remainder of our way; for the wind was contrary, and the
                     stream of the river was too gentle to aid us.</p>
                  <p>Our journey here lost the interest <pb n="[3.20]" facs="images/3.20.jpg"/>
                     arising from beautiful scenery; but we arrived in a few days at Rotterdam,
                     whence we proceeded by sea to <placeName type="tgn" key="7002445"
                        >England</placeName>. It was on a clear morning, in the latter days of
                     September, that I first saw the white cliffs of <placeName type="tgn"
                        key="7008653">Britain</placeName>. The banks of the <placeName type="tgn"
                        key="7011913">Thames</placeName> presented a new scene; they were flat, but
                     fertile, and almost every town was marked by the remembrance of some story. We
                     saw <placeName type="tgn" key="7011913">Tilbury Fort</placeName>, and
                     remembered the Spanish armada; <placeName type="tgn" key="7011614"

                  <p>At length, we saw the numerous steeples of <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781"

                     <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName>was our present point of
                     rest; we determined to remain several months in this wonderful and celebrated
                     city. <persName>Clerval</persName> desired the intercourse of the men of genius
                     and talent who flourished at this time; but this was with me a secondary
                     object; I was principally occupied with the means of obtaining the information
                     necessary for the completion of my promise, and quickly availed myself of the
                     letters of introduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the most
                     distinguished natural philosophers.</p>
                  <p>If this journey had taken place during <pb n="[3.22]" facs="images/3.22.jpg"/>
                     my days of study and happiness, it would have afforded me inexpressible
                     pleasure. But a blight had come over my existence, and I only visited these
                     people for the sake of the information they might give me on the subject in
                     which my interest was so terribly profound. Company was irksome to me; when
                     alone, I could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of
                        <persName>Henry</persName> soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a
                     transitory peace. But busy uninteresting joyous faces brought back despair to
                     my heart. I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my fellow-men;
                     this barrier was sealed with the blood of <persName>William</persName> and
                        <persName>Justine</persName>; and to reflect on the events connected with
                     those names filled my soul with anguish.</p>
                  <p>But in <persName>Clerval</persName> I saw the image of my former self; he was
                     inquisitive, and <pb n="[3.23 - page breaks after 'an-']"
                        facs="images/3.23.jpg"/> anxious to gain experience and instruction. The
                     difference of manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of
                     instruction and amusement. He was for ever busy; and the only check to his
                     enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mien. I tried to conceal this as much
                     as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one who
                     was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by any care or bitter
                     recollection. I often refused to accompany him, alleging another engagement,
                     that I might remain alone. I now also began to collect the materials necessary
                     for my new creation, and this was to me like the torture of single drops of
                     water continually falling on the head. Every thought that was devoted to it was
                     an extreme anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it <pb
                        n="[3.24]" facs="images/3.24.jpg"/> caused my lips to quiver, and my heart
                     to palpitate.</p>

                        >London</placeName>, we received a letter from a person in <placeName

                     visitor at <placeName type="tgn" key="7003746">Geneva</placeName>. He mentioned
                     the beauties of his native country, and asked us if those were not sufficient
                     allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth, where he
                     resided. <persName>Clerval</persName> eagerly desired to accept this
                     invitation; and I, although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains
                     and streams, and all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen
                     dwelling-places.</p>
                  <p>We had arrived in <placeName type="tgn" key="7002445">England</placeName> at
                     the beginning of October, and it was now February. We accordingly determined to
                     commence our journey towards the north at the expiration of another month. In
                     this expedition we did not <pb n="[3.25]" facs="images/3.25.jpg"/> intend to
                     follow the great road to <placeName type="tgn" key="7009546"
                        >Edinburgh</placeName>, but to visit <placeName type="tgn" key="7011919"
                        >Windsor</placeName>, <placeName type="tgn" key="7011931"
                     >Oxford</placeName>, <placeName type="tgn" key="1030005">Matlock</placeName>,
                     and the <placeName type="tgn" key="7010206">Cumberland lakes</placeName>,
                     resolving to arrive at the completion of this tour about the end of July. I
                     packed up my chemical instruments, and the materials I had collected, resolving
                     to finish my labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of
                        <placeName type="tgn" key="7002444">Scotland</placeName>.</p>
                  <p>We quitted <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName> on the
                        <date>27th of March</date>, and remained a few days at <placeName type="tgn"
                        key="7011919">Windsor</placeName>, rambling in its beautiful forest. This
                     was a new scene to us mountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game,
                     and the herds of stately deer, were all novelties to us.</p>
                  <p>From thence we proceeded to <placeName type="tgn" key="7011931"
                        >Oxford</placeName>. As we entered this city, our minds were filled with the
                     remembrance of the events that had been transacted there more than a century
                     and a half <pb n="[3.26]" facs="images/3.26.jpg"/> before. It was here that
                        <persName type="lccn" key="n79132433">Charles I</persName>. had collected
                     his forces. This city had remained faithful to him, after the whole nation had
                     forsaken his cause to join the standard of parliament and liberty. The memory
                     of that unfortunate king, and his companions, the amiable <persName type="lccn"
                        key="n83180215">Falkland</persName>, the insolent <persName type="lccn"
                        key="n85115759" cert="low">Gower</persName>, his queen, and son, gave a
                     peculiar interest to every part of the city, which they might be supposed to
                     have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a dwelling here, and we
                     delighted to trace its footsteps. If these feelings had not found an imaginary
                     gratification, the appearance of the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty
                     to obtain our admiration. The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets
                     are almost magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through
                     meadows of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a <pb n="[3.27]"
                        facs="images/3.27.jpg"/> placid expanse of waters, which reflects its
                     majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and domes, embosomed among aged
                     trees.</p>
                  <p>I enjoyed this scene; and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of
                     the past, and the anticipation of the future. I was formed for peaceful
                     happiness. During my youthful days discontent never visited my mind; and if I
                     was ever overcome by ennui, the sight of what is beautiful in nature, or the
                     study of what is excellent and sublime in the productions of man, could always
                     interest my heart, and communicate elasticity to my spirits. But I am a blasted
                     tree; the bolt has entered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to
                     exhibit, what I shall soon cease to be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked
                     humanity, pitiable to others, and abhorrent to myself.</p>
                  <pb n="[3.28]" facs="images/3.28.jpg"/>
                  <p>We passed a considerable period at <placeName type="tgn" key="7011931"
                        >Oxford</placeName>, rambling among its environs, and endeavouring to
                     identify every spot which might relate to the most animating epoch of
                        <foreign>English</foreign> history. Our little voyages of discovery were
                     often prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves. We visited
                     the tomb of the illustrious Hampden, and the field on which that patriot fell.
                     For a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears, to
                     contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and self-sacrifice, of which these
                     sights were the monuments and the remembrancers. For an instant I dared to
                     shake off my chains, and look around me with a free and lofty spirit; but the
                     iron had eaten into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my
                     miserable self.</p>
                  <p>We left <placeName type="tgn" key="7011931">Oxford</placeName> with regret, and
                        <pb n="[3.29 - page breaks after 'pro-']" facs="images/3.29.jpg"/> proceeded
                     to <placeName type="tgn" key="1030005">Matlock</placeName>, which was our next
                     place of rest. The country in the neighbourhood of this village resembled, to a
                     greater degree, the scenery of <placeName type="tgn" key="7011731"
                        >Switzerland</placeName>; but everything is on a lower scale, and the green
                     hills want the crown of distant white <placeName type="tgn" key="7007746"
                        >Alps</placeName>, which always attend on the piny mountains of my native
                     country. We visited the wondrous cave, and the little cabinets of natural
                     history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same manner as in the
                     collections at <placeName type="tgn" key="1035711">Servox</placeName> and
                        <placeName type="tgn" key="1032562">Chamounix</placeName>. The latter name
                     made me tremble, when pronounced by <persName>Henry</persName>; and I hastened
                     to quit <placeName type="tgn" key="1030005">Matlock</placeName>, with which
                     that terrible scene was thus associated.</p>
                  <p>From <placeName type="tgn" key="7010684">Derby</placeName> still journeying
                     northward, we passed two months in <placeName type="tgn" key="7011987"
                        >Cumberland</placeName> and <placeName type="tgn" key="5000223"
                        >Westmoreland</placeName>. I could now almost fancy myself among the <pb
                        n="[3.30]" facs="images/3.30.jpg"/>
                     <placeName type="tgn" key="7007746">Swiss mountains</placeName>. The little
                     patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides of the mountains, the
                     lakes, and the dashing of the rocky streams, were all familiar and dear sights
                     to me. Here also we made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me
                     into happiness. The delight of <persName>Clerval</persName> was proportionably
                     greater than mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he
                     found in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have
                     imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his inferiors.
                        <said>"I could pass my life here,"</said> said he to me; <said>"and among
                        these mountains I should scarcely regret <placeName type="tgn" key="7011731"
                           >Switzerland</placeName> and the <placeName type="tgn" key="7012611"
                           >Rhine</placeName>."</said></p>
                  <p>But he found that a traveller's life is one that includes much pain amidst its
                     enjoyments. His feelings are for ever on the stretch; and when he <pb
                        n="[3.31 - page breaks after 'be-']" facs="images/3.31.jpg"/> begins to sink
                     into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he rests in
                     pleasure for something new, which again engages his attention, and which also
                     he forsakes for other novelties.</p>
                  <p>We had scarcely visited the various lakes of <placeName type="tgn"
                        key="7011987">Cumberland</placeName> and <placeName type="tgn" key="5000223"
                        >Westmoreland</placeName>., and conceived an affection for some of the
                     inhabitants, when the period of our appointment with our
                        <foreign>Scotch</foreign> friend approached, and we left them to travel on.
                     For my own part I was not sorry. I had now neglected my promise for some time,
                     and I feared the effects of the dæmon's disappointment. He might remain in
                        <placeName type="tgn" key="7011731">Switzerland</placeName>, and wreak his
                     vengeance on my relatives. This idea pursued me, and tormented me at every
                     moment from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace. I waited
                     for my letters with feverish <pb n="[3.32 - page begins after 'im-']"
                        facs="images/3.32.jpg"/> impatience: if they were delayed, I was miserable,
                     and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived, and I saw the
                     superscription of <persName>Elizabeth</persName> or my father, I hardly dared
                     to read and ascertain my fate. Sometimes I thought that the fiend followed me,
                     and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion. When these thoughts
                     possessed me, I would not quit <persName>Henry</persName> for a moment, but
                     followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of his
                     destroyer. I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the consciousness of
                     which haunted me. I was guiltless, but I had indeed drawn down a horrible curse
                     upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.</p>
                  <p>I visited <placeName type="tgn" key="7009546">Edinburgh</placeName> with
                     languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might have interested the most
                     unfortunate being. <persName>Clerval</persName> did not like it so well <pb
                        n="[3.33]" facs="images/3.33.jpg"/> as <placeName type="tgn" key="7011931"
                        >Oxford</placeName>; for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing
                     to him. But the beauty and regularity of the new town of <placeName type="tgn"
                        key="7009546">Edinburgh</placeName>, its romantic castle, and its environs,
                     the most delightful in the world, <placeName type="tgn" key="7465617">Arthur's
                        Seat</placeName>, St. Bernard's Well, and the <placeName type="tgn"
                        key="1110561">Pentland Hills</placeName>, compensated him for the change,
                     and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. But I was impatient to arrive
                     at the termination of my journey.</p>
                  <p>We left <placeName type="tgn" key="7009546">Edinburgh</placeName> in a week,
                     passing through <placeName type="tgn" key="1050546">Coupar</placeName>,
                        <placeName type="tgn" key="7009562">St. Andrew's</placeName>, and along the
                     banks of the <placeName type="tgn" key="1130681">Tay</placeName>, to <placeName
                        type="tgn" key="7009702">Perth</placeName>, where our friend expected us.
                     But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers, or enter into their
                     feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and accordingly I
                     told <persName>Clerval</persName> that I wished to make the tour of <placeName
                        type="tgn" key="7002444">Scotland</placeName> alone. <said>"Do <pb
                           n="[3.34]" facs="images/3.34.jpg"/> you,"</said> said I, <said>"enjoy
                        yourself, and let this be our rendezvous. I may be absent a month or two;
                        but do not interfere with my motions, I entreat you: leave me to peace and
                        solitude for a short time; and when I return, I hope it will be with a
                        lighter heart, more congenial to your own temper."</said></p>
                  <p><persName>Henry</persName> wished to dissuade me; but, seeing me bent on this
                     plan, ceased to remonstrate. He entreated me to write often. <said>"I had
                        rather be with you,"</said> he said, <said>"in your solitary rambles, than
                        with these <foreign>Scotch</foreign> people, whom I do not know: hasten
                        then, my dear friend, to return, that I may again feel myself somewhat at
                        home, which I cannot do in your absence."</said></p>
                  <p>Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of
                        <placeName type="tgn" key="7002444">Scotland</placeName>, and finish my work
                     in solitude. I did not doubt but that the <pb n="[3.35]" facs="images/3.35.jpg"
                     /> monster followed me, and would discover himself to me when I should have
                     finished, that he might receive his companion.</p>
                  <p>With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands, and fixed on one of
                     the remotest of the <placeName type="tgn" key="7459637">Orkneys</placeName> as
                     the scene of my labours. It was a place fitted for such a work, being hardly
                     more than a rock, whose high sides were continually beaten upon by the waves.
                     The soil was barren, scarcely affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and
                     oatmeal for its inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and
                     scraggy limbs gave tokens of their miserable fare. Vegetables and bread, when
                     they indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from
                     the main land, which was about five miles distant.</p>
                  <p>On the whole island there were but <pb n="[3.36]" facs="images/3.36.jpg"/>
                     three miserable huts, and one of these was vacant when I arrived. This I hired.
                     It contained but two rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most
                     miserable penury. The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the
                     door was off its hinges. I ordered it to be repaired, bought some furniture,
                     and took possession; an incident which would, doubtless, have occasioned some
                     surprise, had not all the senses of the cottagers been benumbed by want and
                     squalid poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed at and unmolested, hardly thanked
                     for the pittance of food and clothes which I gave; so much does suffering blunt
                     even the coarsest sensations of men.</p>
                  <p>In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening, when the
                     weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea, to listen to the <pb
                        n="[3.37]" facs="images/3.37.jpg"/> waves as they roared, and dashed at my
                     feet. It was a monotonous, yet ever-changing scene. I thought of <placeName
                        type="tgn" key="7011731">Switzerland</placeName>; it was far different from
                     this desolate and appalling landscape. Its hills are covered with vines, and
                     its cottages are scattered thickly in the plains. Its fair lakes reflect a blue
                     and gentle sky; and, when troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the
                     play of a lively infant, when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean.</p>
                  <p>In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived; but, as I
                     proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and irksome to me.
                     Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for several
                     days; and at other times I toiled day and night in order to complete my work.
                     It was indeed a filthy process in which I was engaged. During <pb n="[3.38]"
                        facs="images/3.38.jpg"/> my first experiment, a kind of enthusiastic frenzy
                     had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my mind was intently fixed on
                     the sequel of my labour, and my eyes were shut to the horror of my proceedings.
                     But now I went to it in cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of
                     my hands.</p>
                  <p>Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in a
                     solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from the actual
                     scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I grew restless and
                     nervous. Every moment I feared to meet my persecutor. Sometimes I sat with my
                     eyes fixed on the ground, fearing to raise them lest they should encounter the
                     object which I so much dreaded to behold. I feared to wander from the sight of
                     my fellow-creatures, <pb n="[3.39]" facs="images/3.39.jpg"/> lest when alone he
                     should come to claim his companion.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably advanced.
                     I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager hope, which I dared
                     not trust myself to question, but which was intermixed with obscure forebodings
                     of evil, that made my heart sicken in my bosom.</p>"</said>

               <head>Chapter III</head>
               <said>" <p>I SAT one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just
                     rising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and I
                     remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my labour
                     for the night, or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention to it. As I
                     sat, a train of reflection occurred to me, which led me to consider the effects
                     of what I was now doing. Three years before I was engaged in the same manner,
                     and had created a fiend whose unparalleled barbarity had desolated my <pb
                        n="[3.41]" facs="images/3.41.jpg"/> heart, and filled it for ever with the
                     bitterest remorse. I was now about to form another being, of whose dispositions
                     I was alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than
                     her mate, and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness. He had
                     sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man, and hide himself in deserts; but she
                     had not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and reasoning
                     animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her creation. They
                     might even hate each other; the creature who already lived loathed his own
                     deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it came
                     before his eyes in the female form? She also might turn with disgust from him
                     to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him, and he be again alone,
                     exasperated by the fresh <pb n="[3.42]" facs="images/3.42.jpg"/> provocation of
                     being deserted by one of his own species. Even if they were to leave <placeName
                        type="tgn" key="1000003">Europe</placeName>, and inhabit the deserts of the
                     new world, yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the dæmon
                     thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon the
                     earth, who might make the very existence of the species of man a condition
                     precarious and full of terror. Had I right, for my own benefit, to inflict this
                     curse upon everlasting generations? I had before been moved by the sophisms of
                     the being I had created; I had been struck senseless by his fiendish threats:
                     but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my promise burst upon me; I
                     shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as their pest, whose
                     selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at <pb n="[3.43]"
                        facs="images/3.43.jpg"/> the price perhaps of the existence of the whole
                     human race.</p>
                  <p>I trembled, and my heart failed within me; when, on looking up, I saw, by the
                     light of the moon, the dæmon at the casement. A ghastly grin wrinkled his lips
                     as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task which he had allotted to me.
                     Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he had loitered in forests, hid himself
                     in caves, or taken refuge in wide and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my
                     progress, and claim the fulfillment of my promise.</p>
                  <p>As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of malice and
                     treachery. I thought with a sensation of madness on my promise of creating
                     another like him, and, trembling with passion, tore to pieces the thing on
                     which I was engaged. The wretch saw me destroy the creature on <pb n="[3.44]"
                        facs="images/3.44.jpg"/> whose future existence he depended for happiness,
                     and, with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.</p>
                  <p>I left the room, and, locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own heart never
                     to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I sought my own
                     apartment. I was alone; none were near me to dissipate the gloom, and relieve
                     me from the sickening oppression of the most terrible reveries.</p>
                  <p>Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea; it was
                     almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature reposed under the
                     eye of the quiet moon. A few fishing vessels alone specked the water, and now
                     and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound of voices, as the fishermen called
                     to one another. I felt the silence, although I was hardly conscious of its
                     extreme profundity, <pb n="[3.45]" facs="images/3.45.jpg"/> until my ear was
                     suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a person landed
                     close to my house.</p>
                  <p>In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one
                     endeavoured to open it softly. I trembled from head to foot; I felt a
                     presentiment of who it was, and wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt
                     in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation of
                     helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain endeavour to
                     fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot.</p>
                  <p>Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door opened,
                     and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared. Shutting the door, he approached me,
                     and said, in a smothered voice—</p>
                  <p><said>"You have destroyed the work <pb n="[3.46]" facs="images/3.46.jpg"/>
                        which you began; what is it that you intend? Do you dare to break your
                        promise? I have endured toil and misery: I left <placeName type="tgn"
                           key="7011731">Switzerland</placeName> with you; I crept along the shores
                        of the <placeName type="tgn" key="7012611">Rhine</placeName>, among its
                        willow islands, and over the summits of its hills. I have dwelt many months
                        in the heaths of <placeName type="tgn" key="7002445">England</placeName>,
                        and among the deserts of <placeName type="tgn" key="7002444"
                           >Scotland</placeName>. I have endured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and
                        hunger; do you dare destroy my hopes?"</said></p>
                  <p><said>"Begone! I do break my promise; never will I create another like
                        yourself, equal in deformity and wickedness."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself unworthy
                        of my condescension. Remember that I have power; you believe yourself
                        miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of day will be <pb
                           n="[3.47]" facs="images/3.47.jpg"/> hateful to you. You are my creator,
                        but I am your master;—obey!"</said></p>
                  <p><said>"The hour of my weakness is past, and the period of your power is
                        arrived. Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but they
                        confirm me in a resolution of not creating you a companion in vice. Shall I,
                        in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a dæmon, whose delight is in death
                        and wretchedness. Begone! I am firm, and your words will only exasperate my
                        rage."</said></p>
                  <p>The monster saw my determination in my face, and gnashed his teeth in the
                     impotence of anger. <said>"Shall each man,"</said> cried he, <said>"find a wife
                        for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone? I had feelings
                        of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn. Man, you may
                        hate; but beware! Your hours will pass in dread and <pb n="[3.48]"
                           facs="images/3.48.jpg"/> misery, and soon the bolt will fall which must
                        ravish from you your happiness for ever. Are you to be happy, while I grovel
                        in the intensity of my wretchedness? You can blast my other passions; but
                        revenge remains—revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food! I may die;
                        but first you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on
                        your misery. Beware; for I am fearless, and therefore powerful. I will watch
                        with the wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom. Man, you
                        shall repent of the injuries you inflict."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice. I
                        have declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend beneath
                        words. Leave me; I am inexorable."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"It is well. I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your
                        wedding-night."</said></p>
                  <pb n="[3.49]" facs="images/3.49.jpg"/>
                  <p>I started forward, and exclaimed, <said>"Villain! before you sign my
                        death-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe."</said></p>
                  <p>I would have seized him; but he eluded me, and quitted the house with
                     precipitation: in a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot across the
                     waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the waves.</p>
                  <p>All was again silent; but his words rung in my ears. I burned with rage to
                     pursue the murderer of my peace, and precipitate him into the ocean. I walked
                     up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination conjured up a
                     thousand images to torment and sting me. Why had I not followed him, and closed
                     with him in mortal strife? But I had suffered him to depart, and he had
                     directed his course towards the main land. I <pb
                        n="[3.50 - page breaks after 'shud-']" facs="images/3.50.jpg"/> shuddered to
                     think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge. And
                     then I thought again of his words—<said>"I will be with you on your
                        wedding-night."</said> That then was the period fixed for the fulfillment of
                     my destiny. In that hour I should die, and at once satisfy and extinguish his
                     malice. The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I thought of my beloved
                        <persName>Elizabeth</persName>,—of her tears and endless sorrow, when she
                     should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her,—tears, the first I had
                     shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall before
                     my enemy without a bitter struggle.</p>
                  <p>The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became
                     calmer, if it may be called calmness, when the violence of rage sinks into the
                     depths of despair. I left the <pb n="[3.51]" facs="images/3.51.jpg"/> house,
                     the horrid scene of the last night's contention, and walked on the beach of the
                     sea, which I almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my
                     fellow-creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me.
                     I desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily it is true,
                     but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. If I returned, it was to be
                     sacrificed, or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a dæmon
                     whom I had myself created.</p>
                  <p>I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it loved,
                     and miserable in the separation. When it became noon, and the sun rose higher,
                     I lay down on the grass, and was overpowered by a deep sleep. I had been awake
                     the whole of the preceding night, my nerves were agitated, <pb n="[3.52]"
                        facs="images/3.52.jpg"/> and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery. The
                     sleep into which I now sunk refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as if
                     I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to reflect upon
                     what had passed with greater composure; yet still the words of the fiend rung
                     in my ears like a death-knell, they appeared like a dream, yet distinct and
                     oppressive as a reality.</p>
                  <p>The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my
                     appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a
                     fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet; it
                     contained letters from <placeName type="tgn" key="7003746">Geneva</placeName> ,
                     and one from <persName>Clerval</persName>, entreating me to join him. He said
                     that nearly a year had elapsed since we had quitted <placeName type="tgn"
                        key="7011731">Switzerland</placeName>, and <placeName type="tgn"
                        key="1000070">France</placeName> was yet unvisited. He <pb
                        n="[3.53 - page breaks after 'en-']" facs="images/3.53.jpg"/> entreated me,
                     therefore, to leave my solitary isle, and meet him at <placeName type="tgn"
                        key="7009702">Perth</placeName>, in a week from that time, when we might
                     arrange the plan of our future proceedings. This letter in a degree recalled me
                     to life, and I determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.</p>
                  <p>Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered to
                     reflect: I must pack my chemical instruments; and for that purpose I must enter
                     the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must handle those
                     utensils, the sight of which was sickening to me. The next morning, at
                     day-break, I summoned sufficient courage, and unlocked the door of my
                     laboratory. The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had destroyed,
                     lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had <pb
                        n="[3.54 - page breaks after 'man-']" facs="images/3.54.jpg"/> mangled the
                     living flesh of a human being. I paused to collect myself, and then entered the
                     chamber. With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments out of the room; but I
                     reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my work to excite the horror
                     and suspicion of the peasants, and I accordingly put them into a basket, with a
                     great quantity of stones, and laying them up, determined to throw them into the
                     sea that very night; and in the mean time I sat upon the beach, employed in
                     cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus.</p>
                  <p>Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place in my
                     feelings since the night of the appearance of the dæmon. I had before regarded
                     my promise with a gloomy despair, as a thing that, with whatever consequences,
                     must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film had <pb n="[3.55]"
                        facs="images/3.55.jpg"/> been taken from before my eyes, and that I, for the
                     first time, saw clearly. The idea of renewing my labours did not for one
                     instant occur to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did
                     not reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it. I had resolved in my
                     own mind, that to create another like the fiend I had first made would be an
                     act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness; and I banished from my mind
                     every thought that could lead to a different conclusion.</p>
                  <p>Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my
                     basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore. The
                     scene was perfectly solitary: a few boats were returning towards land, but I
                     sailed away from them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a dreadful
                     crime, and avoided with shuddering <pb n="[3.56]" facs="images/3.56.jpg"/>
                     anxiety any encounter with my fellow-creatures. At one time the moon, which had
                     before been clear, was suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took
                     advantage of the moment of darkness, and cast my basket into the sea; I
                     listened to the gurgling sound as it sunk, and then sailed away from the spot.
                     The sky became clouded; but the air was pure, although chilled by the
                     north-east breeze that was then rising. But it refreshed me, and filled me with
                     such agreeable sensations, that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and
                     fixing the rudder in a direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the
                     boat. Clouds hid the moon, every thing was obscure, and I heard only the sound
                     of the boat, as its keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a
                     short time I slept soundly.</p>
                  <pb n="[3.57]" facs="images/3.57.jpg"/>
                  <p>I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I found
                     that the sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was high, and the waves
                     continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I found that the wind was
                     north-east, and must have driven me far from the coast from which I had
                     embarked. I endeavoured to change my course, but quickly found that if I again
                     made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with water. Thus situated,
                     my only resource was to drive before the wind. I confess that I felt a few
                     sensations of terror. I had no compass with me, and was so little acquainted
                     with the geography of this part of the world that the sun was of little benefit
                     to me. I might be driven into the wide <placeName type="tgn" key="7014206"
                        >Atlantic</placeName>, and feel all the tortures of starvation, or be
                     swallowed up in the immeasurable <pb n="[3.58]" facs="images/3.58.jpg"/> waters
                     that roared and buffeted around me. I had already been out many hours, and felt
                     the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to my other sufferings. I looked on
                     the heavens, which were covered by clouds that flew before the wind only to be
                     replaced by others: I looked upon the sea, it was to be my grave.
                        <said>"Fiend,"</said> I exclaimed, <said>"your task is already
                        fulfilled!"</said> I thought of <persName>Elizabeth</persName>, of my
                     father, and of <persName>Clerval</persName>; and sunk into a reverie, so
                     despairing and frightful, that even now, when the scene is on the point of
                     closing before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.</p>
                  <p>Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the
                     horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze, and the sea became free from
                     breakers. But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick, and hardly able
                     to hold the rudder, when suddenly <pb n="[3.59]" facs="images/3.59.jpg"/> I saw
                     a line of high land towards the south.</p>
                  <p>Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue, and the dreadful suspense I endured for
                     several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of warm joy to
                     my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.</p>
                  <p>How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have of
                     life even in the excess of misery! I constructed another sail with a part of my
                     dress, and eagerly steered my course towards the land. It had a wild and rocky
                     appearance; but, as I approached nearer, I easily perceived the traces of
                     cultivation. I saw vessels near the shore, and found myself suddenly
                     transported back to the neighbourhood of civilized man. I eagerly traced the
                     windings of the land, and hailed a steeple which I at length saw <pb n="[3.60]"
                        facs="images/3.60.jpg"/> issuing from behind a small promontory. As I was in
                     a state of extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town as a
                     place where I could most easily procure nourishment. Fortunately I had money
                     with me. As I turned the promontory, I perceived a small neat town and a good
                     harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected
                     escape.</p>
                  <p>As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several people
                     crowded towards the spot. They seemed very much surprised at my appearance;
                     but, instead of offering me any assistance, whispered together with gestures
                     that at any other time might have produced in me a slight sensation of alarm.
                     As it was, I merely remarked that they spoke English; and I therefore addressed
                     them in that language: <said>"My good friends,"</said> said I, <said>"will you
                        be so <pb n="[3.61]" facs="images/3.61.jpg"/> kind as to tell me the name of
                        this town, and inform me where I am?"</said></p>
                  <p><said>"You will know that soon enough,"</said> replied a man with a gruff
                     voice. <said>"May be you are come to a place that will not prove much to your
                        taste; but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise
                        you."</said></p>
                  <p>I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a stranger; and
                     I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry countenances of
                     his companions. <said>"Why do you answer me so roughly?"</said> I replied:
                        <said>"surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to receive strangers so
                        inhospitably."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"I do not know,"</said> said the man, <said>"what the custom of the
                           <foreign>English</foreign> may be; but it is the custom of the Irish to
                        hate villains."</said></p>
                  <p>While this strange dialogue <pb n="[3.62 - page breaks after 'conti-']"
                        facs="images/3.62.jpg"/> continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly increase.
                     Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which annoyed, and in
                     some degree alarmed me. I inquired the way to the inn; but no one replied. I
                     then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the crowd as they followed
                     and surrounded me; when an ill-looking man approaching, tapped me on the
                     shoulder, and said, <said>"Come, Sir, you must follow me to
                           <persName>Mr.Kirwin’s</persName>."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"Who is <persName>Mr. Kirwin</persName>? Why am I to give an account of
                        myself? Is not this a free country?"</said></p>
                  <p><said>"Ay, Sir, free enough for honest folks. <persName>Mr. Kirwin</persName>
                        is a magistrate; and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman
                        who was found murdered here last night."</said></p>
                  <p>This answer startled me; but I <pb n="[3.63 - page breaks after 'pre-']"
                        facs="images/3.63.jpg"/> presently recovered myself. I was innocent; that
                     could easily be proved: accordingly I followed my conductor in silence, and was
                     led to one of the best houses in the town. I was ready to sink from fatigue and
                     hunger; but, being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic to rouse all my
                     strength, that no physical debility might be construed into apprehension or
                     conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a few
                     moments to overwhelm me, and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of
                     ignominy or death.</p>
                  <p><said>"I must pause here; for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory
                        of the frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my
                        recollection."</said></p></said>

            <div n="3.4" type="chapter">
               <pb n="[3.64]" facs="images/3.64.jpg"/>
               <head>Chapter IV</head>

               <said>"<p>I WAS soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old
                     benevolent man, with calm and mild manners. He looked upon me, however, with
                     some degree of severity; and then, turning towards my conductors, he asked who
                     appeared as witnesses on this occasion.</p>
                  <p>About half a dozen men came forward; and one being selected by the magistrate,
                     he deposed, that he had been out fishing the night before with his son and
                     brother-in-law, <persName>Daniel Nugent </persName>, when, about ten o'clock,
                     they <pb n="[3.65 - page breaks after 'ob-']" facs="images/3.65.jpg"/> observed
                     a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in for port. It was a
                     very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did not land at the
                     harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about two miles below. He
                     walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle, and his companions
                     followed him at some distance. As he was proceeding along the sands, he struck
                     his foot against something, and fell at his length on the ground. His
                     companions came up to assist him; and, by the light of their lantern, they
                     found that he had fallen on the body of a man, who was to all appearance dead.
                     Their first supposition was, that it was the corpse of some person who had been
                     drowned, and was thrown on shore by the waves; but, upon examination, they
                     found that the clothes were not wet, and even that <pb n="[3.66]"
                        facs="images/3.66.jpg"/> the body was not then cold. They instantly carried
                     it to the cottage of an old woman near the spot, and endeavoured, but in vain,
                     to restore it to life. He appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and
                     twenty years of age. He had apparently been strangled; for there was no sign of
                     any violence, except the black mark of fingers on his neck.</p>
                  <p>The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me; but when
                     the mark of the fingers was mentioned, I remembered the murder of my brother,
                     and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a mist came over my
                     eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for support. The magistrate observed
                     me with a keen eye, and of course drew an unfavourable augury from my
                     manner.</p>
                  <p>The son confirmed his father's <pb n="[3.67 - page breaks after 'ac-']"
                        facs="images/3.67.jpg"/> account: but when <persName> Daniel
                        Nugent</persName> was called, he swore positively that, just before the fall
                     of his companion, he saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance
                     from the shore; and, as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it
                     was the same boat in which I had just landed.</p>
                  <p>A woman deposed, that she lived near the beach, and was standing at the door of
                     her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour before she
                     heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat, with only one man in
                     it, push off from that part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards
                     found.</p>
                  <p>Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the body
                     into her house; it was not cold. They put it into a bed, and rubbed it; and
                        <persName>Daniel</persName> went to the <pb n="[3.68]"
                        facs="images/3.68.jpg"/> town for an apothecary, but life was quite
                     gone.</p>
                  <p>Several other men were examined concerning my landing; and they agreed, that,
                     with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it was very
                     probable that I had beaten about for many hours, and had been obliged to return
                     nearly to the same spot from which I had departed. Besides, they observed that
                     it appeared that I had brought the body from another place, and it was likely,
                     that as I did not appear to know the shore, I might have put into the harbour
                     ignorant of the distance of the town of ---- from the place where I had
                     deposited the corpse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <persName>Mr. Kirwin</persName>, on hearing this evidence, desired that I
                     should be taken into the room where the body lay for interment, that it might
                     be observed <pb n="[3.69]" facs="images/3.69.jpg"/> what effect the sight of it
                     would produce upon me. This idea was probably suggested by the extreme
                     agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the murder had been described. I was
                     accordingly conducted, by the magistrate and several other persons, to the inn.
                     I could not help being struck by the strange coincidences that had taken place
                     during this eventful night; but, knowing that I had been conversing with
                     several persons in the island I had inhabited about the time that the body had
                     been found, I was perfectly tranquil as to the consequences of the affair.</p>
                  <p>I entered the room where the corpse lay, and was led up to the coffin. How can
                     I describe my sensations on beholding it? I feel yet parched with horror, nor
                     can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and agony, <pb
                        n="[3.70]" facs="images/3.70.jpg"/> that faintly reminds me of the anguish
                     of recognition. The trial, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses, passed
                     like a dream from my memory, when I saw the lifeless form of <persName>Henry
                        Clerval</persName> stretched before me. I gasped for breath; and, throwing
                     myself on the body, I exclaimed, <said>"Have my murderous machinations deprived
                        you also, my dearest <persName>Henry</persName>, of life? Two I have already
                        destroyed; other victims await their destiny: but you,
                           <persName>Clerval</persName>, my friend, my benefactor—"</said></p>
                  <p>The human frame could no longer support the agonizing suffering that I endured,
                     and I was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.</p>
                  <p>A fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death: my
                     ravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the murderer
                        <pb n="[3.71]" facs="images/3.71.jpg"/> of <persName>William</persName>, of
                        <persName>Justine</persName>, and of <persName>Clerval</persName>. Sometimes
                     I entreated my attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom
                     I was tormented; and, at others, I felt the fingers of the monster already
                     grasping my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror. Fortunately, as I
                     spoke my native language, <persName>Mr. Kirwin</persName> alone understood me;
                     but my gestures and bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other
                     witnesses.</p>
                  <p>Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not sink
                     into forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming children, the
                     only hopes of their doating parents: how many brides and youthful lovers have
                     been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the next a prey for worms and
                     the decay of the tomb! Of what materials was <pb n="[3.72]"
                        facs="images/3.72.jpg"/> I made, that I could thus resist so many shocks,
                     which, like the turning of the wheel, continually renewed the torture.</p>
                  <p>But I was doomed to live; and, in two months, found myself as awaking from a
                     dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by gaolers,
                     turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon. It was morning,
                     I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding: I had forgotten the particulars
                     of what had happened, and only felt as if some great misfortune had suddenly
                     overwhelmed me; but when I looked around, and saw the barred windows, and the
                     squalidness of the room in which I was, all flashed across my memory, and I
                     groaned bitterly.</p>
                  <p>This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside me. <pb
                        n="[3.73]" facs="images/3.73.jpg"/> She was a hired nurse, the wife of one
                     of the turnkeys, and her countenance expressed all those bad qualities which
                     often characterise that class. The lines of her face were hard and rude, like
                     that of persons accustomed to see without sympathizing in sights of misery. Her
                     tone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in
                        <foreign>English</foreign>, and the voice struck me as one that I had heard
                     during my sufferings:</p>
                  <p><said>"Are you better now, Sir?"</said> said she.</p>
                  <p>I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, <said>"I believe I am; but
                        if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am still
                        alive to feel this misery and horror."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"For that matter,"</said> replied the old woman, <said>"if you mean about
                        the gentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you
                        were dead, <pb n="[3.74]" facs="images/3.74.jpg"/> for I fancy it will go
                        hard with you; but you will be hung when the next sessions come on. However,
                        that's none of my business, I am sent to nurse you, and get you well; I do
                        my duty with a safe conscience, it were well if every body did the
                        same."</said></p>
                  <p>I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a speech to
                     a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt languid, and unable
                     to reflect on all that had passed. The whole series of my life appeared to me
                     as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it were all true, for it never
                     presented itself to my mind with the force of reality.</p>
                  <p>As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew feverish; a
                     darkness pressed around me: no one was near me who soothed me with the gentle
                     voice of love; no dear hand supported me.<pb n="[3.75]" facs="images/3.75.jpg"
                     /> The physician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared them
                     for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the expression of
                     brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the second. Who could be
                     interested in the fate of a murderer, but the hangman who would gain his
                     fee?</p>
                  <p>These were my first reflections; but I soon learned that <persName>Mr.
                        Kirwin</persName> had shewn me extreme kindness. He had caused the best room
                     in the prison to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was
                     he who had provided a physician and a nurse. It is true, he seldom came to see
                     me; for, although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of every human
                     creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and miserable ravings of
                     a murderer. He came, therefore, <pb n="[3.76 - page breaks after 'some-']"
                        facs="images/3.76.jpg"/> sometimes to see that I was not neglected; but his
                     visits were short, and at long intervals.</p>
                  <p>One day, when I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes half
                     open, and my cheeks livid like those in death, I was overcome by gloom and
                     misery, and often reflected I had better seek death than remain miserably pent
                     up only to be let loose in a world replete with wretchedness. At one time I
                     considered whether I should not declare myself guilty, and suffer the penalty
                     of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been. Such were my thoughts,
                     when the door of my apartment was opened, and <persName>Mr. Kirwin</persName>
                     entered. His countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair
                     close to mine, and addressed me in <foreign>French</foreign>—</p>
                  <p><said>"I fear that this place is very <pb
                           n="[3.77 - page breaks after 'shock-']" facs="images/3.77.jpg"/> shocking
                        to you; can I do any thing to make you more comfortable?"</said></p>
                  <p><said>"I thank you; but all that you mention is nothing to me: on the whole
                        earth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to
                        one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune. But you will, I hope,
                        soon quit this melancholy abode; for, doubtless, evidence can easily be
                        brought to free you from the criminal charge."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"That is my least concern: I am, by a course of strange events, become
                        the most miserable of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am and have
                        been, can death be any evil to me?"</said></p>
                  <p><said>"Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonizing than the strange
                        chances that have lately <pb n="[3.78 - page breaks after 'occur-']"
                           facs="images/3.78.jpg"/> occurred. You were thrown, by some surprising
                        accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality: seized immediately,
                        and charged with murder. The first sight that was presented to your eyes was
                        the body of your friend, murdered in so unaccountable a manner, and placed,
                        as it were, by some fiend across your path."</said></p>
                  <p>As <persName>Mr. Kirwin</persName> said this, notwithstanding the agitation I
                     endured on this retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise
                     at the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me. I suppose some
                     astonishment was exhibited in my countenance; for <persName>Mr.
                        Kirwin</persName> hastened to say—</p>
                  <p><said>"It was not until a day or two after your illness that I thought of
                        examining your dress, that I might discover some trace by which I could send
                        to your relations an account of your misfortune <pb n="[3.79]"
                           facs="images/3.79.jpg"/> and illness. I found several letters, and, among
                        others, one which I discovered from its commencement to be from your father.
                        I instantly wrote to <placeName type="tgn" key="7003746">Geneva</placeName>:
                        nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.—But you are
                        ill; even now you tremble: you are unfit for agitation of any
                     kind."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event:
                        tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am now to
                        lament."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"Your family is perfectly well,"</said> said <persName>Mr.
                        Kirwin</persName>, with gentleness; <said>"and some one, a friend, is come
                        to visit you."</said></p>
                  <p>I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it instantly
                     darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my misery, and taunt
                     me with the death of <persName>Clerval</persName>, as <pb n="[3.80]"
                        facs="images/3.80.jpg"/> a new incitement for me to comply with his hellish
                     desires. I put my hand before my eyes, and cried out in agony—</p>
                  <p><said>"Oh! take him away! I cannot see him; for God's sake, do not let him
                        enter!"</said></p>
                  <p>
                     <persName>Mr. Kirwin</persName> regarded me with a troubled countenance. He
                     could not help regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt, and said,
                     in rather a severe tone—</p>
                  <p><said>"I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father would
                        have been welcome, instead of inspiring such violent repugnance."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"My father!"</said> cried I, while every feature and every muscle was
                     relaxed from anguish to pleasure. <said>"Is my father, indeed, come? How kind,
                        how very kind. But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?"</said></p>
                  <p>My change of manner surprised and <pb n="[3.81]" facs="images/3.81.jpg"/>
                     pleased the magistrate; perhaps he thought that my former exclamation was a
                     momentary return of delirium, and now he instantly resumed his former
                     benevolence. He rose, and quitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my
                     father entered it.</p>
                  <p>Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the arrival
                     of my father. I stretched out my hand to him, and cried—</p>
                  <p><said>"Are you then safe—and <persName>Elizabeth</persName> —and
                           <persName>Ernest</persName>?"</said></p>
                  <p>My father calmed me with assurances of their welfare, and endeavoured, by
                     dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my desponding
                     spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of cheerfulness.
                        <said>"What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!"</said> said he,
                     looking mournfully at the barred windows, and wretched <pb n="[3.82]"
                        facs="images/3.82.jpg"/> appearance of the room. <said>"You travelled to
                        seek happiness, but a fatality seems to pursue you. And poor
                           <persName>Clerval</persName>—"</said></p>
                  <p>The name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too great to be
                     endured in my weak state; I shed tears.</p>
                  <p><said>"Alas! yes, my father,"</said> replied I; <said>"some destiny of the most
                        horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfill it, or surely I
                        should have died on the coffin of Henry."</said></p>
                  <p>We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the precarious
                     state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that could insure
                     tranquillity. <persName>Mr. Kirwin</persName> came in, and insisted that my
                     strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion. But the appearance of my
                     father was to me like that of my good angel, and I gradually recovered my
                     health.</p>
                  <pb n="[3.83]" facs="images/3.83.jpg"/>
                  <p>As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black melancholy,
                     that nothing could dissipate. The image of <persName>Clerval</persName> was for
                     ever before me, ghastly and murdered. More than once the agitation into which
                     these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous relapse. Alas! why
                     did they preserve so miserable and detested a life? It was surely that I might
                     fulfill my destiny, which is now drawing to a close. Soon, oh, very soon, will
                     death extinguish these throbbings, and relieve me from the mighty weight of
                     anguish that bears me to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I
                     shall also sink to rest. Then the appearance of death was distant, although the
                     wish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours motionless and
                     speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that might <pb n="[3.84]"
                        facs="images/3.84.jpg"/> bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.</p>
                  <p>The season of the assizes approached. I had already been three months in
                     prison; and although I was still weak, and in continual danger of a relapse, I
                     was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the county-town, where the
                     court was held. <persName>Mr. Kirwin</persName> charged himself with every care
                     of collecting witnesses, and arranging my defence. I was spared the disgrace of
                     appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not brought before the court
                     that decides on life and death. The grand jury rejected the bill, on its being
                     proved that I was on the <placeName type="tgn" key="7459637">Orkney
                        Islands</placeName> at the hour the body of my friend was found, and a
                     fortnight after my removal I was liberated from prison.</p>
                  <p>My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a <pb
                        n="[3.85 - page breaks after 'cri-']" facs="images/3.85.jpg"/> criminal
                     charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh atmosphere, and allowed
                     to return to my native country. I did not participate in these feelings; for to
                     me the walls of a dungeon or a palace were alike hateful. The cup of life was
                     poisoned for ever; and although the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and
                     gay of heart, I saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness,
                     penetrated by no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me.
                     Sometimes they were the expressive eyes of <persName>Henry</persName>,
                     languishing in death, the dark orbs nearly covered by the lids, and the long
                     black lashes that fringed them; sometimes it was the watery clouded eyes of the
                     monster, as I first saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt.</p>
                  <p>My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. He talked of <pb
                        n="[3.86]" facs="images/3.86.jpg"/>
                     <placeName type="tgn" key="7003746">Geneva</placeName>, which I should soon
                     visit—of <persName>Elizabeth</persName>, and <persName>Ernest</persName>; but
                     these words only drew deep groans from me. Sometimes, indeed, I felt a wish for
                     happiness; and thought, with melancholy delight, of my beloved cousin; or
                     longed, with a devouring maladie du pays, to see once more the blue lake and
                     rapid <placeName type="tgn" key="7023890">Rhone</placeName>, that had been so
                     dear to me in early childhood: but my general state of feeling was a torpor, in
                     which a prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and
                     these fits were seldom interrupted, but by paroxysms of anguish and despair. At
                     these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the existence I loathed; and
                     it required unceasing attendance and vigilance to restrain me from committing
                     some dreadful act of violence.</p>
                  <p>I remember, as I quitted the prison, <pb n="[3.87]" facs="images/3.87.jpg"/> I
                     heard one of the men say, <said>"He may be innocent of the murder, but he has
                        certainly a bad conscience."</said> These words struck me. A bad conscience!
                     yes, surely I had one. <persName>William</persName>,
                        <persName>Justine</persName>, and <persName>Clerval</persName>, had died
                     through my infernal machinations; <said>"And whose death,"</said> cried I,
                        <said>"is to finish the tragedy? Ah! my father, do not remain in this
                        wretched country; take me where I may forget myself, my existence, and all
                        the world."</said></p>
                  <p>My father easily acceded to my desire; and, after having taken leave of
                        <persName>Mr. Kirwin</persName>, we hastened to <placeName type="tgn"
                        key="7001306">Dublin</placeName>. I felt as if I was relieved from a heavy
                     weight, when the packet sailed with a fair wind from Ireland, and I had quitted
                     for ever the country which had been to me the scene of so much misery.</p>
                  <p>It was midnight. My father slept in <pb n="[3.88]" facs="images/3.88.jpg"/> the
                     cabin; and I lay on the deck, looking at the stars, and listening to the
                     dashing of the waves. I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my sight,
                     and my pulse beat with a feverish joy, when I reflected that I should soon see
                        <placeName type="tgn" key="7003746">Geneva</placeName>. The past appeared to
                     me in the light of a frightful dream; yet the vessel in which I was, the wind
                     that blew me from the detested shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded
                     me, told me too forcibly that I was deceived by no vision, and that
                        <persName>Clerval</persName>, my friend and dearest companion, had fallen a
                     victim to me and the monster of my creation. I repassed, in my memory, my whole
                     life; my quiet happiness while residing with my family in <placeName type="tgn"
                        key="7003746">Geneva</placeName>, the death of my mother, and my departure
                     for Ingolstadt. I remembered shuddering at the <rs content="#enthusiasm">mad
                        enthusiasm that hurried me on to the <pb
                           n="[3.89 - page breaks after 'crea-']" facs="images/3.89.jpg"/> creation
                        of my hideous enemy</rs>, and I called to mind the night during which he
                     first lived. I was unable to pursue the train of thought; a thousand feelings
                     pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.</p>
                  <p>Ever since my recovery from the fever I had been in the custom of taking every
                     night a small quantity of laudanum; for it was by means of this drug only that
                     I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of life.
                     Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now took a double
                     dose, and soon slept profoundly. But sleep did not afford me respite from
                     thought and misery; my dreams presented a thousand objects that scared me.
                     Towards morning I was possessed by a kind of night-mare; I felt the fiend's
                     grasp in my neck, and could not free myself from it; groans and cries rung in
                     my ears. My father, who was <pb n="[3.90]" facs="images/3.90.jpg"/> watching
                     over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me, and pointed to the port of
                     Holyhead, which we were now entering.to give an account of yourself.</p></said>

               <p><said>"WE had resolved not to go to <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781"
                        >London</placeName>, but to cross the country to <placeName type="tgn"
                        key="7011393">Portsmouth</placeName>, and thence to embark for <placeName
                        type="tgn" key="7008927" cert="medium">Havre</placeName>. I preferred this
                     plan principally because I dreaded to see again those places in which I had
                     enjoyed a few moments of tranquillity with my beloved
                        <persName>Clerval</persName>. I thought with horror of seeing again those
                     persons whom we had been accustomed to visit together, and who might make
                     inquiries concerning an event, the very remembrance of which made me again feel
                     the pang I endured <pb n="[3.92]" facs="images/3.92.jpg"/> when I gazed on his
                     lifeless form in the inn at ----.</said></p>
               <p>As for my father, his desires and exertions were bounded to the again seeing me
                  restored to health and peace of mind. His tenderness and attentions were
                  unremitting; my grief and gloom was obstinate, but he would not despair. Sometimes
                  he thought that I felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge
                  of murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.</p>
               <p><said>"Alas! my father,"</said> said I, <said>"how little do you know me. Human
                     beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such a wretch
                     as I felt pride. <persName>Justine</persName>, poor unhappy
                        <persName>Justine</persName>, was as innocent as I, and she suffered the
                     same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause of this—I murdered her.
                        <persName>William</persName>, <persName>Justine</persName>, <pb n="[3.93]"
                        facs="images/3.93.jpg"/> and <persName>Henry</persName>—they all died by my
                     hands."</said></p>
               <p>My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same assertion;
                  when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an explanation, and at
                  others he appeared to consider it as caused by delirium, and that, during my
                  illness, some idea of this kind had presented itself to my imagination, the
                  remembrance of which I preserved in my convalescence. I avoided explanation, and
                  maintained a continual silence concerning the wretch I had created. I had a
                  feeling that I should be supposed mad, and this for ever chained my tongue, when I
                  would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret. Yet still words like
                  those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably from me. I could offer no
                  explanation of them; but their truth in part relieved the burden of my mysterious
                  woe.</p>
               <p>Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder,
                     <said>"What do you mean, <persName>Victor</persName>? <pb n="[3.94]"
                        facs="images/3.94.jpg"/> are you mad? My dear son, I entreat you never to
                     make such an assertion again."</said></p>
               <p><said>"I am not mad,"</said> I cried energetically; <said>"the sun and the
                     heavens, who have viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth. I am the
                     assassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations. A
                     thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have saved
                     their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not sacrifice the whole
                     human race."</said></p>
               <p>The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were deranged, and
                  he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and endeavoured to alter the
                  course of my thoughts. He wished as much as possible to obliterate the memory of
                  the scenes that had taken place in <placeName type="tgn" key="1000078"
                     >Ireland</placeName>, <pb n="[3.95]" facs="images/3.95.jpg"/> and never alluded
                  to them, or suffered me to speak of my misfortunes.</p>
               <p>As time passed away I became more calm: misery had her dwelling in my heart, but I
                  no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own crimes; sufficient for me
                  was the consciousness of them. By the utmost self-violence, I curbed the imperious
                  voice of wretchedness, which sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole
                  world; and my manners were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since
                  my journey to the sea of ice.</p>
               <p>We arrived at <placeName type="tgn" key="7008927" cert="medium">Havre</placeName>
                  on the <date>8th of May</date>, and instantly proceeded to <placeName type="tgn"

                  detained us a few weeks. In this city, I received the following letter from

                     <opener>To <persName>VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN.</persName>
                        <salute><said>"MY DEAREST FRIEND,"</said></salute></opener>
                     <p>It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle dated at
                           <placeName type="tgn" key="7008038">Paris</placeName>; you are no longer
                        at a formidable distance, and I may hope to see you in less than a
                        fortnight. My poor cousin, how much you must have suffered! I expect to see
                        you looking even more ill than when you quitted <placeName type="tgn"
                           key="7003746">Geneva</placeName>. This winter has been passed most
                        miserably, tortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see
                        peace in your countenance, and to find that your heart is not totally devoid
                        of comfort and tranquillity.</p>
                     <p>Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable a
                        year ago, even perhaps augmented by <pb n="[3.97]" facs="images/3.97.jpg"/>
                        time. I would not disturb you at this period when so many misfortunes weigh
                        upon you; but a conversation that I had with my uncle previous to his
                        departure renders some explanation necessary before we meet.</p>
                     <p>Explanation! you may possibly say; what can <persName>Elizabeth</persName>
                        have to explain? If you really say this, my questions are answered, and I
                        have no more to do than to sign myself your affectionate cousin. But you are
                        distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread, and yet be pleased
                        with this explanation; and, in a probability of this being the case, I dare
                        not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I have often
                        wished to express to you, but have never had the courage to begin.</p>
                     <p>You well know, <persName>Victor</persName>, that our union had been the
                        favourite plan of <pb n="[3.98]" facs="images/3.98.jpg"/> your parents ever
                        since our infancy. We were told this when young, and taught to look forward
                        to it as an event that would certainly take place. We were affectionate
                        playfellows during childhood, and, I believe, dear and valued friends to one
                        another as we grew older. But as brother and sister often entertain a lively
                        affection towards each other, without desiring a more intimate union, may
                        not such also be our case? Tell me, dearest <persName>Victor</persName>.
                        Answer me, I conjure you, by our mutual happiness, with simple truth—Do you
                        not love another?</p>
                     <p>You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at <placeName
                           type="tgn" key="7017035">Ingolstadt</placeName>; and I confess to you, my
                        friend, that when I saw you last autumn so unhappy, flying to solitude, from
                        the society of every creature, I could not help supposing that you <pb
                           n="[3.99]" facs="images/3.99.jpg"/> might regret our connection, and
                        believe yourself bound in honour to fulfill the wishes of your parents,
                        although they opposed themselves to your inclinations. But this is false
                        reasoning. I confess to you, my cousin, that I love you, and that in my airy
                        dreams of futurity you have been my constant friend and companion. But it is
                        your happiness I desire as well as my own, when I declare to you, that our
                        marriage would render me eternally miserable, unless it were the dictate of
                        your own free choice. Even now I weep to think, that, borne down as you are
                        by the cruellest misfortunes, you may stifle, by the word honour, all hope
                        of that love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself. I, who
                        have so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries
                        ten-fold by being an obstacle to your wishes. Ah, <pb
                           n="[3.100 - page breaks after 'Vic-']" facs="images/3.100.jpg"/>
                        <persName>Victor</persName>, be assured that your cousin and playmate has
                        too sincere a love for you not to be made miserable by this supposition. Be
                        happy, my friend; and if you obey me in this one request, remain satisfied
                        that nothing on earth will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity.</p>
                     <p>Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer to-morrow, or the next
                        day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain. My uncle will send me
                        news of your health; and if I see but one smile on your lips when we meet,
                        occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, I shall need no other
                        happiness.</p>

               <p>This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat <pb
                     n="[3.101]" facs="images/3.101.jpg"/> of the fiend—<said>"I will be with you on
                     your wedding-night!"</said> Such was my sentence, and on that night would the
                  dæmon employ every art to destroy me, and tear me from the glimpse of happiness
                  which promised partly to console my sufferings. On that night he had determined to
                  consummate his crimes by my death. Well, be it so; a deadly struggle would then
                  assuredly take place, in which if he was victorious, I should be at peace, and his
                  power over me be at an end. If he were vanquished, I should be a free man. Alas!
                  what freedom? such as the peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred
                  before his eyes, his cottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift,
                  homeless, pennyless, and alone, but free. Such would be my liberty, except that in
                  my <persName>Elizabeth</persName> I possessed a treasure; alas! balanced <pb
                     n="[3.102]" facs="images/3.102.jpg"/> by those horrors of remorse and guilt,
                  which would pursue me until death.</p>
               <p>Sweet and beloved <persName>Elizabeth</persName>! I read and re-read her letter,
                  and some softened feelings stole into my heart, and dared to whisper paradisaical
                  dreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the angel's arm bared
                  to drive me from all hope. Yet I would die to make her happy. If the monster
                  executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet, again, I considered whether my
                  marriage would hasten my fate. My destruction might indeed arrive a few months
                  sooner; but if my torturer should suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his
                  menaces, he would surely find other, and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge.
                  He had vowed to be with me on my wedding-night, yet he did not consider that
                  threat as binding him to peace in <pb n="[3.103]" facs="images/3.103.jpg"/> the
                  mean time; for, as if to shew me that he was not yet satiated with blood, he had
                  murdered <persName>Clerval</persName> immediately after the enunciation of his
                  threats. I resolved, therefore, that if my immediate union with my cousin would
                  conduce either to her's or my father's happiness, my adversary's designs against
                  my life should not retard it a single hour.</p>
               <p>In this state of mind I wrote to <persName>Elizabeth</persName>. My letter was
                  calm and affectionate. <said>"I fear, my beloved girl,"</said> I said,
                     <said>"little happiness remains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day
                     enjoy is concentered in you. Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I
                     consecrate my life, and my endeavours for contentment. I have one secret,
                        <persName>Elizabeth</persName>, a dreadful one; when revealed to you, it
                     will chill your frame with horror, and then, far from being <pb n="[3.104]"
                        facs="images/3.104.jpg"/> surprised at my misery, you will only wonder that
                     I survive what I have endured. I will confide this tale of misery and terror to
                     you the day after our marriage shall take place; for, my sweet cousin, there
                     must be perfect confidence between us. But until then, I conjure you, do not
                     mention or allude to it. This I most earnestly entreat, and I know you will
                     comply."</said></p>
               <p>In about a week after the arrival of <persName>Elizabeth</persName>'s letter, we
                  returned to <placeName type="tgn" key="7003746">Geneva</placeName>. My cousin
                  welcomed me with warm affection; yet tears were in her eyes, as she beheld my
                  emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. I saw a change in her also. She was thinner,
                  and had lost much of that heavenly vivacity that had before charmed me; but her
                  gentleness, and soft looks of compassion, made her a more fit companion for one
                  blasted and miserable as I was.</p>
               <pb n="[3.105]" facs="images/3.105.jpg"/>
               <p>The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure. Memory brought madness with
                  it; and when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity possessed me; sometimes
                  I was furious, and burnt with rage; sometimes low and despondent. I neither spoke
                  or looked, but sat motionless, bewildered by the multitude of miseries that
                  overcame me.</p>
               <p><persName>Elizabeth</persName> alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her
                  gentle voice would soothe me when transported by passion, and inspire me with
                  human feelings when sunk in torpor. She wept with me, and for me. When reason
                  returned, she would remonstrate, and endeavour to inspire me with resignation. Ah!
                  it is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the guilty there is no
                  peace. The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is <pb n="[3.106]"
                     facs="images/3.106.jpg"/> otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of
                  grief.</p>
               <p>Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with my cousin. I
                  remained silent.</p>
               <p><said>"Have you, then, some other attachment?"</said></p>
               <p><said>"None on earth. I love <persName>Elizabeth</persName>, and look forward to
                     our union with delight. Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will
                     consecrate myself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin."</said></p>
               <p><said>"My dear <persName>Victor</persName>, do not speak thus. Heavy misfortunes
                     have befallen us; but let us only cling closer to what remains, and transfer
                     our love for those whom we have lost to those who yet live. Our circle will be
                     small, but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune. And when
                     time shall have softened your despair, new <pb n="[3.107]"
                        facs="images/3.107.jpg"/> and dear objects of care will be born to replace
                     those of whom we have been so cruelly deprived."</said></p>
               <p>Such were the lessons of my father. But to me the remembrance of the threat
                  returned: nor can you wonder, that, omnipotent as the fiend had yet been in his
                  deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as invincible; and that when he had
                  pronounced the words, <said>"I shall be with you on your wedding-night,"</said> I
                  should regard the threatened fate as unavoidable. But death was no evil to me, if
                  the loss of <persName>Elizabeth</persName> were balanced with it; and I therefore,
                  with a contented and even cheerful countenance, agreed with my father, that if my
                  cousin would consent, the ceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as
                  I imagined, the seal to my fate.</p>
               <p>Great God! if for one instant I <pb n="[3.108]" facs="images/3.108.jpg"/> had
                  thought what might be the hellish intention of my fiendish adversary, I would
                  rather have banished myself for ever from my native country, and wandered a
                  friendless outcast over the earth, than have consented to this miserable marriage.
                  But, as if possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real
                  intentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I hastened
                  that of a far dearer victim.</p>
               <p>As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or a
                  prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me. But I concealed my feelings by
                  an appearance of hilarity, that brought smiles and joy to the countenance of my
                  father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer eye of
                     <persName>Elizabeth</persName>. She looked forward to our union with placid
                  contentment, not <pb n="[3.109]" facs="images/3.109.jpg"/> unmingled with a little
                  fear, which past misfortunes had impressed, that what now appeared certain and
                  tangible happiness, might soon dissipate into an airy dream, and leave no trace
                  but deep and everlasting regret.</p>
               <p>Preparations were made for the event; congratulatory visits were received; and all
                  wore a smiling appearance. I shut up, as well as I could, in my own heart the
                  anxiety that preyed there, and entered with seeming earnestness into the plans of
                  my father, although they might only serve as the decorations of my tragedy. A
                  house was purchased for us near <placeName type="tgn" key="7004446"
                     >Cologne</placeName>, by which we should enjoy the pleasures of the country,
                  and yet be so near <placeName type="tgn" key="7003746">Geneva</placeName> as to
                  see my father every day; who would still reside within the walls, for the benefit
                  of <persName>Ernest</persName>, that he might follow his studies at the
                  schools.</p>
               <pb n="[3.110]" facs="images/3.110.jpg"/>
               <p>In the mean time I took every precaution to defend my person, in case the fiend
                  should openly attack me. I carried pistols and a dagger constantly about me, and
                  was ever on the watch to prevent artifice; and by these means gained a greater
                  degree of tranquillity. Indeed, as the period approached, the threat appeared more
                  as a delusion, not to be regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the
                  happiness I hoped for in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty, as
                  the day fixed for its solemnization drew nearer, and I heard it continually spoken
                  of as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.</p>
               <p><persName>Elizabeth</persName> seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed
                  greatly to calm her mind. But on the day that was to fulfill my wishes and my
                  destiny, she was melancholy, and <pb n="[3.111]" facs="images/3.111.jpg"/> a
                  presentiment of evil pervaded her; and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful
                  secret, which I had promised to reveal to her on the following day. My father was
                  in the mean time overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only observed in
                  the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.</p>
               <p>After the ceremony was performed, a large party assembled at my father's; but it
                  was agreed that <persName>Elizabeth</persName> and I should pass the afternoon and
                  night at <placeName type="tgn" key="7009171">Evian</placeName>, and return to
                     <placeName type="tgn" key="7004446">Cologne</placeName> the next morning. As
                  the day was fair, and the wind favourable, we resolved to go by water.</p>
               <p>Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the feeling of
                  happiness. We passed rapidly along: the sun was hot, but we were sheltered from
                  its rays by a kind of canopy, while we enjoyed the beauty of the scene, <pb
                     n="[3.112]" facs="images/3.112.jpg"/> sometimes on one side of the lake, where
                  we saw <placeName type="tgn" key="1106285">Mont Salêve</placeName>, the pleasant
                  banks of <placeName type="tgn" key="1032711" cert="medium">Montalêgre</placeName>,
                  and at a distance, surmounting all, the beautiful <placeName type="tgn"
                     key="7617157">Mont Blânc</placeName>, and the assemblage of snowy mountains
                  that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the opposite banks, we
                  saw the mighty <placeName type="tgn" key="1109172">Jura</placeName> opposing its
                  dark side to the ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost
                  insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.</p>
               <p>I took the hand of <persName>Elizabeth</persName>: <said>"You are sorrowful, my
                     love. Ah! if you knew what I have suffered, and what I may yet endure, you
                     would endeavour to let me taste the quiet, and freedom from despair, that this
                     one day at least permits me to enjoy."</said></p>
               <p><said>"Be happy, my dear <persName>Victor</persName>,"</said> replied
                     <persName>Elizabeth</persName>; <said>"there is, I hope, <pb n="[3.113]"
                        facs="images/3.113.jpg"/> nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a
                     lively joy is not painted in my face, my heart is contented. Something whispers
                     to me not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us; but I
                     will not listen to such a sinister voice. Observe how fast we move along, and
                     how the clouds which sometimes obscure, and sometimes rise above the dome of
                        <placeName type="tgn" key="7617157">Mont Blânc</placeName>, render this
                     scene of beauty still more interesting. Look also at the innumerable fish that
                     are swimming in the clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that
                     lies at the bottom. What a divine day! how happy and serene all nature
                     appears!"</said></p>
               <p>Thus <persName>Elizabeth</persName> endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine
                  from all reflection upon melancholy subjects. But her temper was fluctuating; joy
                  for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it <pb n="[3.114]"
                     facs="images/3.114.jpg"/> continually gave place to distraction and
                  reverie.</p>
               <p>The sun sunk lower in the heavens; we passed the <placeName type="tgn"
                     key="7647999" cert="medium">river Drance</placeName>, and observed its path
                  through the chasms of the higher, and the glens of the lower hills. The <placeName
                     type="tgn" key="7007746">Alps</placeName> here come closer to the lake, and we
                  approached the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary. The
                  spire of <placeName type="tgn" key="7009171">Evian</placeName> shone under the
                  woods that surrounded it, and the range of mountain above mountain by which it was
                  overhung.</p>
               <p>The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity, sunk at
                  sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water, and caused a
                  pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the shore, from which it wafted
                  the most delightful scent of flowers and hay. The sun sunk <pb
                     n="[3.115 - page breaks after 'be-']" facs="images/3.115.jpg"/> beneath the
                  horizon as we landed; and as I touched the shore, I felt those cares and fears
                  revive, which soon were to clasp me, and cling to me for ever.</p>" </div>

            <div n="3.6" type="chapter">
               <pb n="[3.116]" facs="images/3.116.jpg"/>
               <head>Chapter VI</head>

               <said>"<p>IT was eight o'clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the
                     shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn, and
                     contemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured in
                     darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines.</p>
                  <p>The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence in the
                     west. The moon had reached her summit in the heavens, and was beginning to
                     descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight of the vulture, and
                     dimmed her rays, while <pb n="[3.117]" facs="images/3.117.jpg"/> the lake
                     reflected the scene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless
                     waves that were beginning to rise. Suddenly a heavy storm of rain
                     descended.</p>
                  <p>I had been calm during the day; but so soon as night obscured the shapes of
                     objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind. I was anxious and watchful, while
                     my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in my bosom; every sound
                     terrified me; but I resolved that I would sell my life dearly, and not relax
                     the impending conflict until my own life, or that of my adversary, were
                     extinguished.</p>
                  <p><persName>Elizabeth</persName> observed my agitation for some time in timid and
                     fearful silence; at length she said, <said>"What is it that agitates you, my
                        dear <persName>Victor</persName>? What is it you fear?"</said></p>
                  <p><said>"Oh! peace, peace, my love,"</said>
                     <pb n="[3.118 - page breaks after 're-']" facs="images/3.118.jpg"/> replied I,
                        <said>"this night, and all will be safe: but this night is dreadful, very
                        dreadful."</said></p>
                  <p>I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how dreadful
                     the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife, and I earnestly
                     entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her until I had obtained some
                     knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.</p>
                  <p>She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages of the
                     house, and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to my adversary.
                     But I discovered no trace of him, and was beginning to conjecture that some
                     fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the execution of his menaces; when
                     suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful scream. It came from the room into which
                        <persName>Elizabeth</persName>
                     <pb n="[3.119]" facs="images/3.119.jpg"/> had retired. As I heard it, the whole
                     truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the motion of every muscle and
                     fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood trickling in my veins, and tingling
                     in the extremities of my limbs. This state lasted but for an instant; the
                     scream was repeated, and I rushed into the room.</p>
                  <p>Great God! why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate the destruction
                     of the best hope, and the purest creature of earth. She was there, lifeless and
                     inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down, and her pale and
                     distorted features half covered by her hair. Everywhere I turn I see the same
                     figure—her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung by the murderer on its bridal
                     bier. Could I behold this, and live? Alas! life is obstinate, and clings
                     closest where it <pb n="[3.120]" facs="images/3.120.jpg"/> is most hated. For a
                     moment only did I lose recollection; I fainted.</p>
                  <p>When I recovered, I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their
                     countenances expressed a breathless terror: but the horror of others appeared
                     only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. I escaped from
                     them to the room where lay the body of <persName>Elizabeth</persName>, my love,
                     my wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. She had been moved from the
                     posture in which I had first beheld her; and now, as she lay, her head upon her
                     arm, and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have supposed
                     her asleep. I rushed towards her, and embraced her with ardour; but the deathly
                     languor and coldness of the limbs told me, that what I now held in my arms had
                     ceased to be the <persName>Elizabeth</persName> whom I had loved and cherished.
                     The <pb n="[3.121]" facs="images/3.121.jpg"/> murderous mark of the fiend's
                     grasp was on her neck, and the breath had ceased to issue from her lips.</p>
                  <p>While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up. The
                     windows of the room had before been darkened; and I felt a kind of panic on
                     seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber. The shutters
                     had been thrown back; and, with a sensation of horror not to be described, I
                     saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred. A grin was on
                     the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his fiendish finger he
                     pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed towards the window, and drawing
                     a pistol from my bosom, shot; but he eluded me, leaped from his station, and,
                     running with the swiftness of lightning, plunged into the lake.</p>
                  <pb n="[3.122]" facs="images/3.122.jpg"/>
                  <p>The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to the spot
                     where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with boats; nets were cast,
                     but in vain. After passing several hours, we returned hopeless, most of my
                     companions believing it to have been a form conjured by my fancy. After having
                     landed, they proceeded to search the country, parties going in different
                     directions among the woods and vines.</p>
                  <p>I did not accompany them; I was exhausted: a film covered my eyes, and my skin
                     was parched with the heat of fever. In this state I lay on a bed, hardly
                     conscious of what had happened; my eyes wandered round the room, as if to seek
                     something that I had lost.</p>
                  <p>At length I remembered that my father would anxiously expect the return <pb
                        n="[3.123]" facs="images/3.123.jpg"/> of <persName>Elizabeth</persName> and
                     myself, and that I must return alone. This reflection brought tears into my
                     eyes, and I wept for a long time; but my thoughts rambled to various subjects,
                     reflecting on my misfortunes, and their cause. I was bewildered in a cloud of
                     wonder and horror. The death of <persName>William</persName>, the execution of
                        <persName>Justine</persName>, the murder of <persName>Clerval</persName>,
                     and lastly of my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining
                     friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now might be
                     writhing under his grasp, and <persName>Ernest</persName> might be dead at his
                     feet. This idea made me shudder, and recalled me to action. I started up, and
                     resolved to return to <placeName type="tgn" key="7003746">Geneva</placeName>
                     with all possible speed.</p>
                  <p>There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the
                     wind was unfavourable, and <pb n="[3.124]" facs="images/3.124.jpg"/> the rain
                     fell in torrents. However, it was hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope
                     to arrive by night. I hired men to row, and took an oar myself, for I had
                     always experienced relief from mental torment in bodily exercise. But the
                     overflowing misery I now felt, and the excess of agitation that I endured,
                     rendered me incapable of any exertion. I threw down the oar; and, leaning my
                     head upon my hands, gave way to every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I
                     saw the scenes which were familiar to me in my happier time, and which I had
                     contemplated but the day before in the company of her who was now but a shadow
                     and a recollection. Tears streamed from my eyes. The rain had ceased for a
                     moment, and I saw the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours
                     before; they had then been observed <pb n="[3.125]" facs="images/3.125.jpg"/>
                     by <persName>Elizabeth</persName>. Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a
                     great and sudden change. The sun might shine, or the clouds might lour; but
                     nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. A fiend had snatched
                     from me every hope of future happiness: no creature had ever been so miserable
                     as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of man.</p>
                  <p>But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming
                     event. Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their acme, and what I
                     must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know that, one by one, my friends
                     were snatched away; I was left desolate. My own strength is exhausted; and I
                     must tell, in a few words, what remains of my hideous narration.</p>
                  <p>I arrived at <placeName type="tgn" key="7003746">Geneva</placeName>. My father
                     and <pb n="[3.126]" facs="images/3.126.jpg"/>
                     <persName>Ernest</persName> yet lived; but the former sunk under the tidings
                     that I bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable old man! his eyes wandered
                     in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their delight—his niece, his more
                     than daughter, whom he doated on with all that affection which a man feels,
                     who,in the decline of life, having few affections, clings more earnestly to
                     those that remain. Cursed, cursed be the fiend that brought misery on his grey
                     hairs, and doomed him to waste in wretchedness! He could not live under the
                     horrors that were accumulated around him; an apoplectic fit was brought on, and
                     in a few days he died in my arms.</p>
                  <p>What then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and darkness
                     were the only objects that pressed upon me. Sometimes, indeed, I dreamt that I
                     wandered in flowery <pb n="[3.127]" facs="images/3.127.jpg"/> meadows and
                     pleasant vales with the friends of my youth; but awoke, and found myself in a
                     dungeon. Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear conception of my
                     miseries and situation, and was then released from my prison. For they had
                     called me mad; and during many months, as I understood, a solitary cell had
                     been my habitation.</p>
                  <p>But liberty had been a useless gift to me had I not, as I awakened to reason,
                     at the same time awakened to revenge. As the memory of past misfortunes pressed
                     upon me, I began to reflect on their cause—the monster whom I had created, the
                     miserable daemon whom I had sent abroad into the world for my destruction. I
                     was possessed by a maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and
                     ardently prayed that I might have him <pb n="[3.128]" facs="images/3.128.jpg"/>
                     within my grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge on his cursed head.</p>
                  <p>Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to reflect on
                     the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about a month after my
                     release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town, and told him that I had an
                     accusation to make; that I knew the destroyer of my family; and that I required
                     him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer.</p>
                  <p>The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness: <said>"Be assured,
                        sir,"</said> said he, <said>"no pains or exertions on my part shall be
                        spared to discover the villain."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"I thank you,"</said> replied I; <said>"listen, therefore, to the
                        deposition that I have to make. It is indeed a tale so strange, that I
                        should fear you would not credit <pb n="[3.129]" facs="images/3.129.jpg"/>
                        it, were there not something in truth which, however wonderful, forces
                        conviction. The story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream, and I
                        have no motive for falsehood."</said> My manner, as I thus addressed him,
                     was impressive, but calm; I had formed in my own heart a resolution to pursue
                     my destroyer to death; and this purpose quieted my agony, and provisionally
                     reconciled me to life. I now related my history briefly, but with firmness and
                     precision, marking the dates with accuracy, and never deviating into invective
                     or exclamation.</p>
                  <p>The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued he
                     became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with horror,
                     at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted on his
                     countenance.</p>
                  <pb n="[3.130]" facs="images/3.130.jpg"/>
                  <p>When I had concluded my narration, I said, <said>"This is the being whom I
                        accuse, and for whose detection and punishment I call upon you to exert your
                        whole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that
                        your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those functions
                        on this occasion."</said></p>
                  <p>This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my auditor. He
                     had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given to a tale of
                     spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon to act officially
                     in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity returned. He, however,
                     answered mildly, <said>"I would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit;
                        but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put
                        all my exertions to defiance. <pb n="[3.131]" facs="images/3.131.jpg"/> Who
                        can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice, and inhabit caves
                        and dens, where no man would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have
                        elapsed since the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to
                        what place he has wandered, or what region he may now inhabit."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit; and if he
                        has indeed taken refuge in the <placeName type="tgn" key="7007746"
                           >Alps</placeName>, he may be hunted like the chamois, and destroyed as a
                        beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts: you do not credit my narrative,
                        and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his
                        desert."</said></p>
                  <p>As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated;
                        <said>"You are mistaken,"</said> said he, <said>"I will <pb n="[3.132]"
                           facs="images/3.132.jpg"/> exert myself; if it is in my power to seize the
                        monster, be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his
                        crimes. But I fear, from what you have yourself described to be his
                        properties, that this will prove impracticable, and that, while every proper
                        measure is pursued, you should endeavour to make up your mind to
                        disappointment."</said></p>
                  <p><said>"That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail. My
                        revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I
                        confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul. My rage is
                        unspeakable, when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned loose upon
                        society, still exists. You refuse my just demand: I have but one resource;
                        and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to his
                     destruction."</said></p>
                  <pb n="[3.133]" facs="images/3.133.jpg"/>
                  <p>I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a phrenzy in my
                     manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness, which the
                     martyrs of old are said to have possessed. But to a Genevan magistrate, whose
                     mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of devotion and heroism, this
                     elevation of mind had much the appearance of madness. He endeavoured to soothe
                     me as a nurse does a child, and reverted to my tale as the effects of
                     delirium.</p>
                  <p><said>"Man,"</said> I cried, <said>"how ignorant art thou in thy pride of
                        wisdom! Cease; you know not what it is you say."</said></p>
                  <p>I broke from the house angry and disturbed, and retired to meditate on some
                     other mode of action.</p>"</said>

               <head>Chapter VII</head>

               <said>"<p>MY present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was swallowed
                     up and lost. I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone endowed me with strength
                     and composure; it modelled my feelings, and allowed me to be calculating and
                     calm, at periods when otherwise delirium or death would have been my
                     portion.</p>
                  <p>My first resolution was to quit <placeName type="tgn" key="7003746"
                        >Geneva</placeName> for ever; my country, which, when I was happy and
                     beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became hateful. I provided
                     myself with <pb n="[3.135]" facs="images/3.135.jpg"/> a sum of money, together
                     with a few jewels which had belonged to my mother, and departed.</p>
                  <p>And now my wanderings began, which are to cease but with life. I have traversed
                     a vast portion of the earth, and have endured all the hardships which
                     travellers, in deserts and barbarous countries, are wont to meet. How I have
                     lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon the
                     sandy plain, and prayed for death. But revenge kept me alive; I dared not die,
                     and leave my adversary in being.</p>
                  <p>When I quitted <placeName type="tgn" key="7003746">Geneva</placeName>, my first
                     labour was to gain some clue by which I might trace the steps of my fiendish
                     enemy. But my plan was unsettled; and I wandered many hours around the confines
                     of the town, uncertain what path I should pursue. As night <pb n="[3.136]"
                        facs="images/3.136.jpg"/> approached, I found myself at the entrance of the
                     cemetery where <persName>William</persName>, <persName>Elizabeth</persName>,
                     and my father, reposed. I entered it, and approached the tomb which marked
                     their graves. Every thing was silent, except the leaves of the trees, which
                     were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark; and the scene
                     would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested observer. The
                     spirits of the departed seemed to flit around, and to cast a shadow, which was
                     felt but seen not, around the head of the mourner.</p>
                  <p>The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to rage
                     and despair. They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived, and to
                     destroy him I must drag out my weary existence. I knelt on the grass, and
                     kissed the earth, and with <pb n="[3.137 - page breaks after 'quiver-']"
                        facs="images/3.137.jpg"/> quivering lips exclaimed, <said>"By the sacred
                        earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the deep and
                        eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and by the spirits
                        that preside over thee, I swear to pursue the daemon, who caused this
                        misery, until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict. For this purpose I
                        will preserve my life: to execute this dear revenge, will I again behold the
                        sun, and tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish
                        from my eyes for ever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead; and on you,
                        wandering ministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work. Let the
                        cursed and hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair
                        that now torments me."</said></p>
                  <p>I had begun my abjuration with solemnity, and an awe which almost <pb
                        n="[3.138]" facs="images/3.138.jpg"/> assured me that the shades of my
                     murdered friends heard and approved my devotion; but the furies possessed me as
                     I concluded, and rage choaked my utterance.</p>
                  <p>I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish laugh. It
                     rung on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed it, and I felt as if
                     all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter. Surely in that moment I
                     should have been possessed by phrenzy, and have destroyed my miserable
                     existence, but that my vow was heard, and that I was reserved for vengeance.
                     The laughter died away: when a well-known and abhorred voice, apparently close
                     to my ear, addressed me in an audible whisper—<said>"I am satisfied: miserable
                        wretch! you have determined to live, and I am satisfied."</said></p>
                  <pb n="[3.139]" facs="images/3.139.jpg"/>
                  <p>I darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded; but the devil eluded
                     my grasp. Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose, and shone full upon his
                     ghastly and distorted shape, as he fled with more than mortal speed.</p>
                  <p>I pursued him; and for many months this has been my task. Guided by a slight
                     clue, I followed the windings of the <placeName type="tgn" key="7023890"
                        >Rhone</placeName>, but vainly. The blue <placeName type="tgn" key="7016735"
                        >Mediterranean</placeName> appeared; and, by a strange chance, I saw the
                     fiend enter by night, and hide himself in a vessel bound for the <placeName
                        type="tgn" key="7016619">Black Sea</placeName>. I took my passage in the
                     same ship; but he escaped, I know not how.</p>
                  <p>Amidst the wilds of <placeName type="tgn" key="7016836" cert="medium"
                        >Tartary</placeName> and <placeName type="tgn" key="7002435"
                        >Russia</placeName>, although he still evaded me, I have ever followed in
                     his track. Sometimes the peasants, scared by this horrid apparition, informed
                     me of his <pb n="[3.140]" facs="images/3.140.jpg"/> path; sometimes he himself,
                     who feared that if I lost all trace I should despair and die, often left some
                     mark to guide me. The snows descended on my head, and I saw the print of his
                     huge step on the white plain. To you first entering on life, to whom care is
                     new, and agony unknown, how can you understand what I have felt, and still
                     feel? Cold, want, and fatigue, were the least pains which I was destined to
                     endure; I was cursed by some devil, and carried about with me my eternal hell;
                     yet still a spirit of good followed and directed my steps, and, when I most
                     murmured, would suddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable
                     difficulties. Sometimes, when nature, overcome by hunger, sunk under the
                     exhaustion, a repast was prepared for me in the desert, that restored and
                     inspirited me. The fare was indeed <pb n="[3.141]" facs="images/3.141.jpg"/>
                     coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate; but I may not doubt that it
                     was set there by the spirits that I had invoked to aid me. Often, when all was
                     dry, the heavens cloudless, and I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would
                     bedim the sky, shed the few drops that revived me, and vanish.</p>
                  <p>I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the daemon generally
                     avoided these, as it was here that the population of the country chiefly
                     collected. In other places human beings were seldom seen; and I generally
                     subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my path. I had money with me, and
                     gained the friendship of the villagers by distributing it, or bringing with me
                     some food that I had killed, which, after taking a small part, I always
                     presented to those who had provided me with fire and utensils for cooking.</p>
                  <pb n="[3.142]" facs="images/3.142.jpg"/>
                  <p>My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during sleep
                     alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! often, when most miserable, I
                     sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The spirits that
                     guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of happiness, that I
                     might retain strength to fulfill my pilgrimage. Deprived of this respite, I
                     should have sunk under my hardships. During the day I was sustained and
                     inspirited by the hope of night: for in sleep I saw my friends, my wife, and my
                     beloved country; again I saw the benevolent countenance of my father, heard the
                     silver tones of my <persName>Elizabeth</persName>'s voice, and beheld
                        <persName>Clerval</persName> enjoying health and youth. Often, when wearied
                     by a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should
                     come, and <pb n="[3.143]" facs="images/3.143.jpg"/> that I should then enjoy
                     reality in the arms of my dearest friends. What agonizing fondness did I feel
                     for them! how did I cling to their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even
                     my waking hours, and persuade myself that they still lived! At such moments
                     vengeance, that burned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path
                     towards the destruction of the daemon, more as a task enjoined by heaven, as
                     the mechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than as the
                     ardent desire of my soul.</p>
                  <p>What his feelings were whom I pursued, I cannot know. Sometimes, indeed, he
                     left marks in writing on the barks of the trees, or cut in stone, that guided
                     me, and instigated my fury. <said>"My reign is not yet over,"</said> (these
                     words were legible in one of these inscriptions); <said>"you live, and my power
                        is <pb n="[3.144]" facs="images/3.144.jpg"/> complete. Follow me; I seek the
                        everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the misery of cold and
                        frost, to which I am impassive. You will find near this place, if you follow
                        not too tardily, a dead hare; eat, and be refreshed. Come on, my enemy; we
                        have yet to wrestle for our lives; but many hard and miserable hours must
                        you endure, until that period shall arrive."</said></p>
                  <p>Scoffing devil! Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee, miserable
                     fiend, to torture and death. Never will I omit my search, until he or I perish;
                     and then with what ecstasy shall I join my <persName>Elizabeth</persName>, and
                     those who even now prepare for me the reward of my tedious toil and horrible
                     pilgrimage.</p>
                  <p>As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened, and the
                     cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support. The peasants <pb
                        n="[3.145]" facs="images/3.145.jpg"/> were shut up in their hovels, and only
                     a few of the most hardy ventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had
                     forced from their hiding-places to seek for prey. The rivers were covered with
                     ice, and no fish could be procured; and thus I was cut off from my chief
                     article of maintenance.</p>
                  <p>The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours. One
                     inscription that he left was in these words: <said>"Prepare! your toils only
                        begin: wrap yourself in furs, and provide food, for we shall soon enter upon
                        a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting
                     hatred."</said></p>
                  <p>My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I
                     resolved not to fail in my purpose; and, calling on heaven to support me, I
                     continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts, until the <pb
                        n="[3.146]" facs="images/3.146.jpg"/> ocean appeared at a distance, and
                     formed the utmost boundary of the horizon. Oh! how unlike it was to the blue
                     seas of the south! Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land
                     by its superior wildness and ruggedness. The <foreign>Greeks</foreign> wept for
                     joy when they beheld the <placeName type="tgn" key="7016735"
                        >Mediterranean</placeName> from the hills of <placeName type="tgn"
                        key="1000004">Asia</placeName>, and hailed with rapture the boundary of
                     their toils. I did not weep; but I knelt down, and, with a full heart, thanked
                     my guiding spirit for conducting me in safety to the place where I hoped,
                     notwithstanding my adversary's gibe, to meet and grapple with him.</p>
                  <p>Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs, and thus
                     traversed the snows with inconceivable speed. I know not whether the fiend
                     possessed the same advantages; but I found that, as before I had <pb
                        n="[3.147]" facs="images/3.147.jpg"/> daily lost ground in the pursuit, I
                     now gained on him, so much so, that when I first saw the ocean, he was but one
                     day's journey in advance, and I hoped to intercept him before he should reach
                     the beach. With new courage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived
                     at a wretched hamlet on the sea-shore. I inquired of the inhabitants concerning
                     the fiend, and gained accurate information. A gigantic monster, they said, had
                     arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols; putting to flight
                     the inhabitants of a solitary cottage, through fear of his terrific appearance.
                     He had carried off their store of winter food, and, placing it in a sledge, to
                     draw which he had seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed
                     them, and the same night, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had
                     pursued his journey <pb n="[3.148]" facs="images/3.148.jpg"/> across the sea in
                     a direction that led to no land; and they conjectured that he must speedily be
                     destroyed by the breaking of the ice, or frozen by the eternal frosts.</p>
                  <p>On hearing this information, I suffered a temporary access of despair. He had
                     escaped me; and I must commence a destructive and almost endless journey across
                     the mountainous ices of the ocean,—amidst cold that few of the inhabitants
                     could long endure, and which I, the native of a genial and sunny climate, could
                     not hope to survive. Yet at the idea that the fiend should live and be
                     triumphant, my rage and vengeance returned, and, like a mighty tide,
                     overwhelmed every other feeling. After a slight repose, during which the
                     spirits of the dead hovered round, and instigated me to toil and revenge, I
                     prepared for my journey.</p>
                  <pb n="[3.149]" facs="images/3.149.jpg"/>
                  <p>I exchanged my land sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of the frozen
                     ocean; and, purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I departed from
                     land.</p>
                  <p>I cannot guess how many days have passed since then; but I have endured misery,
                     which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution burning within my
                     heart could have enabled me to support. Immense and rugged mountains of ice
                     often barred up my passage, and I often heard the thunder of the ground sea,
                     which threatened my destruction. But again the frost came, and made the paths
                     of the sea secure.</p>
                  <p>By the quantity of provision which I had consumed I should guess that I had
                     passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction of hope,
                     returning back upon the heart, <pb n="[3.150]" facs="images/3.150.jpg"/> often
                     wrung bitter drops of despondency and grief from my eyes. Despair had indeed
                     almost secured her prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery; when
                     once, after the poor animals that carried me had with incredible toil gained
                     the summit of a sloping ice mountain, and one sinking under his fatigue died, I
                     viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye caught a dark
                     speck upon the dusky plain. I strained my sight to discover what it could be,
                     and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I distinguished a sledge, and the
                     distorted proportions of a well-known form within. Oh! with what a burning gush
                     did hope revisit my heart! warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped
                     away, that they might not intercept the view I had of the daemon; but still my
                     sight was dimmed by the <pb n="[3.151 - page breaks after 'burn-']"
                        facs="images/3.151.jpg"/> burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions
                     that oppressed me, I wept aloud.</p>
                  <p>But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their dead
                     companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food; and, after an hour's rest,
                     which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly irksome to me, I
                     continued my route. The sledge was still visible; nor did I again lose sight of
                     it, except at the moments when for a short time some ice rock concealed it with
                     its intervening crags. I indeed perceptibly gained on it; and when, after
                     nearly two days' journey, I beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my
                     heart bounded within me.</p>
                  <p>But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my enemy, my hopes were
                     suddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had ever
                     done before. A ground sea <pb n="[3.152]" facs="images/3.152.jpg"/> was heard;
                     the thunder of its progress, as the waters rolled and swelled beneath me,
                     became every moment more ominous and terrific. I pressed on, but in vain. The
                     wind arose; the sea roared; and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it
                     split, and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound. The work was soon
                     finished: in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and
                     I was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice, that was continually
                     lessening, and thus preparing for me a hideous death.</p>
                  <p>In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died; and I
                     myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress, when I saw your
                     vessel riding at anchor, and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life. I
                     had no conception that vessels ever came so far north, and was <pb n="[3.153]"
                        facs="images/3.153.jpg"/> astounded at the sight. I quickly destroyed part
                     of my sledge to construct oars; and by these means was enabled, with infinite
                     fatigue, to move my ice-raft in the direction of your ship. I had determined,
                     if you were going southward, still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas,
                     rather than abandon my purpose. I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with
                     which I could pursue my enemy. But your direction was northward. You took me on
                     board when my vigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my
                     multiplied hardships into a death, which I still dread,—for my task is
                     unfulfilled.</p>
                  <p>Oh! when will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the daemon, allow me the
                     rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live? If I do, swear to me,
                        <persName>Walton</persName>, that he shall not escape; that you will seek
                     him, and satisfy my <pb n="[3.154]" facs="images/3.154.jpg"/> vengeance in his
                     death. Yet, do I dare ask you to undertake my pilgrimage, to endure the
                     hardships that I have undergone? No; I am not so selfish. Yet, when I am dead,
                     if he should appear; if the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you,
                     swear that he shall not live—swear that he shall not triumph over my
                     accumulated woes, and live to make another such a wretch as I am. He is
                     eloquent and persuasive; and once his words had even power over my heart: but
                     trust him not. His soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery and
                     fiend-like malice. Hear him not; call on the manes of
                        <persName>William</persName>, <persName>Justine</persName>,
                        <persName>Clerval</persName>, <persName>Elizabeth</persName>, my father, and
                     of the wretched <persName>Victor</persName>, and thrust your sword into his
                     heart. I will hover near, and direct the steel aright.</p>"</said>

                  others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with difficulty the words so
                  replete with agony. His fine and lovely eyes were now lighted up with indignation,
                  now subdued to downcast sorrow, and quenched in infinite wretchedness. Sometimes
                  he commanded his countenance and tones, and related the most horrible incidents
                  with a tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a volcano
                  bursting <pb n="[3.156]" facs="images/3.156.jpg"/> forth, his face would suddenly
                  change to an expression of the wildest rage, as he shrieked out imprecations on
                  his persecutor.</p>
               <p>His tale is connected, and told with an appearance of the simplest truth; yet I
                  own to you that the letters of <persName>Felix</persName> and
                     <persName>Safie</persName>, which he shewed me, and the apparition of the
                  monster, seen from our ship, brought to me a greater conviction of the truth of
                  his narrative than his asseverations, however earnest and connected. Such a
                  monster has then really existence; I cannot doubt it; yet I am lost in surprise
                  and admiration. Sometimes I endeavoured to gain from
                     <persName>Frankenstein</persName> the particulars of his creature's formation;
                  but on this point he was impenetrable.</p>
               <p><said>"Are you mad, my friend?"</said> said he, <said>"or whither does your
                     senseless <pb n="[3.157 - page breaks after 'curio-']" facs="images/3.157.jpg"
                     /> curiosity lead you? Would you also create for yourself and the world a
                     demoniacal enemy? Or to what do your questions tend? Peace, peace! learn my
                     miseries, and do not seek to increase your own."</said></p>
               <p><persName>Frankenstein</persName> discovered that I made notes concerning his
                  history: he asked to see them, and then himself corrected and augmented them in
                  many places; but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he
                  held with his enemy. <said>"Since you have preserved my narration,"</said> said
                  he, <said>"I would not that a mutilated one should go down to
                  posterity."</said></p>
               <p>Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest tale that ever
                  imagination formed. My thoughts, and every feeling of my soul, have been drunk up
                  by the interest for my guest, which this tale, and his own <pb n="[3.158]"
                     facs="images/3.158.jpg"/> elevated and gentle manners have created. I wish to
                  soothe him; yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of every
                  hope of consolation, to live? Oh, no! the only joy that he can now know will be
                  when he composes his shattered feelings to peace and death. Yet he enjoys one
                  comfort, the offspring of solitude and delirium: he believes, that, when in dreams
                  he holds converse with his friends, and derives from that communion consolation
                  for his miseries, or excitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations
                  of his fancy, but the real beings who visit him from the regions of a remote
                  world. This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render them to me almost
                  as imposing and interesting as truth.</p>
               <p>Our conversations are not always confined to his own history and <pb
                     n="[3.159 - page breaks after 'mis-']" facs="images/3.159.jpg"/> misfortunes.
                  On every point of general literature he displays unbounded knowledge, and a quick
                  and piercing apprehension. His eloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear
                  him, when he relates a pathetic incident, or endeavours to move the passions of
                  pity or love, without tears. What a glorious creature must he have been in the
                  days of his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin. He seems to
                  feel his own worth, and the greatness of his fall.</p>
               <p><said>"When younger,"</said> said he, <said>"I felt as if I were destined for some
                     great enterprise. My feelings are profound; but I possessed a coolness of
                     judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. This sentiment of the
                     worth of my nature supported me, when others would have been oppressed; for I
                     deemed it criminal to throw away in useless <pb n="[3.160]"
                        facs="images/3.160.jpg"/> grief those talents that might be useful to my
                     fellow-creatures. When I reflected on the work I had completed, no less a one
                     than the creation of a sensitive and rational animal, I could not rank myself
                     with the herd of common projectors. But this feeling, which supported me in the
                     commencement of my career, now serves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All
                     my speculations and hopes are as nothing; and, like the archangel who aspired
                     to omnipotence, I am chained in an eternal hell. My imagination was vivid, yet
                     my powers of analysis and application were intense; by the union of these
                     qualities I conceived the idea, and executed the creation of a man. Even now I
                     cannot recollect, without passion, my reveries while the work was incomplete. I
                     trod heaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the
                     idea of <pb n="[3.161]" facs="images/3.161.jpg"/> their effects. From my
                     infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty ambition; but how am I sunk!
                     Oh! my friend, if you had known me as I once was, you would not recognize me in
                     this state of degradation. Despondency rarely visited my heart; a high destiny
                     seemed to bear me on, until I fell, never, never again to rise."</said></p>
               <p>Must I then lose this admirable being? I have longed for a friend; I have sought
                  one who would sympathize with and love me. Behold, on these desert seas I have
                  found such a one; but, I fear, I have gained him only to know his value, and lose
                  him. I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea.</p>
               <p><said>"I thank you, <persName>Walton</persName>,"</said> he said, <said>"for your
                     kind intentions towards so miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties,
                     and fresh affections, <pb n="[3.162]" facs="images/3.162.jpg"/> think you that
                     any can replace those who are gone? Can any man be to me as
                        <persName>Clerval</persName> was; or any woman another
                        <persName>Elizabeth</persName>? Even where the affections are not strongly
                     moved by any superior excellence, the companions of our childhood always
                     possess a certain power over our minds, which hardly any later friend can
                     obtain. They know our infantine dispositions, which, however they may be
                     afterwards modified, are never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions
                     with more certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. A sister or a
                     brother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shewnearly, suspect
                     the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend, however strongly he
                     may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be invaded with suspicion. But I
                     enjoyed friends, dear not only <pb n="[3.163]" facs="images/3.163.jpg"/>
                     through habit and association, but from their own merits; and, wherever I am,
                     the soothing voice of my <persName>Elizabeth</persName>, and the conversation
                     of <persName>Clerval</persName>, will be ever whispered in my ear. They are
                     dead; and but one feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my
                     life. If I were engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with
                     extensive utility to my fellow-creatures, then could I live to fulfill it. But
                     such is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I gave
                     existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled, and I may die."</said></p>

                  <salute>MY BELOVED SISTER,</salute></opener>

               <p>I write to you encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever doomed to see
                  again dear <placeName type="tgn" key="7002445">England</placeName>, and the dearer
                  friends that inhabit it. I <pb n="[3.164]" facs="images/3.164.jpg"/> am surrounded
                  by mountains of ice, which admit of no escape and threaten every moment to crush
                  my vessel. The brave fellows whom I have persuaded to be my companions look
                  towards me for aid; but I have none to bestow. There is something terribly
                  appalling in our situation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me. We may
                  survive; and if we do not, I will repeat the lessons of my <persName type="lccn"
                     key="n79004229" cert="medium">Seneca</persName>, and die with a good heart.</p>
               <p>Yet what, <persName>Margaret</persName>, will be the state of your mind? You will
                  not hear of my destruction, and you will anxiously await my return. Years will
                  pass, and you will have visitings of despair, and yet be tortured by hope. Oh! my
                  beloved sister, the sickening failings of your heart-felt expectations are, in
                  prospect, more terrible to me than my own death. But you have a <pb n="[3.165]"
                     facs="images/3.165.jpg"/> husband, and lovely children; you may be happy:
                  Heaven bless you, and make you so!</p>
               <p>My unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion. He endeavours to
                  fill me with hope; and talks as if life were a possession which he valued. He
                  reminds me how often the same accidents have happened to other navigators, who
                  have attempted this sea, and, in spite of myself, he fills me with cheerful
                  auguries. Even the sailors feel the power of his eloquence: when he speaks, they
                  no longer despair; he rouses their energies, and, while they hear his voice, they
                  believe these vast mountains of ice are mole-hills, which will vanish before the
                  resolutions of man. These feelings are transitory; each day's expectation delayed
                  fills them with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny caused by this despair.</p>

               <!-- question -->
               <p>A scene has just passed of such uncommon interest, that although it is highly
                  probable that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot forbear recording
                  it.</p>
               <p>We are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger of being
                  crushed in their conflict. The cold is excessive, and many of my unfortunate
                  comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of desolation.
                     <persName>Frankenstein</persName> has daily declined in health: a feverish fire
                  still glimmers in his eyes; but he is exhausted, and, when suddenly roused to any
                  exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent lifelessness.</p>
               <p>I mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny. This morning,
                  as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend—his eyes <pb n="[3.167]"
                     facs="images/3.167.jpg"/> half closed, and his limbs hanging listlessly,—I was
                  roused by half a dozen of the sailors, who desired admission into the cabin. They
                  entered; and their leader addressed me. He told me that he and his companions had
                  been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation to me, to make me a demand,
                  which, in justice, I could not refuse. We were immured in ice, and should probably
                  never escape; but they feared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate,
                  and a free passage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage, and
                  lead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted this. They
                  desired, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn promise, that if the vessel
                  should be freed, I would instantly direct my course southward.</p>
               <p>This speech troubled me. I had <pb n="[3.168]" facs="images/3.168.jpg"/> not
                  despaired; nor had I yet conceived the idea of returning, if set free. Yet could
                  I, in justice, or even in possibility, refuse this demand? I hesitated before I
                  answered; when <persName>Frankenstein</persName>, who had at first been silent,
                  and indeed, appeared hardly to have force enough to attend, now roused himself;
                  his eyes sparkled, and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour. Turning towards
                  the men, he said—</p>
               <p><said>"What do you mean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you then so
                     easily turned from your design? Did you not call this a glorious expedition?
                     And wherefore was it glorious? Not because the way was smooth and placid as a
                     southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and terror; because, at every
                     new incident, your fortitude was to be called forth, and your courage
                     exhibited; because <pb n="[3.169]" facs="images/3.169.jpg"/> danger and death
                     surrounded, and these dangers you were to brave and overcome. For this was it a
                     glorious, for this was it an honourable undertaking. You were hereafter to be
                     hailed as the benefactors of your species; your names adored, as belonging to
                     brave men who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind. And now,
                     behold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first mighty
                     and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away, and are content to be
                     handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and peril; and
                     so, poor souls, they were chilly, and returned to their warm fire-sides. Why,
                     that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come thus far, and dragged
                     your captain to the shame of a defeat, merely to prove yourselves cowards. Oh!
                     be men, or <pb n="[3.170]" facs="images/3.170.jpg"/> be more than men. Be
                     steady to your purposes, and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff
                     as your hearts might be; it is mutable, cannot withstand you, if you say that
                     it shall not. Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace marked
                     on your brows. Return as heroes who have fought and conquered, and who know not
                     what it is to turn their backs on the foe."</said></p>
               <p>He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed in his
                  speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can you wonder that
                  these men were moved. They looked at one another, and were unable to reply. I
                  spoke; I told them to retire, and consider of what had been said: that I would not
                  lead them further north, if they strenuously desired the contrary; but that I
                  hoped <pb n="[3.171]" facs="images/3.171.jpg"/> that, with reflection, their
                  courage would return.</p>
               <p>They retired, and I turned towards my friend; but he was sunk in languor, and
                  almost deprived of life.</p>
               <p>How all this will terminate, I know not; but I had rather die, than return
                  shamefully,—my purpose unfulfilled. Yet I fear such will be my fate; the men,
                  unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never willingly continue to endure
                  their present hardships.</p>

               <p>The die is cast; I have consented to return, if we are not destroyed. Thus are my
                  hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back ignorant and disappointed.
                  It requires more philosophy than I possess, to bear this injustice with

               <p>It is past; I am returning to <placeName type="tgn" key="7002445"
                     >England</placeName>. I have lost my hopes of utility and glory;—I have lost my

                     >England</placeName>, and towards you, I will not despond.</p>
               <p><date>September 9th</date>, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were
                  heard at a distance, as the islands split and cracked in every direction. We were
                  in the most imminent peril; but, as we could only remain passive, my chief
                  attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest, whose illness increased in such a
                  degree, that he was entirely confined to his bed. The ice cracked behind us, and
                  was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprung from the west, and on the
                  11th <pb n="[3.173]" facs="images/3.173.jpg"/> the passage towards the south
                  became perfectly free. When the sailors saw this, and that their return to their
                  native country was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them,
                  loud and long-continued. <persName>Frankenstein</persName>, who was dozing, awoke,
                  and asked the cause of the tumult. <said>"They shout,"</said> I said,
                     <said>"because they will soon return to <placeName type="tgn" key="7002445"
                        >England</placeName>."</said></p>
               <p><said>"Do you then really return?"</said></p>
               <p><said>"Alas! yes; I cannot withstand their demands. I cannot lead them unwillingly
                     to danger, and I must return."</said></p>
               <p><said>"Do so, if you will; but I will not. You may give up your purpose, but mine
                     is assigned to me by heaven, and I dare not. I am weak; but surely the spirits
                     who assist my vengeance will endow me with sufficient strength."</said> Saying
                  this, he endeavoured to spring from the bed, but the exertion was <pb n="[3.174]"
                     facs="images/3.174.jpg"/> too great for him; he fell back, and fainted.</p>
               <p>It was long before he was restored; and I often thought that life was entirely
                  extinct. At length he opened his eyes, but he breathed with difficulty, and was
                  unable to speak. The surgeon gave him a composing draught, and ordered us to leave
                  him undisturbed. In the mean time he told me, that my friend had not many hours to
                  live.</p>
               <p>His sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve, and be patient. I sat by his
                  bed watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but presently he
                  called to me in a feeble voice, and, bidding me come near, said—<said>"Alas! the
                     strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall soon die, and he, my enemy
                     and persecutor, may still be in being. Think <pb n="[3.175]"
                        facs="images/3.175.jpg"/> not, <persName>Walton</persName>, that in the last
                     moments of my existence I feel that burning hatred, and ardent desire of
                     revenge I once expressed; but I feel myself justified in desiring the death of
                     my adversary. During these last days I have been occupied in examining my past
                     conduct; nor do I find it blameable. In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created
                     a rational creature, and was bound towards him, to assure, as far as was in my
                     power, his happiness and well-being. This was my duty; but there was another
                     still paramount to that. My duties towards my fellow-creatures had greater
                     claims to my attention, because they included a greater proportion of happiness
                     or misery. Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to
                     create a companion for the first creature. He showed unparalleled malignity and
                     selfishness, in <pb n="[3.176]" facs="images/3.176.jpg"/> evil: he destroyed my
                     friends; he devoted to destruction beings who possessed exquisite sensations,
                     happiness, and wisdom; nor do I know where this thirst for vengeance may end.
                     Miserable himself, that he may render no other wretched, he ought to die. The
                     task of his destruction was mine, but I have failed. When actuated by selfish
                     and vicious motives, I asked you to undertake my unfinished work; and I renew
                     this request now, when I am only induced by reason and virtue."</said></p>
               <p><said>"Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends, to fulfill this
                     task; and now, that you are returning to <placeName type="tgn" key="7002445"
                        >England</placeName>, you will have little chance of meeting with him. But
                     the consideration of these points, and the well balancing of what you may
                     esteem your duties, I leave to you; my <pb

                     and ideas are already disturbed by the near approach of death. I dare not ask
                     you to do what I think right, for I may still be misled by passion. That he
                     should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in other respects,
                     this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the only happy one which I
                     have enjoyed for several years. The forms of the beloved dead flit before me,
                     and I hasten to their arms. Farewell, <persName>Walton</persName>! Seek
                     happiness in tranquillity, and avoid ambition, even if it be only the
                     apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in science and discoveries.
                     Yet why do I say this? I have myself been blasted in these hopes, yet another
                     may succeed."</said></p>
               <p>His voice became fainter as he spoke; and at length, exhausted by <pb n="[3.178]"
                     facs="images/3.178.jpg"/> his effort, he sunk into silence. About half an hour
                  afterwards he attempted again to speak, but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly,
                  and his eyes closed for ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed away
                  from his lips.<persName>Margaret</persName>, what comment can I make on the
                  untimely extinction of this glorious spirit? What can I say that will enable you
                  to understand the depth of my sorrow? All that I should express would be
                  inadequate and feeble. My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of
                  disappointment. But I journey towards <placeName type="tgn" key="7002445"
                     >England</placeName>, and I may there find consolation.</p>
               <p>I am interrupted. What do these sounds portend? It is midnight; the breeze blows
                  fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir. Again; there is a sound as of a human
                  voice, but <pb n="[3.179]" facs="images/3.179.jpg"/> hoarser; it comes from the
                  cabin where the remains of <persName>Frankenstein</persName> still lie. I must
                  arise and examine. Good night, my sister.</p>
               <p>Great God! what a scene has just taken place! I am yet dizzy with the remembrance
                  of it. I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail it; yet the tale
                  which I have recorded would be incomplete without this final and wonderful
                  catastrophe.</p>
               <p>I entered the cabin, where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable friend.
                  Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to describe; gigantic in stature,
                  yet uncouth and distorted in its proportions. As he hung over the coffin, his face
                  was concealed by long locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in
                  colour and apparent texture like that of a mummy. When he heard the sound of my
                     <pb n="[3.180 - page breaks after 'ap-']" facs="images/3.180.jpg"/> approach,
                  he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror, and sprung towards the
                  window. Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of such loathsome,
                  yet appalling hideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily, and endeavoured to
                  recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer. I called on him to
                  stay.</p>
               <p>He paused, looking on me with wonder; and, again turning towards the lifeless form
                  of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and every feature and gesture
                  seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some uncontrollable passion.</p>
               <p><said>"That is also my victim!"</said> he exclaimed; <said>"in his murder my
                     crimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its close!
                     Oh, <persName>Frankenstein</persName>! generous and self-devoted being! what
                     does it avail that <pb n="[3.181]" facs="images/3.181.jpg"/> I now ask thee to
                     pardon me? I, who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovest.
                     Alas! he is cold, he may not answer me."</said></p>
               <p>His voice seemed suffocated; and my first impulses, which had suggested to me the
                  duty of obeying the dying request of my friend, in destroying his enemy, were now
                  suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion. I approached this tremendous
                  being; I dared not again raise my looks upon his face, there was something so
                  scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. I attempted to speak, but the words died
                  away on my lips. The monster continued to utter wild and incoherent
                  self-reproaches. At length I gathered resolution to address him, in a pause of the
                  tempest of his passion: <said>"Your repentance,"</said> I said, <said>"is now
                     superfluous. If you had listened to the voice of <pb
                        n="[3.182 - page breaks after 'con-']" facs="images/3.182.jpg"/> conscience,
                     and heeded the stings of remorse, before you had urged your diabolical
                     vengeance to this extremity, <persName>Frankenstein</persName> would yet have
                     lived."</said></p>
               <p><said>"And do you dream?"</said> said the dæmon; <said>"do you think that I was
                     then dead to agony and remorse?—He"</said> he continued, pointing to the
                  corpse, <said>"he suffered not more in the consummation of the deed;—oh! not the
                     ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the lingering detail
                     of its execution. A frightful selfishness hurried me on, while my heart was
                     poisoned with remorse. Think ye that the groans of <persName>Clerval</persName>
                     were music to my ears? My heart was fashioned to be susceptible of love and
                     sympathy; and, when wrenched by misery to vice and hatred, it did not endure
                     the violence of the change without torture such as you cannot even
                     imagine."</said></p>
               <pb n="[3.183]" facs="images/3.183.jpg"/>
               <p><said>"After the murder of <persName>Clerval</persName>, I returned to <placeName
                        type="tgn" key="7011731">Switzerland</placeName> heartbroken and overcome. I
                     pitied <persName>Frankenstein</persName>; my pity amounted to horror: I
                     abhorred myself. But when I discovered that he, the author at once of my
                     existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for happiness; that
                     while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me he sought his own
                     enjoyment in feelings and passions from the indulgence of which I was for ever
                     barred, then impotent envy and bitter indignation filled me with an insatiable
                     thirst for vengeance. I recollected my threat, and resolved that it should be
                     accomplished. I knew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture; but I
                     was the slave, not the master of an impulse, which I detested, yet could not
                     disobey. Yet when she died!—nay, then I was not miserable. I had cast <pb
                        n="[3.184]" facs="images/3.184.jpg"/> off all feeling, subdued all anguish
                     to riot in the excess of my despair. Evil thenceforth became my good. Urged
                     thus far, I had no choice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had
                     willingly chosen. The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable
                     passion. And now it is ended; there is my last victim!"</said></p>
               <p>I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called to
                  mind what <persName>Frankenstein</persName> had said of his powers of eloquence
                  and persuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my friend,
                  indignation was re-kindled within me. <said>"Wretch!"</said> I said, <said>"it is
                     well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you have made. You
                     throw a torch into a pile of buildings; and when they are consumed you sit
                     among the ruins, and lament the fall. <pb
                        n="[3.185 - page breaks after 'Hypo-']" facs="images/3.185.jpg"/>
                     Hypocritical fiend! if he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the
                     object, again would he become the prey of your accursed vengeance. It is not
                     pity that you feel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is
                     withdrawn from your power."</said></p>
               <p><said>"Oh, it is not thus—not thus,"</said> interrupted the being; <said>"yet such
                     must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to be the purport of my
                     actions. Yet I seek not a fellow-feeling in my misery. No sympathy may I ever
                     find. When I first sought it, it was the love of virtue, the feelings of
                     happiness and affection with which my whole being overflowed, that I wished to
                     be participated. But now, that virtue has become to me a shadow, and that
                     happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair, in what
                     should I seek for <pb n="[3.186 - page breaks after 'sym-']"
                        facs="images/3.186.jpg"/> sympathy? I am content to suffer alone, while my
                     sufferings shall endure: when I die, I am well satisfied that abhorrence and
                     opprobrium should load my memory. Once my fancy was soothed with dreams of
                     virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once I falsely hoped to meet with beings,
                     who, pardoning my outward form, would love me for the excellent qualities which
                     I was capable of bringing forth. I was nourished with high thoughts of honour
                     and devotion. But now vice has degraded me beneath the meanest animal. No
                     crime, no mischief, no malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine.
                     When I call over the frightful catalogue of my deeds, I cannot believe that I
                     am he whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent visions of
                     the beauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; <pb n="[3.187]"
                        facs="images/3.187.jpg"/> the fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet
                     even that enemy of God and man had friends and associates in his desolation; I
                     am quite alone."</said></p>
               <p><said>"You, who call <persName>Frankenstein</persName> your friend, seem to have a
                     knowledge of my crimes and his misfortunes. But, in the detail which he gave
                     you of them, he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I
                     endured, wasting in impotent passions. For whilst I destroyed his hopes, I did
                     not satisfy my own desires. They were for ever ardent and craving; still I
                     desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned. Was there no injustice in
                     this? Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all human kind sinned against
                     me? Why do you not hate <persName>Felix</persName>, who drove his friend from
                     his door with contumely? Why do you not execrate the rustic who sought to <pb
                        n="[3.188]" facs="images/3.188.jpg"/> destroy the saviour of his child? Nay,
                     these are virtuous and immaculate beings! I, the miserable and the abandoned,
                     am an abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. Even now my
                     blood boils at the recollection of this injustice."</said></p>
               <p><said>"But it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the lovely and the
                     helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept, and grasped to death his
                     throat who never injured me or any other living thing. I have devoted my
                     creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and admiration among
                     men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that irremediable ruin. There he
                     lies, white and cold in death. You hate me; but your abhorrence cannot equal
                     that with which I regard myself. I look on the hands which executed the deed; I
                     think on the <pb n="[3.189]" facs="images/3.189.jpg"/> heart in which the
                     imagination of it was conceived, and long for the moment when they will meet my
                     eyes, when it will haunt my thoughts, no more."</said></p>
               <p><said>"Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief. My work is
                     nearly complete. Neither your's nor any man's death is needed to consummate the
                     series of my being, and accomplish that which must be done; but it requires my
                     own. Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this sacrifice. I shall quit
                     your vessel on the ice-raft which brought me hither, and I shall seek the most
                     northern extremity of the globe; I shall collect my funeral pile, and consume
                     to ashes this miserable frame, that its remains may afford no light to any
                     curious and unhallowed wretch, who would create such another as I have been. I
                     shall <pb n="[3.190]" facs="images/3.190.jpg"/> die. I shall no longer feel the
                     agonies which now consume me, or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet
                     unquenched. He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no more,
                     the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish. I shall no longer see the
                     sun or stars, or feel the winds play on my cheeks. Light, feeling, and sense,
                     will pass away; and in this condition must I find my happiness. Some years ago,
                     when the first images which this world affords first opened upon me, when I
                     felt the cheering warmth of summer, and heard the rustling of the leaves and
                     the chirping of the birds, and these were all to me, I should have wept to die;
                     now it is my only consolation. Polluted by crimes, and torn by the bitterest

                  books as well as published them--capitalized on a new, middle-class reading
                  public. In 1791, the bookseller moved from Chiswell Street to a large
                  purpose-built store in Finsbury Square, dubbed "The Temple of the Muses"--above
                  the entrance, an inscription advertised "The Cheapest Books in the World."
                  Lackington's 1799-1800 catalog, according to the <ref

                  In 1789, the founder's cousin, George Lackington, took over operations, and it was
                  here that Shelley's book was sold. <ref

                  The first run--at 500 copies--was relatively small for such a well-known shop, but
                  the book was popular and sold well; St. Clair notes that the first edition of <hi

                     width="300"/> Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley was born on August 30, 1797, in
                     <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName>, England, to William
                  Godwin and famed feminist writer Mary Wollstonecraft—the author of <hi
                     rend="italic">The Vindication of the Rights of Woman</hi> (1792). Mary had a
                  difficult upbringing, as her mother died shortly after her birth and her father
                  remarried to Mary Jane Clairmont, who had a tenuous relationship with Mary. Mary
                  was never formally educated but read many of her father’s books and was introduced
                  to many influential writers like William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge.
                  Mary, while on a trip to Scotland visiting family friends, met and fell in love
                  with Percy Bysshe Shelley, who was already married and also a student of her
                  father. The two eloped in 1814 and travelled around Europe. It was in Switzerland,
                  with a cohort made up of the Shelleys, Jane Clairmont, Lord Byron, and John
                  Polidori, where Mary first began Frankenstein one rainy afternoon during a ghost
                  story writing exercise.</p>
               <p><hi rend="italic">Frankenstein</hi> was published in 1818 anonymously with a
                  foreword by Percy Shelley, whom many people assumed wrote the novel. The novel was
                  a huge success, and is now often considered the first science fiction novel. After
                  the success of her first novel, Shelley continued to write but her personal life
                  declined rapidly. She lost three children in her lifetime, her half-sister
                  committed suicide, and her marriage, riddled with affairs, ended in 1822 when
                  Percy Shelley drowned in the Gulf of Spezia. Mary died at 53 of brain cancer on
                  February 1, 1851 in <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName>,
                  England. She was buried at St. Peter's Church in Bournemouth, laid to rest with
                  the cremated remains of her late husband's heart. The portrait of Shelley included
                  above, painted by Richard Rothwell (1840), is housed in the National Portrait

                  William Godwin was an anarchist and supporter of the French Revolution, and many
                  of his theories of absolute sovereignty are alluded to within the text of
                  Frankenstein. Shelley learned much from her father’s library growing up, and thus
                  was highly influenced by her father’s beliefs. To learn more about Godwin, read

                  murder. When Falkland realizes that Caleb suspects him, he falsely accuses Caleb

                  Written after the French Revolution, a ten-year period of political upheaval in
                  France culminating in the overthrow of the monarchy and the creation of a

                  Paine’s <hi rend="italic">Rights of Man</hi>--specifically, on questions of
                  authority. Godwin wrote the <hi rend="italic">Enquiry</hi> to advocate for the
                  Enlightenment project of social improvement. His radical writing resonated deeply
                  with Romantic authors, especially Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Percy Bysshe

            <note xml:id="enthusiasm" type="editorial" resp="TH"><p>Enthusiasm is an important
                  concept in the development of Romanticism. Deriving from the Greek word "enthous,"
                  meannig possessed or inspired by a god, the concept of enthusiasm was linked to
                     <ref target="https://books.google.com/books/about/Enlightening_Enthusiasm.html"
                     >religious fanaticism (particularly Methodism)</ref> during the early
                  eighteenth century and described by philosophers like Locke and Hume as an error
                  in thinking that reason and reflection could correct. Enthusiasm was also,
                  however, understood as the ability to "see the truth transparently and
                  spontaneously without mediation" (Mee 8). <ref
                     target="https://books.google.com/books/about/Romanticism_Enthusiasm_and_Regulation.html"

                     Regulation</hi></ref>, goes on to note: "Although it was often associated with
                  the sort of implosion of the self that came from the prophet retiring into the
                  wilderness, a species of melancholia and gloomy introspection, it was also
                  routinely construed in terms of the delirium of the senses that manifested itself
                  in the mania of the crowd" (10-11). Closely related to concepts of imagination and
                  fancy, enthusiasm is a complex term that suggests many of the negative aspects of
                  the Romantic sensibility. For Wordsworth and Coleridge, enthusiasm is a kind of
                  corruption of or detour in the imagination (Mee 12).</p></note>

The luck of the ship  dissipates, and they are becalmed on the ocean. The Mariner watches as each of the sailors  die of thirst, while he alone is saved. This direct allusion highlights the similarities between the Mariner and Frankenstein, who are both reeling after accomplishing their respective goals--killing the albatross and creating a sentient being--and both in the process of telling their stories. The use of the quote is two-fold; it highlights Frankenstein’s isolation and his decision to abandon his creature, but it also juxtaposes the Mariner’s violence with Frankenstein’s act of creation.

The Romantics placed importance in feeling and nature, and Milton epitomized that throughout his poem, showing the the evolution of human consciousness and the building up of the human spirit. The independence and individuality he gives to Satan creates sympathy for a hated stock character, redeeming him in the reader’s eyes. This in turn projects the idea of redemption of the spirit through internal means, removing the need for deliverance through an omnipotent being.

               <p>At the beginning of <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, Milton states that the purpose of the poem is to "justifie the wayes of God to men" (I.26). This idea speaks to Shelley’s themes of free will and theodicy. The story of <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> is felt acutely by Victor Frankenstein and his Creature, and many allusions to it appear throughout the text. An interesting juxtaposition of religious thought to her scientific filled novel, Mary Shelley combines the contemporary understanding of science with an obvious allusion to the religious folly and fall of man.

                     width="300"/> William Shakespeare (1564-1616) is one of the greatest writers in
                  the English language, known for composing 37 plays, 154 sonnets, and two long
                  narrative poems (pictured above is a digital print of Earl of Warwick’s 1623 first
                  folio of William Shakespeare’s works via the Folger Shakespeare Library).
                  Shakespeare’s works, known for his innovative, vivid use of language and his
                  exploration of individual subjectivity, were of special interest to the Romantics.

               <hi rend="italic"><ref target="http://shakespeare.mit.edu/midsummer/full.html">Midsummer Night’s Dream</ref></hi> (1595) is a comedy by William Shakespeare. A play within a play, the story is set in a fairyland Athenian forest during the marriage of Theseus, the Duke of Athens, to Hippolyta, the Queen of the Amazons. The play’s complex subplots involve a variety of complementary stories. The play opens with a love triangle between Hermia, who is in love with Lysander but is being forced to marry Demetrius by her father Egeus. Helena, Hermia’s best friend is in love with Demetrius. On another side of the story are the "Rude Mechanicals," a group of six skilled laborers who are planning a performance of <hi rend="italic">Pyramus and Thisbe</hi>. The last subplot involves the king and queen of the fairies, Oberon and Titania, who are in an argument over a small child Titania is protecting from Oberon. Oberon, in his frustration over Titania’s disobedience, sends his sprite, Robin "Puck" Goodfellow, to create a love potion to shame Titania into obedience. Puck wreaks  havoc on all the characters, causing the men to fall in love with Helena and rebuff Hermia, turning Bottom part donkey, and prompting Titania to fall in love with Bottom. During this confusion, Oberon steals the child from Titania, upon which success he orders Puck to set everything straight. The play concludes with the Mechanicals’ inexpert play-within-a-play, staged for the marriage festivities of Theseus and Hippolyta.

                  Chivalry, in particular, refers to "an idealized code of civilized behaviour that

                  heroism, and the imagination--such stories were revived. For a fuller discussion

                  Humphry Davy describes the "penetrative" agency of the masculine
                  scientist-explorer in virtually identical terms. Davy’s writes, "Not contented
                  with what is found upon the surface of the earth, he has penetrated into her
                  bosom, and has even searched the bottom of the ocean for the purpose of allaying
                  the restlessness of his desires, or of extending and increasing his power." Davy,
                  going on to state that "[h]e [the modern chemist] is to a certain extent the ruler
                  of all the elements around him," emphasizes the almost unlimited power and
                  omnipotent will of the scientist: "he is capable of using not only common matter
                  according to his will and inclinations, but likewise of subjecting to his purposes
                  the ethereal principles of heat and light. By his inventions they are elicited
                  from the atmosphere; and under his control they become, according to
                  circumstances, instruments of comfort and enjoyment, or of terror and destruction"

                  the science of the Ancient Greek physician Galen, but he used direct observation
                  and experimentation--like vivisection--to illustrate and explore his ideas. For

                  falls in love with Charlotte, a woman already promised to his friend, Albert.
                  Despite the agony caused by this love triangle, Werther cultivates a friendship
                  with the couple, until the pain and sorrow of his love overpowers him and he
                  leaves. When Werther returns, he finds the couple now married. He lessens his
                  visits to Charlotte, out of respect for her husband, but ultimately realizes that
                  in order to resolve the love triangle, he must die. He commits suicide, and the
                  novel ends with Charlotte potentially dying of a broken heart. The novel was an
                  amazing hit, creating a wave not only in literary circles but also across fashion
                  and society. As <ref

                  only in creating life but ending life (Victor contemplates suicide and the
                  Creature praises suicide). Finally, Shelley’s novel <hi rend="italic"
                     >Frankenstein</hi> is a book of unrequited love: Frankenstein’s bride is killed
                  on their wedding night, the Creature’s love is ripped apart by Frankenstein, and
                  the Creature never receives or love from another. Ultimately, the Creature most
                  identifies with <hi rend="italic">Sorrows</hi> as he is desperate to feel complete
                  through love. By invoking <hi rend="italic">Sorrows</hi> in conjunction with her
                  Creature, Shelley is both highlighting and criticizing Goethe’s novel for the
                  theme of love triumphing over all. First, Shelley is critiquing <ref

                     thinking</ref> by pointing out that problems cannot always be solved using
                  logic, especially in regards to building a human being as humans are more than a
                  series of automations or mechanical processes—humans are emotional and
                  unpredictable. In the same vein, Shelley is critiquing the idea that love can be
                  engineered to solve problems. Instead, she argues the romantic idea of organically
                  developing love, like that between Safi and Felix, is desirable, unlike the
                  engineered or arranged romances of Frankenstein and Elizabeth (or the Creature’s

In <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://archive.org/stream/orlandofuriosoin01arioiala?ref=ol#page/n5">Orlando Furioso</ref></hi>, the first 10 stanzas of Canto 10 describe the cause of female desirability as resistance and flight, using in stanza 7 a classical hunting metaphor to do so:  "So the keen hunter follows up the hare / In heat and cold, on shore, or mountain-height; / Nor, when 'tis taken, more esteems the prize; / And only hurries after that which flies" (10.7.5-8).

In Experiment 41, Boyle placed birds, mice, and other small creatures into the air pump and slowly removed the air to prove the necessity of respiration. While watching a lark in one reiteration of the experiment, he observed: "…the Bird for a while appear'd lively enough; but upon a greater Exsuction of the Air, she began manifestly to droop and appear sick, and very soon after was taken with as violent and irregular Convulsions, as are wont to be observ'd in Poultry, when their heads are wrung off: For the Bird threw her self over and over two or three times, and dyed with her Breast upward, her Head downwards, and her Neck awry" (cite page 98).

               This is a direct allusion to experiments performed by Benjamin Franklin and other scientists during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Ben Franklin was a contemporary of Mary Shelley’s parents, and he influenced the world of politics, culture, and science. Well-known inventing  bifocals, Franklin is also associated in the popular imagination with his electrical experiments involving keys, storms, and kites. Contrary to popular belief, Franklin did not discover electricity, but he connected electrical conduits through substances like water and metal, and he understood that electricity can be held and discharged. Read more about his electrical experiment at  <ref target="https://www.fi.edu/benjamin-franklin/kite-key-experiment">The Franklin Institute</ref>. Franklin’s experiments with electricity were the precursor to Galvani’s and Volta’s experiments with electricity and galvanism. These two scientists sought to prove that electricity could animate deceased matter, namely frogs, but went so far as to momentarily animate the bodies of beheaded criminals. To learn  more about these experiments, read Alan Brown’s "<ref target="https://www.insidescience.org/news/science-made-frankenstein">The Science That Made Frankenstein</ref>." This is not the first time electrical experiments had been referenced in literature;  Erasmus Darwin, whose works are alluded to in <hi rend="italic">Frankenstein</hi> often referenced Franklin, in his <hi rend="italic">Economy of Vegetation</hi>. Darwin describes Franklin as taming lightning through his invention of the lightning rod, for instance: <ref target="https://books.google.com/books?id=j7hEAAAAYAAJ">"-Led by the phosphor-light, with daring tread/ Immortal Franklin sought the fiery bed;/ Where, nursed in night, incumbent Tempest shrouds/ His embryon Thunders in circumfluent clouds" (Canto 2.2 355-358).</ref> To explore more about Darwin, see Stephen Foster’s addition to <ref target="http://www.victorianweb.org/science/edarwin/poetry.html">the Victorian Web</ref>; to learn more about the science of <hi rend="italic">Frankenstein</hi>, see Sharon Ruskin’s <ref target="https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/the-science-of-life-and-death-in-mary-shelleys-frankenstein">article from the British Library</ref>.

            <note xml:id="1818" type="editorial" resp="AF"><p>The first edition of <hi rend="italic">Frankenstein</hi> was written while Mary Shelley was in the prime of her life, but it was published in January of 1818, shortly after she buried her first child. The second edition, published in 1831, came after the loss of her husband, most of her children, and her family. There are many differences between the two texts, which <ref target="http://juxtacommons.org/shares/Nme50n">can be viewed</ref> in Dana Wheeles’ public Juxta collation. One of the main structural differences between the texts is the loss of the three volumes found in the 1818 edition. In the 1831 edition, after the first four letters, the chapters are numbered 1-24, which not only removes the multiple volumes but also obscures the separated narratives of Victor, the Creature, and Walton. Another noticeable difference comes from the removal of the epigraph from Milton’s <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, which, in the beginning of the 1818 edition, announces the key theme of the novel. Its removal from the 1831 edition obscures the importance of the allusions to Milton’s work throughout the novel. In the <ref target="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/frankenstein/1831v1/intro">newly-added forward to the 1831 edition</ref>, Mary Shelley wrote, somewhat disingenuously, "I have changed no portion of the story, nor introduced any new ideas or circumstances." Shelley in fact makes many changes that drastically change the interpretation and meaning of the text. </p>
               <p>First, many of the scientific ideas written about in the 1818 edition are removed, detaching the novel from an intellectual context and further pressing it into the fantastical. Shelley also removes many of Elizabeth’s more independent thoughts about women’s rights as well as her indictment of the justice system in regards to Justine. Finally, one of the largest differences between the editions is Victor Frankenstein’s character.

               While the idea of lenses and magnification dates far back in time, the earliest known examples of compound microscopes appeared in Europe around 1620, as explained in David Bardell’s article “<ref target="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4608700">The Invention of the Microscope</ref>."

Hooke held titles such as scientist, astronomer, philosopher, architect and inventor, and was a polymath. In his book, Hooke describes in minute detail the visions of insects, leaves, and other objects, accompanying many of his descriptions with richly detailed illustrations. is work has contributed to cell theories and even helped create the discipline of paleontology.

Franklin writes, “It is impossible to imagine the height to which may be carried in a thousand years, the power of man over matter. We may perhaps learn to deprive large masses of their gravity, and give them absolute levity, for the sake of easy transport." This sentiment is reiterated in both Godwin’s <hi rend="italic">Political Justice</hi> and Humphry Davy’s “<ref target="https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=xAtQAAAAcAAJ">Lectures on Chemistry</ref>." During this time science was thought to be a source of unlimited powers. The idea that science was all powerful forms an important context for Shelley’s <hi rend="Italic">Frankenstein</hi>. Mary Shelley would have been very aware of Franklin’s experiments with electricity. Her mother, Mary Wollstonecraft was tutored Dr. Richard Price (a supporter of the American Revolution) and uses the same publisher as Franklin, Joseph Johnson.

            <note xml:id="lightning" type="editorial" resp="AF"><p>In order to truly explain the Romantic imagery throughout the text, one must have a full understanding of what constitutes Romanticism. Romanticism has little to do with feelings of romance and more to do with a philosophical way of thinking that prioritizes imagination, nature, and the self. Romanticism began in England and Germany (two countries not home to the romance languages begotten from Vulgar Latin), most notably with the poets <ref target="https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/william-wordsworth">William Wordsworth</ref>, <ref target="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-keats">John Keats</ref>, <ref target="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Samuel-Taylor-Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</ref>, and <ref target="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Johann-Wolfgang-von-Goethe">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</ref>. The early Romantic period is one of revolutionary thought heavily influenced with the American and French revolutions. These revolutions are important to note as they changed the political and individual structure and thought of their countries, overthrowing monarchies and creating democracies. The Romantics valued imagination over reason as the imagination was the primary method of creation. Nature, to the Romantics, was a work of art created by the divine imagination, full of symbolism and meaning. Nature plays a central symbolic  role in <hi rend="italic">Frankenstein</hi>. Victor’s mood is often reflected in the nature he observes around him, and once he creates the Creature, he describes  storms and ominous natural elements meant to instill foreboding in the reader. However, nature is also beautiful and could only be created by a higher power, so while it mimics Victor’s interior state of duress, it is also a reminder that something is a more powerful and a better creator than Victor, whose creation is “grotesque" and “malformed." To learn more about Romanticism, read Glen Levin Swiggett’s article <ref target="https://www.jstor.org/stable/27530553">"What is Romanticism?"</ref> or explore the <ref target="https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/themes/romanticism">British Library’s resources on Romanticism</ref>.</p><ptr target="#lightningA"/></note>

The Jura are a range of mountains in the northwest following the France-Switzerland border forming the watersheds for both the Rhone and Rhine basins. These two ranges make up the majority of the natural setting within the novel. Among the peaks named in the novel are Mont Blanc (the highest), Mole, and Mont Saleve. Montanvert is also part of the Alps, but is the eighteenth-century name for Mer de Glace, a glacier on the Mont Blanc massif. <ref target="https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/landscape-and-the-sublime">Romantic artists--including Percy Shelley, Coleridge, J.M.W.

                     >Prometheus</a> (1750 illustration of Prometheus Attacked by an Eagle by
                     René-Michel Slodtz pictured from the Melbourne Museum) is a Greek trickster Titan
                     known as "Forethought". In one myth, Prometheus created man, but in the more
                     common myth, Prometheus protected man by tricking Zeus out of a prize sacrifice of
                     meat and giving it to humans. Zeus then prevented humans from accessing fire,
                     which Prometheus gave to humans by hiding it inside a fennel-stalk. This slight
                     against Zeus caused Zeus the Olympian to punish Prometheus dearly; in one instance
                     he is tied to a rock and his liver is continually eaten and replenished every
                     day.</p>
               <p>While <i>Frankenstein</i> was being published, Percy Shelley, Mary Shelley’s
                  husband, wrote a closet drama about the myth entitled <i>Prometheus Unbound</i>
                  which can be read <a

                     Poetry Foundation</a>. In Shelley’s poem Zeus falls from power, allowing
                  Prometheus to escape his fetters. This poem is a response to <a

                     >Aeschylus’ drama <i>Prometheus Bound</i></a>, one of the first classical

                  Frankenstein--the "modern Prometheus"--is more akin to the Prometheus of
                  Aeschylus’ drama, a creator who finds his creation "wretched." Frankenstein is
                  very different from the Hesiodic understanding of Prometheus, which,<a

                     in <i>Meaning and Being in Myth</i></a>, saw him as a benefactor and caretaker,

                  <hi rend="italic">Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus</hi>, was published by
                  the Lackington firm, founded by James Lackington in 1774. Advertised as "The
                  Cheapest Bookseller in the World," Lackington's business--which both sold and lent
                  books as well as published them--capitalized on a new, middle-class reading
                  public. In 1791, the bookseller moved from Chiswell Street to a large
                  purpose-built store in Finsbury Square, dubbed "The Temple of the Muses"--above
                  the entrance, an inscription advertised "The Cheapest Books in the World."
                  Lackington's 1799-1800 catalog, according to the <a

                     of National Biography</a>, boasted nearly 300,000 volumes available for sale.
                  In 1789, the founder's cousin, George Lackington, took over operations, and it was
                  here that Shelley's book was sold. <a

                  Shelley, Shelley's husband and spand Romantic poet, arranged the initial printing

                  The first run--at 500 copies--was relatively small for such a well-known shop, but

                     width="100%"/> Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley was born on August 30, 1797, in
                     <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName>, England, to William
                  Godwin and famed feminist writer Mary Wollstonecraft—the author of <hi
                     rend="italic">The Vindication of the Rights of Woman</hi> (1792). Mary had a
                  difficult upbringing, as her mother died shortly after her birth and her father
                  remarried to Mary Jane Clairmont, who had a tenuous relationship with Mary. Mary
                  was never formally educated but read many of her father’s books and was introduced
                  to many influential writers like William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge.
                  Mary, while on a trip to Scotland visiting family friends, met and fell in love
                  with Percy Bysshe Shelley, who was already married and also a student of her
                  father. The two eloped in 1814 and travelled around Europe. It was in Switzerland,
                  with a cohort made up of the Shelleys, Jane Clairmont, Lord Byron, and John
                  Polidori, where Mary first began Frankenstein one rainy afternoon during a ghost
                  story writing exercise.</p>
               <p><hi rend="italic">Frankenstein</hi> was published in 1818 anonymously with a
                  foreword by Percy Shelley, whom many people assumed wrote the novel. The novel was
                  a huge success, and is now often considered the first science fiction novel. After
                  the success of her first novel, Shelley continued to write but her personal life
                  declined rapidly. She lost three children in her lifetime, her half-sister
                  committed suicide, and her marriage, riddled with affairs, ended in 1822 when
                  Percy Shelley drowned in the Gulf of Spezia. Mary died at 53 of brain cancer on
                  February 1, 1851 in <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName>,
                  England. She was buried at St. Peter's Church in Bournemouth, laid to rest with
                  the cremated remains of her late husband's heart. The portrait of Shelley included

                  Written after the French Revolution, a ten-year period of political upheaval in
                  France culminating in the overthrow of the monarchy and the creation of a

                  Paine’s <hi rend="italic">Rights of Man</hi>--specifically, on questions of
                  authority. Godwin wrote the <hi rend="italic">Enquiry</hi> to advocate for the
                  Enlightenment project of social improvement. His radical writing resonated deeply
                  with Romantic authors, especially Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Percy Bysshe

            <span id="enthusiasm" type="editorial" resp="TH"><p>Enthusiasm is an important
                  concept in the development of Romanticism. Deriving from the Greek word "enthous,"
                  meannig possessed or inspired by a god, the concept of enthusiasm was linked to
                     <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Enlightening_Enthusiasm.html"
                     >religious fanaticism (particularly Methodism)</a> during the early
                  eighteenth century and described by philosophers like Locke and Hume as an error
                  in thinking that reason and reflection could correct. Enthusiasm was also,
                  however, understood as the ability to "see the truth transparently and
                  spontaneously without mediation" (Mee 8). <a
                     href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Romanticism_Enthusiasm_and_Regulation.html"
                     >Jon Mee, in <hi rend="italic">Romanticism, Enthusiasm, and
                     Regulation</hi></a>, goes on to span: "Although it was often associated with
                  the sort of implosion of the self that came from the prophet retiring into the
                  wilderness, a species of melancholia and gloomy introspection, it was also
                  routinely construed in terms of the delirium of the senses that manifested itself
                  in the mania of the crowd" (10-11). Closely related to concepts of imagination and
                  fancy, enthusiasm is a complex term that suggests many of the negative aspects of
                  the Romantic sensibility. For Wordsworth and Coleridge, enthusiasm is a kind of
                  corruption of or detour in the imagination (Mee 12).</p></span>

                  Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" and her letters make clear. While

               <p>Victor Frankenstein attends the University of Ingolstadt, a university founded in
                  1472, known for its focus on the natural sciences. The university had a massive
                  chemistry laboratory and one of the finest operating theatres at the time
                  Frankenstein was written, making it a perfect setting for his experiments.
                  Ingolstadt is located in Germany, within the Free State of Bavaria. In the
                  eighteenth century, an intellectual movement for the reconstruction of European
                  society was centered in the city, and many pieces of propaganda resulted from this

                  Haimatoff, was written by Percy Shelley’s roommate at Oxford as well as reviewed
                  by Shelley himself, which would have made Mary Shelley aware of the political

                     width="100%"/> William Shakespeare (1564-1616) is one of the greatest writers in
                  the English language, known for composing 37 plays, 154 sonnets, and two long
                  narrative poems (pictured above is a digital print of Earl of Warwick’s 1623 first
                  folio of William Shakespeare’s works via the Folger Shakespeare Library).
                  Shakespeare’s works, known for his innovative, vivid use of language and his
                  exploration of individual subjectivity, were of special interest to the Romantics.

                  veneration of the creative imagination was essential to the Romantic ideology, and
                  Shakespeare became a key sign of natural creative genius. The "bardolatry" that

                     href="http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095608946"
                     >according Oxford Reference</a>, is a genre of literature that began in
                  Medieval Europe and flourished into the 17th century. Chivalric romances, usually
                  written in poetic verse, tell stories of the great deeds of knight-errantry.
                  Chivalry, in particular, refers to "an idealized code of civilized behaviour that
                  combines loyalty, honour, and courtly love." These sorts of stories were often
                  called "romans," from which the word "romance" derives. Formally loose or episodic
                  in structure, heroic romances written in later periods "deliberately eschew[ed]
                  contemporaneity"; their plots featured courtly lovers engaged in "heroic stories
                  of love and war in a remote and idealized past" (1046), as Shellinger states in
                  the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=FPdRAwAAQBAJ"><i>Encyclopedia
                        of the Novel</i></a>. Some representative heroic romances include
                     <i>Euphues</i> by John Lyly, <i>L'Astrée</i> by Honore d'Urfé, <i>Artamène</i>
                  by Madame de Scudéry, <i>Orlando Furioso</i> by Ludovico Ariosto, and <i>Amadís de
                     Gaula</i> by Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo. Romance of this sort declined in
                  popularity during the 18th century, but during the Romantic period--so named by
                  later scholars for its turn toward these very romantic ideals of individualism,
                  heroism, and the imagination--such stories were revived. For a fuller discussion

                  who falls in love with Oriana, the daughter of Lisuarte, the king of England.
                  Amadís is an orphan who was separated from his English parents at birth, but
                  through this hardship becomes a better man. Arthurian in nature, the story is one

                  falls in love with Charlotte, a woman already promised to his friend, Albert.
                  Despite the agony caused by this love triangle, Werther cultivates a friendship
                  with the couple, until the pain and sorrow of his love overpowers him and he
                  leaves. When Werther returns, he finds the couple now married. He lessens his
                  visits to Charlotte, out of respect for her husband, but ultimately realizes that
                  in order to resolve the love triangle, he must die. He commits suicide, and the
                  novel ends with Charlotte potentially dying of a broken heart. The novel was an
                  amazing hit, creating a wave not only in literary circles but also across fashion

                  and using similar pistols. Some even had the copies of the novel beside their

                  only in creating life but ending life (Victor contemplates suicide and the
                  Creature praises suicide). Finally, Shelley’s novel <hi rend="italic"
                     >Frankenstein</hi> is a book of unrequited love: Frankenstein’s bride is killed
                  on their wedding night, the Creature’s love is ripped apart by Frankenstein, and
                  the Creature never receives or love from another. Ultimately, the Creature most
                  identifies with <hi rend="italic">Sorrows</hi> as he is desperate to feel complete
                  through love. By invoking <hi rend="italic">Sorrows</hi> in conjunction with her
                  Creature, Shelley is both highlighting and criticizing Goethe’s novel for the
                  theme of love triumphing over all. First, Shelley is critiquing <a
                     href="https://www.history.com/topics/enlightenment">Enlightenment
                     thinking</a> by pointing out that problems cannot always be solved using
                  logic, especially in regards to building a human being as humans are more than a
                  series of automations or mechanical processes—humans are emotional and
                  unpredictable. In the same vein, Shelley is critiquing the idea that love can be
                  engineered to solve problems. Instead, she argues the romantic idea of organically
                  developing love, like that between Safi and Felix, is desirable, unlike the
                  engineered or arranged romances of Frankenstein and Elizabeth (or the Creature’s

                  theological and philosophical knowledge during his time. His influence on natural
                  science is most important as he brought Aristotelian knowledge of nature to the

                  composed in approximately the 9th century BCE, is an epic poem in elevated and
                  formal verse, narrating the events that occurred in the ninth year of the attack
                  on Troy. The story begins with Agamemnon, the <hi rend="italic"><lang id="grc"

                  Achaean kingdoms, insulting Achilles. Turmoil ensues among the Achaeans, who have
                  been laying siege to the City of Troy for nearly ten years. The story includes the
                  death of Achilles’ closest friend Patroclus, which causes Achilles to defeat and
                  defile his murderer, Hector, Prince of Troy. The story concludes with Achilles
                  surrendering Hector’s body to King Priam, father of Hector, and his recognition of
                  a kinship between them through grief. See MIT’s <a

                  person called "Homer," the idea of such authorship has had an enduring
                  interpretive effect from ancient times to the present. Known as the "Father of
                  Western Literature," Homer is credited with a number of hymns and lesser works in
                  addition to <hi rend="italic">The Iliad</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The
                     Odyssey</hi>. If such an individual existed, scholars have suggested his
