              <l>MY goodly cloathing, and my beauteous skin,</l>
              <l>Declare some greater riches are within;</l>
              <l>But what is best i'le first present to view,</l> 
              <l>And then the worst, in a more ugly hue;</l> 
              <l>For thus to do, we on this Stage assemble,</l> 
              <l>Then let not him, which hath most craft dissemble;</l> 
              <l>Mine education, and my learning's such,</l> 
              <l>As might my self, and others, profit much:</l>
              <l>With nurture trained up in vertues Schools,</l> 
              <l>Of Science, Arts, and Tongues, I know the rules,</l> 
              <l>The manners of the Court, I likewise know,</l> 
              <l>Nor ignorant what they in Country do;</l> 
              <l>The brave attempts of valiant Knights I prize,</l>

              <l>The snorting Horse, the Trumpet, Drum I like,</l> 
              <l>The glistring Sword, and wel advanced Pike;</l>
              <l>I cannot lye in trench, before a Town,</l> 
              <l>Nor wait til good advice our hopes do crown;</l> 
              <l>I scorn the heavy Corsset, Musket-proof,</l>
              <l>Though thus in field, at home, to all most kind,</l> 
              <l>So affable that I do suit each mind;></l>
              <l>I can insinuate into the brest,</l>

              <l>And elevates my thoughts above the Pole.</l> 
              <l>My wit, my bounty, and my courtesie,</l>
              <l>Makes all to place their future hopes on me.</l>
              <l>This is my best, but youth (is known) alas,</l>
              <l>To be as wilde as is the snuffing Asse,</l>
              <l>As vain as froth, as vanity can be,</l> 
              <l>That who would see vain man, may look on me:</l>
              <l>My gifts abus'd, my education lost,</l> 
              <l>My woful Parents longing hopes all crost,</l>
              <l>My wit, evaporates in meriment:></l> 
              <l>My valour, in some beastly quarrel's spent;</l>
              <l>Martial deeds I love not, 'cause they're vertuous,</l> 
              <l>But doing so, might seem magnanimous.</l> 
              <l>My Lust doth hurry me, to all that's ill,</l>
              <l>I know no Law, nor reason, but my wil;</l>
              <l>Sometimes lay wait to take a wealthy purse,</l> 
              <l>Or stab the man, in's own defence, that's worse,</l> 
              <l>Sometimes I cheat (unkind) a female Heir, </l>
              <l>Of all at once, who not so wise, as fair, </l>
              <l>Trusteth my loving looks, and glozing tongue, </l>
              <l>Until her freinds, treasure, and honour's gone.</l> 
              <l>Sometimes I sit carousing others health,</l> 
              <l>Until mine own be gone, my wit, and wealth;</l> 
              <l>From pipe to pot, from pot to words, and blows,</l> 
              <l>For he that loveth Wine, wanteth no woes;</l>
              <l>Dayes, nights, with Ruffins, Roarers, Fidlers spend;</l> 
              <l>To all obscenity, my eares I bend.</l>
              <l>All counsel hate, which tends to make me wise,</l> 
              <l>And dearest freinds count for mine enemies;</l> 
              <l>If any care I take, 'tis to be fine,</l> 
              <l>For sure my suit more then my vertues shine;</l> 
              <l>If any time from company I spare,</l>
              <l>'Tis spent in curling, frisling up my hair;</l>
              <l>Some young Adonis I do strive to be,</l>                                               <l><ref target="a002" corresp="n002">Sardana Pallas</ref><note xml:id="n002" target="a002">(DRAFT)When I look this up I just get referenced back to the poem</note>, now survives in me:</l>
