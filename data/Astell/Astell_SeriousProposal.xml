        <p>LADIES,</p>
        <p>SInce the Profitable Ad∣ventures that have gone abroad in the World, Page  2 have met
            with so great Encouragement, tho' the highest advantage they can propose, is an
            uncertain Lot for such matters as O∣pinion (not real worth) gives a value to; things
            which if obtain'd, are as flitting and fickle, as that Chance which is to dis∣pose of
            them. I there∣fore persuade my self, you will not be less kind to a Proposition that
            comes at∣tended with more certain and substantial Gain; whose only design is to improve
            your Charms and heighten your Value, by suffering you no longer to be cheap and
            contemptible. It's aim Page  3 is to fix that Beauty, to make it lasting and per∣manent,
            which Nature with all the helps of Art, cannot secure: And to place it out of the reach
            of Sickness and Old Age, by transferring it from a cor∣ruptible Body to an im∣mortal
            Mind. An oblig∣ing Design, which wou'd procure them inward Beau∣ty, to whom Nature has
            unkindly denied the out∣ward; and not permit those Ladies who have comely Bodies, to
            tarnish their Glo∣ry with deformed Souls. Wou'd have you all be wits, or what is better
            Wise. Raise you above the Vul∣gar Page  4 by something more truely illustrious, than a
            founding Title, or a great Estate. Wou'd excite in you a generous Emulati∣on to excel in
            the best things, and not in such Trifles as every mean per∣son who has but Mony e∣nough,
            may purchase as well as you. Not suffer you to take up with the low thought of
            distinguish∣ing your selves by any thing that is not truly va∣luable; and procure you
            such Ornaments as all the Treasures of the Indies are not able to purchase. Wou'd help
            you to surpass the Men as much in Vertue and In∣genuity, Page  5 as you do in Beau∣ty;
            that you may not on∣ly be as lovely, but as wise as Angels. Exalt and Esta∣blish your
            Fame, more than the b•st wrought Poems, and loudest Panegyricks, by ennobling your Minds
            with such Graces as really deserve it. And instead of the Fu∣stian Complements and
            Ful∣some Flatteries of your Ad∣mirers, obtain for you the Plaudit of Good Men and
            Angels, and the approbati∣on of him who cannot err. In a word, render you the Glory and
            Blessing of the present Age, and the Ad∣miration and Pattern of the next.</p>

        <p>Page  6 And sure, I shall not need many words to persuade you to close with this
            Pro∣posal. The very offer is a sufficient inducement; nor does it need the set-off's of
            Rhetorick to recommend it, were I capable, which yet I am not, of applying them with the
            greatest force. Since you cannot be so unkind to your selves, as to refuse your real
            Interest; I only entreat you to be so wise as to examine wherein it consists; for
            nothing is of worser consequence than to be deceiv'd in a matter of so great concern.
            'Tis as little beneath your Grandeur as your Prudence, to examine Page  7 curiously what
            is in this case offer'd you; and to take care that cheating Hucksters don't impose up∣on
            you with deceitful Ware. This is a matter infinitely more worthy your Debates, than what
            Colours are most agreeable, or whats the Dress becomes you best? Your Glass will not do
            you half so much service as a serious reflection on your own Minds; which will discover
            Irregularities more worthy your Correction, and keep you from being either too much
            elated or depress'd by the representa∣tions of the other. 'Twill not be near so
            advantagious Page  8 to consult with your Dan∣cing-master as with your own Thoughts, how
            you may with greatest exactness tread in the Paths of Ver∣tue, which has certainly the
            most attractive Air, and Wisdom the most grace∣ful and becoming Meen: Let these attend
            you, and your Carriage will be al∣ways well compos'd, and ev'ry thing you do will carry
            its Charm with it. No solicitude in the adorna∣tion of your selves is discom∣mended,
            provided you em∣ploy your care about that which is really your self; and do not neglect
            that par∣ticle of Divinity within Page  9 you, which must survive, and may (if you
            please) be happy and perfect when it's unsuitable and much inferiour Companion is
            mouldring into Dust. Nei∣ther will any pleasure be de∣nied you, who are only de∣sir'd
            not to catch at the Shadow and let the Sub∣stance go. You may be as ambitious as you
            please, so you aspire to the best things; and contend with your Neighbours as much as
            you can, that they may not out∣do you in any commenda∣ble Quality. Let it never be said,
            that they to whom pre∣eminence is so very agree∣able, can be tamely content Page  10
            that others shou'd surpass them in this, and precede them in a better World! Remember, I
            pray you, the famous Women of former Ages, the Orinda's of late, and the more Modern
            D'a∣cier and others, and blush to think how much is now, and will hereafter be said of
            them, when you your selves (as great a Figure as you make) must be buried in si∣lence
            and forgetfulness! Shall your Emulation fail there only, where it is com∣mendable? Why
            are you so preposterously humble, as not to contend for one of the highest Mansions in
            the Court of Heav'n? Be∣lieve Page  11 me Ladies, this is the on∣ly Place worth
            contending for; you are neither better nor worse in your selves for going before, or
            coming after now; but you are really so much the better, by how much the higher your
            station is in an Orb of Glory. How can you be content to be in the world like Tulips in
            a Garden, to make a fine shew and be good for nothing; have all your Glories set in the
            grave, or perhaps much sooner? What your own sentiments are, I know not, but I can∣not
            without pity and re∣sentment reflect, that those Glorious Temples on which Page  12 your
            kind Creator has be∣stow'd such exquisite work∣manship, shou'd enshrine no better than
            Egyptian Deities; be like a garnish'd Sepulchre, which for all it's glittering, has
            nothing with∣in but Emptiness or Putri∣faction! What a pity it is, that whilst your
            Beauty casts a lustre round about, your Souls which are infi∣nitely more bright and
            ra∣diant (of which if you had but a clear Idea, as lovely as it is, and as much as you
            now value it, you wou'd then despise and neglect the mean Case that encloses it) shou'd
            be suffer'd to over∣run with Weeds, lye fallow Page  13 and neglected, unadorn'd with
            any dGrace! Altho the Beauty of the Mind is necessary to secure those Conquests which
            your Eyes have gain'd; and Time that mortal Enemy to hand∣some Faces, has no influ∣ence
            on a lovely Soul, but to better and improve it. For shame, let us abandon that Old, and
            therefore one wou'd think, unfashionable employment of pursuing Butterflies and Trifles!
            No longer drudge on in the dull beaten road of Vanity and Folly, which so many have
            gone, before us; but dare to break the enchanted Circle that custom has Page  14 plac'd
            us in, and scorn the vulgar way of imitating all the Impertinencies of our Neighbours.
            Let us learn to pride our selves in some∣thing more excellent than the invention of a
            Fashion: And not entertain such a degrading thought of our own worth, as to imagin that
            our Souls were given us on∣ly for the service of our Bo∣dies, and that the best
            im∣provement we can make of these, is to attract the eyes of men. We value them too
            much, and our selves too little, if we place any part of our worth in their Opinion; and
            do not think our selves capable of Page  15 Nobler Things than the pi∣tiful Conquest of
            some worthless heart. She who has opportunities of making an interest in Heav'n, of
            ob∣taining the love and admi∣ration of GOD and Angels, is too prodigal of her Time, and
            injurious to her Charms, to throw them away on vain insignificant men. She need not make
            her self so cheap, as to descend to Court their Applauses; for at the greater distance
            she keeps, and the more she is above them, the more effectually she secures their esteem
            and wonder. Be so generous then Ladies, as to do no∣thing unworthy of you; so Page  16
            true to your Interest as not to lessen your Empire, and depreciate your Charms. Let not
            your Thoughts be wholly busied in observing what respect is paid you, but a part of them
            at least, in studying to de∣serve it. And after all, re∣member, that Goodness is the
            truest Greatness, to be wise for your selves, the greatest Wit, and that Beauty the most
            desirable, which will endure to Eter∣nity.</p>

        <p>Pardon me the seeming rudeness of this Proposal, which goes upon a supposi∣tion that
            there is something amiss in you, which it is Page  17 intended to amend. My design is
            not to expose, but to rectify your Failures. To be exempt from mistake, is a priviledge
            few can pre∣tend to, the greatest is to be past Conviction, and too obstinate to reform.
            Even the Men, as exact as they wou'd seem, and as much as they divert themselves with
            our Miscarriages, are very often guilty of great∣er faults; and such as con∣sidering the
            advantages they enjoy, are much more inexcusable. But I will not pretend to correct
            their Errors, who either are or at least think themselves too wise to receive
            Instruc∣tion Page  18 from a Womans Pen. My earnest desire is, that you Ladies, would be
            as perfect and happy as 'tis possible to be in this im∣perfect state; for I love you too
            well to endure a spot upon your Beauties, if I can by any means remove and wipe it off.
            I would have you live up to the dig∣nity of your Nature, and express your thankfulness
            to GOD for the benefits you enjoy by a due improvement of them: As I know ve∣ry many of
            you do, who countenance that Piety which the men decry, and are the brightest Patterns
            of Religion that Page  19 the Age affords; 'tis my grief that all the rest of our Sex do
            not imitate such il∣lustrious Patterns, and there∣fore I would have them en∣creas'd and
            render'd more conspicuous, that Vice be∣ing put out of countenance, (because Vertue is
            the only thing in fashion) may sneak out of the world, and it's darkness be dispell'd by
            the confluence of so many shin∣ing Graces. Some perhaps will cry out that I teach you
            false Doctrine; for be∣cause by their seductions, some amongst us are become very mean
            and contempti∣ble, they would fain per∣suade the rest to be as des∣picable Page  20 and
            forlorn as they. We are indeed oblig'd to them for their management, in endeavouring •o
            make us so; who use all 〈◊〉 artifice they can to spoil, •nd deny us the means of
            improve∣ment. So that instead of inquiring why all Women are not wise and good, we have
            reason to wonder that there are any so. Were the men as much neglected, and as little
            care taken to cultivate and improve them, perhaps they wou'd be so far from surpassing
            those whom they now despise, that they themselves wou'd sink into the greatest
            stupi∣dity and brutality. The Page  21 preposterous returns that the most of them make,
            to all the care and pains that is bestow'd on them, ren∣ders this no uncharitable, nor
            improbable Conjecture. One wou'd therefore almost think, that the wise dispo∣ser of all
            things, foreseeing how unjustly Women are denied opportunities of im∣provement from
            without, has therefore by way of com∣pensation endow'd them with greater propensions to
            Vertue, and a natural good∣ness of Temper within, which if duly manag'd, would raise
            them to the most eminent pitch of Heroick Vertue. Hither Ladies, I desire you Page  22
            wou'd aspire, 'tis a noble and becoming Ambition; and to remove such Obsta∣cles as lye
            in your way, is the design of this Paper. We will therefore enquire what it is that
            stops your flight, that keeps you gro∣veling here below, like Do∣mitian catching Flies,
            when you should be busied in ob∣taining Empires?</p>

        <p>Whatever has been said by Men of more Wit than Wisdom, and perhaps of more malice than
            either, that Women are natural∣ly Incapable of acting Pru∣dently, or that they are
            necessarily determined to folly, I must by no means Page  23 grant it; that Hypothesis
            would render my endea∣vours impertinent, for then it would be in vain to ad∣vise the
            one, or endeavour the Reformation of the o∣ther. Besides, there are Examples in all
            Ages, which sufficiently confute the Ig∣norance and Malice of this Assertion.</p>
        <pb n="23"/>
        <p>The Incapacity, if there be any, is acquired not na∣tural; and none of their Follies are
            so necessary, but that they might avoid them if they pleased them∣selves. Some
            disadvantages indeed they labour under, &amp; what these are we shall see by and by, and
            endeavour Page  24 to surmount; but Women need not take up with mean things, since (if
            they are not wanting to themselves) they are capable of the best. Neither God nor Nature
            have excluded them from being Ornaments to their Families, and useful in their
            Generation; there is therefore no reason they should be content to be Cyphers in the
            World, useless at the best, and in a little time a burden and nuisance to all about
            them. And 'tis very great pity that they who are so apt to over-rate themselves in
            smaller matters, shou'd, where it most concerns Page  25 them to know, and stand upon
            their Value, be so insensible of their own worth.</p>
        <pb n="24"/>
        <pb n="25"/>
        <p>The cause therefore of the defects we labour un∣der, is, if not wholly, yet at least in
            the first place, to be ascribed to the mistakes of our Education; which like an Error in
            the first Concoction, spreads its ill Influence thro' all our Lives.</p>
        <p>The Soil is rich and would, if well cultivated, produce a noble Harvest, if then the
            Unskilful Ma∣nagers not only permit, but incourage noxious Weeds, tho' we shall suf∣fer
            by their Neglect, yet Page  26 they ought not in justice to blame any but them∣selves,
            if they reap the Fruit of their own Folly. Women are from their ve∣ry Infancy debar'd
            those Advantages, with the want of which, they are after∣wards reproached, and nur∣sed
            up in those Vices which will hereafter be upbraided to them. So partial are Men as to
            expect Brick where they afford no straw; and so abundantly civil as to take care we
            shou'd make good that obliging Epithet of Ignorant, which out of an excess of good
            Manners, they are pleas'd to bestow on us!</p>
        <pb n="26"/>
        <hi rend="italic">Ignorant,</hi>
        <p>Page  27 One wou'd be apt to think indeed, that Parents shou'd take all possible care of
            their Childrens Educati∣on, not only for their sakes, but even for their own. And tho
            the Son convey the Name to Posterity, yet cer∣tainly a great Part of the Honour of their
            Families de∣pends on their Daughters. 'Tis the kindness of Educa∣tion that binds our
            duty fastest on us: For the be∣ing instrumental to the bringing us into the world, is no
            matter of choice, and therefore the less obliging: But to procure that we may live
            wisely and happi∣ly in it, and be capable of Page  28 endless Joys hereafter, is a
            benefit we can never suffi∣ciently acknowledge. To introduce poor Children in∣to the
            world, and neglect to fence them against the temp∣tations of it, and so leave them
            expos'd to tempo∣ral and eternal Miseries, is a wickedness, for which I want a Name;
            'tis beneath Bruta∣lity, the Beasts are better natur'd, for they take care of their
            off-spring, till they are capable of caring for themselves. And, if Mo∣thers had a due
            regard to their Posterity, how Great soever they are, they wou'd not think themselves
            too Good to perform what Na∣ture Page  29 requires, nor thro' Pride and Delicacy remit
            the poor little one to the care of a Foster Parent. Or, if ne∣cessity inforce them to
            de∣pute another to perform their Duty, they wou'd be as choice at least in the Man∣ners
            and Inclinations, as they are in the complections of their Nurses, least with their Milk
            they transfuse their Vices, and form in the Child such evil habits as will not easily be
            eradicated.</p>

        <p>Nature as bad as it is, and as much as it is complain'd of, is so far improveable by the
            grace of GOD, upon our honest and hearty endea∣vours, that if we are not Page  30
            wanting to our selves, we may all in some, tho not in an equal measure, be instru∣ments
            of his Glory, Bles∣sings to this world, and ca∣pable of eternal Blessedness in that to
            come. But if our Nature is spoil'd, instead of being improv'd at first; if from our
            Infancy, we are nurs'd up in Ignorance and Vanity; are taught to be Proud and Petulent,
            Deli∣cate and Fantastick, Hu∣morous and Inconstant, 'tis not strange that the ill
            ef∣fects of this Conduct ap∣pears in all the future Acti∣ons of our Lives. And see∣ing
            it is Ignorance, either ha∣bitual or actual, which is Page  31 the cause of all sin, how
            are they like to escape this, who are bred up in that? That therefore women are
            unpro∣fitable to most, and a plague and dishonour to some men is not much to be
            regretted on account of the Men, be∣cause 'tis the product of their own folly, in
            denying them the benefits of an inge∣nuous and liberal Educa∣ion, the most effectual
            means to direct them into, and to secure their progress in the ways of Vertue.</p>

        <p>For that Ignorance is the cause of most Feminine Vi∣ces may be instanc'd in that Pride
            and Vanity which is usually imputed to us, and Page  32 which, I suppose, if through∣ly
            sifted, will appear to be some way or other, the rise and Original of all the rest.
            These, tho very bad Weeds, are the product of a good Soil; they are nothing else but
            Generosity degenerated and corrupted. A desire to advance and perfect its Be∣ing, is
            planted by GOD in all Rational Natures, to ex∣cite them hereby to every worthy and
            becoming Acti∣on; for certainly, next to the Grace of GOD, nothing does so powerfully
            restrain people from Evil, and stir them up to Good, as a ge∣nerous Temper. And
            there∣fore to be ambitious of per∣fections Page  33 is no fault; tho to assume the Glory
            of our Ex∣cellencies to our selves, or to Glory in such as we really have not, are. And
            were Womens haughtiness ex∣press'd in disdaining to do a mean and evil thing; wou'd they
            pride themselves in somewhat truly per∣fective of a Rational Nature, there were no hurt
            in it. But then they ought not to be denied the means of ex∣amining and judging what is
            so; they should not be impos'd on with tinsel ware. If by reason of a false Light, or
            undue Medium, they chuse amiss; theirs is the loss, but the Crime is the Page  34
            Deceivers. She who right¦ly understands wherein the perfection of her Na∣ture consists,
            will lay out her Thoughts and In∣dustry in the acquisition of such Perfections. But she
            who is kept ignorant of the matter, will take up with such Objects as first offer
            themselves, and bear any plausible resemblance to what she desires; a shew of advantage
            is sufficient to render them agreeable baits to her, who wants Judgment and skill to
            dis∣cern between reality and pretence. From whence it easily follows, that she who has
            nothing else to Page  35 value her self upon, will be proud of her Beauty, or Money, and
            what that can purchase; and think her self mightily oblig'd to him, who tells her she
            has those Perfections which she natu∣rally longs for. Her imbred self-esteem, and desire
            of good, which are degenera∣ted into Pride, and mista∣ken self-love, will easily o∣pen
            her Ears to whatever goes about to nourish and delight them; and when a cunning
            designing Enemy from without, has drawn over to his Party these Tray∣tors within, he has
            the Poor unhappy Person at his Mer∣cy, who now very glibly Page  36 swallows down his
            Poyson, because 'tis presented in a Golden Cup; and credu∣lously hearkens to the most
            disadvantagious Proposals, because they come attended with a seeming esteem. She whose
            Vanity makes her swallow praises by the whole sale, without examin∣ing whether she
            deserves them, or from what hand they come, will reckon it but gratitude to think well
            of him who values her so much; and think she must needs be merciful to the poor
            dispairing Lover whom her Charms have reduc'd to die at her feet. Love and Honour are
            what every Page  37 one of us naturally esteem; they are excellent things in themselves,
            and very wor∣thy our regard; and by how much the readier we are to embrace what ever
            resem∣bles them, by so much the more dangerous, it is that these venerable Names should
            be wretchedly a∣bus'd, and affixt to their direct contraries, yet this is the Custom of
            the World: And how can she possibly detect the fallacy, who has no better Notion of
            either, but what she derives from Plays and Romances? How can she be furnished with any
            solid Principles whose very Instructors are Froth Page  38 and emptiness? Whereas Women
            were they rightly Educated, had they obtain'd a well inform'd and discern∣ing Mind, they
            would be proof against all these Bat∣teries, see through and scorn those little silly
            Artifices which are us'd to ensnare and deceive them. Such an one would value her self
            only on her Vertue, and consequently be most cha∣ry of what she esteems so much. She
            would know, that not what others say, but what she her self does, is the true
            Commendation, and the only thing that ex∣alts her; the loudest Enco∣miums being not half
            so sa∣tisfactory Page  39 as the calm and secret Plaudit of her own Mind; which moving
            on true Principles of Honour and Vertue, wou'd not fail on a review of it self to
            anti∣cipate that delightful Eulo∣gy she shall one day hear.</p>

        <p>Whence is it but from ig∣norance, from a want of un∣derstanding to compare and judge of
            things, to chuse a right end, to proportion the means to the end, and to rate ev'ry
            thing according to its proper value; that we quit the Substance for the Sha∣dow, Reality
            for Appear∣ance, and embrace those ve∣ry things, which if we un∣derstood, we shou'd hate
            and Page  40 fly, but now are reconcil'd to, merely because they us∣urp the Name, tho
            they have nothing of the Nature of those venerable Objects we desire and seek? Were it
            not for this delusion, is it proba∣ble a Lady who passionately desires to be admir'd,
            shou'd ever consent to such Actions as render her base and con∣temptible? Wou'd she be
            so absurd as to think either to get love, or to keep it, by those methods which
            occasi∣on loathing, and consequent∣ly end in hatred? Wou'd she reckon it a piece of her
            Gran∣deur, or hope to gain esteem by such excesses as really les∣sen her in the eyes of
            all con∣siderate Page  41 and judicious per∣sons? Wou'd she be so silly as to look big,
            and think her self the better person, be∣cause she has more Mony to bestow profusely, or
            the good luck to have a more ingeni∣ous Taylor or Milliner than her Neighbour? Wou'd she
            who by the regard she pays to Wit, seems to make some pretences to it, undervalue her
            Judgment so much as to admit the Scurrility and pro∣fane noisy Nonsense of men, whose
            Fore-heads are better than their Brains to pass un∣der that Character? Wou'd she be so
            weak as to imagine that a few airy Fancies, joyn'd with a great deal of Page  42
            Impudence (the right defi∣nition of modern Wit) can be speak him a Man of sense, who
            runs counter to all the sense and reason that ever appear'd in the world? than which
            nothing can be an Argument of greater shal∣lowness, unless it be to re∣gard and esteem
            him for it. Wou'd a woman, if she tru∣ly understood her self, be af∣fected either with
            the prais∣es or calumnies of those worthless persons, whose Lives are a direct
            contradic∣tion to Reason, a very sink of corruption; by whom one wou'd blush to be
            com∣mended, lest they shou'd be mistaken for Partners or Page  43 Connivers at their
            Crimes? Will she who has a jot of discernment think to satisfy her greedy desire of
            Plea∣sure, with those promising nothings that have again &amp; again deluded her? Or,
            will she to obtain such Bubbles, run the risque of forfeiting Joys, infinitely
            satisfying and eternal? In sum, did not ignorance impose on us, we would never lavish
            out the greatest part of our Time and Care, on the decoration of a Tenement, in which
            our Lease is so very short, and which for all our indust∣ry, may lose it's Beauty e're
            that Lease be out, and in the mean while neglect a Page  44 more glorious and durable
            Mansion! We wou'd never be so curious of the House, and so careless of the Inha∣bitant,
            whose beauty is ca∣pable of great improvement, and will endure for ever without
            diminution or de∣cay!</p>

        <p>Thus Ignorance and a nar∣row Education, lay the Foun∣dation of Vice, and imita∣tion and
            custom rear it up. Custom, that merciless tor∣rent that carries all before. And which
            indeed can be stem'd by none but such as have a great deal of Pru∣dence and a rooted
            Vertue. For 'tis but Decorous that she who is not capable of Page  45 giving better
            Rules, shou'd follow those she sees before her, lest she only change the instance, and
            retain the ab∣surdity. 'T wou'd puzzle a considerate Person to ac∣count for all that Sin
            and Folly that is in the World, (whcih certainly has no∣thing in it self to recommend
            it,) did not custom help to solve the difficulty. For Vertue without question has on all
            accounts the pre∣eminence of Vice 'tis abun∣dantly more pleasant in the Act, as well as
            more advan∣tagious in the consequences, as any one who will but right∣ly use her reason,
            in a serious reflection on her self, and the Page  46 nature of things, may easily
            perceive. 'Tis custom there∣fore, that Tyrant Custom, which is the grand motive to all
            those irrational choices which we daily see made in the World, so very contrary to our
            present interest and pleasure, as well as to our Future. We think it an un∣pardonable
            mistake, not to do what others do round a∣bout us, and part with our Peace and Pleasure
            as well as our Innocence &amp; Vertue, meerly in complyance with an unreasonable
            Fashion. And having inur'd our selves to Folly, we know not how to quit it; we go on in
            Vice, not because we find satis∣faction Page  47 in it, but because we are unacquainted
            with the Joys of Vertue.</p>

        <p>Add to this the hurry and noise of the world, which does generally so busy and pre-ingage
            us, that we have little time, and less inclina∣tion to stand still and reflect on our
            own Minds. Those impertinent Amusements which have seiz'd us, keep their hold so well,
            and so constantly buz about our Ears, that we cannot attend to the Dictates of our
            Rea∣son, nor to the soft whispers and winning persuasives of the divine Spirit, by whose
            assistance were we dispos'd to make use of it, we might Page  48 shake off these
            Follies, and regain our Freedom. But alas! to complete our mis∣fortunes, by a continual
            ap∣plication to Vanity and Fol∣ly, we quite spoil the con∣texture and frame of our
            Minds; so loosen and dissi∣pate, that nothing solid and substantial will stay in it. By
            an habitual inadvertency we render our selves incapable of any serious &amp; improving
            thought, till our minds themselves become as light and frothy as those things they are
            conversant about. To all which, if we further add the great industry that bad people use
            to corrupt the good, and that unaccoun∣table Page  49 backwardness that ap∣pears in too
            many good per∣sons, to stand up for, and propagate the Piety they profess; (so strangely
            are things transposed, that Ver∣tue puts on the blushes, which belong to Vice, and Vice
            insults with the autho∣rity of Vertue!) and we have a pretty fair account of the Causes
            of our non-im∣provement.</p>

        <p>When a poor Young La∣dy is taught to value her self on nothing but her Cloaths, and to
            think she's very fine when well accou∣tred. When she hears say, that 'tis Wisdom enough
            for her to know how to dress Page  50 her self, that she may be∣come amiable in his
            eyes, to whom it appertains to be knowing and learned; who can blame her if she lay out
            her Industry and Money on such Accomplishments, and sometimes extends it farther than
            her misinformer desires she should? When she sees the vain and the gay, ma∣king Parade
            in the World, and attended with the Courtship and admiration of all about them, no
            won∣der that her tender Eyes are dazled with the Pageantry; and wanting Judgment to pass
            a due Estimate on them and their Admirers, longs to be such a fine and celebra∣ted Page
             51 thing as they! What tho' she be sometimes told of another World, she has however a
            more lively per∣ception of this, and may well think, that if her In∣structors were in
            earnest, when they tell her of here∣after, they would not be so busied and concerned
            about what happens here. She is, it may be, taught the Prin∣ciples and Duties of
            Religion, but not acquainted with the Reasons and Grounds of them; being told, 'tis
            enough for her to believe, to examin why, and wherefore be∣longs not to her. And
            therefore, though her Piety may be tall and spreading, Page  52 yet because it wants
            founda∣tion and Root, the first rude Temptation overthrows and blasts it; or perhaps the
            short liv'd Gourd decays and withers of its own ac∣cord. But why should she be blamed
            for setting no great value on her Soul, whose noblest Faculty, her Understanding is
            render'd useless to her? Or censur'd for relinquishing a course of Life, whose
            Prerogatives she was never acquainted with, and tho highly reasonable in it self, was
            put upon the em∣bracing it, with as little rea∣son as she now forsakes it? For if her
            Religion it self, be taken up as the Mode of the Page  53 Country, 'tis no strange thing
            that she lays it down again, in conformity to the Fashion. Whereas she whose Reason is
            suffer'd to display it self, to inquire into the grounds and Mo∣tives of Religion, to
            make a disquisition of its Graces, and search out its hidden Beau∣ties; who is a
            Christian out of Choice, not in conformi∣ty to those about her; and cleaves to Piety,
            because 'tis her Wisdom, her Interest, her Joy, not because she has been accustom'd to
            it; she who is not only eminently and unmoveably good, but able to give a Reason why she
            is so; is too firm and stable Page  54 to be mov'd by the pitiful Allurements of sin,
            too wise and too well bottom'd to be undermin'd and supplanted by the strongest Efforts
            of Temptation. Doubtless a truly Christian Life requires a clear Understanding, as well
            as regular Affections, that both together may move the Will to a direct choice of Good,
            and a sted∣fast adherence to it. For tho the heart may be honest, it is but by chance
            that the Will is right, if the Under∣standing be ignorant and Cloudy. And whats the
            rea∣son that we sometimes un∣happily see persons falling off from their Piety, but Page
             55 because 'twas their Affecti∣ons, not their Judgment, that inclin'd them to be
            Re∣ligious? Reason and Truth are firm and immutable, she who bottoms on them is on sure
            ground: Humour and Inclination are sandy Foun∣dations; and she who is sway'd by her
            Affections more than by her Judgment, owes the happiness of her Soul in a great mea∣sure
            to the temper of her Body; her Piety may perhaps blaze higher, but will not last so
            long. For the Affections are various and changeable, mov'd by e∣very Object, and the
            last comer easily undoes whate∣ver Page  56 its Predecessor had done before it. Such
            Persons are always in extreams; they are either violently good, or quite cold and
            indifferent, a perpetual trouble to them∣selves &amp; others, by indecent Raptures, or
            unnecessary Scruples; there is no Beauty and order in their lives, all is rapid and
            unaccounta∣ble; they are now very furious in such a course, but they cannot well tell
            why, &amp; anon as violent in the other extream. Having more Heat than Light, their Zeal
            out runs their knowledge and instead of representing Piety as it is in it self, the most
            lovely and inviting Page  57 thing imaginable, they ex∣pose it to the contempt and
            ridicule of the censorious World. Their Devotion being ricketed, starv'd and contracted
            in some of it's vi∣tal parts, and disproportion∣ed and over grown in less material
            instances; whilst one Duty is over done, to commute for the neglect of another, and the
            mistaken Person thinks the being of∣ten on her knees, attones for all the miscarriages
            of her Conversation: Not consi∣dering that 'tis in vain to Petition for those Graces
            which we take no care to Practice, and a mockery to a∣dore those Perfections we Page  58
            run counter to: and that the true end of all our Pray∣ers and external Observan∣ces, is
            to work our minds in∣to a truly Christian temper, to obtain for us the Empire of our
            Passions, and to reduce all irregular Inclinations, that so we may be as like GOD in
            Purity, Charity, and all his imitable excellen∣cies, as is consistent with the
            imperfection of a Creature.</p>

        <p>And now having discove∣red the Disease and its cause, 'tis proper to apply a Reme∣dy;
            single Medicines are too weak to cure such compli∣cated Distempers, they re∣quire a full
            Dispensatory; and what wou'd a good wo∣man Page  59 refuse to do, could she hope by that
            to advantage the greatest part of the world, and improve her Sex in Knowledge and true
            Re∣ligion? I doubt not Ladies, but that the Age, as bad as it is, affords very many of
            you who will readily em∣brace whatever has a true tendency to the Glory of GOD, and your
            mutual E∣dification, to revive the an∣tient Spirit of Piety in the World, and to
            transmit it to succeeding Generations. I know there are many of you who so ardently love
            GOD, as to think no time too much to spend in his service, nor any thing too difficult
            to do Page  60 for his sake; and bear such a hearty good-will to your Neighbours, as to
            grudge no Prayers or Pains to reclaim and improve them. I have therefore no more to do,
            but to make the Proposal, to prove that it will answer these great and good Ends, and
            then 'twill be easy to obviate the Objections that Persons of more Wit than Vertue may
            happen to raise against it.</p>

        <p>Now as to the Proposal, it is to erect a Monastry, or if you will (to avoid giving
            of∣fence to the scrupulous and injudicious, by names which tho innocent in themselves,
            have been abus'd by super∣stitious Page  61 Practices.) we will call it a Religious
            Retirement, and such as shall have a dou∣ble aspect, being not only a Retreat from the
            World for those who desire that advan∣tage; but likewise, an insti∣tution and previous
            discip∣line, to fit us to do the great∣est good in it; such an insti∣tution as this (if
            I do not mightily deceive my self,) would be the most probable method to amend the
            pre∣sent, and improve the future Age. For here, those who are convinc'd of the
            empti∣ness of earthly Enjoyments, who are sick of the vanity of the world, and its
            imper∣tinencies, may find more Page  62 substantial and satisfyingen∣tertainments, and
            need not be confin'd to what they justly loath. Those who are desirous to know and
            fortify their weak side, first do good to themselves, that hereafter they may be capable
            of do∣ing more good to others; or for their greater security are willing to avoid
            temptation, may get out of that danger which a continual stay in view of the Enemy, and
            the familiarity and unwearied application of the Temptati∣on may expose them to; and
            gain an opportunity to look into themselves, to be ac∣quainted at home, and no longer
            the greatest strangers Page  63 to their own hearts. Such as are willing in a more
            pe∣culiar and undisturb'd man∣ner, to attend the great bu∣siness they came into the
            world about, the service of GOD, and improvement of their own Minds, may find a
            convenient and blissful re∣cess from the noise and hur∣ry of the world. A world so
            cumbersom, so infecti∣ous, that altho' thro' the grace of GOD, and their own strict
            watchfulness, they are kept from sinking down into its corruptions, 'twill however damp
            their flight to heav'n, hinder them from attaining any eminent pitch of Vertue.</p>

        <p>Page  64 You are therefore Ladies, invited into a place, where you shall suffer no other
            con∣finement, but to be kept out of the road of sin: You shall not be depriv'd of your
            grandeur, but only exchange the vain Pomps and Pagean∣try of the world, empty Ti∣tles
            and Forms of State, for the true and solid Greatness of being able to dispise them. You
            will only quit the Chat of insignificant people, for an ingenious Conversation; the
            froth of flashy wit for real wisdom; idle tales for instruc¦tive discourses. The
            deceitful Flatteries of those who un∣der pretence of loving and admiring you, really
            served Page  65 their own base ends, for the seasonable Reproofs and wholsom Counsels of
            your hearty well-wishers and af∣fectionate Friends; which will procure you those
            per∣fections your feigned lovers pretended you had, and kept you from obtaining. No
            uneasy task will be enjoyn'd you, all your labour being only to prepare for the high∣est
            degrees of that Glory, the very lowest of which, is more than at present you are able to
            conceive, and the prospect of it suffici∣ent to out-weigh all the Pains of Religion,
            were there any in it, as really there is none. All that is requir'd of Page  66 you, is
            only to be as happy as possibly you can, and to make sure of a Felicity that will fill
            all the capacities of your Souls! A happiness, which when once you have tasted, you'l be
            fully con∣vinc'd, you cou'd never do too much to obtain it; nor be too solicitous to
            a∣dorn your Souls, with such tempers and dispositions, as will at present make you in
            some measure such holy and Heavenly Creatures, as you one day hope to be in a more
            perfect manner; with∣out which Qualifications you can neither reasonably expect, nor are
            capable of en∣joying the Happiness of the Page  67 Life to come. Happy Re∣treat! which
            will be the in∣troducing you into such a Paradise as your Mother Eve forfeited, where
            you shall feast on Pleasures, that do not, like those of the World, disappoint your
            ex∣pectations, pall your Appe∣tites, and by the disgust they give you, put you on the
            fruitless search after new Delights, which when obtain'd are as empty as the former; but
            such as will make you truly happy now, and prepare you to be per∣fectly so hereafter.
            Here are no Serpents to deceive you, whilst you entertain your selves in these delicious
            Gar∣dens. Page  68 No Provocations are given in this Amicable So∣ciety, but to Love and
            to good Works, which will af∣ford such an entertaining employment, that you'l have as
            little inclination as lei∣sure to pursue those Follies which in the time of your
            ignorance pass'd with you under the name of love; al∣tho' there is not in nature two
            more different things, than true Love, and that bru∣tish Passion which pretends to ape
            it. Here will be no Rivalling but for the love of GOD, no ambition but to procure his
            Favour, to which nothing will more effectually recommend you, Page  69 than a great and
            dear affecti∣on to each other. Envy, that Canker, will not here di∣sturb your Breasts;
            for how can she repine at anothers wel-fare, who reckons it the greatest part of her
            own? No Covetousness will gain admittance in this blest a∣bode, but to amass huge
            Treasures of good Works, and to procure one of the brightest Crowns of Glory. You will
            not be solicitous to encrease your Fortunes, but enlarge your Minds; esteeming no
            Grandeur like being conformable to the meek and humble JESUS. So that you only withdraw
            from the noise and trouble, Page  70 the folly and temptation of the world, that you may
            more peaceably enjoy your selves, and all the innocent Pleasures it is able to afford
            you, and particularly that which is worth all the rest, a noble, Vertuous and
            Disin∣teress'd Friendship. And to compleat all that acme of de∣light which the devout
            Se∣raphic Soul enjoys, when dead to the World, she de∣votes her self entirely to the
            contemplation and fruition of her Beloved; when hav∣ing disengag'd her felf from all
            those Lets which hin∣dred her from without, she moves in a direct and vigo∣rous motion
            towards her Page  71 true and only Good, whom now she embraces and ac∣quiesces in, with
            such an unspeakable pleasure, as is only intelligible to them who have tried and felt
            it, which we can no more de∣scribe to the dark and sensu∣al part of Mankind, than we can
            the beauty of Colours, and harmony of Sounds, to the Blind and Deaf. In fine, the place
            to which you are invited will be a Type and Antipast of Heav'n, where your Employment
            will be as there, to magni∣fy GOD, and to love one a∣nother, and to communicate that
            useful knowledge, which by the due improvement of Page  72 your time in Study and
            Con∣templation you will obtain; and which when obtain'd, will afford you a much sweeter
            and durable delight, than all those pitiful diversi∣ons, those revellings and
            a∣musements, which now thro your ignorance of better, ap∣pear the only grateful and
            relishing Entertainments.</p>

        <p>But because we were not made for our selves, nor can by any means so effectually glorify
            GOD, and do good to our own Souls, as by do∣ing Offices of Charity and Beneficence to

            a contemplative Life, but by a due mixture of both, retain all the advanta∣ges, and

            it the greatest Good, and be a Seminary to stock the Kingdom with pious and prudent
            Ladies; whose good Example it is to be hop'd, will so influence the rest of their Sex,
            that Women may no longer pass for those little Page  74 useless and impertinent

        <p>We have hitherto consi∣der'd our Retirement only in relation to Religion, which is indeed
            its main, I may say, its only design; nor can this be thought too contracting a word,
            since Religion is the adequate business of our lives; and largely consider'd, takes in
            all we have to do; nothing being a fit employment for a rational Creature, which has not
            either a direct or remote tendency to this great and on∣ly end. But because, as we have
            all along observ'd, Reli∣gion never appears in it's true Beauty, but when it is
            ac∣companied Page  75 with Wisdom and Discretion; and that without a good
            Understand∣ing, we can scarce be truly, but never eminently Good; being liable to a
            thousand seductions and mistakes; for even the men themselves, if they have not a
            competent degree of Knowledge, they are carried about with every wind of Doctrine.
            Therefore, one great end of this institu∣tion, shall be to expel that cloud of
            Ignorance, which custom has involv'd us in, to furnish our minds with a stock of solid
            and useful Knowledge, that the Souls of women may no longer be the only unadorn'd and
            neg∣lected things. It is not in∣tended Page  76 that our Religious shou'd waste their
            time, and trouble their heads about such unconcerning matters, as the vogue of the world
            has turn'd up for Learning; the impertinency of which has been excellently expos'd by an
            ingenious Pen, but busy themselves in a * serious enquiry after necessary and perfective
            truths; something which it concerns them to know, and which tends to their real interest
            and perfection, and what that is, the excellent Author just now mention'd, will
            suf∣ficiently inform them, such a course of Study will neither be too troublesome nor
            out of the reach of a Female Virtu∣oso; Page  77 for it is not intended she shou'd spend
            her hours in learning words but things, and therefore no more Languag∣es than are
            necessary to ac∣quaint her with useful Au∣thors Nor need she trouble her self in turning
            over a huge number of Books, but take care to understand and digest a few well-chosen
            and good ones. Let her but ob∣tain right Ideas, and be truly acquainted with the nature
            of those Objects that present themselves to her mind, and then no matter whether or no
            she be able to tell what fanciful people have said a∣bout them: And throughly to
            understand Christianity as profess'd by the Church of Page  78England, will be
            sufficient to confirm her in the truth, tho she have not a Catalogue of those particular
            errors which oppose it. Indeed a Learn∣ed Education of the Women will appear so
            unfashionable, that I began to startle at the singularity of the propositi∣on, but was
            extreamly pleas'd when I found a late ingeni∣ous Author (whose Book I met with since the
            writing of this) agree with me in my Opinion. For speaking of the Repute that Learning
            was in about 150 years ago: It*was so very mo∣dish (says he) that the fair Sex seem'd to
            be∣lieve that Greek and Latin ad∣dedPage  79to their Charms; and Pla∣to and Aristotle
            untranslated, were frequent Ornaments of their Closets. One wou'd think by the effects,
            that it was a pro∣per way of Educating them, since there are no accounts in History of
            so many great Women in any one Age, as are to be found be∣tween the years 15 and
            1600.</p>

        <p>For, since GOD has given Women as well as Men in∣telligent Souls, why should they be
            forbidden to improve them? Since he has not de∣nied us the faculty of Think∣ing, why
            shou'd we not (at least in gratitude to him) em∣ploy our Thoughts on him∣self, their
            noblest Object, and not unworthily bestow them on Trifles and Gaities Page  80 and
            secular Affairs? Being the Soul was created for the contemplation of Truth, as well as
            for the fruition of Good, is it not as cruel and unjust to preclude Women from the
            knowledge of the one, as well as from the en∣joyment of the other? Espe∣cially since the
            Will is blind, and cannot chuse but by the direction of the Understand∣ing; or to speak
            more pro∣perly, since the Soul always Wills according as she Ʋnder∣stands, so that, if
            she Ʋnder∣stands amiss she Wills amiss: And as Exercise enlarges and exalts any Faculty,
            so thro' want of using, it becomes crampt and lessened; if we make little or no use of
            our Page  81 Understandings we shall shortly have none to use; and the more contracted,
            and un∣employ'd the deliberating and directive Power is, the more liable is the elective
            to unworthy and mischievous options. What is it but the want of an ingenious Educa∣tion
            that renders the genera∣lity of Feminine Conversati∣ons so insipid and foolish, and
            their solitude so insupportable? Learning is therefore necessa∣ry to render them more
            agree∣able and useful in company, and to furnish them with be∣coming entertainments when
            alone, that so they may not be driven to those miserable shifts, which too many make use
            of to put off their time, Page  82 that precious Talent that ne∣ver lies on the hands of
            a ju∣dicious Person. And since our Happiness in the next world depends so far on those
            dispositions which we carry along with us out of this, that without a right habitude and
            temper of mind, we are not capable of Felicity; and see∣ing our Beatitude consists in
            the contemplation of the di∣vine Truth and Beauty, as well as in the fruition of his
            Goodness, can Ignorance be a fit preparative for Hea∣ven? Is't likely that she whose
            Understanding has been busied about nothing but froth and trifles, shou'd be capable of
            delighting her self in noble and sublime Page  83 Truths? Let such therefore as deny us
            the improvement of our Intellectuals, either take up his Paradox, who said, That Women
            have no Souls; which at this time a day, when they are allow'd to Brutes, wou'd be as
            un∣philosophical as it is unman∣nerly; or else let them per∣mit us to cultivate and
            im∣prove them. There is a sort of Learning indeed which is worse than the greatest
            Igno∣rance: A woman may study Plays and Romances all her days, &amp; be a great deal
            more knowing, but never a jot the wiser. Such a Knowledge as this serves only to
            instruct and put her forward in the practice of the greatest Fol∣lies; Page  84 yet how
            can they just∣ly blame her, who forbid, or at least, won't afford oppor∣tunity of
            better? A rational mind will be employ'd, it will never be satisfy'd in doing nothing;
            and if you neglect to furnish it with good mate∣rials, 'tis like to take up with such as
            come to hand.</p>

        <p>We pretend not that Wo∣men shou'd teach in the Church, or usurp Authority where it is not
            allow'd them; permit us only to understand our own duty, and not be forc'd to take it
            upon trust from others; to be at least so far learned, as to be able to form in our
            minds a true Idea of Christianity, it being so very necessary to fence us a∣gainst Page
             85 the danger of these last and perilous days, in which Deceivers, a part of whose
            Character is, to lead captive silly Women, need not creep into Houses, since they have
            Au∣thority to proclaim their Er∣rors on the House top. And let us also acquire a true
            Prac∣tical Knowledge, such as will convince us of the absolute necessity of Holy Living,
            as well as of Right Believing, and that no Heresy is more dan∣gerous, than that of an
            un∣godly and wicked Life. And since the French Tongue is un∣derstood by most Ladies,
            me∣thinks they may much better improve it by the study of Philosophy (as I hear the
            French Ladies do,) Des Cartes,Page  86Malebranch, and others, than by reading idle
            Novels and Romances. 'Tis strange we shou'd be so forward to imi∣tate their Fashions and
            Fop∣peries, and have no regard to what is truly imitable in them! And why shall it not
            be thought as genteel, to un∣derstand French Philosophy, as to be accoutred in a French
            Mode? Let therefore the fa∣mous Madam D'acier, &amp;c. and our own incomparable Orin∣da,

            their Offices of Devo∣tion, Employments, Work, &amp;c. is not now necessary. Suffice it
            at present to signi∣fy, that they will be more than ordinarily careful to re∣deem their
            time, spending no more of it on the Body than the necessities of Nature re∣quire, but by
            a judicious choice of their Employment, and a constant industry about it, so improve
            this invaluable Treasure, that it may nei∣ther Page  89 be buried in Idleness, nor
            lavish'd out in unprofitable concerns. For a stated por∣tion of it being daily paid to
            GOD in Prayers and Praises, the rest shall be employ'd in innocent, charitable, and
            use∣ful Business; either in study (in learning themselves, or in∣structing others; for
            it is de∣sign'd that part of their Em∣ployment be the Education of those of their own
            Sex) or else in spiritual and corpo∣ral Works of Mercy, reliev∣ing the Poor, healing the
            Sick, mingling Charity to the Soul with that they express to the Body, instructing the
            Igno∣rant, counselling the Doubt∣ful, comforting the Afflicted, and correcting those
            that err and do amiss.</p>

        <p>Page  90 And as it will be the busi∣ness of their lives, their meat and drink to know and
            do the Will of their heavenly Fa∣ther, so will they pay a strict conformity to all the
            Precepts of their holy Mother the Church, whose sacred Injunc∣tions are too much
            neglect∣ed, even by those who pre∣tend the greatest zeal for her. For, besides the daily
            perfor∣mance of the Publick Offices after the Cathedral manner, in the most affecting
            and ele∣vating way, the celebration of the Holy Eucharist every Lords Day and Holyday,
            and a course of solid instructive Preaching and Catechizing; our Religious, considering
            that the holy JESUS punctu∣ally Page  91 observ'd the innocent usages of the Jewish
            Church; and tho in many instances the reason of the Command ceas'd as to him, yet he
            wou'd obey the letter to avoid giv∣ing offence, and to set us an admirable pattern of
            Obedi∣ence; therefore, tho' it may be thought such pious Souls have little occasion for
            the severities of fasting and mor∣tification; yet, they will consider it as a special
            part of their Duty, carefully to ob∣serve all the Fasts of the Church, viz. Lent, Ember,
            and Rogation-days, Fridays and Vigils; times so little heeded by the most, that one
            wou'd scarce believe them set apart for Religious Purposes, did Page  92 we not find
            them in the an∣tiquated Rubricks. And 〈◊〉 their Devotion will be regu∣lar, so shall it
            likewise be so∣lid and substantial. They will not rest in the mere out-side of Duty, nor
            fancy the per∣formance of their Fasts and Offices will procure them li∣cense to indulge
            a darling Vice. But having long since laid the Ax to the root of sin, and destroy'd the
            whole bo∣dy of it, they will look upon these holy times of recollecti∣on and
            extraordinary Devo∣tion (without which Fasting signifies little) as excellent means to
            keep it down, and to pluck up every the least Fibre that may happen to re∣main in them.
            But we in∣tend Page  93 not by this to impose any intolerable burden on tender
            Constitutions, know∣ing that our Lord has taught us, that Mercy is to be pre∣fer'd
            before Sacrifice; and that Bodily Exercise profit∣eth but a little, the chief bu∣siness
            being to obtain a di∣vine and God-like temper of Mind.</p>

        <p>And as this institution will strictly enjoyn all pious and profitable Employments, so
            does it not only permit but recommend harmless and in∣genious Diversions, Musick
            particularly, and such as may refresh the Body, without e∣nervating the mind. They do a
            disservice to Religion who make it an enemy to in∣nocent Page  95 Nature, and injure the
            Almighty when they repre∣sent him as imposing burdens that are not to be born. Nei∣ther
            GOD nor Wise men will like us the better, for an af∣fected severity and waspish
            sourness. Nature and Grace will never disagree, provided we mistake not the one, nor
            indulge the petulency of the other; there being no Displacencies in Religon, but what we
            our selves have unhappily made. For true Piety is the most sweet and engaging thing
            imaginable, as it is most ob∣liging to others, so most ea∣sie to our selves. 'Tis in
            truth the highest Epicurism, exalting our Pleasures by re∣sining Page  94 them; keeping
            our Appetites in that due regu∣larty which not only Grace, but 〈◊〉 Nature and Reason
            require, in the breach of which, tho' there may be a Transport, there can be no true and
            substantial delight.</p>

        <p>As to Lodging, Habit and Diet, they may be quickly resolv'd on by the Ladies who shall
            subscribe; who I doubt not will make choice of what is most plain and decent, what
            Nature, not Luxury requires. And since neither Meat nor Cloaths commend us unto GOD,
            they'l content themselves with such things as are fit and convenient, without
            occasioning scruple to themselves, or giving any Page  96 trouble or offence to others.
            She who considers to how much better account that Money will turn, which is bestow'd on
            the Poor, then that which is laid out in un∣necessary Expences on her self, needs no
            Admonitions against superfluities: She who truly loves her self, will never waste that
            Money on a decaying Carkass, which if prudently disburs'd, wou'd procure her an eternal
            Man∣sion. She will never think her self so fine, as when the backs of the Poor do bless
            her; and never feast so luxuriously as when she treats an hungry person. No perfume will
            be thought so grateful as the Odour of Good Page  97 Works; nor any Wash so beautifying
            as her own tears. For her Heroic Soul is too great to ambition any Em∣pire but that of
            her own Breast; or to regard any o∣ther Conquest than the res∣cuing poor unhappy-Souls
            from the slavery of Sin and Satan, those only unsuppor∣table Tyrants; and therefore what
            Decays she observes in her Face will be very uncon∣cerning, but she will with greatest
            speed and accuracy rectify the least Spot that may prejudice the beauty of her lovely
            Soul.</p>

        <p>In a word, this happy So∣ciety will be but one Body, whose Soul is love, animating and
            informing it, and perpe∣tually Page  98 breathing forth it self in flames of holy
            desires after GOD, and acts of Benevo∣lence to each other. Envy and Uncharitableness are
            the Vices only of little and nar∣row hearts, and therefore 'tis suppos'd, they will not
            enter here amongst persons whose Dispositions as well as their Births are to be
            Generous. Censure will refine into Friendly Admonition, all Scoffing and offensive
            Railleries will be abo∣minated and banish'd hence; where not only the Words and Actions,
            but even the very Thoughts and Desires of the Religious, tend to pro∣mote the most
            endearing Love, and universal Good- Page  99 will; for tho' there may be particular
            Friendships, they must by no means prejudice the general Amity. Thus these innocent and
            holy Souls shou'd run their Race, mea∣suring their hours by their Devotions, and their
            days by the charitable Works they do. Thus wou'd they live the life of Heaven whilst on
            Earth, and receive an Earn∣est of its Joys in their hearts. And now, what remains for
            them to do at Night, but to review the Actions of the Day? to examine what Pas∣sions
            have been stirring? How their Devotions were perform'd? in what temper their Hearts are?
            what good they have done? and what Page  100 progress made towards Hea∣ven? and with the
            plaudit of a satisfied Conscience sweetly to sleep in peace and safety, Angels pitching
            their Tents round about them, and he that neither slumbers nor sleeps, rejoycing over

        <p>And to the end, that these great designs may be the bet∣ter pursu'd, and effectually
            obtain'd, care shall be taken that our Religious be under the tuition of persons of
            irre∣proachable Lives, of a con∣summate Prudence, sincere Piety, and unaffected
            Gravi∣ty. No Novices in Religi∣on, but such as have spent the greatest part of their
            lives in the study and practice of Page  101 Christianity; who have liv∣ed much,
            whatever the time of their abode in the world has been. Whose under∣standings are clear
            and com∣prehensive, as well as their Passions at command, and Af∣fections regular; and
            their knowledge able to govern their Zeal. Whose scrutiny into their own hearts has been
            so exact, that they fully understand the weaknesses of human Nature, are able to bear
            with its defects, and by the most prudent methods procure its Amendment. Plentifully
            furnish'd with in∣structions for the ignorant, and comfort for the disconso∣late. Who
            know how to quicken the slothful, to a∣waken Page  102 the secure, and to dis∣pel the
            doubts of the Scrupu∣lous. Who are not ignorant when to use the Spur, and when the Rein,
            but duly qua∣lified to minister to all the spiritual wants of their Charge. Watching
            over their Souls with tenderness and prudence; applying fitting Medicines with sweetness
            &amp; affability. Sagacious in dis∣covering the very approach∣es of a fault, wise in
            prevent∣ing, and charitable in bear∣ing with all pityable Infirmi∣ties. The sweetness of
            whose Nature is commensurate to all the rest of their good Qua∣lities, and all conspire
            toge∣ther to make them lov'd and reverenc'd. Who have the Page  103 perfect government
            of them∣selves, and therefore rule ac∣cording to Reason, not Hu∣mour, consulting the
            good of the Society, not their own ar∣bitrary sway. Yet know how to assert their
            Authority when there is just occasion for it, and will not prejudice their Charge, by an
            indiscreet remissness and loosning the Reins of discipline. Yet what occasion will there
            be for ri∣gour, when the design is to represent Vertue in all her Charms and native
            Loveli∣ness, which must needs at∣tract the eyes, and enamour the hearts of all who
            behold her? To joyn the sweetness of Humanity to the strictness of Philosophy, that both
            to∣gether Page  104 being improv'd and heighten'd by grace, may make up an accomplish'd
            Christian; who (if truly so) is certainly the best-bred and best-natur'd person in the
            world, adorn'd with a thou∣sand Charms, most happy in her self, and most agreeable and
            beneficial to all about her. And that every one who comes under this holy Roof, may be
            such an ami∣able, such a charming Crea∣ture, what faults they bring with them shall be
            corrected by sweetness, not severity; by friendly Admonitions, not magisterial Reproofs;
            Piety shall not be roughly impos'd, but wisely insinuated by a perpetual Display of the
            Page  105 Beauties of Religion in an exemplary Conversation, the continual and most
            powerful Sermon of an holy Life. And since Inclination can't be forc'd, (and nothing
            makes people more uneasy than the fettering themselves with un∣necessary Bonds) there
            shall be no Vows or irrevocable Obligations, not so much as the fear of Reproach to keep
            our Ladies here any longer than they desire. No: Ev'ry act of our Religious Votary shall
            be voluntary and free, and no other tye but the Pleasure, the Glory and Ad∣vantage of
            this blessed Re∣tirement, to confine her to it.</p>

        <p>And now, I suppose, you will save me the labour of Page  106 proving, that this
            instituti∣on will very much serve the ends of Piety and Charity; it is methinks
            self-evident, and the very Proposal suffi∣cient proof. But if it will not promote these
            great ends, I shall think my self mightily oblig'd to him that will shew me what will;
            for provided the good of my Neighbour be advanc'd, 'tis very indif∣ferent to me, whether
            it be by my method or by ano∣thers. Here will be no im∣pertinent Visits, no foolish
            Amours, no idle Amusements to distract our Thoughts, and waste our precious time; a very
            little of which is spent in Dressing, that grand de∣vourer, and its concomitants; Page
             107 and no more than necessity requires in sleep and eating; so that here's an huge
            Trea∣sure gain'd, which for ought I know, may purchase an happy Eternity. But we need
            not rest in generals, a curso∣ry view of some particulars will sufficiently demonstrate
            the great usefulness of such a Retirement; which will appear by observing first, a few
            of those inconveniences to which Ladies are expos'd, by living in the world, and in the
            next place the positive advantages of a Retreat.</p>
        <pb n="106"/>

        <p>And first, as to the incon∣veniences of living in the World; no very small one is that
            strong Idea and warm perception it gives us of its Page  108 Vanities; since these are
            e∣ver at hand, constantly thronging about us, they must necessarily push aside all other
            Objects, and the Mind being prepossess'd and gratefully entertain'd with those pleasing
            Perceptions which external Objects occa∣sion, takes up with them as its only Good, is
            not at lei∣sure to taste those delights which arise from a Reflecti∣on on it self, nor
            to receive the Ideas which such a Re∣flection conveys, and conse∣quently forms all its
            Noti∣ons by such Ideas only as sensation has furnish'd it with, being unacquainted with
            those more excellent ones which arisefrom its own Page  109 operations and a serious
            re∣flection on them, and which are necessary to correct the mistakes, and supply the
            de∣fects of the other. From whence arises a very partial knowledge of things, nay,
            almost a perfect ignorance in things of the greatest mo∣ment. For tho we are ac∣quainted
            with the Sound of some certain words, v. g. God, Religion, Pleasure and Pain, Honour and
            Dishonour, and the like; yet having no other Ideas but what are convey'd to us by those
            Trifles we con∣verse with, we frame to our selves strange &amp; awkard noti∣ons of them,
            conformable on∣ly to those Ideas sensation has furnish'd us with, which Page  110
            sometimes grow so strong and fixt, that 'tis scarce pos∣sible to introduce a new Scheme
            of Thoughts, and so to disabuse us, especially whilst these Objects are thick about
            us.</p>

        <p>Thus she who sees her self and others respected in proportion to that Pomp and Bustle
            they make in the world, will form her Idea of Honour accordingly. She who has relish'd
            no Pleasures but such as arise at the pre∣sence of outward Objects, will seek no higher
            than her Sen∣ses for her Gratification. And thus we may account for that strange
            insensibility that appears in some people when you speak to them of any se∣rious Page
             111 religious matter. They are then so dull you'l have much ado to make them
            un∣derstand the clearest Truth: Wheras if you rally the same persons, or chat with them
            of some Mode or Foppery, they'll appear very quick, ex∣pert, and ingenious. I have
            sometimes smil'd to hear Women talk as grave∣ly and concernedly about some trifling
            disappointment from their Milliner or Tay∣lor, as if it had related to the weightiest
            concerns of their Soul, nay, perhaps more seri∣ously than others who wou'd pass for
            Good, do about their eternal Interest; but turn the talk that way, and they grow as
            heavy and cold as Page  112 they were warm and sensi∣ble before. And whence is this, but
            because their heads are full of the one, and quite destitute of such Ideas as might give
            them a competent notion of the other; and therefore to discourse of such matters, is as
            little to the pur∣pose as to make Mathemati∣cal Demonstrations to one who knows not what
            an Angle or Triangle means. (Hence by the way, will ap∣pear the great usefulness of
            judicious Catechizing, which is necessary to stir up clear Idea's in the mind, without
            which it can receive but little benefit from the Dis∣courses of the Pulpit, and per∣haps
            the neglect of the for∣mer Page  113 is the reason that the great plenty of the latter
            has no better effect.) By all which it appears, that if we wou'd not be impos'd on by
            false Reprefentations and Impo∣stures, if we wou'd obtain a due knowledge of the most
            important things, we must remove the little Toys and Vanities of the world from us, or
            our selves from them; enlarge our Ideas, seek out new Fields of Knowledge, whereby to
            rectify our first mistakes.</p>

        <p>From the same Original, viz. the constant flattery of external Objects, arises that
            querulousness and delicacy observable in most Persons of Fortune, and which be∣trays
            Page  114 them to many incon∣veniencies. For besides that, it renders them altogether
            unfit to bear a change, which considering the great uncer∣tainty, the swift vicissitudes
            of worldly things, the Great∣est and most established, ought not to be unprepar'd for;
            besides this, it makes them perpetually uneasy, a∣bates the delight of their
            en∣joyments, for such persons will very rarely find all things to their mind, and then
            some little disorder which others wou'd take no notice of, like an aching Tooth or Toe,
            spoils the re∣lish of their Joys. And tho many great Ladies affect this temper,
            mistaking it for a Page  115 piece of Grandeur, 'tis so far from that, that it gives
            evi∣dence of a poor weak Mind; a very childish Humour, that must be cocker'd and fed
            with Toys and Baubles to still its frowardness; &amp; is like the crazy stomach of a
            sick Person, which no body has reason to be fond of or desire.</p>

        <p>This also disposes them to Inconstancy, (for she who is continually supply'd with
            variety, knows not where to fix,) a Vice which some wo∣men seem to be proud of, and yet
            nothing in the world so reproachsul and degrading, because nothing is a stronger
            evidence of a weak and inju∣dicious mind. For it suppo∣ses us either so ignorant as Page
             116 to make a wrong Choice at first, or else so silly as not to know and stick to it,
            when we have made a right one. It bespeaks an unthinking inconsiderate Mind, one that
            lives at Random, without any design or end; who wanting judgment to discern where to
            fix, or to know when she's well, is ever fluct∣uating and uncertain, undo∣ing to day
            what she had done yesterday, which is the worst Character that can be given of ones
            Understanding.</p>

        <p>A constant Scene of Temp∣tations, and the infection of ill company, is another great
            danger, which conversing in the world exposes to. 'Tis a dangerous thing to have all
            Page  117 the opportunities of sinning in our power, and the danger is increas'd by the
            ill Prece∣dents we daily see of those who take them. Liberty (as some body says) will
            corrupt an Angel. And tho it is in∣deed more glorious to con∣quer than to fly, yet since
            our Vertue is so visibly weakned in other instances, we have no reason to pre∣sume on't
            in this. 'Tis be∣come no easy matter to se∣cure our Innocence in our necessary
            Civilities and daily Conversations; in which, if we have the good luck to a∣void such as
            bring a necessity on us, either of seeming rude to them, or of being really so to GOD
            Almighty, whilst Page  118 we tamely hear him, our best Friend and Benefactor
            af∣fronted, and swallow'd it, at the same time, that we wou'd reckon't a very piti∣ful
            Spirit to hear an Acquain∣tance traduc'd and hold our Tongue; yet, if we avoid this
            Trial, our Charity is however in continual dan∣ger, Censoriousness being grown so
            modish, that we can scarce avoid being active or passive in it; so that she who has not
            her pert jest ready to pass upon others, shall as soon as her back is turn'd, become a
            Jest her self for want of Wit.</p>

        <p>In consequence of all this, we are insensibly betray'd to a great loss of time, a
            Trea∣sure Page  119 whose value we are too often quite ignorant of, till it be lost past
            redemption. And yet, considering the shortness and uncertainty of Life, the great work
            we have to do, and what advantages accrew to us by a due ma∣nagement of our time, we
            cannot reconcile it with pru∣dence to suffer the least mi∣nute to escape us. But
            be∣sides our own lavish Expen∣ces (concerning which one may ask as Solomon does of
            Labour, What Fruit have we of all that Sport and Pastime we have taken under the Sun?)
            So unreasonable is the hum∣our of the World, that those who wou'd reckon it a rude∣ness
            to make so bold with Page  120 our Mony, never scruple to waste, and rob us of this
            in∣finitely more precious Trea∣sure.</p>

        <pb n="120"/>
        <p>In the last place, by reason of this loss of time and the continual hurry we are in, we
            can find no opportunities for thoughtfulness and recol∣lection; we are so busied with
            what passes abroad, that we have no leisure to look at home, nor to rectify the
            dis∣orders there. And such an unthinking mechanical way of living, when like Machins we
            are condemn'd every day to repent the impertinencies of the day before; shortens our
            Views, contracts our Minds, exposes to a thousand practical Errors, and renders Page
             121 Improvement impossible, be∣cause it will not permit us to consider and recollect,
            which is the only means to attain it. So much for the inconveniences of living in the
            World; if we enquire about Retirement, we shall find it does not only remove all these,
            but brings consi∣derable advantages of its own.</p>
        <pb n="121"/>
        <p>For first, it helps us to mate custom, and delivers us from its Tyranny, which is the
            most considerable thing we have to do, it being no∣thing else but the habituating our
            selves to Folly that can reconcile us to it. But how hard is it to quit an old road?
            What courage as well as pru∣dence Page  122 does it require? How clear a Judgment to
            over∣look the Prejudices of Edu∣cation and Example, and to discern what is best, and how
            strong a resolution, notwith∣standing all the Scoffs and Noises of the world to adhere
            to it! For Custom has u∣surpt such an unaccountable Authority, that she who wou'd
            endeavour to put a stop to its Arbitrary Sway, and reduce it to Reason, is in a fair way
            to render her self the Butt for all the Fops in Town to shoot their im∣pertinent
            Censures at. And tho a wise Woman will not value their Censure, yet she cares not to be
            the subject of their Discourse. The only Page  123 way then is to retire from the world,
            as the Israelites did out of Egypt, lest the Sacrifice we must make of its Follies,
            shou'd provoke its Spleen.</p>

        <p>This also puts us out of the road of temptation, and very much redeems our Time, cutting
            off those ex∣travagancies on which so much of it was squandred away before. And
            furnish∣ing us constantly with good employment, secures us from being seduc'd into bad.
            Great are the Benefits of holy Con∣versation which will be here enjoy'd: As Vice is, so
            Ver∣tue may be catching; and to what heights of Piety will not she advance, who is
            plac'd where the sole Bu∣siness Page  124 is to be Good, where there is no pleasure but
            in Religion, no contention but to excel in what is truly commendable; where her Soul is
            not defil'd nor her Zeal provok'd, by the sight or relation of those Villanies the World
            abounds with?</p>
        <pb n="124"/>
        <p>And by that Learning which will be here afforded, and that leisure we have, to enquire
            after it, and to know and reflect on our own minds, we shall rescue our selves out of
            that woful in∣cogitancy we have slipt into, awaken our sleeping Powers, and make use of
            that reason which GOD has given us. We shall then begin to won∣der at our Folly, that
            amongst Page  125 all the pleasures we former∣ly pursued, we never attend∣ed to that
            most noble and de∣licious one which the chase of truth affords us; and bless our selves
            at last, that our eyes are open'd to discern how much more pleasantly we may be
            entertain'd by our own Thoughts, than by all the Diversions which the world affords us.
            By this means we are fitted to re∣ceive the influences of the ho∣ly Spirit, and are put
            in a due frame of Devotion. No doubt but he has often knock'd at the door of our hearts,
            when the croud and noise of our Vanities would not suffer us to regard or hear him; and
            could find no admittance Page  126 when our house was so fill'd with other company. Here
            therefore is the fittest place for his Entertainment, when we are freed from outward
            disturbances, and entirely at leisure to attend so divine a Guest. Our Devotions will be
            perform'd with due attention, those Objects that used to distract being now remov'd from
            us; simplicity of desire will beget simplici∣ty of thought, and that will make our minds
            most intense and elevated, when we come to address our selves to the Throne of Grace.
            Being dead to the things of this world, we shall with greater fervour petition for those
            of another; and living always in a lively Page  127 and awful sense of the divine
            Majesty, our hearts will e∣ver be dispos'd to approach him in the most solemn, seri∣ous
            and reverent manner. 'Tis a very unseemly thing to jump from our Diversions to our
            Prayers; as if when we have been entertaining our selves and others with Vanity, we were
            instantly prepar'd to appear in the sacred presence of GOD. But a Religious Retirement
            and holy Conversation, will procure us a more serious Temper, a graver Spirit, and so
            both make us constantly sit to approach, and likewise stir us up to be more careful in
            our preparations when we do. For besides all other Page  128 improvements of knowledge,
            we shall hereby obtain tru∣er Notions of GOD than we were capable of before, which is of
            very great conse∣quence, since the want of right apprehensions concern∣ing him, is the
            general cause of mistakes in Religion, and Errors in Practice; for as he is the noblest
            Object of our Understanding, so nothing is more necessary or of such con∣sequence to us
            as to busy our thoughts about him. And did we rightly consider his Na∣ture, we shou'd
            neither dare to forget him, nor draw near to him with unclean hands, and unholy
            hearts.</p>

        <p>From this sacred Moun∣tain where the world will Page  129 be plac'd at our feet, at such
            a distance from us, that the steams of its corruptions shall not obscure our eye∣sight;
            we shall have a right prospect of it, and clearly dis∣cern that all its Allurements, all
            those Gaities and Pagean∣tries which at present we ad∣mire so much, are no better than
            insignificant Toys, which have no value but what our perverse Opinion imposes on them.
            Things which contribute so very little to our real Good, that even at present, which is
            their only season, we may live much happier without than with them; and which are so far
            from being necessary to true Felicity, that they Page  130 shall vanish and be no more
            when that is consummate and perfect. Many are the Topic's from whence we might declaim
            against the vanity of the world, but me∣thinks Experience is so con∣vincing, that it
            supersedes all the rest, and wou'd certain∣ly reclaim us from the im∣moderate love of
            earthly en∣joyments, did we but seri∣ously hearken to it. For tell me Ladies, if your
            greatest Pleasures are not attended with a greater sting; when you think to grasp them,
            do they not either vanish into froth, or gall your fingers? To want, or to enjoy them,
            is equally tormenting; the one produces in you the Pain Page  131 of Hunger, the other
            of Loathing. For in reality, there is no good in them, no∣thing but the Shadow and
            Appearance; if there were, you cou'd not so easily loath your old Delights, and be so
            fond of variety, what is tru∣ly desirable never ending in disgust. They are not
            there∣fore Pleasures but Amuse∣ments which you now pur∣sue, and which, through your
            ignorance of better Joys, pre∣tend to fill their place; toll you on with fair pretences,
            and repay your Labour with defeated Hopes. Joys, not near so lasting as the slightest
            toy you wear; the most ca∣pricious Humorist among you is more constant far than Page
             132 they. Come hither there∣fore and take a true view of 'em, that you may no longer
            deceive your selves with that which profits not; but spurning away these empty nothings,
            secure a portion in such a Bliss as will not fail, as cannot disappoint you! A Felicity
            which de∣pending on GOD only and your own Minds, is out of Fortunes reach, will place
            you above the Batteries of the world, above its Terrors and Allurements, and enable you
            at once to triumph over, and despise it. And what can be more glorious, than to have a
            mind unshaken by the blandishments of Prosperity, or the rough shocks of Ad∣versity;
            Page  133 that passes thro both with the same indifferency and integrity, is not to be
            tempted by either to a mean unworthy and indecent Acti∣on?</p>

        <p>Farther yet, besides that holy emulation which a con∣tinual view of the brightest and
            most exemplary Lives will excite in us; we shall have opportunity of contrac∣ting the
            purest and noblest Friendship; a Blessing, the purchase of which were rich∣ly worth all
            the world be∣sides! For she who posses∣ses a worthy Person, has cer∣tainly obtain'd the
            richest Treasure! a Blessing that Monarchs may envy, and she who enjoys is happier than
            Page  134 she who fills a Throne! a Blessing, which next to the love of GOD, is the
            choicest Jewel in our Caelestial Dia∣dem, which, were it duly practic'd, wou'd both fit
            us for heav'n, and bring it down into our hearts whilst we tarry here. For Friendship is
            a Vertue which compre∣hends all the rest; none be∣ing fit for this, who is not a∣dorn'd
            with every other Vertue. Probably one con∣siderable cause of the degene∣racy of the
            present Age, is the little true Friendship that is to be found in it; or per∣haps you
            will rather say, that this is the effect of our cor∣ruption. The cause and the effect
            are indeed reciprocal; Page  135 for were the world better, there wou'd be more
            Friend∣ship, and were there more Friendship we shou'd have a better world. But because
            Iniquity abounds, therefore the love of many is not only wax∣en cold, but quite benum'd
            and perish'd. But if we have such narrow hearts, be so full of mistaken Self-love, so
            unreasonably fond of our selves, that we cannot spare a hearty Good-will to one or two
            choice Persons, how can it ever be thought, that we shou'd well acquit our selves of
            that Charity which is due to all mankind? For Friend∣ship is nothing else but Cha∣rity
            contracted; it is (in the words of an admired Au∣thor) Page  136 a kind of revenging our
            selves on the narrowness of our Faculties, by exemply∣fying that extraordinary cha∣rity
            on one or two, which we are willing, but not able to exercise towards all. And therefore
            'tis without doubt, the best Instructor to teach us our duty to our Neigh∣bour, and a
            most excellent Monitor to excite us to make payment as far as our pow∣er will reach. It
            has a spe∣cial force to dilate our hearts, to deliver them from that vi∣cious
            selfishness and the rest of those sordid passions, which express a narrow illiberal
            temper, and are of such per∣nitious consequence to man∣kind. That institution
            there∣fore, Page  137 must needs be highly beneficial, which both dispo∣ses us to be
            friends our selves, and helps to find them. But by Friendship I do not mean any thing
            like those intima∣cies that are about in the world, which are often com∣binations in
            evil, and at best but insignificant dearnesses; as little resembling true Friendship, as
            Modern Practice does Primitive Christianity. But I in∣tend by it the greatest
            usefulness, the most refin'd and disinteress'd Benevolence, a love that thinks nothing
            within the bounds of Power and Duty, too much to do or suffer for its Beloved: And makes
            no distinction Page  138 betwixt its Friend and its self, except that in Tempo∣rals it
            prefers her interest. But tho it be very desirable to obtain such a Treasure, such a
            Medicine of Life, (as the wise man speaks) yet the danger is great, least being deceiv'd
            in our choice, we suck in Poyson where we expected Health. And con∣sidering how apt we
            are to disguise our selves, how hard it is to know our own hearts, much less anothers,
            it is not advisable to be too hasty in contracting so important a Relation; before that
            be done, it were well if we could look into the very Soul of the beloved Person, to
            discover what resemblance Page  139 it bears to our own, and in this Society we shall
            have the best opportunities of do∣ing so. There are no inte∣rests here to serve, no
            contri∣vances for another to be a stale to; the Souls of all the Religious will be open
            and free, and those particular Friendships must be no pre∣judice to the general Amity.
            But yet, as in Heav'n, that region of perfect Love, the happy Souls (as some are of
            opinion) now and then step aside from more general Con∣versations, to entertain
            them∣selves with a peculiar friend; so, in this little emblem of this blessed place,
            what shoud hinder, but that two Persons of a sympathizing dispositi∣on Page  140 the
            make and frame of whose Souls bears an exact conformity to each other, and therefore one
            wou'd think, were purposely design'd by Heaven to unite and mix; what shou'd hinder them
            from entring into an holy combination to watch over each other for Good, to ad∣vise,
            encourage and direct, and to observe the minutest fault in order to its amend∣ment. The
            truest effect of love being to endeavour the bettering the beloved Person. And therefore
            nothing is more likely to improve us in Vertue, and advance us to the very highest pitch
            of Goodness, than unfeigned Friendship, which is the most Page  141 beneficial, as well
            as the most pleasant thing in the world.</p>

        <p>But to hasten; such an in∣stitution will much confirm us in Vertue, and help us to
            persevere to the end, and by that substantial Piety and so∣lid Knowledge, we shall here
            acquire, fit us to propagate it when we return into the World. An habitual Prac∣tice of
            Piety for some years will so root and establish us in it, that Religion will be∣come a
            second Nature, and we must do strange violences to our selves, if after that we dare
            venture to oppose it. For besides all the other Ad∣vantages that Vertue has o∣ver Vice,
            this will disarm it of Custom, the only thing Page  142 that recommends it, bravely win
            its strongest Fort, and turn its own Cannon against it self. How almost impossi∣ble
            wou'd it be for her to sin, whose Understanding being clearly illuminated with the
            knowledge of the Truth, is too wise to be impos'd on by those false representations that
            sin wou'd deceive it with; whose will has found out and united it self to its true
            Centie; and having been long habitu∣ated to move in a right line, has no temptation to
            decline to an Oblique. Whose affecti∣ons have daily regaled on those delicious Fruits of
            Pa∣radice, which Religion pre∣sents them with, and are therefore too sublime and
            re∣fin'd Page  143 to relish the muddy Pleasures of sensual Delights. It must certainly
            be a Mira∣cle if such an one relinquish her Glory and Joy; she must be as bad as Lucifer
            himself who after such Enjoyments can forsake her Heaven. 'Tis too unreasonable to
            imagine such an Apostacy, the suppo∣sition is monstrous, &amp; there∣fore we may
            conclude will never, or very rarely happen. And then what a blessed world shou'd we
            have, shin∣ing with so many stars of Vertue! Who, not content to be happy themselves,
            for that's a narrowness of mind too much beneath their God∣like temper, would like the
            glorious Lights of Heav'n, or Page  144 rather like him who made them, diffuse their
            benign Influences round about. Ha∣ving gain'd an entrance into Paradise themselves, they
            wou'd both shew the way and invite all others to par∣take of their felicity. Instead of
            that froth and imperti∣nence, that Censure and Prag∣maticalness, with which Fe∣minine
            Conversations so much abound, we should hear their tongues employ'd in making Proselytes
            to hea∣ven, in running down Vice, in establishing Vertue, and proclaiming their Makers
            Glory. 'Twou'd be more genteel to give and take in∣structions about the orna∣ments of
            the Mind, than to Page  145 enquire after the Mode; and a Lecture on the Fashions wou'd
            become as disagreeable as at pre∣sent any serious discourse is. Not the Follies of the
            Town, but the Beauties and the Love of JESUS wou'd be the most polite and de∣licious
            Entertainment. 'Twould be thought as rude and barbarous to send our Visitors away
            unin∣structed, as our foolishness at pre∣sent reckons it to introduce a pertinent and
            useful Conversati∣on. Ladies of Quality wou'd be able to distinguish themselves from
            their Inferiors by the bles∣sings they communicated, and the good they did. For this is
            their grand Prerogative, their distinguishing Character, that they are plac'd in a
            condition which makes that which is every ones chief business, to be their only employ.
            They have nothing to do but to glorify GOD, and to Page  146 benefit their Neighbours,
            and she who does not thus improve her Talent, is more vile and des∣picable than the
            meanest Crea∣ture about her.</p>

        <p>And tho at first I propos'd to my self to speak nothing in par∣ticular of the employment
            of the Religious, yet to give a Specimen how useful they will be to the World, I am now
            inclin'd to de∣clare, that it is design'd a part of their business shall be to give the
            best Education to the Children of Persons of Quality, who shall be attended and
            instructed in lesser matters by meaner persons deputed to that Office, but the forming
            of their minds shall be the particular care of those of Page  148 their own Rank; who
            cannot have a more pleasant and useful employment than to exercise and encrease their
            own knowledge, by instilling it into these young ones, who are most like to profit under
            such Tutors. For how can their little Pupils forbear to cre∣dit them, since they do not
            decry the World (as others may be thought to do) because they cou'd not enjoy it; but
            when they had it in their power, were courted and caress'd by it, for very good Reasons,
            and on mature delibe∣ration, thought fit to relinquish and despise its offers for a
            better choice? Nor are mercenary peo∣ple on other accounts capable of doing so much good
            to young Persons, because, having often but short views of things them∣selves, sordid
            and low Spirits, they are not like to form a gene∣rous temper in the minds of the Page
             149 Educated. Doubtless 'twas well consider'd of him, who wou'd not trust the breeding
            of his Son to a Slave, because nothing great or excellent could be expected from a
            person of that condition.</p>
        <pb n="148"/>
        <pb n="149"/>
        <p>And when by the increase of their Revenue, the Religious are enabled to do such a work of
            Charity, the Education they de∣sign to bestow on the Daughters of Gentlemen who are
            fallen in∣to decay, will be no inconsidera∣ble advantage to the Nation. For hereby many
            Souls will be preserv'd from great Dishonours, and put in a comfortable way of
            subsisting, being either receiv'd into the House, if they incline to it, or otherwise
            dispos'd of. It being suppos'd that prudent men will reckon the endowments they here
            acquire a sufficient Dowry; and that a disereet and vertuous Gentlewoman will make a
            better Page  150 Wife than she whose mind is empty, tho her Purse be full.</p>
        <hi rend="italic">Dowry;</hi>

        <p>But some will say, May not peo∣ple be good without this confine∣ment? may they not live
            at large in the world, and yet serve GOD as acceptably as here? 'tis allow'd they may;
            truly wise and vertu∣ous Souls will do it by the assist∣ance of GODS Grace, in despite
            of all temptations; and I hearti∣ly wish, that all Women were of this temper. But it is
            to be con∣sider'd, that there are tender Ver∣tues, who need to be screened from the ill
            Airs of the world: Many persons who had begun well might have gone to the Grave in peace
            and innocence, had it not been their misfortune to be vio∣lently tempted. For those who
            have honest Hearts have not al∣ways the strongest Heads; and sometimes the enticements
            of the world, and the subtil insinuations Page  151 of such as lye in wait to deceive,
            may make their Heads giddy, stagger their Resolutions, and o∣verthrow all the fine hopes
            of a promising beginning. 'Tis fit therefore, such tender Cyons shou'd be transplanted,
            that they may be supported by the prop of Vertuous Friendship, and con∣firm'd in
            Goodness by holy Ex∣amples, which alas! they will not often meet with in the world. And,
            such is the weakness of hu∣man Nature, that bad people are not so apt to be better'd by
            the Society of the Good, as the Good are to be corrupted by theirs. Since therefore we
            daily pray a∣gainst temptation, it cannot be amiss if we take all prudent care to avoid
            it, and not out of a vain presumption face the danger, which GOD may justly permit to
            overcome us for a due correc∣tion of our Pride. It is not im∣possible Page  152 for a
            man to live in an infected House or Town, and es∣cape with Life and Health; yet if he
            have a place in the Country to retire to, he will not make slight of that advantage; and
            surely the Health of our Souls is of greater consideration than the health of our
            Bodies. Besides, she has need of an establish'd Ver∣tue and consummated Prudence, who so
            well understands the great end she was sent into the world about, and so faithfully
            pursues it, that not content to be wise and good her self alone, she en∣deavours to
            propagate Wisdom and Piety to all about her. But neither this Prudence nor heroic
            Goodness are easily attainable a∣midst the noise and hurry of the world, we must
            therefore retire a while from its clamour and im∣portunity, if we generously de∣sign to
            do it good; and having Page  153 calmly and sedately observ'd and rectify'd what is
            amiss in our selves, we shall be fitter to pro∣mote a Reformation in others. A devout
            Retirement will not only strengthen and confirm our Souls, that they be not insected by
            the worlds Corruptions, but likewise so purity and resite them, that they will become
            An∣tidotes to expel the Poyson in o∣thers, and spread a salutary Air round about
            them.</p>

        <p>If any object against a Learn∣ed Education, that it will make Women vain and assuming,
            and instead of correcting, encrease their Pride: I grant, that a smat∣tering in Learning
            may; for it has this effect on the Men, none so Dogmatical, and so forward to shew their
            Parts as your little Pretenders to Science. But I wou'd not have the Ladies con∣tent
            themselves with the shew, my Page  154 desire is, that they shou'd not rest till they
            obtain the Substance. And then she who is most know∣ing, will be forward to own with the
            wise Socrates, that she knows nothing: nothing that is matter of Pride and Ostentation;
            no∣thing but what is attended with so much ignorance and imperfec∣tion, that it cannot
            reasonably elate and puff her up. The more she knows, she will be the less subject to
            talkativeness and its sister Vices, because she discerns, that the most difficult piece
            of Learning is, to know when to use and when to hold ones Tongue, and never to speak but
            to the purpose.</p>

        <p>But the men if they rightly understand their own interest, have no reason to oppose the
            in∣genious Education of the Wo∣men, since 'twou'd go a great way towards reclaming the
            men; great Page  155 is the influence we have over them in their Childhood, in which
            time, if a Mother be discreet and knowing as well as devout, she has many opportunities
            of giving such a Form and Season to the ten∣der Mind of the Child, as will shew its good
            effects thro' all the stages of his Life. But tho' you should not allow her capable of
            doing good, 'tis certain, she may do hurt: If she do not make the Child, she has power
            to marr him, by suffering her fondness to get the better of discreet affection. But
            besides this, a good and pru∣dent Wife, wou'd wonderfully work on an ill man; he must be
            a Brute indeed, who cou'd hold out against all those innocent Arts, those gentle
            persuasives, and obliging methods she wou'd use to reclaim him. Piety is of∣ten
            offensive, when it is accom∣panied with indiscretion: but Page  156 she who is as Wise
            as Good, pos∣sesles such Charms as can hardly fail of prevailing. Doubtless, her Husband
            is a much happier Man, and more likely to aban∣don all his ill Courses, than he who has
            none to come home to, but an ignorant, froward and fan∣tastick Creature. An ingenious
            Conversation will make his life comfortable, and he who can be so well entertain'd at
            home, needs not run into Temptations in search of Diversions abroad. The only danger is,
            that the Wife be more knowing than the Husband; but if she be, 'tis his own fault, since
            he wants no opportunities of improvement; unless he be a natural Blockhead, and then
            such an one will need a wise Woman to govern him, whose prudence will conceal it from
            publick Ob∣servation, and at once both co∣ver and supply his defects. Give Page  157 me
            leave therefore to hope, that no Gentleman who has honoura∣ble designs, will
            henceforward decry Knowledge and Ingenuity in her he wou'd pretend to Ho∣nour: Or if he
            does, it may serve for a Test to distinguish the feigned and unworthy from the real
            Lover.</p>

        <p>Now, who that has a Spark of of Piety, will go about to oppose so Religious a design?
            What ge∣nerous Spirit that has a due re∣gard to the good of Mankind, will not be forward
            to advance and perfect it? Who will think 500 pounds too much to lay out for the
            purchase of so much Wisdom and Happiness? Certainly, we shou'd not think them too
            dear∣ly paid for by a much greater Sum, did not our pitiful and sor∣did Spirits set a
            much higher va∣lue on Money than it deserves. But granting so much of that dear Page
             158 Idol is given away, a person thus bred, will easily make it up by her Frugality and
            other Vertues: if she bring less, she will not waste so much, as others do in
            superfluous and vain Expences. Nor can I think of any expedi∣ent so useful as this to
            Persons of Quality, who are over-stock'd with Children; for thus they may honourably
            dispose of them with∣out impairing their Estates. Five or six hundred pounds may be
            easily spar'd with a Daughter, when so many thousand would go deep; and yet as the world

            of their own Rank (contrary to the generous custom of the Germans) chusing rather to
            fill their Coffers than Page  159 to preserve the purity of their Blood, and therefore
            think a weighty Bag the best Gentility, preferring a wealthy Upstart be∣fore the best
            Descended and best Qualifyed Lady: Their own ex∣travagancies perhaps having made it
            necessary, that they may keep up an empty shadow of Greatness, which is all that

        <p>Does any think their money lost to their Families, when 'tis put in here? I will only ask
            what course they can take to save it, and at once to preserve their Money, their Honour
            and their Daughters too? Were they sure the Ladies wou'd die unmarried, I shou'd commend
            their Thrift; but Experience has too often shewn us the vanity of this ex∣pectation. For
            the poor Lady having past the prime of her Page  160 years in Gaity and Company, in
            running the Circle of all the Vanities of the Town, having spread all her Nets and us'd
            all her Arts for Con∣quest, and finding that the Bait fails where she wou'd have it
            take, and having all this while been so over-careful of her Body, that she had no time
            to improve her mind, which therefore affords her no safe retreat now she meets with
            Disappointments abroad, and growing every day more and more sensible that the respect
            which us'd to be paid her, decays as fast as her Beauty; quite ter∣rified with the
            dreadful name of Old Maid, which yet none but Fools will reproach her with, nor any wise
            Woman be afraid of; to avoid this terrible M•r∣mo, and the scoffs that are thrown on
            superannuated Virgins, she f••es to some dishonourable Match Page  161 as her last, tho
            much mistaken Refuge, to the disgrace of her Family, and her own irreparable Ruin. And
            now let any person of Honour tell me, if it were not richly worth some thousand Pounds,
            to prevent all this mis∣mischief, and the having an idle Fellow, and perhaps a race of
            beggarly Children to hang on him, and to provide for?</p>

        <p>Cou'd I think of any other ob∣jection, I wou'd consider it; theres nothing indeed which
            witty per∣sons may not argue for &amp; against, but they who duly weigh the Ar∣guments
            on both sides, unless they be extreamly prejudiced, will casily discern the great
            use∣fulness of this Institution. The Beaux perhaps, and topping Sparks of the Town, will
            ridi∣cule and laugh at it. For Vertue her self as bright as she is, can't escape the
            lash of scurrilous Page  162 Tongues; the comfort is, whilst they impotently endeavour
            to throw dirt on her, they are un∣able to soil her Beauty, and only render themselves
            the more con∣temptible. They may therefore if they please, hug themselves in their own
            dear folly, and enjoy the diversion of their own insipid Jests. She has but little
            Wisdom and less Vertue, who is to be frighted from what she judges reasonable by the
            scoffs and in∣significant noises of ludicrous Wits, and pert Buffoons. And no wonder
            that such as they, (who have nothing to shew for their pretences to Wit, but some scraps
            of Plays, and blustring Non-sence; who fancy a well adjusted Peruke is able to supply
            their want of Brains, and that to talk much is a sign of Ingenuity, tho't be ne∣ver so
            little to the purpose,) ob∣ject against our Proposal; 'twou•d Page  163 indeed spoil the
            Trade of the gay fluttering Fops, who wou'd be at a loss, had they no body as
            im∣pertinent as themselves to talk with. The Criticism of their Dress wou'd be useless,
            and the labour of their Valet de Chambre lost, unless they cou'd peaceably lay aside
            their Rivalling, and one Ass be content to comple∣ment and admire another. For the
            Ladies wou'd have more dis∣cernment than to esteem a Man for such Follies as shou'd
            rather incline them to scorn and despise him. They wou'd never be so sottish as to
            imagine, that he who regards nothing but his own bru∣tish Appetite, shou'd have any real
            affection for them, nor ever expect Fidelity from one who is unfaithful to GOD and his
            own Soul. They wou'd not be so ab∣surd as to suppose, that man can esteem them who
            neglects his Page  164 Maker; for what are all those fine Idolatries, by which he wou'd
            recommend himself to his pre∣tended Goddess; but mockery and delusion from him who
            for∣gets and affronts the true Dei∣ty? They wou'd not value them∣selves on account of
            the Admi∣ration of such incompetent Judg∣es, nor consequently make use of those little
            trifling Arts that are necessary to recommend them to such Admirers: Neither wou'd they

        <p>What now remains, but to re∣duce to Practice that which tends so very much to our

            own and their neigh∣bours Souls? Shall we freely ex∣pend our Money to purchase Va∣nity,
            Page  165 and often times both pre∣sent and future Ruin, and find none for such an
            eminent good Work, which will make the Ages to come arise and call us Blessed? I wou'd
            fain persuade my self better things, and that I shall one day see this Religious
            Retirement happily setled, and its great designs wisely and vigorously pursu'd; and
            methinks I have al∣ready a Vision of that lustre and glory our Ladies cast round about
            them! Let me therefore intreat the rest of our Sex, who tho at liberty in the world, are
            the mi∣serable Slaves of their own vile affections; let me entreat them to lay aside
            their Prejudices, and whatever borders on Envy and Malice, and with impartial eyes to
            behold the Beauties of our Religious. The native innocen∣cy and unaffectedness of whose
            Charms, and the unblameable Page  166 Integrity of their Lives, are a∣bundantly more
            taking than all the curious Artifices and studied Arts the other can invent to
            re∣commend them, even bad men themselves being Judges, who often betray a secret
            Veneration for that vertue they wou'd seem to despise and endeavour to cor∣rupt. As
            there is not any thing, no not the least shadow of a mo∣tive to recommend vice, but its
            fashionableness, and the being ac∣custom'd to it; so there is no∣thing at all forbidding
            in vertue but her uncouthness. Acquaint your selves with her a little, and you'l wonder
            how you cou'd be so foolish as to delight in any thing besides! For you'l find her
            Conversation most sweet and obliging; her Precepts most ea∣sy and beneficial; her very
            tasks Joys, and her Injunctions the highest Pleasures. She will not Page  167 rob you of
            any innocent delight, not engage you to any thing be∣neath your Birth and Breeding: But
            will put a new and more grateful relish into all your Enjoyments, and make them more
            delicious with her Sweet∣ness She'll preserve and aug∣ment your Honour, by allying you
            to the King of Heaven; secure your Grandeur by fixing it on a firm bottom, such as the
            caprice of Fortune cannot shake or overthrow; she'll enlarge your souls, raise them
            above the common level, and encourage that allowable Pride of Scorn∣ing to do a base
            unworthy action. Make you truly amiable in the eyes of GOD and Man, preserve even the
            Beauty of your Bodies as long as 'tis possible for such a brittle thing to last; and
            when it must of necessity decay, impress such a loveliness on your Minds, Page  168 as
            will shine thro' and brighten your very Countenances; en∣riching you with such a stock
            of Charms, that Time which de∣vours every other thing, shall never be able to decay. In
            a word, 'tis Vertue only which can make you truly happy in this world as well as in the
            next.</p>

        <p>There is a sort of Bravery and Greatness of Soul, which does more truly ennoble us than
            the highest Title, and it consists in the living up to the dignity of our Natures,
            scorning to do a mean unbecoming thing; in passing differently thro' Good and Evil
            Fortune, without being corrupted by the one or deprest by the other. For she that can do
            so, gives evidence that her Happiness depends not on so mutable a thing as this world;
            but, in a due subserviency to the Almighty, is bottom'd only on Page  169 her own great
            Mind. This is the richest Ornament, and ren∣ders a Woman glorious in the lowest Fortune:
            So shining is real worth, that like a Diamond it loses not its lustre, tho cast on a
            Dunghill. Whereas, she who is advanc'd to some eminent Stati∣on, and wants this natural
            and solid Greatness, is no better than Fortunes May-game, rendered more conspicuous,
            that she may appear the more contemptible. Let those therefore who value themselves only
            on external Ac∣complishments, consider how li∣able they are to decay, and how soon they
            may be depriv'd of them, and that supposing they shou'd continue, they are but san∣dy
            Foundations to build Esteem upon. What a disappointment will it be to a Ladies Admirer
            as well as to her self, that her Con∣versation shou'd lose and endan∣ger Page  170 the
            Victory her eyes had gain'd! For when the Passion of a Lover is evaporated into the cool
            temper of a Husband, and a frequent review has lessen'd the wonder which her Charms at
            first had rais'd, she'll retain no more than such a formal re∣spect as decency and good
            breed∣ing will require, and perhaps hardly that; but unless he be a very good Man (and
            indeed the world is not over full of 'em) her worthlesness has made a forfeit of his
            Affections, which are seldom fixt by any other thing than Veneration and Es∣teem.
            Whereas, a wise and good Woman is useful and valuable in all Ages and Conditions; she
            who chiefly attends the one thing needful, the good part which shall not be taken from
            her, lives a cheerful and pleasant Life, inno∣cent and sedate, calm and tran∣quile, Page
             171 and makes a glorious Exit; being translated from the most happy life on Earth, to
            unspeakable happiness in heaven; a fresh and fragrant Name, em∣balming her Dust, and
            extend∣ing its Perfume to succeeding Ages. Whilst the Fools, and the worst sort of them
            the wick∣ed, live as well as die in Misery, go out in a snuff, leaving nothing but
            stench and putrefaction be∣hind them.</p>
