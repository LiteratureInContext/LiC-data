                        <p>This is the first printed edition of Gray's poem; later editions are sometimes titled "An Elegy Written in a Country Church Yard." This pamphlet version was published at roughly the same time in a slightly different version in the <hi rend="italic">Magazine of Magazines</hi>, a periodical that had obtained a copy of the poem in manuscript. (Such copies had been circulating among Gray's friends for several years.) Gray asked his friend Horace Walpole to get a print edition issued by a more respectable London publisher since an authorized publication in a periodical was not the way that he wanted his work to appear in the world. At Gray's request, Walpole enlisted the prestigious London publisher Robert Dodsley, who rushed the text into print to beat the periodical version.</p>
                        <p>Our edition is built from the version produced by the Text Creation Partnership. We have changed the long "s" in the original to a modern "s." Page images from this first edition are from the University of Virginia Special Collections Library.</p>

It was immediately popular with readers when it was first printed in 1751, and has been reprinted (usually often the later, slightly revised title "An Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard"), anthologized, recited, translated, memorized, studied, parodied, and quoted ever since. The poem's publication kicked off an entire movement of what has been known as "graveyard poetry," poems centered around a figure--usually a man--walking quietly through a graveyard, musing on his place in the cosmos and on his own mortality. The poem's author, Thomas Gray (1716-1771), did not write a great deal of poetry compared to many other canonical poets, and he published only a handful of poems in his own lifetime. He led a fairly quiet life as an academic in Cambridge. But the "Elegy" has been enough to ensure Gray a lasting place in English literary history.</p>

                  <lb/>
                  <p>What made Gray's "Elegy" stand out then and makes it significant now? Perhaps the most important clue is in the word "elegy" itself. An elegy is a poem of praise for the a dead person, and poets of this period very frequently wrote elegies to commemorate a death. Sometimes these were elegies for a famous person; other elegies were written to mark the passing of a family member or friend. Gray does something different. Rather than writing about an individual person and describing their virtues in the manner of most elegies, Gray offers praise for the long-gone, ordinary people whose lives are now largely forgotten, commemorated only by the names on the headstones in an undistinguished cemetary next to a typical small church in an unnamed English village. The poem praises ordinary, not extraordinary people, people whom the poet walking through the graveyard never knew. In its final stanzas, the poem then turns in another direction, as it offers an epitaph (that is, a poem that would be inscribed on a gravestone) that seems to be the future epitaph for the poet himself. </p></note> <lb/>

When Gray learned that the poem was going to be published against his wishes in a periodical, the <hi rend="italic">Magazine of Magazines</hi>, he wrote from his home in Cambridge to Walpole asking him to supervise getting a separate edition printed by a more respectable London printer. (There's a good chance, too, that it was Walpole's handwritten copy of the the poem that somehow made its way to William Owen, the publisher of the magazine, so it was his responsbility to make things right.) Walpole turned to Robert Dodsley, one of the most prestigious publishers in London at the time, and expedited the process. The magazine version and this stand-alone version came out at roughly the same time in February 1751.</note></signed>
