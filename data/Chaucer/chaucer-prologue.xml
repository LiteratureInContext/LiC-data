                        According to ancient and medieval physiology, an individual's body consisted
                        of four "humors": blood, phlegm, choler (yellow bile), and melancholy (black
                        bile). The proportions of these humors in an individual determined their
                        health and personality—hence the term "choleric" to refer to someone who is
                        frequently angry, for example. Disease was seen as an imbalance of these
                        humors.</p></note>

                        Chaucer's use of the legal terminology with reference to the Host is meant

                        the Host frames the competition, each pilgrim is to tell two tales on the
                        way to Canterbury and two tales on the way back, or four tales total. The
                        existence of only one tale from each of the pilgrims has left it a matter of
                        scholarly debate whether Chaucer left <hi rend="italic">The Canterbury

                        the 'Water of Saint Thomas'—purportedly a mixture of Holy Water from his
                        tomb with a drop of his blood. The mixture was said to contain healing
                        properties. This practice was popular among the laity, but controversial
                        among the clergy, reminiscent, as it was, of the Eucharist. </p></note>

                        communicating that it's uncertain whether the arrival of the pilgrims at the
                        Tabard was a happy coincidence or an act of Fate. </p></note>
