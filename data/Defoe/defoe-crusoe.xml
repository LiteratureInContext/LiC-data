With his first work of fiction, Daniel Defoe--a businessman turned poet, journalist, and political propagandist--created a character who very quickly went on to have a life that went well beyond the pages of the book that first appeared, without build-up, fanfare, or even the author's name on the title page, in April 1719. <hi rend="italic">Robinson Crusoe</hi> was an immediate bestseller; the bookseller went through several editions in the first year alone. By August, Defoe had produced a sequel, <hi rend="italic">The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe</hi>, a work that he wrote quickly in part to head off the possibility that someone else might beat him to it. Over the last three hundred years, the story of a person isolated on a deserted island or something like it, has been used by dozens, maybe hundreds of writers, who have made it a genre of its own, the "Robinsoniad," a genre that includes satirical parodies like <hi rend="italic">Gulliver's Travels</hi>, children's books like <hi rend="italic">The Swiss Family Robinson</hi>, Bugs Bunny cartoons, television situation comedies like <hi rend="italic">Gilligan's Island</hi>, and science fiction works like the 2015 film <hi rend="italic">The Martian</hi>. Robinson Crusoe, the man and the book in which he first appeared, has become one of the foundational myths of the modern world.The story of one man's survival has become so well known in all of these instances that it can be difficult to see through the mythology to analyze Defoe's original book and to imagine what its first readers might have noticed and found so striking. It is important to recognize, for example, that the book is told in the first person, by a narrator who never lets on that this is a work of fiction. Defoe's name, as noted above, did not appear on the title page of the first edition (although it quickly became clear to those in the know that he was the author), or even in any of the many editions issued in his lifetime. Although the book is famous for the many years that Crusoe spends on the island, it takes a while for him to get there, and his experiences both before and after his time there are worth paying attention to for the way that they frame the central experience. Defoe's prose is sometimes clunky-he has a tendency to shape sentences and paragraphs that would never pass muster with a modern copyeditor--but it is also capable of great beauty and insight, and rewards careful attention.</p>
                     
                     <p>Perhaps most important, this is not a "novel" in any sense that either Defoe or we would recognize. In 1719, that word was most typically associated with short works of romantic fiction. This book, by contrast, has no romance at all (one of the stranger things about it, in fact, is how little Crusoe thinks of sex), is very long, and grounds itself thoroughly in circumstantial details drawn from a world that can be identified and verified. <hi rend="italic">Robinson Crusoe</hi> dates its events precisely, and locates its scenes in real places that can be found on a map. (In fact, <hi rend="italic">The Farther Adventures</hi> includes a map, inviting the reader to trace its fictional hero's exploits as he were an explorer in the world.) Defoe is very likely basing at least parts of the story on the real-life experience of Alexander Selkirk, a Scottish sailor who had been left on a deserted island for several years. Even the slave trading voyage that Crusoe goes on that results in the shipwreck that isolates him was drawn from contemporary events; because of the outbreak of war with Spain in 1718, the English South Sea Company found itself unable to exercise its right to transport slaves from Africa to the Spanish colonies in the Americas, with the result that private merchants were undertaking such voyages, as Crusoe does. Contemporaries quickly recognized that Crusoe's story was fictional, but took a lot of pleasure in the way that it blurred the lines between the real world and the imagination. <hi rend="italic">Robinson Crusoe</hi> has remained perhaps the single most important, influential, and popular work of fiction in the English language ever since.</p></note>Of <hi rend="italic">YORK,</hi> MARINER:<lb/> Who lived Eight and Twenty Years all alone in <lb/> an un-inhabited Island on the Coast of AMERICA,<lb/> near the Mouth of the Great River of OROONOQUE;<lb/> Having been cast on Shore by Shipwreck, where<lb/>in all the Men perished but himself.<lb/>

            <p>IF ever the Story of any private Man's Adventures in the World were worth making
               Publick, and were acceptable when Publish'd, the Editor of this Account thinks this

            <p>The Wonders of this Man's Life exceed all that (he thinks) is to be found extant; the
               Life of one Man being scarce capable of a greater Variety.</p>
            <p>The Story is told with Modesty, with Seriousness, and with a
               religious Application of Events to the Uses to which wise Men <pb
                  /> always apply them (<ref target="viz_" corresp="viz"

               all the Variety of our Circumstances, let them happen how they will.</p>
            <p>The Editor believes the thing to be a just History of Fact; neither is there any Appearance of Fiction in it: And however
               thinks, because all such things are dispatch'd, that the Improvement of it, as well
               to the Diversion, as to the Instruction of the Reader, will be the same; and as such,
               he thinks, without farther Compliment to the World, he does

                  character "Crusoe," Defoe may be recalling his childhood schoolmate Timothy Cruso
                  (1656-1697), who would go on to a prominent career as a Presbyterian minister. The
                  name "Kreutznaer," from which Crusoe tells us his name is derived, is suggestive
                  of the Christian cross. And the fact that Crusoe lives his adult life with a name
                  other than that he was born with links him both to Defoe, who was born simply
                  Daniel Foe, and Alexander Selkirk, who was born Alexander Selcraig.</note> but by

               Free-School generally goes, and design'd me for the Law; but I would be satisfied

               not embarass'd with the Pride, Luxury, Ambition and Envy of the upper Part of Mankind. He told me, I might judge of the
               Happiness of this State, by this one thing, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> That this was the State of
               Life which all other People envied, that Kings have frequently lamented the miserable Consequences of being born to great
               things, and wish'd they had been placed in the Middle of the two Extremes, between
               the Mean and the Great; that the wise Man gave his Testimony to this as the just
               Standard of true Felicity, when he prayed to have neither
               Poverty or Riches.</p>
            <p>He bid me observe it, and I should always find, that the Calamities of Life were
               shared among the upper and lower Part of Mankind; but that the middle Station had the
               fewest Disasters, and was not expos'd to so many Vicissitudes as the higher or lower
               Part of Mankind; nay, they were not subjected to so many
               Distempers and Uneasinesses either of Body or Mind, as those were who, by vicious
               Living, Luxury and Extravagancies on one Hand, or by hard Labour, Want of
               Necessaries, and mean or insufficient Diet on the other Hand, bring Distempers upon themselves by the natural Consequences of their Way of Living; <hi rend="italic">That</hi> the middle Station of Life was calculated for all kind of Vertues and all
               kinds of Enjoyments; that Peace and Plenty were the
               Hand-maids of a middle Fortune; that Temperance, Moderation, Quietness, Health, <pb
                  n="4" /> Society, all agreeable Diversions, and all
               desirable Pleasures, were the Blessings attending the middle Station of Life; that
               this Way Men went silently and smoothly thro' the World, and comfortably out of it,
               not embarass'd with the Labours of the Hands or of the Head, not sold to the Life of
                  Slavery for daily Bread, or harrast with perplex'd Circumstances, which rob the Soul of Peace, and the Body of
               Rest; not enrag'd with the Passion of Envy, or secret
               burning Lust of Ambition for great things; but in easy Circumstances sliding gently
               thro' the World, and sensibly tasting the Sweets of living, without the bitter,
               feeling that they are happy, and learning by every Day's Experience to know it more
               sensibly.</p>
            <p>After this, he press'd me earnestly, and in the most affectionate manner, not to play
               the young Man, not to precipitate my self into Miseries which Nature and the Station
               of Life I was born in, seem'd to have provided against; that I was under no Necessity
               of seeking my Bread; that he would do well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly
               into the Station of Life which he had been just recommending
               to me; and that if I was not very easy and happy in the
               World, it must be my meer Fate or Fault that must hinder it, and that he should have
               nothing to answer for, having thus discharg'd his Duty in
               warning me against Measures which he knew would be to my Hurt: In a word, that as he
               would do very kind things for me if I would stay and settle at Home as he directed,
               so he would not have so much Hand in my Misfortunes, as to
               give me any Encouragement to go away: And to close all, he told me I had my elder
               Brother for an Example, to whom he had used the same earnest Perswasions to keep him
               from going into the Low Country Wars, but could not prevail, <pb n="5" /> his young Desires
               prompting him to run into the Army where he was kill'd; and tho' he said he would not
               cease to pray for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that if I did take this
               foolish Step, God would not bless me, and I would have Leisure hereafter to reflect
               upon having neglected his Counsel when there might be none to assist in my
               Recovery.</p>
            <p>I observed in this last Part of his Discourse, which was truly Prophetick, tho' I
               suppose my Father did not know it to be so himself; I say, I observed the Tears run down his Face very plentifully, and especially when he spoke of my Brother who was
               kill'd; and that when he spoke of my having Leisure to repent, and none to assist me,
               he was so mov'd, that he broke off the Discourse, and told me, his Heart was so full
               he could say no more to me.</p>
            <p>I was sincerely affected with this Discourse, as indeed who could be otherwise; and I
               resolv'd not to think of going abroad any more, but to settle at home according to my
               Father's Desire. But alas! a few Days wore it all off; and in short, to prevent any
               of my Father's farther Importunities, in a few Weeks after, I resolv'd to run quite
               away from him. However, I did not act so hastily neither as my first Heat of
               Resolution prompted, but I took my Mother, at a time when I thought her a little
               pleasanter than ordinary, and told her, that my Thoughts were so entirely bent upon
               seeing the World, that I should never settle to any thing with Resolution enough to
               go through with it, and my Father had better give me his Consent than force me to go
               without it; that I was now Eighteen Years old, which was <ref target="apprentice_"

               Attorney; that I was sure if I did, I should never serve out my time, and I <pb n="6"
                  /> should certainly run away from my Master before my Time
               was out, and go to Sea; and if she would speak to my Father to let me go but one
               Voyage abroad, if I came home again and did not like it, I
               would go no more, and I would promise by a double Diligence to recover that Time I
               had lost.</p>
            <p>This put my Mother into a great Passion: She told me, she knew it would be to no
               Purpose to speak to my Father upon any such Subject; that he knew too well what was
               my Interest to give his Consent to any thing so much for my Hurt, and that she
                  wondered how I could think of any such thing after such a
               Discourse as I had had with my Father, and such kind and tender Expressions as she
               knew my Father had us'd to me; and that in short, if I would ruine my self there was
               no Help for me; but I might depend I should never have their
               Consent to it: That for her Part she would not have so much Hand in my Destruction;
               and I should never have it to say, that my Mother was willing when my Father was
               not.</p>
            <p>Tho' my Mother refused to move it to my Father, yet as I
               have heard afterwards, she reported all the Discourse to him, and that my Father,
               after shewing a great Concern at it, said to her with a Sigh, That Boy might be happy
               if he would stay at home, but if he goes abroad he will be the miserablest Wretch that was ever born: I can give no Consent
               to it.</p>
            <p>It was not till almost a Year after this that I broke loose, tho' in the mean time I
               continued obstinately deaf to all Proposals of settling to
               Business, and frequently expostulating with my Father and Mother, about their being
               so positively determin'd against what they knew my Inclinations prompted me to. But

               that time; but I say, being there, and <pb n="7" /> one of my
               Companions being going by Sea to <hi rend="italic">London,</hi> in his Father's Ship, and prompting
               me to go with them, with the common Allurement of Seafaring Men, <hi rend="italic">viz</hi> That it
               should cost me nothing for my Passage, I consulted neither Father or Mother any more,
               nor so much as sent them Word of it; but leaving them to
               hear of it as they might, without asking God's Blessing, or my Father's, without any
                  Consideration of Circumstances or Consequences, and in an
               ill Hour, God knows. On the first of <hi rend="italic">September</hi> 1661
               I went on Board a Ship bound for <hi rend="italic">London</hi>; never any young Adventurer's
               Misfortunes, I believe, began sooner, or continued longer
               than mine. The Ship was no sooner gotten out of the <hi rend="italic">Humber,</hi> but the Wind began to blow, and the Winds to rise in a most frightful
               manner; and as I had never been at Sea before, I was most
               inexpressibly sick in Body, and terrify'd in my Mind: I began now seriously to reflect upon what I had done, and how justly I was overtaken by the Judgment of Heaven for my wicked
               leaving my Father's House, and abandoning my Duty; all the
               good Counsel of my Parents, my Father's Tears and my
               Mother's Entreaties came now fresh into my Mind, and my
               Conscience, which was not yet come to the Pitch of Hardness which it has been since,
               reproach'd me with the Contempt of Advice, and the Breach of my Duty to God and my
               Father.</p>
            <p>All this while the Storm encreas'd, and the Sea, which I had never been upon before,
               went very high, tho' nothing like what I have seen many times since; no, nor like
               what I saw a few Days after: But it was enough to affect me then, who was but a young
               Sailor, and had never known any thing of the matter. I expected every Wave would have
               swallowed us up, and that every time the Ship fell down, as I thought, in the Trough
               or Hollow <pb n="8" /> of the Sea, we should never rise more;
               and in this Agony of Mind, I made many Vows and Resolutions, that if it would please
               God here to spare my Life this one Voyage, if ever I got once my Foot upon dry Land
               again, I would go directly home to my Father, and never set it into a Ship again
               while I liv'd; that I would take his Advice, and never run my self into such Miseries
               as these any more. Now I saw plainly the Goodness of his Observations about the
               middle Station of Life, how easy, how comfortably he had liv'd all his Days, and
               never had been expos'd to Tempests at Sea, or Troubles on Shore; and I resolv'd that
               I would, like a true repenting <ref target="prodigal_" corresp="prodigal"

            <p>These wise and sober Thoughts continued all the while the Storm continued, and indeed
               some time after; but the next Day the Wind was abated and
               the Sea calmer, and I began to be a little <ref target="inure_" corresp="inure"

               was very grave for all that Day, being also a little Sea sick still; but towards
               Night the Weather clear'd up, the Wind was quite over, and a charming fine Evening
               follow'd; the Sun went down perfectly clear and rose so the next Morning; and having
               little or no Wind and a smooth Sea, the Sun shining upon it, the Sight was, as I
               thought, the most delightful that ever I saw.</p>
            <p>I had slept well in the Night, and was now no more Sea sick but very chearful,
               looking with Wonder upon the Sea that was so rough and terrible the Day before, and could be so calm and so pleasant in so little time after.
               And now least my good Resolutions should continue, my Companion, who had indeed
               entic'd me away, comes to me, <hi rend="italic">Well</hi> Bob, says he, clapping me on the

               that one Night's Wickedness I drowned all my Repentance, all
               my Reflections upon my past Conduct, and all my Resolutions for my future. In a word,
               as the Sea was returned to its Smoothness of Surface and
               settled Calmness by the Abatement of that Storm, so the Hurry of my Thoughts being
               over, my Fears and Apprehensions of being swallow'd up by the Sea being forgotten,
               and the Current of my former Desires return'd, I entirely forgot the <ref

               shook them off, and rouz'd my self from them as it were from a Distemper, and applying my self to Drink and Company, soon master'd the Return of those Fits, for so I
               call'd them, and I had in five or six Days got as compleat a Victory over Conscience

               was to have another Trial for it still; and Providence, as in such Cases generally it

               I could ill re-assume the first Penitence, which I had so apparently trampled upon,
               and harden'd my self against: I thought the Bitterness of Death had been past, and
               that this would be nothing too like the first. But when the
               Master himself came by me, as I said just now, and said we should be all lost, I was
               dreadfully frighted: I got up out of my Cabbin, and look'd out; but such a dismal
               Sight I never saw: The Sea went Mountains high, and broke upon us every three or four
               Minutes: When I could look about, I could see nothing but Distress round us: Two
               Ships that rid near us we found had cut their Masts by the Board, being deep loaden;
               and our Men cry'd out, that a Ship which rid about a Mile a-Head of us was foundered.
               Two more Ships being driven from their Anchors, were run out of the Roads to Sea <ref

            <p>Any one may judge what a Condition I must be in at all this, who was but a young
               Sailor, and who had been in such a Fright before at but a little. But if I can express at this Distance the <pb n="12"/> Thoughts I had about me at that time, I was in tenfold more Horror of Mind upon
               Account of my former Convictions, and the having returned from them to the
               Resolutions I had wickedly taken at first, than I was at Death it self; and these
               added to the Terror of the Storm, put me into such a Condition, that I can by no
               Words describe it. But the worst was not come yet, the Storm continued with such
               Fury, that the Seamen themselves acknowledged they had never known a worse. We had a
               good Ship, but she was deep loaden, and wallowed in the Sea, that the Seamen every
               now and then cried out, she would founder. It was my Advantage in one respect, that I
               did not know what they meant by Founder, till I enquir'd. However, the Storm was so
                  violent, that I saw what is not often seen, the Master,
               the Boat-Swain, and some others more sensible than the rest, at their Prayers, and
               expecting every Moment when the Ship would go to the Bottom.
               In the Middle of the Night, and under all the rest of of our Distresses, one of the
               Men that had been down on Purpose to see, cried out we had sprung a Leak; another
               said there was four Foot Water in the Hold. Then all Hands were called to the Pump.
               At that very Word my Heart, as I thought, died within me, and I fell backwards upon
               the Side of my Bed where I sat, into the Cabbin. However, the Men roused me, and told
               me, that I that was able to do nothing before, was as well able to pump as another;
               at which I stirr'd up, and went to the Pump and work'd very heartily. While this was
               doing, the Master seeing some light <ref target="collier_" corresp="collier"
                  >Colliers</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="collier"
                  target="collier_" type="gloss">Coal barges</note>, who not able to ride out the
               Storm, were oblig'd to flip and run away to Sea, and would come near us, ordered to
               fire a Gun as a Signal of Distress. I who knew nothing what that meant, was so
                  surprised, that I thought the Ship had broke, or some <pb
                  n="13" /> dreadful thing had happen'd. In a word, I was so
               surprised, that I fell down in a Swoon. As this was a time when every Body had his
               own Life to think of, no Body minded me, or what was become of me; but another Man
               stept up to the Pump, and thrusting me aside with his Foot, let me lye, thinking I had been dead; and it was a great while before I came
               to my self.</p>
            <p>We work'd on, but the Water encreasing in the Hold, it was apparent that the Ship
               would founder, and tho' the Storm began to abate a little, yet as it was not possible
               she could swim till we might run into a Port, so the Master continued firing Guns for
               Help; and a light Ship who had rid it out just a Head of us ventured a Boat out to
               help us. It was with the utmost Hazard the Boat came near us, but it was impossible
               for us to get on Board, or for the Boat to lie near the Ship Side, till at last the
               Men rowing very heartily, and venturing their Lives to save ours, our Men cast them a
               Rope over the Stern with a Buoy to it, and then vered it out a great Length, which
               they after great Labour and Hazard took hold of and we
               hall'd them close under our Stern and got all into their Boat. It was to no Purpose
               for them or us after we were in the Boat to think of reaching to their own Ship, so
               all agreed to let her drive and only to pull her in towards
               Shore as much as we could, and our Master promised them, That if the Boat was stav'd
               upon Shore <ref target="makegood_" corresp="makegood">he would make it good to their

            <p>We were not much more than a quarter of an Hour out of our Ship but we saw her sink,
               and then I understood for the first time what was meant by a Ship foundering in the
               Sea; I must acknowledge <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0653600100:18"
               /> I had hardly Eyes to look up when the Seamen told me she
               was sinking; for from that Moment they rather put me into
               the Boat than that I might be said to go in, my Heart was as it were dead within me,
               partly with Fright, partly with Horror of Mind and the Thoughts of what was yet
               before me.</p>
            <p>While we were in this Condition, the Men yet labouring at the Oar to bring the Boat
               near the Shore, we could see, when our Boat mounting the Waves, we were able to see
               the Shore, a great many People running along the Shore to assist us when we should
               come near, but we made but slow way towards the Shore, nor were we able to reach the
               Shore, till being past the Light-House at <hi rend="italic">Winterton,</hi> the Shore falls off to the Westward towards <hi rend="italic">Cromer,</hi> and so
               the Land broke off a little the Violence of the Wind: Here we got in, and tho' not
                  without much Difficulty got all safe on Shore and walk'd
               afterwards on Foot to <hi rend="italic">Yarmouth,</hi> where, as unfortunate Men, we were used with great Humanity as well by the Magistrates of the
               Town, who assign'd us good Quarters, as by particular Merchants and Owners of Ships,
               and had Money given us sufficient to carry us either to
                  <hi rend="italic">London</hi> or back to <hi rend="italic">Hull,</hi> as we thought fit.</p>
            <p>Had I now had the Sense to have gone back to <hi rend="italic">Hull,</hi> and have gone home, I had
               been happy, and my Father, an Emblem of our Blessed Saviour's Parable, had even <ref

            <p>But my ill Fate push'd me on now with an Obstinacy that
               nothing could resist; and tho' I had several times loud
               Calls from my Reason and my more composed Judgment to go home, yet I had <pb n="15"
                  /> no Power to do it. I know not what to call this, nor
               will I urge, that it is a secret over-ruling Decree that hurries us on to be the
               Instruments of our own Destruction, even tho' it be before us, and that we rush upon
               it with our Eyes open. Certainly nothing but some such
               decreed unavoidable Misery attending, and which it was impossible for me to escape,
               could have push'd me forward against the calm Reasonings and Perswasions of my most
                  retired Thoughts, and against two such visible Instructions as I had met with in my first Attempt.</p>
            <p>My Comrade, who had help'd to harden me before, and who was
               the Master's Son, was now less forward than I; the first time he spoke to me after we
               were at <hi rend="italic">Yarmouth,</hi> which was not till two or three Days, for we were
               separated in the Town to several Quarters; I say, the first time he saw me, it
               appear'd his Tone was alter'd, and looking very melancholy and shaking his Head,
               ask'd me how I did, and telling his Father who I was, and how I had come this Voyage
               only for a Trial in order to go farther abroad; his Father turning to me with a very
               grave and concern'd Tone, <hi rend="italic">Young Man,</hi> says he, <hi rend="italic">you ought never to go to
                  Sea any more, you ought to take this for a plain and visible Token that you are

               Foot in <pb n="16" /> the same Ship with thee again for a
               Thousand Pounds. This indeed was, as I said, an Excursion of his Spirits which were
               yet agitated by the Sense of his Loss, and was farther than he could have Authority
               to go. However he afterwards talk'd very gravely to me, exhorted me to go back to my
                  Father, and not tempt Providence to my Ruine; told me I

               had many Struggles with my self, what Course of Life I
               should take, and whether I should go Home, or go to Sea.</p>
            <p>As to going Home, Shame opposed the best Motions that offered to my Thoughts; and it
                  immediately occurr'd to me how I should be laugh'd at
               among the Neighbours, and should be asham'd to see, not my Father and Mother only,
               but even every Body else; from whence I have since often observed, how incongruous
               and irrational the common Temper of Mankind is, especially
               of Youth, to that Reason which ought to guide them in such Cases, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> That
               they are not asham'd to sin, and yet are asham'd to repent; not asham'd of the Action for which they ought justly to be esteemed Fools, but are
               asham'd of the returning, which only can make them be esteem'd wise Men.</p>
            <p>In this State of Life however I remained some time, uncertain what Measures to take,
               and what Course of Life to lead. An irresistible Reluctance continu'd to going Home;
               and as I stay'd a while, <pb n="17" /> the Remembrance of the
               Distress I had been in wore off; and as that abated, the little Motion I had in my
               Desires to a Return wore off with it, till at last I quite lay'd aside the Thoughts
               of it, and lookt out for a Voyage.</p>

            <p>That evil Influence which carryed me first away from my Father's House, that hurried
               me into the wild and indigested Notion of raising my Fortune; and that imprest those
               Conceits so forcibly upon me, as to make me deaf to all good Advice, and to the
               Entreaties and even Command of my Father: I say the same
               Influence, whatever it was, presented the most unfortunate of all Enterprises to my
               View; and I went on board a Vessel bound to the Coast of <hi rend="italic">Africa</hi>; or, as our

            </p>
            <p>It was my great Misfortune that in all these Adventures I did not ship my self as a
               Sailor; whereby, tho' I might indeed have workt a little harder than ordinary, yet at
               the same time I had learn'd the Duty and Office of a <ref target="mastman_"

               might have quallified my self for a Mate or Lieutenant, if not for a Master: But as
               it was always my Fate to choose for the worse, so I did here; for having Money in my
               Pocket, and good Cloaths upon my Back, I would always go on board in the Habit of a
               Gentleman; and so I neither had any Business in the Ship, or learn'd to do any.</p>
            <p>It was my Lot first of all to fall into pretty good Company in <hi rend="italic">London,</hi> which
               does not always happen to such loose and unguided young
               Fellows as I then was; the Devil generally not omitting to lay some Snare for them
               very early: But it was not so with me, I first fell acquainted with the Master of a

               a Sailor: For, as he took Delight to introduce me, I took Delight to learn; and, in a

               the rest of our Men were, but was kept by the Captain of the Rover, as his proper
               Prize, and made his Slave, being young and nimble, and fit for his Business. At this
               surprising Change of my Circumstances from a Merchant to a
               miserable Slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed; and now I
               look'd back upon my Father's prophetick Discourse to me, that I should be miserable, and have none to relieve me, which I thought was now
               so effectually brought to pass, that it could not be worse; that now the Hand of
               Heaven had overtaken me, and I was undone without Redemption. But alas! this was but a Taste of the Misery I was
               to go thro', as will appear in the Sequel of this Story.</p>
            <p>As my new Patron or Master had taken me Home to his House, so I was in hopes that he
               would take me with him when he went to Sea again, believing
               that it would some time or other be his Fate to be taken by a <hi rend="italic">Spanish</hi> or
                  <hi rend="italic">Portugal</hi> Man of War; and that then I should be set at Liberty. But this
               Hope of mine was soon taken away; for when he went to Sea, he left me on Shoar to
               look after his <pb n="21" /> little Garden, and do the common
               Drudgery of Slaves about his House; and when he came home again from his Cruise, he
               order'd me to lye in the Cabbin to look after the Ship.</p>
            <p>Here I meditated nothing but my Escape; and what Method I might take to effect it,
               but found no Way that had the least Probability in it: Nothing presented to make the Supposition of it rational;
               for I had no Body to communicate it to, that would embark with me; no Fellow-Slave,
               no <hi rend="italic">Englishman, Irishman,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> there
               but my self; so that for two Years, tho' I often pleased my self with the
               Imagination, yet I never had the least encouraging Prospect
               of putting it in Practice.</p>
            <p>After about two Years an odd Circumstance presented it self,
               which put the old Thought of making some Attempt for my
               Liberty, again in my Head: My Patron lying at Home longer than usual, without fitting out his Ship, which, as I heard, was for
               want of Money; he used constantly, once or twice a Week, sometimes oftner, if the
               Weather was fair, to take the Ship's <ref target="pinnace_" corresp="pinnace"

            <p>It happen'd one time, that going a fishing in a stark calm Morning, a Fog rose so
               thick, that tho' we were not half a League from the Shoar we lost Sight of it; and
               rowing we knew not whither or which way, we labour'd all Day and all the next Night,
               and when the Morning came we found we had pull'd off to Sea instead of pulling in for
               the Shoar; and that we were at least two Leagues from <pb n="22"
                  /> the Shoar: However we got well in again, tho' with a
               great deal of Labour, and some Danger; for the Wind began to blow pretty fresh in the
                  Morning; but particularly we were all very hungry.</p>
            <p>But our Patron warn'd by this Disaster, resolved to take more Care of himself for the
               future; and having lying by him the Long-boat of our <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Ship we had
               taken, he resolved he would not go a fishing any more without a Compass and some
               Provision; so he ordered the Carpenter of his Ship, who also was an <hi rend="italic">English</hi>
               Slave, to build a little State-room or Cabin in the middle of the Long Boat, like
               that of a Barge, with a Place to stand behind it to steer and hale home the
               Main-sheet; and Room before for a hand or two to stand and work the Sails; she sail'd
               with that we call a Shoulder of Mutton Sail; and the Boom

               Table to eat on, with some small Lockers to put in some Bottles of such Liquor as he
               thought fit to drink in; particularly his Bread, Rice and Coffee.</p>
            <p>We went frequently out with this Boat a fishing, and as I was most dextrous to catch
               fish for him, he never went without me: It happen'd that he had appointed to go out
               in this Boat, either for Pleasure or for Fish, with two or three <hi rend="italic">Moors</hi> of
               some Distinction in that Place, and for whom he had provided extraordinarily; and had
               therefore sent on board the Boat over Night, a larger Store of Provisions than
               ordinary; and had order'd me to get ready three Fuzees with Powder and Shot, which
               were on board his Ship; for that they design'd some Sport of
               Fowling as well as Fishing.</p>
            <p>I got all things ready as he had directed, and waited the next Morning with the Boat,

               my Patroon came on board alone, and told me his Guests had put off going, upon some
               Business that fell out, and order'd me with the Man and Boy, as usual, to go out with
               the Boat and catch them some Fish, for that his Friends were to sup at his House; and
               commanded that as soon as I had got some Fish I should bring it home to his House;
               all which I prepar'd to do.</p>
            <p>This Moment my former Notions of Deliverance darted into my
               Thoughts, for now I found I was like to have a little Ship at my Command; and my
               Master being gone, I prepar'd to furnish my self, not for a fishing Business but for
               a Voyage; tho' I knew not, neither did I so much as consider whither I should steer;
               for any where to get out of that Place was my Way.</p>
            <p>My first Contrivance was to make a Pretence to speak to this <hi rend="italic">Moor,</hi> to get
               something for our Subsistance on board; for I told him we must not presume to eat of
               our Patroon's Bread, he said that was true; so he brought a large Basket of Rusk or
               Bisket of their kind, and three Jarrs with fresh Water into the Boat; I knew where my
               Patroon's Case of Bottles stood, which it was evident by the make were taken out of
               some <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Prize; and I convey'd them into the Boat while the
                  <hi rend="italic">Moor</hi> was on Shoar, as if they had been there before, for our Master: I
               convey'd also a great Lump of Bees-Wax into the Boat, which weighed above <ref

               which he innocently came into also; his Name was <hi rend="italic">Ismael,</hi> who they call

               more; and another with Shot, that had five or six Pound, with some Bullets; and put
               all into the Boat: At the same time I had found some Powder of my Masters in the
               Great Cabbin, with which I fill'd one of the large Bottles in the Case, which was
               almost empty; pouring what was in it into another: and thus furnished with every
               thing needful, we sail'd out of the Port to fish: The Castle which is at the Entrance
               of the Port knew who we were, and took no Notice of us; and we were not above a Mile
               out of the Port before we hal'd in our Sail, and set us down to fish: The Wind blew
               from the N. NE. which was contrary to my Desire; for had it blown southerly I had
               been sure to have made the Coast of <hi rend="italic">Spain,</hi> and at least reacht to the Bay of

                  thinking no harm agreed, and being in the head of the
               Boat set the Sails; and as I had the Helm I run the Boat out near a League farther,
               and then brought her too as if I would fish; when giving the Boy the Helm, I stept

               I, you swim well enough to reach to the Shoar, and the Sea is calm, make the best of
               your Way to Shoar and I will do you no harm, but if you come near the Boat I'll shoot
               you thro' the Head; for I am resolved to have my Liberty; so he turn'd himself about
               and swam for the Shoar, and I make no doubt but he reacht it with Ease, for he was an
               Excellent Swimmer.</p>
            <p>I could ha' been content to ha' taken this <hi rend="italic">Moor</hi> with me, and ha' drown'd the
               Boy, but there was no venturing to trust him: When he was gone I turn'd to the Boy,
               who they call'd <hi rend="italic">Xury,</hi> and said to him, <hi rend="italic">Xury,</hi> if you will be
               faithful to me I'll make you a great Man, but if you will not stroak your Face to be

               must throw you into the Sea too; the Boy smil'd in my Face and spoke so innocently that I could not mistrust him; and swore to be
               faithful to me, and go all over the World with me.</p>
            <p>While I was in View of the <hi rend="italic">Moor</hi> that was swimming, I stood out directly to
               Sea with the Boat, rather stretching to Windward, that they might think me gone
               towards the <hi rend="italic">Straits</hi>-mouth (as indeed any one that had been in their Wits
               must ha' been supposed to do) for who would ha' suppos'd we

               whole Nations of Negroes were sure to surround us with their Canoes, and destroy us;
               where we could ne'er once go on shoar but we should be devour'd by savage Beasts, or
               more merciless Savages of humane kind.</p>
            <p>But as soon as it grew dusk in the Evening, I chang'd my Course, and steer'd directly
               South and by East, bending my Course a little toward the East, that I might keep in
               with the Shoar; and having a fair fresh Gale of Wind, and a smooth quiet Sea, I made
               such Sail that I believe by the next Day at Three a Clock in the Afternoon, when I
               first made the Land, I could not be less than 150 Miles South of <hi rend="italic">Sallee</hi>;
               quite beyond the Emperor of <hi rend="italic">Morocco</hi>'s Dominions, or

            <p>Yet such was the Fright I had taken at the <hi rend="italic">Moors,</hi> and the dreadful

               Shoar, or come to an Anchor; the Wind continuing fair, 'till I had sail'd in that

               came to an Anchor in the Mouth of a little River, I knew not what, or where; neither
               what Latitude, what Country, what Nations, or what River: I neither saw, or desir'd
               to see any People, the principal thing I wanted was fresh Water: We came into this
               Creek in the Evening, resolving to swim on shoar as soon as it was dark, and discover
               the Country; but as soon as it was quite dark, we heard such dreadful Noises of the
               Barking, Roaring, and Howling of Wild Creatures, of we knew not what Kinds, that the
               poor Boy was ready to die with <pb n="27" /> Fear, and beg'd
               of me not to go on shoar till Day; well <hi rend="italic">Xury</hi> said I, then I won't, but it

                  a sip</note> (out of our Patroon's Case of Bottles) to
               chear him up: After all, <hi rend="italic">Xury</hi>'s Advice was good, and I took it, we dropt our
               little Anchor and lay still all Night; I say still, for we
               slept none! for in two or three Hours we saw vast great Creatures (we knew not what
               to call them) of many sorts, come down to the Sea-shoar and run into the Water,
               wallowing and washing themselves for the Pleasure of cooling themselves; and they
               made such hideous Howlings and Yellings, that I never indeed heard the like.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Xury</hi> was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was I too; but we were both more
               frighted when we heard one of these mighty Creatures come swimming towards our Boat, we could not see him, but we might hear him by his blowing
               to be a monstrous, huge and furious Beast; <hi rend="italic">Xury</hi>
               said it was a Lyon, and it might be so for ought I know; but poor <hi rend="italic">Xury</hi> cryed
               to me to weigh the Anchor and row away; no says I, <hi rend="italic">Xury,</hi> we can slip our
               Cable with the Buoy to it and go off to Sea, they cannot
               follow us far; I had no sooner said so, but I perceiv'd the Creature (whatever it
               was) within Two Oars Length, which something surprized me; however I immediately
               stept to the Cabbin-door, and taking up my Gun fir'd at him, upon which he
               immediately turn'd about and swam towards the Shoar
               again.</p>
            <p>But it is impossible to describe the horrible Noises, and
               hideous Cryes and Howlings, that were <pb n="28" /> raised as
               well upon the Edge of the Shoar, as higher within the
               Country; upon the Noise or Report of the Gun, a Thing I have
               some Reason to believe those Creatures had never heard before: This Convinc'd me that
               there was no going on Shoar for us in the Night upon that Coast, and how to venture
               on Shoar in the Day was another Question too; for to have
               fallen into the Hands of any of the Savages, had been as bad as to have fallen into
               the Hands of Lyons and Tygers; at least we were equally apprehensive of the Danger of
               it.</p>
            <p>Be that as it would, we were oblig'd to go on Shoar somewhere or other for Water, for
               we had not a Pint left in the Boat; when or where to get to it was the Point:
                  <hi rend="italic">Xury</hi> said, if I would let him go on Shoar with one of the Jarrs, he would
               find if there was any Water and bring some to me. I ask'd him why he would go? Why I
               should not go and he stay in the Boat? The Boy answer'd with so much Affection that
               made me love him ever after. Says he, <hi rend="italic">If wild Mans come, they eat me, you go
                  wey.</hi> Well, <hi rend="italic">Xury,</hi> said I, we will both go, and if the wild Man's come
               we will kill them, they shall Eat neither of us; so I gave <hi rend="italic">Xury</hi> a piece of
               Rusk-bread to Eat and a Dram out of our Patroons Case of
               Bottles which I mentioned before; and we hal'd the Boat in as near the Shoar as we
               thought was proper, and so waded on Shoar, carrying nothing
               but our Arms and two Jarrs for Water.</p>
            <p>I did not care to go out of Sight of the Boat, fearing the coming of Canoes with
                  <hi rend="italic">Savages</hi> down the River; but the Boy seeing a low Place about a Mile up
               the Country rambled to it; and by and by I saw him come running towards me, I thought
               he was pursued by some Savage, or <pb n="29" /> frighted with
               some wild Beast, and I run forward towards him to help him, but when I came nearer to him, I saw something hanging over his Shoulders which
               was a Creature that he had shot, like a Hare but different in Colour, and longer
               Legs, however we were very glad of it, and it was very good Meat; but the great Joy
               that poor <hi rend="italic">Xury</hi> came with, was to tell me he had found good Water and seen no
               wild Mans.</p>
            <p>But we found afterwards that we need not take such Pains for Water, for a little
               higher up the Creek where we were, we found the Water fresh when the Tide was out,
               which flowed but a little way up; so we filled our Jarrs and feasted on the Hare we
               had killed, and prepared to go on our Way, having seen no Foot-steps of any humane
               Creature in that part of the Country.</p>
            <p>As I had been one Voyage to this Coast before, I knew very well that the Islands of
               the <ref target="canaries_" corresp="canaries">Canaries,</ref> and the <hi rend="italic">Cape de
                  Verd</hi> Islands also, lay not far off from the Coast <note
                  resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="canaries" target="canaries_" type="gloss"
                  >There is a geographical inconsistency here. Crusoe and Xury are somewhere along
                  the southwest Moroccan coast if the Canary Islands are close by. Therefore, they
                  are to the southwest of their starting point at Salé, which is in northwest Morocco. However, Crusoe claims to have sailed south
                  and east of Salé - this is, in fact, impossible, since traveling southeast of Salé
                  would entail going inland.</note>. But as I had no Instruments to take an
               Observation to know what Latitude we were in, and did not exactly know, or at least
                  remember what Latitude they were in; I knew not where to
               look for them, or when to stand off to Sea towards them; otherwise I might now easily
               have found some of these Islands. But my hope was, that if I stood along this Coast
               till I came to that Part where the <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Traded, I should find some of
               their Vessels upon their usual Design of Trade, that would relieve and take us
               in.</p>
            <p>By the best of my Calculation, that Place were I now was, must be that Country, which
               lying between the Emperor of <hi rend="italic">Morocco</hi>'s Dominions
               and the <hi rend="italic">Negro</hi>'s, lies wast and uninhabited, except by wild Beasts; the
                  <hi rend="italic">Negroes</hi> having abandon'd it and gone farther South for fear of the
                  <hi rend="italic">Moors</hi>; and the <hi rend="italic">Moors</hi>
               <pb n="30" /> not thinking it worth inhabiting, by reason of
               its Barrenness; and indeed both forsaking it because of the prodigious Numbers of
               Tygers, Lyons, Leopards and other furious Creatures which harbour there; so that the <hi rend="italic">Moors</hi> use it for their Hunting only, where they go like an Army, two or three thousand Men at a time; and
               indeed for near an hundred Miles together upon this Coast, we saw nothing but a wast
               uninhabited Country, by Day; and heard nothing but Howlings and Roaring of wild
               Beasts, by Night.</p>
            <p>Once or twice in the Day time, I thought I saw the <hi rend="italic">Pico</hi> of
                  <hi rend="italic">Teneriffe,</hi> being the high top of the Mountain <hi rend="italic">Teneriffe</hi> in the
                  <hi rend="italic">Canaries</hi>; and had a great mind to venture out in hopes of reaching
               thither; but having tried twice I was forced in again by contrary Winds, the Sea also
               going too high for my little Vessel, so I resolved to pursue my first Design and keep
               along the Shoar.</p>
            <p>Several times I was obliged to land for fresh Water, after we had left this Place;
               and once in particular, being early in the Morning, we came to an Anchor under a
               little Point of Land which was pretty high, and the Tide beginning to flow, we lay
               still to go farther in; <hi rend="italic">Xury,</hi> whose Eyes were more about him than it seems
               mine were, calls softly to me, and tells me that we had best go farther off the
               Shoar; for, says he, look yonder lies a dreadful Monster on the side of that Hillock
               fast asleep: I look'd where he pointed, and saw a dreadful Monster indeed, for it was
               a terrible great Lyon that lay on the Side of the Shoar, under the Shade of a Piece
               of the Hill that hung as it were a little over him. <hi rend="italic">Xury,</hi> says I, you shall
               go on Shoar and kill him; <hi rend="italic">Xury</hi> look'd frighted, and said, <hi rend="italic">Me kill! he
                  eat me at one Mouth</hi>; one Mouthful he meant; however, I said no more to the
               Boy, but <pb n="31" /> bad him lye still, and I took our
               biggest Gun, which was almost <ref target="bore_" corresp="bore"

                  xml:id="slug" target="slug_" type="gloss">Bullets</note>, and laid it down; then I
               loaded another Gun with two Bullets, and the third, for we had three Pieces, I loaded
               with five smaller Bullets. I took the best aim I could with the first Piece to have
               shot him into the Head, but he lay so with his Leg rais'd a little above his Nose,
               at first, but finding his Leg broke fell down again, and then got up upon three Legs
               and gave the most hideous Roar that ever I heard; I was a little suppriz'd that I had
               not hit him on the Head; however I took up the second Piece immediately, and tho' he
               began to move off fir'd again, and shot him into the Head, and had the Pleasure to
               see him drop, and make but little Noise, but lay struggling for Life. Then
                  <hi rend="italic">Xury</hi> took Heart, and would have me let him go on Shoar: Well, go said I,
               so the Boy jump'd into the Water, and taking a little Gun in
               one Hand swam to Shoar with the other Hand, and coming close to the Creature, put the
               Muzzle of the Piece to his Ear, and shot him into the Head again which dispatch'd him quite.</p>
            <p>This was Game indeed to us, but this was no Food, and I was very sorry to lose three
               Charges of Powder and Shot upon a Creature that was good for nothing to us. However
                  <hi rend="italic">Xury</hi> said he would have some of him; so he comes on board, and ask'd me
               to give him the Hatchet; for what, <hi rend="italic">Xury,</hi> said I? <hi rend="italic">Me cut off his
                  Head,</hi> said he. However <hi rend="italic">Xury</hi> could not cut
               off his Head, but he cut off a Foot and brought it with him, and it was a monstrous
               great one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" />I bethought my self however, that perhaps the
               Skin of him might one way or other be of some Value to us; and I resolved to take off
               his Skin if I could. So <hi rend="italic">Xury</hi> and I went to work with him; but <hi rend="italic">Xury</hi>
               was much the better Workman at it, for I knew very ill how to do it. Indeed it took
               us up both the whole Day, but at last we got of the Hide of him, and spreading it on
               the top of our Cabbin, the Sun effectually dried it in two Days time, and it
               afterwards serv'd me to lye upon.</p>

            <p>When I had pursued this Resolution about ten Days longer, as I have said, I began to
               see that the Land was inhabited, and in two or three Places as we sailed by, we saw
               People stand upon the Shoar to look at us, we could also perceive they were quite
               Black and Stark-naked. I was once inclin'd to ha' gone on Shoar to them; but
                  <hi rend="italic">Xury</hi> was my better Councellor, and said to me, <hi rend="italic">no go, no go</hi>;
               however I hal'd in nearer the Shoar that I might talk to them, and I found they run
               along the Shoar by me a good way; I observ'd they had <pb n="33"
                  /> no Weapons in their Hands, except one who had a long
               slender Stick, which <hi rend="italic">Xury</hi> said was a Lance, and that they would throw them a
               great way with good aim; so I kept at a distance, but talk'd with them by Signs as
               well as I could; and particularly made Signs for some thing to Eat, they beckon'd to
               me to stop my Boat, and that they would fetch me some Meat; upon this I lower'd the
               top of my Sail, and lay by, and two of them run up into the Country, and in less than
               half an Hour came back and brought with them two Pieces of dry Flesh and some Corn,
               such as is the Produce of their Country, but we neither knew what the one or the
               other was; however we were willing to accept it, but how to come at it was our next
               Dispute, for I was not for venturing on Shore to them, and they were as much affraid
               of us; but they took a safe way for us all, for they brought it to the Shore and laid
               it down, and went and stood a great way off till we fetch'd it on Board, and then
               came close to us again.</p>
            <p>We made Signs of Thanks to them, for we had nothing to make them amends; but an
                  Opportunity offer'd that very Instant to oblige them
                  wonderfully, for while we were lying by the Shore, came
               two mighty Creatures one pursuing the other, (as we took it) with great Fury, from
               the Mountains towards the Sea; whether it was the Male pursuing the Female, or
               whether they were in Sport or in Rage, we could not tell, any more than we could tell
                  whether it was usual or strange, but I believe it was the
               latter; because in the first Place, those ravenous Creatures seldom appear but in the
               Night; and in the second Place, we found the People terribly frighted, especially the
               Women. The Man that had the Lance or Dart did not fly from them, but the rest did;
               however as the two Creatures <pb n="34" /> ran directly into
               the Water, they did not seem to offer to fall upon any of
               the <hi rend="italic">Negroes,</hi> but plung'd themselves into the Sea and swam about as if they
               had come for their Diversion; at last one of them began to come nearer our Boat than
               at first I expected, but I lay ready for him, for I had loaded my Gun with all
               possible Expedition, and bad <hi rend="italic">Xury</hi> load both the other; as soon as he came
               fairly within my reach, I fir'd, and shot him directly into
               the Head; immediately he sunk down into the Water, but rose instantly and plung'd up
               and down as if he was struggling for Life; and so indeed he was, he immediately made
               to the Shore, but between the Wound which was his mortal Hurt, and the strangling of
               the Water, he dyed just before he reach'd the Shore.</p>
            <p>It is impossible to express the Astonishment of these poor Creatures at the Noise and
               the Fire of my Gun; some of them were even ready to dye for Fear, and fell down as
               Dead with the very Terror. But when they saw the Creature dead and sunk in the Water,
               and that I made Signs to them to come to the Shore; they took Heart and came to the
               Shore and began to search for the Creature, I found him by his Blood staining the
               Water, and by the help of a Rope which I slung round him and gave the
                  <hi rend="italic">Negroes</hi> to hawl, they drag'd him on Shore, and found that it was a most
               curious Leopard, spotted and fine to an admirable Degree,
               and the <hi rend="italic">Negroes</hi> held up their Hands with Admiration to think what it was I
               had kill'd him with.</p>
            <p>The other Creature frighted with the flash of Fire and the Noise of the Gun swam on
               Shore, and ran up directly to the Mountains from whence they came, nor could I at
               that Distance know what it was. I found quickly the <hi rend="italic">Negroes</hi> were for eating
               the Flesh of this Creature, so I was willing <pb n="35"/> to have them take it as a Favour from me, which when I
               made Signs to them that they might take him, they were very thankful for, immediately they fell to work with him, and tho' they had no Knife,
               yet with a sharpen'd Piece of Wood they took off his Skin as readily, and much more
               readily than we cou'd have done with a Knife; they offer'd me some of the Flesh,
               which I declined, making as if I would give it them, but made Signs for the Skin,
               which they gave me very freely, and brought me a great deal more of their Provision,
               which tho' I did not understand, yet I accepted; then I made Signs to them for some
               Water, and held out one of my Jarrs to them, turning it bottom upward, to shew that it was empty, and that I wanted to have
               it filled. They call'd immediately to some of their Friends, and there came two Women and brought a great Vessel made of Earth, and burnt as I
               suppose in the Sun; this they set down for me, as before, and I sent <hi rend="italic">Xury</hi> on
               Shore with my Jarrs, and filled them all three: The Women
               were as stark Naked as the Men.</p>
            <p>I was now furnished with Roots and Corn, such as it was, and Water, and leaving my
               friendly <hi rend="italic">Negroes,</hi> I made forward for about eleven
               Days more without offering to go near the Shoar, till I saw the Land run out a great
               Length into the Sea, at about the Distance of four or five
               Leagues before me, and the Sea being very calm I kept a large, offing to make this
               Point; at length, doubling the Point at about two Leagues from the Land, I saw
               plainly Land on the other Side to Seaward; then I concluded, as it was most certain
               indeed, that this was the <hi rend="italic">Cape de Verd,</hi> and those the <hi rend="italic">Islands,</hi> call'd from thence <hi rend="italic">Cape de Verd
                  Islands.</hi> However they were at a great Distance, and I could not well tell
               what I had best to do, for if I <pb n="36" /> should be taken
               with a Fresh of Wind I might neither reach one or other.</p>
            <p>In this Dilemna, as I was very pensive, I stept into the Cabbin and sat me down,
                  <hi rend="italic">Xury</hi> having the Helm, when on a suddain the Boy cry'd out, <hi rend="italic">Master,
                  Master, a Ship with a Sail,</hi> and the foolish Boy was frighted out of his Wits,
               thinking it must needs be some of his Master's Ships sent to pursue us, when, I knew
               we were gotten far enough out of their reach. I jump'd out of the Cabbin, and
               immediately saw not only the Ship, but what she was, (<hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>) that it was a
                  <hi rend="italic">Portuguese</hi> Ship, and as I thought was bound to the Coast of
                  <hi rend="italic">Guinea</hi> for <hi rend="italic">Negroes.</hi> But when I observ'd the Course she steer'd,
               I was soon convinc'd they were bound some other way, and did not design to come any
               nearer to the Shoar; upon which I stretch'd out to Sea as much as I could, resolving
               to speak with them if possible.</p>
            <p>With all the Sail I could make, I found I should not be able to come in their Way,
               but that they would be gone by, before I could make any Signal to them; but after I
               had crowded to the utmost, and began to despair, they it seems saw me by the help of
               their Perspective-Glasses, and that it was some <hi rend="italic">European</hi> Boat, which as they
               supposed must belong to some Ship that was lost, so they shortned Sail to let me come up. I was encouraged with this, and as I had my Patroon's
               Antient on Board, I made a Waft of it to them for a Signal of Distress, and fir'd a
               Gun, both which they saw, for they told me they saw the Smoke, tho' they did not hear
               the Gun; upon these Signals they very kindly brought too, and lay by for me, and in
                  about three Hours time I came up with them.</p>
            <p>They ask'd me what I was, in <hi rend="italic">Portuguese,</hi> and in <hi rend="italic">Spanish,</hi> and in
                  <hi rend="italic">French,</hi> but I understood none of <pb n="37" />
               them; but at last a <hi rend="italic">Scots</hi> Sailor who was on board, call'd to me, and I
               answer'd him, and told him I was an <hi rend="italic">Englishman,</hi> that I had made my escape
               out of Slavery from the <hi rend="italic">Moors</hi> at <hi rend="italic">Sallee</hi>; then they bad me come on
               board, and very kindly took me in, and all my Goods.</p>
            <p>It was an inexpressible Joy to me, that any one will believe, that I was thus
               deliver'd, as I esteem'd it, from such a miserable and
               almost hopeless Condition as I was in, and I immediately
                  offered all I had to the Captain of the Ship, as a Return
               for my Deliverance; but he generously told me, he would take nothing from me, but
               that all I had should be deliver'd safe to me when I came to the <hi rend="italic">Brasils,</hi>
               for says he, <hi rend="italic">I have sav'd your Life on no other Terms than I would be glad to be
                  saved my self, and it may one time or other be my Lot to be taken up in the same
                  Condition; besides,</hi> said he, <hi rend="italic">when I carry you to the</hi> Brasils, <hi rend="italic">so
                  great a way from your own Country, if I should take from you what you have, you
                  will be starved there, and then I only take away that Life I have given. No, no,
                  Seignor</hi> Inglese, says he, <hi rend="italic">Mr.</hi> Englishman, <hi rend="italic">I will carry you
                  thither in Charity, and those things will help you to buy your Subsistance there
                  and your Passage home again.</hi>

               own Possession, and gave me back an exact Inventory of them, that I might have them,
               even so much as my three Earthen Jarrs.</p>
            <p>As to my Boat it was a very good one, and that he saw, and told me he would buy it of
               me for the Ship's use, and ask'd me what I would have for it? I told him he had been
               so generous to me in every thing, that I could not offer to make any <pb n="38" /> Price of the Boat,
               but left it entirely to him, upon which he told me he would give me a Note of his

               one offer'd to give more he would make it up; he offer'd me

               that I was not willing to let the Captain have him, but I was very loath to sell the
               poor Boy's Liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in
               procuring my own. However when I let him know my Reason. he
               own'd it to be just, and offer'd me this Medium, that he would give the Boy an
               Obligation to set him free in ten Years, if he turn'd Christian; upon this, and
                  <hi rend="italic">Xury</hi> saying he was willing to go to him, I let the Captain have him.</p>
            <p>We had a very good Voyage to the <hi rend="italic">Brasils,</hi> and arriv'd in the <hi rend="italic">Bay de Todos los Santos,</hi> or <ref target="allsaints_"

                  century and instituted the lucrative sugar plantation system, which relied on
                  African and Native American slave labor. In the seventeenth century, Brazil was
                  the world's leading exporter of sugar.</note>. I lived with him some time, and
               acquainted my self by that means with the Manner of their planting and making of
               Sugar; and seeing how well the Planters liv'd, and how they grew rich suddenly, I
               resolv'd, if I could get Licence to settle there, I would turn Planter among them,
               resolving in the mean time to find out some Way to get my Money which I had left in
                  <hi rend="italic">London</hi> remitted to me. To this Purpose getting a kind of a Letter of
               Naturalization, I purchased as much Land that was Uncur'd, as my Money would reach,
               and form'd a Plan for my Plantation and Settlement, and such
               a one as might be suitable to the Stock which I proposed to my self to receive from
                  <hi rend="italic">England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had a Neighbour, a <hi rend="italic">Portugueze</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Lisbon,</hi> but born of
                  <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Parents, whose Name was <hi rend="italic">Wells,</hi> and in much such
               Circumstances as I was. I call him my Neighbour, because his Plantation lay next to
               mine, and we went on very sociably together. My Stock was but low as well as his; and
               we rather planted for Food than any thing else, for about two Years. However, we
               began to increase, and our Land began to come into Order; so that the third Year we
               planted some Tobacco, and made each of us a large Piece of Ground ready for planting
               Canes in the Year to come; but we both wanted Help, and now I found more than before,
               I had done wrong in parting with my Boy <hi rend="italic">Xury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But alas! for me to do wrong that never did right, was no great Wonder: I had no
               Remedy but to go on; I was gotten into an Employment quite remote to my Genius, and
               directly contrary to the Life I delighted in, and for which I forsook my Father's House, and broke thro' all his good Advice; nay, I
               was coming into the very Middle Station, or upper Degree of low Life, which my Father
                  advised me to before; and which if I resolved to go on
                  <pb n="40" /> with, I might as well ha' staid at Home, and
               never have fatigu'd my self in the World as I had done; and I used often to say to my
               self, I could ha' done this as well in <hi rend="italic">England</hi> among my Friends, as ha' gone
               5000 Miles off to do it among Strangers and Salvages in a Wilderness, and at such a
               Distance, as never to hear from any Part of the World that had the least Knowledge of
               me.</p>
            <p>In this manner I used to look upon my Condition with the utmost Regret. I had no body
               to converse with but now and then this Neighbour; no Work to
               be done, but by the Labour of my Hands; and I used to say, I liv'd just like a Man
               cast away upon some desolate Island, that had no body there but himself. But how just
               has it been, and how should all Men reflect, that when they compare their present Conditions with others that are worse, Heaven may
               oblige them to make the Exchange, and be convinc'd of their former Felicity by their
                  Experience: I say, how just has it been, that the truly
                  solitary Life I reflected on in an Island of meer
                  Desolation should be my Lot, who had so often unjustly
               compar'd it with the Life which I then led, in which had I continued, I had in all
               Probability been exceeding prosperous and rich.</p>
            <p>I was in some Degree settled in my Measures for carrying on the Plantation, before my
               kind Friend the Captain of the Ship that took me up at Sea, went back; for the Ship
               remained there in providing his Loading, and preparing for
               his Voyage, near three Months, when telling him what little Stock I had left behind
               me in <hi rend="italic">London,</hi> he gave me this friendly and sincere Advice, <hi rend="italic">Seignior

            <p>This was so wholesom Advice, and look'd so friendly, that I could not but be
               convinc'd it was the best Course I could take; so I accordingly prepared Letters to
               the Gentlewoman with whom I had left my Money, and a Procuration to the
                  <hi rend="italic">Portuguese</hi> Captain, as he desired.</p>
            <p>I wrote the <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Captain's Widow a full Account of all my Adventures, my
               Slavery, Escape, and how I had met with the <hi rend="italic">Portugal</hi> Captain at Sea, the
                  Humanity of his Behaviour, and in what Condition I was
               now in, with all other necessary Directions for my Supply; and when this honest
               Captain came to <hi rend="italic">Lisbon,</hi> he found means by some of the <hi rend="italic">English</hi>
               Merchants there, to send over not the Order only, but a full Account of my Story to a
               Merchant at <hi rend="italic">London,</hi> who represented it effectually to her; whereupon, she
               not only delivered the Money, but out of her own Pocket sent the <hi rend="italic">Portugal</hi>
               Captain a very handsom Present for his Humanity and Charity
               to me.</p>
            <p>The Merchant in <hi rend="italic">London</hi> vesting this Hundred Pounds in <hi rend="italic">English</hi>
               Goods, such as the Captain had writ for, sent them directly to him at
                  <hi rend="italic">Lisbon,</hi> and he brought them all safe to me to the <hi rend="italic">Brasils,</hi> among
               which, without my Direction (for I was too young in my Business to think of them) he
               had taken Care to have all Sorts of Tools, Iron-Work, and Utensils <pb n="42" /> necessary for my Plantation, and which
               were of great Use to me.</p>
            <p>When this Cargo arrived, I thought my Fortunes made, for I was surprised with the Joy
               of it; and my good Steward the Captain had laid out the Five Pounds which my Friend
               had sent him for a Present for himself, to purchase, and
               bring me over a Servant under Bond for six Years Service, and would not accept of any
               Consideration, except a little Tobacco, which I would have
               him accept, being of my own Produce.</p>
            <p>Neither was this all; but my Goods being all <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Manufactures, such as
               Cloath, Stuffs, Bays, and things particularly valuable and desirable in the Country,
               I found means to sell them to a very great Advantage; so that I might say, I had more
               than four times the Value of my first Cargo, and was now infinitely beyond my poor
               Neighbour, I mean in the Advancement of my Plantation; for the first thing I did, I
               bought me a Negro Slave, and an <hi rend="italic">European</hi> Servant also; I mean another
               besides that which the Captain brought me from <hi rend="italic">Lisbon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as abus'd Prosperity is oftentimes made the very Means of our greatest Adversity,
               so was it with me. I went on the next Year with great Success in my Plantation: I
               raised fifty great Rolls of Tobacco on my own Ground, more
               than I had disposed of for Necessaries among my Neighbours; and these fifty Rolls
               being each of above a <ref target="hundredweight2_" corresp="hundredweight2">100

               my self good in a fair and plain pursuit of those Prospects and those measures of
               Life, which Nature and Providence concurred to present me with, and to make my

            <p>As I had once done thus in my breaking away from my Parents, so I could not be

               pursue a rash and immoderate Desire of rising faster than the Nature of the Thing
                  admitted; and thus I cast my self down again into the

               with Life and a State Health of in the World.</p>

            <p>To come then by just Degrees, to the Particulars of this
               Part of my Story; you may suppose, that having now lived
               almost four Years in the <hi rend="italic">Brasilo,</hi> and beginning to thrive and prosper very well upon my Plantation; I had not only learn'd the
               Language, but had contracted Acquaintance and Friendship among my Fellow-Planters, as
               well as among the Merchants at St. <hi rend="italic">Salvadore,</hi> which was our Port; and that
               in my Discourses among <pb n="44" /> them, I had frequently
               given them an Account of my two Voyages to the Coast of <hi rend="italic">Guinea,</hi> the manner
               of Trading with the <hi rend="italic">Negroes</hi> there, and how easy it was to purchase upon the
               Coast, for Trifles, such as Beads, Toys, Knives, Scissars, Hatchets, bits of Glass,
               and the like; not only Gold Dust, <hi rend="italic">Guinea</hi> Grains, Elephants Teeth,
                  <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> but <hi rend="italic">Negroes</hi> for the Service of the <hi rend="italic">Brasils,</hi> in
               great Numbers.</p>
            <p>They listened always very attentively to my Discourses on these Heads, but especially
               to that Part which related to the buying <hi rend="italic">Negroes,</hi> which was a Trade at that
               time not only not far entred into, but as far as it was, had been carried on by the

                  >The asiento was the contract to provide slaves to the Spanish and Portuguese
                  colonies in the Americas. At the time of the publication of Robinson Crusoe, the
                  contract was held by Great Britain, which could not exercise it in 1718 and 1719
                  due to the outbreak of war with Spain. The language here makes it seem as though
                  African slaves were rare in Brazil, but in reality, the sugar and tobacco
                  plantations of colonial Brazil were heavily dependent on slave labor and the
                  trans-Atlantic slave trade. In 1888, Brazil became the last country in the Western
                  world to abolish slavery.</note>, or Permission of the Kings of <hi rend="italic">Spain</hi> and

            <p>It happen'd, being in Company with some Merchants and
               Planters of my Acquaintance, and talking of those things very earnestly, three of
               them came to me the next Morning, and told me they had been musing very much upon
               what I had discoursed with them of, the last Night, and they came to make a secret
               Proposal to me; and after enjoining me Secrecy, they told me, that they had a mind to

               Voyage, to bring the <hi rend="italic">Negroes</hi> on Shoar privately, and divide them among their
               own Plantations; and in a Word, the Question was, whether I would go their
               Super-Cargo in the Ship to manage the Trading Part upon the Coast <pb n="45"
                  /> of <hi rend="italic">Guinea</hi>? And they offer'd me that I should
               have my equal Share of the <hi rend="italic">Negroes</hi> without providing any Part of the
               Stock.</p>
            <p>This was a fair Proposal it must be confess'd, had it been made to any one that had
               not had a Settlement and Plantation of his own to look after, which was in a fair way
               of coming to be very Considerable, and with a good Stock upon it. But for me that was
               thus entered and established, and had nothing to do but go on as I had begun for
               three or four Years more, and to have sent for the other hundred Pound from
                  <hi rend="italic">England,</hi> and who in that time, and with that little Addition, could
               scarce ha' fail'd of being worth three or four thousand
               Pounds Sterling, and that encreasing too; for me to think of such a Voyage, was the
               most prepostorous Thing that ever Man in such Circumstances could be guilty of.</p>
            <p>But I that was born to be my own Destroyer, could no more resist the Offer than I
               could restrain my first rambling Designs, when my Father's good Counsel was lost upon me. In a word, I told them
               I would go with all my Heart, if they would undertake to look after my Plantation in
               my Absence, and would dispose of it to such as I should direct if I miscarry'd. This
               they all engag'd to do, and entred into Writings or Covenants to do so; and I made a formal Will, disposing of my
               Plantation and Effects, in Case of my Death, making the Captain of the Ship that had
               sav'd my Life as before, my universal Heir, but obliging him to dispose of my Effects
               as I had directed in my Will, one half of the Produce being
               to himself, and the other to be ship'd to <hi rend="italic">England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In short, I took all possible Caution to preserve my Effects, and keep up my
               Plantation; had I used half as much Prudence to have look'd
               into my <pb n="46" /> own Intrest, and have made a Judgment
               of what I ought to have done, and not to have done, I had certainly never gone away
               from so prosperous an Undertaking, leaving all the probable
               Views of a thriving Circumstance, and gone upon a Voyage to
               Sea, attended with all its common Hazards; to say nothing of
               the Reasons I had to expect particular Misfortunes to my self.</p>
            <p>But I was hurried on, and obey'd blindly the Dictates of my Fancy rather than my
               Reason; and accordingly the Ship being fitted out, and the Cargo furnished, and all
               things done as by Agreement, by my Partners in the Voyage. I
               went on Board in an evil Hour, the _____ th of _____ , being the same Day eight Year that I went from my Father and Mother at <hi rend="italic">Hull,</hi> in order to act the Rebel to their Authority, and
               the Fool to my own Interest.</p>
            <p>Our Ship was about 120 Tun Burthen, carried 6 Guns, and 14 Men, besides the Master,
               his Boy, and my self; we had on board no large Cargo of Goods, except of such Toys as
               were fit for our Trade with the <hi rend="italic">Negroes,</hi> such as Beads, bits of Glass,
               Shells, and odd Trifles, especially little Looking-Glasses, Knives, Scissars,
               Hatchets, and the like.</p>
            <p>The same Day I went on board we set sail, standing away to the Northward upon our own
               Coast, with Design to stretch over for the <hi rend="italic">Affrican</hi> Coast, when they came
               about 10 or 12 Degrees of Northern Latitude, which it seems was the manner of their Course in those Days. We had very good Weather,

               nothing but drive, and scudding away before it, let it carry us whither ever Fate and

               and to our selves.</p>
            <p>With this Design we chang'd our Course and steer'd away <hi rend="italic">N. W.</hi> by <hi rend="italic">W.</hi>
               in order to reach some of our <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Islands, where I hoped for Relief; but our Voyage was otherwise determined, for being in
               the Latitude of 12 Deg. 18 Min. a second Storm came upon us, which carry'd us away with the same Impetuosity Westward, and drove us so out
               of the very Way of all humane Commerce, that had all our Lives been saved, as to the
               Sea, we were rather in Danger of being devoured by Savages
               than ever returning to our own Country.</p>
            <p>In this Distress, the Wind still blowing very hard, one of our Men early in the
               Morning, cry'd out, <hi rend="italic">Land</hi>; and we had no sooner run out of the Cabbin to look
               out in hopes of seeing where abouts in the World we were; but the Ship struck upon a
               Sand, and in a moment her Motion being so stopp'd, the Sea broke over her in such a
               manner, that we expected we should all have perish'd
               immediately, and we were immediately driven into our close
               Quarters to shelter us from the very Foam and Sprye of the Sea.</p>
            <p>It is not easy for any one, who has not been in the like Condition, to describe or
               conceive the Consternation of Men in such Circumstances; we knew nothing where we
               were, or upon what Land it was we were driven, whether an Island or the Main, whether
               inhabited or not inhabited; and as the Rage of the Wind was still great, tho' rather less than at first, we could not so much as <pb n="49"
                  /> hope to have the Ship hold many Minutes without breaking in Pieces, unless the Winds by a kind of
               Miracle should turn immediately about. In a word, we sat looking upon one another,
               and expecting Death every Moment, and every Man acting accordingly, as preparing for
               another World, for there was little or nothing more for us to do in this; that which
               was our present Comfort, and all the Comfort we had, was, that contrary to our
               Expectation the Ship did not break yet, and that the Master said the Wind began to
                  abate.</p>
            <p>Now tho' we thought that the Wind did a little abate, yet
               the Ship having thus struck upon the Sand, and sticking too fast for us to expect her
               getting off, we were in a dreadful Condition indeed, and had nothing to do but to
               think of saving our Lives as well as we could; we had a Boat
               at our Stern just before the Storm, but she was first <ref target="stave_"
                  corresp="stave">stav'd</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="stave"

               the Ship's Rudder, and in the next Place she broke away, and
                  either sunk or was driven off to Sea, so there was no
               hope from her; we had another Boat on board, but how to get her off into the Sea, was
               a doubtful thing; however there was no room to debate, for
               we fancy'd the Ship would break in Pieces every Minute, and
               some told us she was actually broken already.</p>
            <p>In this Distress the Mate of our Vessel lays hold of the Boat, and with the help of
               the rest of the Men, they got her slung over the Ship's-side, and getting all into
               her, let go, and committed our selves being Eleven in Number, to God's Mercy, and the
               wild Sea; for tho' the Storm was abated considerably, yet the Sea went dreadful high
                  upon the Shore, and might well be call'd, <ref

            <p>
               <pb n="50" />And now our Case was very dismal indeed; for we
               all saw plainly, that the Sea went so high, that the Boat could not live, and that we
               should be inevitably drowned. As to making Sail, we had
               none, nor, if we had, could we ha' done any thing with it; so we work'd at the Oar
               towards the Land, tho' with heavy Hearts, like Men going to Execution; for we all knew, that when the Boat came nearer the
               Shore, she would be dash'd in a Thousand Pieces by the
               Breach of the Sea. However, we committed our Souls to God in the most earnest Manner,
               and the Wind driving us towards the Shore, we hasten'd our Destruction with our own
               Hands, pulling as well as we could towards Land.</p>
            <p>What the Shore was, whether Rock or Sand, whether Steep or Shoal, we knew not; the
               only Hope that could rationally give us the least Shadow of Expectation, was, if we
               might happen into some Bay or Gulph, or the Mouth of some River, where by great
               Chance we might have run our Boat in, or got <ref target="leeland_" corresp="leeland"

               made smooth Water. But there was nothing of this appeared; but as we made nearer and
               nearer the Shore, the Land look'd more frightful than the Sea.</p>

               Moment.</p>
            <p>Nothing can describe the Counfusion of Thought which I felt when I sunk into the
               Water; for tho' I swam very well, yet I could not deliver my self from the Waves so
               as to draw Breath, till that Wave <pb n="51" /> having driven
               me, or rather carried me a vast Way on towards the Shore, and having spent it self,
               went back, and left me upon the Land almost dry, but half-dead with the Water I took
               in. I had so much Presence of Mind as well as Breath left, that seeing my self nearer
               the main Land than I expected, I got upon my Feet, and endeavoured to make on towards
               the Land as fast as I could, before another Wave should return, and take me up again.
               But I soon found it was impossible to avoid it; for I saw the Sea come after me as
               high as a great Hill, and as furious as an Enemy which I had no Means or Strength to
               contend with; my Business was to hold my Breath, and raise my self upon the Water, if
               I could; and so by swimming to preserve my Breathing, and
               Pilot my self towards the Shore, if possible; my greatest
               Concern now being, that the Sea, as it would carry me a great Way towards the Shore
               when it came on, might not carry me back again with it when it gave back towards the
               Sea.</p>
            <p>The Wave that came upon me again, buried me at once 20 or 30 Foot deep in its own
               Body; and I could feel my self carried with a mighty Force and Swiftness towards the
               Shore a very great Way; but I held my Breath, and assisted my self to swim still
               forward with all my Might. I was ready to burst with holding my Breath, when, as I
               felt my self rising up, so to my immediate Relief, I found my Head and Hands shoot
               out above the Surface of the Water; and tho' it was not two Seconds of Time that I
               could keep my self so, yet it reliev'd me greatly, gave me Breath and new Courage. I
               was covered again with Water a good while, but not so long but I held it out; and
               finding the Water had spent it self, and began to return, I strook forward against the Return of the Waves, and felt Ground again
               with my Feet. I stood still a few <pb n="52" /> Moments to
               recover Breath, and till the Water went from me, and then took to my Heels, and run
               with what Strength I had farther towards the Shore. But neither would this deliver me
               from the Fury of the Sea, which came pouring in after me again, and twice more I was
               lifted up by the Waves, and carried forwards as before, the Shore being very
               flat.</p>
            <p>The last Time of these two had well near been fatal to me; for the Sea having hurried
               me along as before, landed me, or rather dash'd me against a Piece of a Rock, and
               that with such Force, as it left me senseless, and indeed helpless, as to my own
               Deliverance; for the Blow taking my Side and Breast, beat the Breath as it were quite
               out of my Body; and had it returned again immediately, I must have been strangled in
               the Water; but I recover'd a little before the return of the
               Waves, and seeing I should be cover'd again with the Water, I resolv'd to hold fast
               by a Piece of the Rock, and so to hold my Breath, if possible, till the Wave went
               back; now as the Waves were not so high as at first, being nearer Land, I held my
               Hold till the Wave abated, and then fetch'd another Run,
               which brought me so near the Shore, that the next Wave, tho' it went over me, yet did
               not so swallow me up as to carry me away, and the next run I took, I got to the main
               Land, where, to my great Comfort, I clamber'd up the Clifts of the Shore, and sat me
               down upon the Grass, free from Danger, and quite out of the Reach of the Water.</p>
            <p>I was now landed, and safe on Shore, and began to look up and thank God that my Life
               was sav'd in a Case wherein there was some Minutes before scarce any room to hope. I
               believe it is impossible to express to the Life what the
               Extasies and Transports of <pb n="53" /> the Soul are, when
               it is so sav'd, as I may say, out of the very Grave; and I do not wonder now at that

            <p>I walk'd about on the Shore, lifting up my Hands, and my whole Being, as I may say,
               wrapt up in the Contemplation of my Deliverance, making a Thousand Gestures and Motions which I cannot describe, reflecting upon all my Comerades
               that were drown'd, and that there should not be one Soul sav'd but my self; for, as
               for them, I never saw them afterwards, or any Sign of them, except three of their
               Hats, one Cap, and two Shoes that were <ref target="shoes_" corresp="shoes">not

            <p>I cast my Eyes to the stranded Vessel, when the Breach and Froth of the Sea being so
               big, I could hardly see it, it lay so far off, and considered, Lord! how was it
               possible I could get on Shore?</p>
            <p>After I had solac'd my Mind with the comfortable Part of my Condition, I began to
               look round me to see what kind of Place I was in, and what was next to be done, and I
               soon found my Comforts abate, and that in a word I had a dreadful Deliverance: For I
               was wet, had no Clothes to shift me, nor any thing either to eat or drink to comfort
               me, neither did I see any Prospect before me, but that of
               perishing with Hunger, or being devour'd by wild Beasts; and that which was
               particularly afflicting to me, was, that I had no Weapon either to hunt <pb n="54"
                  /> and kill any Creature for my Sustenance, or to defend my self against any other Creature that might desire to
               kill me for theirs: In a Word, I had nothing about me but a
               Knife, a Tobacco-pipe, and a little Tobacco in a Box, this was all my Provision, and this threw me into terrible Agonies of Mind, that
               for a while I run about like a Mad-man; Night coming upon me, I began with a heavy
               Heart to consider what would be my Lot if there were any ravenous Beasts in that
               Country, seeing at Night they always come abroad for their Prey.</p>
            <p>All the Remedy that offer'd to my Thoughts at that Time, was, to get up into a thick
               bushy Tree like a Firr, but thorny, which grew near me, and where I resolv'd to set
               all Night, and consider the next Day what Death I should dye, for as yet I saw no
               Prospect of Life; I walk'd about a <ref target="furlong_" corresp="furlong"

               Shore, to see if I could find any fresh Water to drink,
               which I did, to my great Joy; and having drank and put a little Tobacco in my Mouth
               to prevent Hunger, I went to the Tree, and getting up into it, endeavour'd to place
               my self so, as that if I should sleep I might not fall; and having cut me a short
               Stick, like a Truncheon, for my Defence, I took up my Lodging, and having been excessively fatigu'd, I fell fast asleep, and
               slept as comfortably as, I believe, few could have done in my Condition, and found my
               self the most refresh'd with it, that I think I ever was on such an Occasion.</p>

            <p>When I wak'd it was broad Day, the Weather clear, and the Storm abated, so that the
               Sea did not rage and swell as before: But that which surpris'd me most, was, that the Ship was lifted off in the Night from the Sand where
               she lay, by the Swelling of the Tyde, and was driven up almost as far as the Rock which I first mention'd, <pb n="55"
                  /> where I had been so bruis'd by the dashing me against
               it; this being within about a Mile from the Shore where I was, and the Ship seeming to stand upright still, I wish'd my self on board, that,
               at least, I might save some necessary things for my use.</p>
            <p>When I came down from my Appartment in the Tree, I look'd about me again, and the
               first thing I found was the Boat, which lay as the Wind and the Sea had toss'd her up
               upon the Land, about two Miles on my right Hand, I walk'd as
               far as I could upon the Shore to have got to her, but found a Neck or Inlet of Water
               between me and the Boat, which was about half a Mile broad, so I came back for the
               present, being more intent upon getting at the Ship, where I hop'd to find something
               for my present Subsistence.</p>
            <p>A little after Noon I found the Sea very calm, and the Tyde ebb'd so far out, that I
               could come within a Quarter of a Mile of the Ship; and here I found a fresh renewing
               of my Grief, for I saw evidently, that if we had kept on board, we had been all safe,
               that is to say, we had all got safe on Shore, and I had not been so miserable as to
               be left entirely destitute of all Comfort and Company, as I
               now was; this forc'd Tears from my Eyes again, but as there was little Relief in
               that, I resolv'd, if possible, to get to the Ship, so I pull'd off my Clothes, for
               the Weather was hot to Extremity, and took the Water, but when I came to the Ship, my
               Difficulty was still greater to know how to get on board, for as she lay a ground,
               and high out of the Water, there was nothing within my Reach to lay hold of, I swam
               round her twice, and the second Time I spy'd a small Piece of a Rope, which I
               wonder'd I did not see at first, hang down by the Fore-Chains so low, <pb n="56"
                  /> as that with great Difficulty I got hold of it, and by
               the help of that Rope, got up into the <ref target="forecastle2_"

               had a great deal of Water in her Hold, but that she lay so on the Side of a Bank of
               hard Sand, or rather Earth, that her Stern lay lifted up upon the Bank, and her Head
               low almost to the Water; by this Means all her Quarter was free, and all that was in
               that Part was dry; for you may be sure my first Work was to search and to see what
               was spoil'd and what was free; and first I found that all the Ship's Provisions were dry and untouch'd by the Water, and being very
               well dispos'd to eat, I went to the Bread-room and fill'd my Pockets with Bisket, and eat it as I went about other things, for I had no
               time to lose; I also found some Rum in the great Cabbin, of which I took a large
               Dram, and which I had indeed need enough of to spirit me for what was before me: Now
               I wanted nothing but a Boat to furnish my self with many things which I foresaw would

               spare Yards, and two or three large sparrs of Wood, and a spare Top-mast or two in
               the Ship; I resolv'd to fall to work with these, and I flung as many of them over
               board as I could manage for their Weight, tying every one with a Rope that they might
               not drive away; when this was done I went down the Ship's Side, and pulling them to
               me, I ty'd four of them fast together at both Ends as well as I could, in the Form of
               a Raft, and laying two or three short Pieces of Plank upon them cross-ways, I found I
               could walk upon it very <pb n="57" /> well, but that it was
               not able to bear any great Weight, the Pieces being too light; so I went to work, and
               with the Carpenters Saw I cut a spare Top-mast into three Lengths, and added them to
               my Raft, with a great deal of Labour and Pains, but hope of furnishing my self with
               Necessaries, encourag'd me to go beyond what I should have been able to have done
               upon another Occasion.</p>
            <p>My Raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable Weight; my next Care was what to
               load it with, and how to preserve what I laid upon it from the Surf of the Sea; But I
               was not long considering this, I first laid all the Plank or
               Boards upon it that I could get, and having consider'd well what I most wanted, I
               first got three of the Seamens Chests, which I had broken open and empty'd, and
               lower'd them down upon my Raft; the first of these I fill'd with Provision,

               While I was doing this, I found the Tyde began to flow, tho' very calm, and I had the
               Mortification to see my Coat, Shirt, and Wast-coat which I had left on Shore upon the
               Sand, swim away; as for my Breeches which were only Linnen and open knee'd, I swam on
               board in them and my Stockings: However <pb n="58"
                  /> this put me upon rummaging for Clothes, of which I
               found enough, but took no more than I wanted for present use, for I had other things
               which my Eye was more upon, as first Tools to work with on Shore, and it was after
               long searching that I found out the Carpenter's Chest, which
               was indeed a very useful Prize to me, and much more valuable than a Ship Loading of
               Gold would have been at that time; I got it down to my Raft, even whole as it was,
               without losing time to look into it, for I knew in general what it contain'd</p>

               rusty Swords; I knew there were three Barrels of Powder in the Ship, but knew not
               where our Gunner had stow'd them, but with much search I found them, two of them dry
               and good, the third had taken Water, those two I got to my Raft, with the Arms, and
               now I thought my self pretty well freighted, and began to
               think how I should get to Shore with them, having neither Sail, Oar, or Rudder, and
               the least Cap full of Wind would have overset all my Navigation.</p>
            <p>I had three Encouragements, 1. A smooth calm Sea, 2. The Tide rising and setting in
               to the Shore, 3. What little Wind there was blew me towards the Land; and thus,
               having found two or three broken Oars belong to the Boat, and besides the Tools which were in the Chest, I found two Saws,
               an Axe, and a Hammer, and with this Cargo I put to Sea: For a Mile, or thereabouts,
               my Raft went very well, only that I found it drive a little distant from the Place
               where I had landed before, by which I perceiv'd that there
               was some <ref target="indraft_" corresp="indraft">Indraft</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="indraft"
                  target="indraft_" type="gloss">A type of current</note>
               <pb n="59" /> of the Water, and consequently I hop'd to find
               some Creek or River there, which I might make use of as a Port to get to Land with my
               Cargo.</p>
            <p>As I imagin'd, so it was, there appear'd before me a little opening of the Land, and
               I found a strong Current of the Tide set into it, so I guided my Raft as well as I could to keep in the Middle of
               the Stream: But here I had like to have suffer'd a second Shipwreck, which, if I had,
               I think verily would have broke my Heart, for knowing
               nothing of the Coast, my Raft run a-ground at one End of it upon a Shoal, and not
               being a-ground at the other End, it wanted but a little that all my Cargo had slip'd
               off towards that End that was a-float, and so fall'n into the Water: I did my utmost
               by setting my Back against the Chests, to keep them in their Places, but could not
               thrust off the Raft with all my Strength, neither durst I
               stir from the Posture I was in, but holding up the Chests with all my Might, stood in
               that Manner near half an Hour, in which time the rising of the Water brought me a
               little more upon a Level, and a little after, the Water still rising, my Raft floated
               again, and I thrust her off with the Oar I had, into the Channel, and then driving up
               higher, I at length found my self in the Mouth of a little River, with Land on both
               Sides, and a strong Current or Tide running up, I look'd on both Sides for a proper
               Place to get to Shore, for I was not willing to be driven too high up the River,
               hoping in time to see some Ship at Sea, and therefore resolv'd to place my self as
               near the Coast as I could.</p>
            <p>At length I spy'd a little Cove on the right Shore of the Creek, to which with great
               Pain and Difficulty I guided my Raft, and at last got so near, <pb n="60"
                  /> as that, reaching Ground with my Oar, I could thrust
               her directly in, but here I had like to have dipt all my Cargo in the Sea again; for
               that Shore lying pretty steep, that is to say sloping, there was no Place to land,
               but where one End of my Float, if it run on Shore, would lie so high, and the other
               sink lower as before, that it would endanger my Cargo again:
               All that I could do, was to wait 'till the Tide was at highest, keeping the Raft with
               my Oar like an Anchor to hold the Side of it fast to the Shore, near a flat Piece of
               Ground, which I expected the Water would flow over; and so it did: As soon as I found
               Water enough, for my Raft drew about a Foot Water, I thrust her on upon that flat
               Piece of Ground, and there fasten'd or mor'd her by sticking my two broken Oars into
               the Ground; one on one Side near one End, and one on the other Side near the other
               End; and thus I lay 'till the Water ebb'd away, and left my Raft and all my Cargoe
               safe on Shore.</p>
            <p>My next Work was to view the Country, and seek a proper Place for my Habitation, and
               where to stow my Goods to secure them from whatever might happen; where I was I yet
               knew not, whether on the Continent or on an Island, whether
                  inhabited or not inhabited, whether in Danger of wild
               Beasts or not: There was a Hill not above a Mile from me, which rose up very steep
               and high, and which seem'd to over-top some other Hills which lay as in a Ridge from
               it northward; I took out one of the fowling Pieces, and one of the Pistols, and an Horn of Powder, and thus arm'd I travell'd for
               Discovery up to the Top of that Hill, where after I had with great Labour and
                  Difficulty got to the Top, I saw my Fate to my great
               Affliction, (<hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>) that I was in an Island environ'd <pb n="61"
                  /> every Way with the Sea, no Land to be seen, except some Rocks which lay a great Way off, and two small
               Islands less than this, which lay about three Leagues to the West.</p>
            <p>I found also that the Island I was in was barren, and, as I
               saw good Reason to believe, un-inhabited, except by wild
               Beasts, of whom however I saw none, yet I saw Abundance of Fowls, but knew not their
               Kinds, neither when I kill'd them could I tell what was fit for Food, and what not;
               at my coming back, I shot at a great Bird which I saw sitting upon a Tree on the Side
               of a great Wood, I believe it was the first Gun that had been fir'd there since the
               Creation of the World; I had no sooner fir'd, but from all the Parts of the Wood
               there arose an innumerable Number of Fowls of many Sorts, making a confus'd
               Screaming, and crying every one according to his usual Note; but not one of them of
               any Kind that I knew: As for the Creature I kill'd, I took it to be a Kind of a Hawk,
               its Colour and Beak resembling it, but had no Talons or Claws more than common, its
               Flesh was Carrion, and fit for nothing.</p>
            <p>Contented with this Discovery, I came back to my Raft, and fell to Work to bring my
               Cargoe on Shore, which took me up the rest of that Day, and what to do with my self
               at Night I knew not, nor indeed where to rest; for I was afraid to lie down on the
               Ground, not knowing but some wild Beast might devour me, tho', as I afterwards found,
               there was really no Need for those Fears.</p>
            <p>However, as well as I could, I barricado'd my self round with the Chests and Boards
               that I had brought on Shore, and made a Kind of a Hut for that Night's Lodging; as
               for Food, I yet saw not which Way to supply my self, except that I had <pb n="62"
                  /> seen two or three Creatures like Hares run out of the
               Wood where I shot the Fowl.</p>
            <p>I now began to consider, that I might yet get a great many Things out of the Ship,
               which would be useful to me, and particularly some of the Rigging, and Sails, and such other Things as might come to Land, and I resolv'd to
               make another Voyage on Board the Vessel, if possible; and as I knew that the first
               Storm that blew must necessarily break her all in Pieces, I resolv'd to set all other
               Things apart, 'till I got every Thing out of the Ship that I could get; then I call'd
               a Council, that is to say, in my Thoughts, whether I should take back the Raft, but
               this appear'd impracticable; so I resolv'd to go as before, when the Tide was down,
               and I did so, only that I stripp'd before I went from my Hut, having nothing on but a
                  Chequer'd Shirt, and a Pair of Linnen Drawers, and a Pair
               of Pumps on my Feet.</p>
            <p>I got on Board the Ship, as before, and prepar'd a second Raft, and having had
               Experience of the first, I neither made this so unwieldy, nor loaded it so hard, but
               yet I brought away several Things very useful to me; as first, in the Carpenter's
               Stores I found two or three Bags full of Nails and Spikes, a great Skrew-Jack, a
               Dozen or two of Hatchets, and above all, that most useful Thing call'd a <ref

                  type="gloss">A stone on which to sharpen stone tools</note>; all these I secur'd
               together, with several Things belonging to the Gunner,
                  particularly two or three <ref target="crowbar_"
                  corresp="crowbar">Iron Crows</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff"
                  xml:id="crowbar" target="crowbar_" type="gloss">Crowbars</note>, and two Barrels
               of Musquet Bullets, seven Musquets, and another fowling Piece, with some small
               Quantity of Powder more; a large Bag full of small Shot, and
               a great Roll of Sheet Lead: But this last was so heavy, I
               could not hoise it up to get it over the Ship's Side.</p>
            <p>Besides these Things, I took all the Mens Cloths that I could find, and a spare
               Fore-top-sail, a Hammock, <pb n="63"
                  /> and some Bedding; and with this I loaded my second
               Raft, and brought them all safe on Shore to my very great Comfort.</p>
            <p>I was under some Apprehensions during my Absence from the
               Land, that at least my Provisions might be devour'd on Shore; but when I came back, I
               found no Sign of any Visitor, only there sat a Creature like a wild Cat upon one of
               the Chests, which when I came towards it, ran away a little Distance, and then stood
               still; she sat very compos'd, and unconcern'd, and look'd
               full in my Face, as if she had a Mind to be acquainted with me, I presented my Gun at
               her, but as she did not understand it, she was perfectly
               unconcern'd at it, nor did she offer to stir away; upon which I toss'd her a Bit of
               Bisket, tho' by the Way I was not very free of it, for my Store was not great: However, I spar'd her a Bit, I say, and she went to it, smell'd
               of it, and ate it, and look'd (as pleas'd) for more, but I thank'd her, and could
               spare no more; so she march'd off.</p>
            <p>Having got my second Cargoe on Shore, tho' I was <ref target="fain_" corresp="fain"
                  >fain</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="fain" target="fain_"

               Parcels, for they were too heavy, being large Casks, I went to work to make me a

               Tent I brought every Thing that I knew would spoil, either with Rain or Sun, and I
               piled all the empty Chests and Casks up in a Circle round the Tent, to fortify it
               from any sudden Attempt, either from Man or Beast.</p>
            <p>When I had done this I block'd up the Door of the Tent with some Boards within, and
               an empty Chest set up on End without, and spreading one of
               the Beds upon the Ground, laying my two Pistols just at my Head, and my Gun at Length
               by me, I went to Bed for the first Time, and slept <pb n="64"

               believe, for one Man, but I was not satisfy'd still; for while the Ship sat upright
               in that Posture, I thought I ought to get every Thing out of her that I could; so
               every Day at low Water I went on Board, and brought away some Thing or other: But
               particularly the third Time I went, I brought away as much of the Rigging as I could,
               as also all the small Ropes and Rope-twine I could get, with a Piece of spare
               Canvass, which was to mend the Sails upon Occasion, the
               Barrel of wet Gun-powder: In a Word, I brought away all the Sails first and last,
               only that I was fain to cut them in Pieces, and bring as much at a Time as I could;
               for they were no more useful to be Sails, but as meer
               Canvass only.</p>
            <p>But that which comforted me more still was, that at last of all, after I had made
               five or six such Voyages as these, and thought I had nothing more to expect from the
               Ship that was worth my medling with, I say, after all this,

            <p>The next Day I made another Voyage; and now having plunder'd the Ship of what was
                  portable <pb n="65" /> and fit to
               hand out, I began with the Cables; and cutting the great Cable into Pieces, such as I
               could move, I got two Cables and a <ref target="hawser_" corresp="hawser"

               large Raft, I loaded it with all those heavy Goods, and came away: But my good Luck
               began now to leave me; for this Raft was so unweildy, and so overloaden, that after I
               was enter'd the little Cove, where I had landed the rest of my Goods, not being able to guide it so handily as I did the other, it
               overset, and threw me and all my Cargoe into the Water; as for my self it was no
               great Harm, for I was near the Shore; but as to my Cargoe, it was great Part of it
               lost, especially the Iron, which I expected would have been of great Use to me:
               However, when the Tide was out, I got most of the Pieces of Cable ashore, and some of
               the Iron, tho' with infinite Labour; for I was fain to dip for it into the Water, a
               Work which fatigu'd me very much: After this I went every Day on Board, and brought
               away what I could get.</p>
            <p>I had been now thirteen Days on Shore, and had been eleven Times on Board the Ship;
               in which Time I had brought away all that one Pair of Hands could well be suppos'd
               capable to bring, tho' I believe verily, had the calm
               Weather held, I should have brought away the whole Ship Piece by Piece: But preparing
               the 12th Time to go on Board, I found the Wind begin to rise; however at low Water I went on Board, and tho' I thought I had rumag'd the Cabbin so effectually, as that nothing more could
               be found, yet I discover'd a Locker with Drawers in it, in one of which I found two
               or three Razors, and one Pair of large Sizzers, with some ten or a Dozen of good
               Knives and <pb n="66" /> Forks, in another I found about
               Thirty six Pounds value in Money, some <hi rend="italic">European</hi> Coin, some <hi rend="italic">Brasil,</hi>
               some Pieces of Eight, some Gold, some Silver.</p>
            <p>I smil'd to my self at the Sight of this Money, O Drug! Said I aloud, what art thou
               good for, Thou art not worth to me, no not the taking off of the Ground, one of those
               Knives is worth all this Heap, I have no Manner of use for thee, e'en remain where
               thou art, and go to the Bottom as a Creature whose Life is not worth saving. However, upon Second Thoughts, I took it away, and wrapping all
               this in a Piece of Canvas, I began to think of making another Raft, but while I was
               preparing this, I found the Sky over-cast, and the Wind began to rise, and in a
               Quarter of an Hour it blew a fresh Gale from the Shore; it presently occur'd to me,
               that it was in vain to pretend to make a Raft with the Wind off Shore, and that it
               was my Business to be gone before the Tide of Flood began, otherwise I might not be
               able to reach the Shore at all: Accordingly I let my self down into the Water, and
               swam cross the Channel, which lay between the Ship and the Sands, and even that with
               Difficulty enough, partly with the Weight of the Things I had about me, and partly
               the Roughness of the Water, for the Wind rose very hastily, and before it was quite
               high Water, it blew a Storm.</p>
            <p>But I was gotten home to my little Tent, where I lay with all my Wealth about me very
               secure. It blew very hard all that Night, and in the Morning when I look'd out,
               behold no more Ship was to be seen; I was a little surpriz'd, but recover'd my self
               with this satisfactory Reflection, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> That I had lost no time, nor abated
               no Dilligence to get every thing out of her that could be useful to me, and that
               indeed there was little left in her that I <pb n="67" /> was
               able to bring away if I had had more time.</p>
            <p>I now gave over any more Thoughts of the Ship, or of any thing out of her, except
               what might drive on Shore from her Wreck, as indeed divers Pieces of her afterwards
               did; but those things were of small use to me.</p>
            <p>My Thoughts were now wholly employ'd about securing my self against either Savages,
               if any should appear, or wild Beasts, if any were in the Island; and I had many
               Thoughts of the Method how to do this, and what kind of Dwelling to make, whether I should make me a Cave in the Earth, or a Tent upon
               the Earth: And, in short, I resolv'd upon both, the Manner
               and Discription of which, it may not be improper to give an Account of.</p>
            <p>I sooon found the Place I was in was not for my Settlement, particularly because it
               was upon a low moorish Ground near the Sea, and I believ'd would not be wholsome, and
               more particularly because there was no fresh Water near it, so I resolv'd to find a
               more healthy and more convenient Spot of Ground.</p>
            <p>I consulted several Things in my Situation which I found would be proper for me, 1st.
               Health, and fresh Water I just now mention'd, 2dly. Shelter from the Heat of the Sun,
               3dly. Security from ravenous Creatures, whether Men or
               Beasts, 4thly. a View to the Sea, that if God sent any Ship in Sight, I might not
               lose any Advantage for my Deliverance, of which I was not
               willing to banish all my Expectation yet.</p>
            <p>In search of a Place proper for this, I found a little Plain on the Side of a rising
               Hill, whose Front towards this little Plain, was steep as a House-side, so that
               nothing could come down upon me from the Top; on the Side of this Rock <pb n="68"
                  /> there was a hollow Place worn a little way in like the
               Entrance or Door of a Cave, but there was not really any Cave or Way into the Rock at
               all.</p>
            <p>On the Flat of the Green, just before this hollow Place, I resolv'd to pitch my Tent:
               This Plain was not above an Hundred Yards broad, and about twice as long, and lay
               like a Green before my Door, and at the End of it descended irregularly every Way
               down into the Low-grounds by the Sea-side. It was on the <hi rend="italic">N. N. W.</hi> Side of
               the Hill, so that I was shelter'd from the Heat every Day, till it came to a
                  <hi rend="italic">W.</hi> and by <hi rend="italic">S.</hi> Sun, or thereabouts, which in those Countries is
               near the Setting.</p>
            <p>Before I set up my Tent, I drew a half Circle before the hollow Place, which took in
               about Ten Yards in its <ref target="radius_" corresp="radius"
                  >Semi-diameter</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="radius"
                  target="radius_" type="gloss">Radius</note> from the Rock, and Twenty Yards in its
               Diameter, from its Beginning and Ending.</p>
            <p>In this half Circle I pitch'd two Rows of strong Stakes, driving them into the Ground
               till they stood very firm like Piles, the biggest End being out of the Ground about
               Five Foot and a Half, and sharpen'd on the Top: The two Rows did not stand above Six
               Inches from one another.</p>
            <p>Then I took the Pieces of Cable which I had cut in the Ship, and I laid them in Rows
               one upon another, within the Circle, between these two Rows of Stakes, up to the Top,
               placing other Stakes in the In-side, leaning against them, about two Foot and a half
               high, like a Spurr to a Post, and this Fence was so strong, that neither Man or Beast
               could get into it or over it: This cost me a great deal of Time and Labour,
               especially to cut the Piles in the Woods, bring them to the Place, and drive them
               into the Earth.</p>
            <p>The Entrance into this Place I made to be not by a Door, but by a short Ladder to go
               over <pb n="69" /> the Top, which Ladder, when I was in, I
               lifted over after me, and so I was compleatly fenc'd in, and fortify'd, as I thought,
               from all the World, and consequently slept secure in the Night, which otherwise I could not have done, tho', as it appear'd afterward, there was no need of all this Caution from the
               Enemies that I apprehended Danger from.</p>
            <p>Into this Fence or Fortress, with infinite Labour, I carry'd
               all my Riches, all my Provisions, Ammunition and Stores, of which you have the
               Account above, and I made me a large Tent, which, to preserve me from the Rains that
               in one Part of the Year are very violent there, I made double, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> One
               smaller Tent within, and one larger Tent above it, and cover'd the uppermost with a
               large Tarpaulin which I had sav'd among the Sails.</p>
            <p>And now I lay no more for a while in the Bed which I had brought on Shore, but in a
                  Hammock, which was indeed a very good one, and belong'd
               to the Mate of the Ship.</p>
            <p>Into this Tent I brought all my Provisions, and every thing that would spoil by the
               Wet, and having thus enclos'd all my Goods, I made up the
               Entrance, which till now I had left open, and so pass'd and re-pass'd, as I said, by
               a short Ladder.</p>
            <p>When I had done this, I began to work my Way into the Rock, and bringing all the
               Earth and Stones that I dug down out thro' my Tent, I laid 'em up within my Fence in
               the Nature of a Terras, that so it rais'd the Ground within
               about a Foot and a Half; and thus I made me a Cave just behind my Tent, which serv'd
               me like a Cellar to my House.</p>
            <p>It cost me much Labour, and many Days, before all these
               Things were brought to Perfection, and therefore I must go back to some other Things
               which took up some of my Thoughts. At the same time it <pb n="70"
                  /> happen'd after I had laid my Scheme for the setting up my Tent and making the Cave, that a Storm of Rain
               falling from a thick dark Cloud, a sudden Flash of Lightning happen'd, and after that
               a great Clap of Thunder, as is naturally the Effect of it; I was not so much
               surpris'd with the Lightning as I was with a Thought which
               darted into my Mind as swift as the Lightning it self: O my Powder! My very Heart
               sunk within me, when I thought, that at one Blast all my Powder might be destroy'd,
               on which, not my Defence only, but the providing me Food, as I thought, entirely
                  depended; I was nothing near so anxious about my own
               Danger, tho' had the Powder took fire, <ref target="irony_" corresp="irony">I had
                     never known who had hurt me</ref>. <note
                  resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="irony" target="irony_" type="gloss">Had
                  the explosive gunpowder caught fire from the lightning, Crusoe would ironically
                  not have survived the explosion to have suffered harm at the hands of man or
                  beast.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Such Impression did this make upon me, that after the Storm was over, I laid aside
               all my Works, my Building, and Fortifying, and apply'd my self to make Bags and Boxes
               to separate the Powder, and keep it a little and a little in a Parcel, in hope, that
               whatever might come, it might not all take Fire at once, and to keep it so apart that
               it should not be possible to make one part fire another: I finish'd this Work in
               about a Fort night, and I think my Powder, which in all was about <ref
                  target="pound_" corresp="pound">240 l.</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff"
                  xml:id="pound" target="pound_"> type="gloss">240 pounds</note> weight was divided
               in not less than a Hundred Parcels; as to the Barrel that
               had been wet, I did not apprehend any Danger from that, so I plac'd it in my new
               Cave, which in my Fancy I call'd my Kitchin, and the rest I hid up and down in Holes
               among the Rocks, so that no wet might come to it, marking very carefully where I laid
               it.</p>
            <p>In the Interval of time while this was doing I went out once at least every Day with
               my Gun, as well to divert my self, as to see if I could kill any thing fit for Food,
               and as near as I could to acquaint <pb n="71"
                  /> my self with what the Island produc'd. The first time I
               went out I presently discover'd that there were Goats in the Island, which was a
               great Satisfaction to me; but then it was attended with this Misfortune to me,
                  <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> That they were so shy, so subtile, and so swift of Foot, that it was
               the difficultest thing in the World to come at them: But I was not discourag'd at
               this, not doubting but I might now and then shoot one, as it soon happen'd, for after I had found their Haunts a little, I laid
               wait in this Manner for them: I observ'd if they saw me in the Valleys, tho' they
               were upon the Rocks, they would run away as in a terrible Fright; but if they were
               feeding in the Valleys, and I was upon the Rocks, they took no Notice of me, from
               whence I concluded, that by the Position of their Opticks, their Sight was so
               directed downward, that they did not readily see Objects
               that were above them; so afterward I took this Method, I always clim'd the Rocks
               first to get above them, and then had frequently a fair Mark. The first shot I made
               among these Creatures, I kill'd a She-Goat which had a little Kid by her which she
               gave Suck to, which griev'd me heartily; but when the Old one fell, the Kid stood
               stock still by her till I came and took her up, and not only so, but when I carry'd
               the Old one with me upon my Shoulders, the Kid follow'd me quite to my Enclosure,
               upon which I laid down the Dam, and took the Kid in my Arms, and carry'd it over my
               Pale, in hopes to have bred it up tame, but it would not eat, so I was forc'd to kill
               it and eat it my self; these two supply'd me with Flesh a great while, for I eat
               sparingly; and sav'd my Provisions (my Bread especially) as much as possibly I
               could.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" />Having now fix'd my Habitation, I found it absolutely necessary to provide a Place to make a Fire in, and
               Fewel to burn; and what I did for that, as also how I enlarg'd my Cave, and what
               Conveniencies I made, I shall give a full Account of in its Place: But I must first
               give some little Account of my self, and of my Thoughts about Living, which it may
               well be suppos'd were not a few.</p>
            <p>I had a dismal Prospect of my Condition, for as I was not cast away upon that Island
               without being driven, as is said, by a violent Storm quite
               out of the Course of our intended Voyage, and a great Way, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> some
               Hundreds of Leagues out of the ordinary Course of the Trade of Mankind, I had great
               Reason to consider it as a Determination of Heaven, that in this desolate Place, and
               in this desolate Manner I should end my Life; the Tears would run plentifully down my
               Face when I made these Reflections, and sometimes I would expostulate with my self, Why Providence should thus compleatly
               ruine its Creatures, and render them so absolutely miserable, so without Help
               abandon'd, so entirely depress'd, that it could hardly be rational to be thankful for such a Life.</p>
            <p>But something always return'd swift upon me to check these Thoughts, and to reprove
               me; and particularly one Day walking with my Gun in my Hand by the Sea-side, I was
               very pensive upon the Subject of my present Condition, when Reason as it were
               expostulated with me t'other Way, thus: Well, you are in a desolate Condition 'tis
               true, but pray remember, Where are the rest of you? Did not you come Eleven of you
               into the Boat, where are the Ten? Why were not they sav'd and you lost? Why were you
               singled out? Is it better to be here or there, and then I pointed to the Sea? All <pb
                  n="73" /> Evills are to be consider'd with the Good that
               is in them, and with what worse attends them.</p>
            <p>Then it occurr'd to me again, how well I was furnish'd for my Subsistence, and what
               would have been my Case if it had not happen'd, <hi rend="italic">Which was an Hundred Thousand to
                  one,</hi> that the Ship floated from the Place where she first struck and was
                  driven so near to the Shore that I had time to get all
               these Things out of her: What would have been my Case, if I had been to have liv'd in
               the Condition in which I at first came on Shore, without
               Necessaries of Life, or Necessaries to supply and procure them? Particularly said I
               aloud, (tho' to my self) what should I ha' done without a Gun, without Ammunition,
               without any Tools to make any thing, or to work with, without Clothes, Bedding, a
               Tent, or any manner of Covering, and that now I had all
               these to a Sufficient Quantity, and was in a fair way to provide my self in such a
               manner, as to live without my Gun when my Ammunition was
               spent; so that I had a tollerable View of subsisting without any Want as long as I
               liv'd; for I consider'd from the beginning how I would provide for the Accidents that might happen, and for the time that was to
               come, even not only after my Ammunition should be spent, but even after my Health or
               Strength should decay.</p>
            <p>I confess I had not entertain'd any Notion of my Ammunition being destroy'd at one
               Blast, I mean my Powder being blown up by Lightning, and this made the Thoughts of it
               so surprising to me when it lighten'd and thunder'd, as I observ'd just now.</p>
            <p>And now being to enter into a melancholy Relation of a Scene
               of silent Life, such perhaps as was never heard of in the World before, I shall take
               it from its Beginning, and continue it in its <pb n="74" />
               Order. It was, by my Account, the 30th. of <hi rend="italic">Sept.</hi> when, in the Manner as
               above said, I first set Foot upon this horrid Island, when the Sun being, to us, in
               its Autumnal Equinox, was almost just over my Head, for I reckon'd my self, by
               Observation, to be in the Latitude of <ref target="parallel_" corresp="parallel">9
                  Degrees 22 Minutes North of the Line</ref>. <note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff"
                  xml:id="parallel" target="parallel_" type="gloss">The 9th parallel north
                  intersects both Colombia and Venezuela, from which we can estimate that Crusoe's
                  island is somewhere off the northern coast of South America.</note>
            </p>
            <p>After I had been there about Ten or Twelve Days, it came into my Thoughts, that I
               should lose my Reckoning of Time for want of Books and Pen and Ink, and should even
               forget the Sabbath Days from the working Days; but to
               prevent this I cut it with my Knife upon a large Post, in Captital Letters, and
               making it into a great Cross I set it up on the Shore where I first landed, viz.
                  <hi rend="italic">I came on Shore here on the</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">th of</hi> Sept. 1659. Upon the Sides
               of this square Post I cut every Day a Notch with my Knife, and every seventh Notch
               was as long again as the rest, and every first Day of the Month as long again as that
               long one, and thus I kept my Kalander, or weekly, monthly,
               and yearly reckoning of Time.</p>
            <p>In the next place we are to observe, that among the many things which I brought out
               of the Ship in the several Voyages, which, as above mention'd, I made to it, I got
               several things of less Value, but not all less useful to me, which I omitted setting down before; as in particular, Pens, Ink, and Paper,
               several Parcels in the Captain's, Mate's, Gunner's, and Carpenter's keeping, three or
               four Compasses, some Mathematical Instruments, Dials, Perspectives, Charts, and Books
               of Navigation, all which I huddel'd together, whether I might want them or no; also I
               found three very good Bibles which came to me in my Cargo from <hi rend="italic">England,</hi> and which I had pack'd up among my things;
               some <hi rend="italic">Portugueze</hi> Books also, and among them two <pb n="75"
                  /> or three <ref target="popish_" corresp="popish"
                  >Popish</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="popish"
                  target="popish_" type="gloss">Roman Catholic</note> Prayer-Books, and several
               other Books, all which I carefully secur'd. And I must not forget, that we had in the
               Ship a Dog and two Cats, of whose eminent History I may have occasion to say
               something in its place; for I carry'd both the Cats with me, and as for the Dog, he
               jump'd out of the Ship of himself and swam on Shore to me the Day after I went on
               Shore with my first Cargo, and was a trusty Servant to me
               many Years; I wanted nothing that he could fetch me, nor any Company that he could
               make up to me, I only wanted to have him talk to me, but that would not do. As I
               observ'd before, I found Pen, Ink and Paper, and I <ref target="husband_"
                  corresp="husband">husbanded</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff"
                  xml:id="husband" target="husband_" type="gloss">Economized or eked out, so they
                  would last</note> them to the utmost, and I shall shew, that while my Ink lasted,
               I kept things very exact, but after that was gone I could not, for I could not make
               any Ink by any Means that I could devise.</p>
            <p>And this put me in mind that I wanted many things, notwithstanding all that I had
               amass'd together, and of these, this of Ink was one, as also
               Spade, Pick-Axe, and Shovel to dig or remove the Earth, Needles, Pins, and Thread; as
               for Linnen, I soon learn'd to want that without much Difficulty.</p>
            <p>This want of Tools made every Work I did go on heavily, and it was near a whole Year
               before I had entirely finish'd my little Pale or surrounded Habitation: The Piles or
               Stakes, which were as heavy as I could well lift, were a long time in cutting and preparing in the Woods, and more by far in bringing
               home, so that I spent some times two Days in cuttting and bringing home one of those
               Posts, and a third Day in driving it into the Ground; for which Purpose I got a heavy
               Piece of Wood at first, but at last bethought my self of one of the Iron Crows, which
               however tho' I found it, yet <pb n="76" /> it made driving
               those Posts or Piles very laborious and tedious Work.</p>
            <p>But what need I ha' been concern'd at the Tediousness of any
               thing I had to do, seeing I had time enough to do it in, nor had I any other Employment if that had been over, at least, that I could
               foresee, except the ranging the Island to seek for Food, which I did more or less
               every Day.</p>
            <p>I now began to consider seriously my Condition, and the Circumstance I was reduc'd
               to, and I drew up the State of my Affairs in Writing, not so much to leave them to
               any that were to come after me, for I was like to have but few Heirs, as to deliver my Thoughts from daily poring upon them, and
               afflicting my Mind; and as my Reason began now to master my Despondency, I began to
                  comfort my self as well as I could, and to set the good
               against the Evil, that I might have something to distinguish my Case from worse, and
               I stated it very impartially, like Debtor and Creditor, the Comforts I enjoy'd,
               against the Miseries I suffer'd, Thus, </p>

            <p>Upon the whole, here was an undoubted Testimony, that there
               was scarce any Condition in the World so miserable, but there was something
                     <hi rend="italic">Negative</hi> or something <hi rend="italic">Positiv</hi> to be
               thankful for in it; and let this stand as a Direction from the Experience of the most miserable of all Conditions in this World,
               that we may always find in it something to comfort our selves from, and to set in the
                  Description of Good and Evil, on the Credit Side of the
               Accompt.</p>
            <p>Having now brought my Mind a little to relish my Condition, and given over looking
               out to Sea to see if I could spy a Ship, I say, giving over these things, I began to
               apply my self to accommodate my way of Living, and to make
               things as easy to me as I could.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" />I have already describ'd my Habitation, which
               was a Tent under the Side of a Rock, surrounded with a strong Pale of Posts and
               Cables, but I might now rather call it a Wall, for I rais'd a kind of Wall up against
               it of Turfs, about two Foot thick on the Out-side, and after some time, I think it
               was a Year and Half, I rais'd Rafters from it leaning to the
               Rock, and thatch'd or cover'd it with Bows of Trees, and such things as I could get
               to keep out the Rain, which I found at some times of the Year very violent.</p>
            <p>I have already observ'd how I brought all my Goods into this Pale, and into the Cave
               which I had made behind me: But I must observe too, that at first this was a confus'd
               Heap of Goods, which as they lay in no Order, so they took up all my Place, I had no
               room to turn my self; so I set my self to enlarge my Cave and Works farther into the Earth, for it was a loose sandy Rock,
               which yielded easily to the Labour I bestow'd on it; and so when I found I was pretty
               safe as to Beasts of Prey, I work'd side-ways to the Right Hand into the Rock, and
               then turning to the Right again, work'd quite out and made me a Door to come out, on
               the Out-side of my Pale or Fortification.</p>
            <p>This gave me not only Egress and Regress, as it were a back Way to my Tent and to my
               Store-house, but gave me room to stow my Goods.</p>
            <p>And now I began to apply my self to make such necessary things as I found I most
               wanted, as particularly a Chair and a Table, for without
               these I was not able to enjoy the few Comforts I had in the World, I could not write,
               or eat, or do several things with so much Pleasure without a Table.</p>
            <p>So I went to work; and here I must needs observe, that as
               Reason is the Substance and Original <pb n="79"
                  /> of the Mathematicks, so by stating and squaring every thing by Reason, and by making the most rational
               Judgment of things, every Man may be in time Master of every mechanick Art. I had
               never handled a Tool in my Life, and yet in time by Labour, Application, and
               Contrivance, I found at last that I wanted nothing but I could have made it,
               especially if I had had Tools; however I made abundance of things, even without
               Tools, and some with no more Tools than an <ref target="adze_" corresp="adze"
                  >Adze</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="adze" target="adze_"
                  type="gloss">A tool like a pickax, with a blade at right angles to the
                  handle.</note> and a Hatchet, which perhaps were never made that way before, and
               that with infinite Labour: For Example, If I wanted a Board, I had no other Way but
               to cut down a Tree, set it on an Edge before me, and hew it flat on either Side with
               my Axe, till I had brought it to be thin as a Plank, and then dubb it smooth with my
               Adze. It is true, by this Method I could make but one Board out of a whole Tree, but
               this I had no Remedy for but Patience, any more than I had for the prodigious deal of
               Time and Labour which it took me up to make a Plank or Board: But my Time or Labour
               was little worth, and so it was as well employ'd one way as another.</p>
            <p>However, I made me a Table and a Chair, as I observ'd above, in the first Place, and
               this I did out of the short Pieces of Boards that I brought on my Raft from the Ship:
               But when I had wrought out some Boards, as above, I made large Shelves of the Breadth
               of a Foot and Half one over another, all along one Side of my Cave, to lay all my
               Tools, Nails, and Iron-work, and in a Word, to separate every thing at large in their
               Places, that I might come easily at them; I knock'd Pieces into the Wall of the Rock
               to hang my Guns and all things that would hang up.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" />So that had my Cave been to be seen, it look'd
               like a general <ref target="magazine2_" corresp="magazine2">Magazine</ref><note
                  resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="magazine2" target="magazine2_"
                  type="gloss">Storehouse</note> of all Necessary things, and I had every thing so
               ready at my Hand, that it was a grear Pleasure to me to see all my Goods in such
               Order, and especially to find my Stock of all Necessaries so great.</p>
            <p>And now it was when I began to keep a Journal of every Days
               Employment, for indeed at first I was in too much Hurry, and not only Hurry as to
               Labour, but in too much Discomposure of Mind, and my Journal would ha' been full of
               many dull things: For Example, I must have said thus. <hi rend="italic">Sept.</hi> the 30th. After
               I got to Shore and had escap'd drowning, instead of being thankful to God for my
               Deliverance, having first vomited with the great Quantity of salt Water which was
               gotten into my Stomach, and recovering my self a little, I ran about the Shore,
               wringing my Hands and beating my Head and Face, exclaiming
               at my Misery, and crying out, I was undone, undone, till tyr'd and faint I was forc'd
               to lye down on the Ground to repose, but durst not sleep for fear of being devour'd.</p>
            <p>Some Days after this, and after I had been on board the Ship, and got all that I
               could out of her, yet I could not forbear getting up to the Top of a little Mountain
               and looking out to Sea in hopes of seeing a Ship, then fancy at a vast Distance I spy'd a Sail, please my self with the Hopes of it,
               and then after looking steadily till I was almost blind,
               lose it quite, and sit down and weep like a Child, and thus encrease my Misery by my
               Folly.</p>
            <p>But having gotten over these things in some Measure, and
               having settled my houshold Stuff and Habitation, made me a
               Table and a Chair, and all as handsome about me as I could, I began to keep <pb
                  n="81" /> my Journal, of which I shall here give you the
               Copy (tho' in it will be told all these Particulars over again) as long as it lasted,
               for having no more Ink I was forc'd to leave it off.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">September</hi> 30, 1659. I poor miserable <hi rend="italic">Robinson Crusoe,</hi> being
               shipwreck'd, during a dreadful Storm, in the offing, came on Shore on this dismal
               unfortunate Island, which I call'd <hi rend="italic">the Island of Despair,</hi> all the rest of the Ship's Company being drown'd, and my self almost
               dead.</p>
            <p>All the rest of that Day I spent in afflicting my self at the dismal Circumstances I
               was brought to, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> I had neither Food, House, Clothes, Weapon, or Place to
               fly to, and in Despair of any Relief, saw nothing but Death before me, either that I
               should be devour'd by wild Beasts, murther'd by Savages, or starv'd to Death for Want
               of Food. At the Approach of Night, I slept in a Tree for fear of wild Creatures, but
               slept soundly tho' it rain'd all Night.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">October</hi> 1. In the Morning I saw to my great Surprise the Ship had floated with the high Tide, and was driven on Shore again much
               nearer the Island, which as it was some Comfort on one hand, for seeing her sit
               upright, and not broken to Pieces, I hop'd, if the Wind
               abated, I might get on board, and get some Food and Necessaries out of her for my
               Relief; so on the other hand, it renew'd my Grief at the Loss of my Comrades, who I
                  imagin'd if we had all staid on board might have sav'd
               the Ship, or at least that they would not have been all drown'd as they were; and
               that had the Men been sav'd, we might perhaps have built us a Boat out of the Ruins
               of the Ship, to have carried <pb n="82"
                  /> us to some other Part of the World. I spent great Part
               of this Day in perplexing my self on these things; but at length seeing the Ship
               almost dry, I went upon the Sand as near as I could, and then swam on board; this Day
               also it continu'd raining, tho' with no Wind at all.</p>
            <p>From the 1st of <hi rend="italic">October,</hi> to the 24th. All these Days entirely spent in many
               several Voyages to get all I could out of the Ship, which I brought on Shore, every
               Tide of Flood, upon Rafts. Much Rain also in these Days, tho' with some Intervals of
               fair Weather: But, it seems, this was the rainy Season.</p>

               being chiefly heavy, I recover'd many of them when the Tide was out.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Oct.</hi> 25. It rain'd all Night and all Day, with some Gusts of Wind, during
               which time the Ship broke in Pieces, the Wind blowing a little harder than before,
               and was no more to be seen, except the Wreck of her, and that only at low Water. I
               spent this Day in covering and securing the Goods which I had sav'd, that the Rain
               might not spoil them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Oct.</hi> 26. I walk'd about the Shore almost all Day to find out a place to fix
               my Habitation, greatly concern'd to secure my self from an Attack in the Night,
               either from wild Beasts or Men. Towards Night I fix'd upon a proper Place under a
               Rock, and mark'd out a Semi-Circle for my Encampment, which
               I resolv'd to strengthen with a Work, Wall, or Fortification made of double Piles,
               lin'd within with Cables, and without with Turf.</p>
            <p>From the 26th. to the 30th. I work'd very hard in carrying all my Goods to my new
               Habitation, <pb n="83" /> tho' some Part of the time it
               rain'd exceeding hard</p>
            <p>The 31st. in the Morning I went out into the Island with my Gun to see for some Food,
               and discover the Country, when I kill'd a She-Goat, and her
               Kid follow'd me home, which I afterwards kill'd also because it would not feed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">November</hi> 1. I set up my Tent under a Rock, and lay there for the first
               Night, making it as large as I could with Stakes driven in to swing my Hammock upon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Nov.</hi> 2. I set up all my Chests and Boards, and the Pieces of Timber which
               made my Rafts, and with them form'd a Fence round me, a little within the Place I had mark'd out for my Fortification.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Nov.</hi> 3. I went out with my Gun and kill'd two Fowls like Ducks, which were
               very good Food. In the Afternoon went to work to make me a Table.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Nov.</hi> 4. This Morning I began to order my times of Work, of going out with my
               Gun, time of Sleep, and time of Diversion, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> Every Morning I walk'd out
               with my Gun for two or three Hours if it did not rain, then employ'd my self to work
               till about Eleven a-Clock, then eat what I had to live on, and from Twelve to Two I
               lay down to sleep, the Weather being excessive hot, and then in the Evening to work
               again: The working Part of this Day and of the next were wholly employ'd in making my
               Table, for I was yet but a very sorry Workman, tho' Time and Necessity made me a
               compleat natural Mechanick soon after, as I believe it would do any one else.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Nov.</hi> 5. This Day went abroad with my Gun and my Dog, and kill'd a wild Cat,
               her Skin pretty soft, but her Flesh good for nothing: Every <pb n="84"
                  /> Creature I kill'd I took off the Skins and preserv'd
               them: Coming back by the Sea Shore, I saw many Sorts of Sea Fowls which I did not
               understand, but was surpris'd and almost frighted with two or three Seals, which,
               while I was gazing at, not well knowing what they were, got into the Sea and escap'd
               me for that time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Nov.</hi> 6. After my Morning Walk I went to work with my Table again, and
               finish'd it, tho' not to my liking; nor was it long before I learn'd to mend it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Nov.</hi> 7. Now it began to be settled fair Weather. The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th,
               and Part of the 12th. (for the 11th. was Sunday) I took wholly up to make me a Chair,
               and with much ado brought it to a tolerable Shape, but never to please me, and even
               in the making I pull'd it in Pieces several times.
                  <hi rend="italic">Note,</hi> I soon neglected my keeping Sundays, for omitting my Mark for them
               on my Post, I forgot which was which.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Nov.</hi> 13. This Day it rain'd, which refresh'd me exceedingly, and cool'd the
               Earth, but it was accompany'd with terrible Thunder and
               Lightning, which frighted me dreadfully for fear of my Powder; as soon as it was over, I resolv'd to separate my Stock of Powder into as many
               little Parcels as possible, that it might not be in Danger.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Nov.</hi> 14, 15, 16. These three Days I spent in making little square Chests or
               Boxes, which might hold about a Pound or two Pound, at most, of Powder, and so
               putting the Powder in, I stow'd it in Places as secure and remote from one another as
               possible. On one of these three Days I kill'd a large Bird that was good to eat, but
               I know not what to call it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Nov.</hi> 17. This Day I began to dig behind my Tent into the Rock to make room
               for my farther <pb n="85" /> Conveniency: <hi rend="italic">Note,</hi> Two
               Things I wanted exceedingly for this Work, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> A
               Pick-axe, a Shovel, and a Wheel-barrow or Basket, so I desisted from my Work, and
               began to consider how to supply that Want and make me some Tools; as for a Pick-axe,
               I made use of the Iron Crows, which were proper enough, tho' heavy; but the next
               thing was a Shovel or Spade, this was so absolutely
               necessary, that indeed I could do nothing effectually without it, but what kind of
               one to make I knew not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Nov.</hi> 18. The next Day in searching the Woods I found a Tree of that Wood, or
               like it, which, in the <hi rend="italic">Brasils</hi> they call the <ref target="ironwood_"
                  corresp="ironwood">Iron Tree,</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff"
                  xml:id="ironwood" target="ironwood_" type="gloss">The Brazil Ironwood, sometimes
                  called the Leopard Tree, has yellow flowers and extremely hard, spotted
                  wood.</note> for its exceeding Hardness, of this, with
               great Labour and almost spoiling my Axe, I cut a Piece, and brought it home too with
               Difficulty enough, for it was exceeding heavy.</p>
            <p>The excessive Hardness of the Wood, and having no other Way, made me a long while
               upon this Machine, for I work'd it effectually by little and little into the Form of
               a Shovel or Spade, the Handle exactly shap'd like ours in <hi rend="italic">England,</hi> only that
               the broad Part having no Iron shod upon it at Bottom, it
               would not last me so long, however it serv'd well enough for the uses which I had occasion
               to put it to; but never was a Shovel, I believe, made after that Fashion, or so long
               a making.</p>
            <p>I was still deficient, for I wanted a Basket or a Wheel-barrow, a Basket I could not
               make by any Means, having no such things as Twigs that would bend to make Wicker
               Ware, at least none yet found out; and as to a Wheel-barrow, I fancy'd I could make
               all but the Wheel, but that I had no Notion of, neither did I know how to go about
               it; besides I had no possible Way to make the Iron <ref target="gudgeon_"
                  corresp="gudgeon">Gudgeons</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff"

               so I gave it over, and so for carrying away the Earth which I dug out of the Cave, I
               made me a Thing like a <ref target="hodd_" corresp="hodd">Hodd</ref><note

               Labourers carry Morter in, when they serve the Bricklayers.</p>
            <p>This was not so difficult to me as the making the Shovel; and yet this, and the
               Shovel, and the Attempt which I made in vain, to make a Wheel-Barrow, took me up no
               less than four Days, I mean always, excepting my Morning Walk with my Gun, which I
               seldom fail'd, and very seldom fail'd also bringing Home something fit to eat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Nov.</hi> 23. My other Work having now stood still, because of my making these
               Tools; when they were finish'd, I went on, and working every Day, as my Strength and
               Time allow'd, I spent eighteen Days entirely in widening and
               deepening my Cave, that it might hold my Goods commodiously.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Note,</hi> During all this Time, I work'd to make this Room or Cave spacious
               enough to accommodate me as a Warehouse or Magazin, a
               Kitchen, a Dining-room, and a Cellar; as for my Lodging, I kept to the Tent, except
               that some Times in the wet Season of the Year, it rain'd so hard, that I could not
               keep my self dry, which caused me afterwards to cover all my
               Place within my Pale with long Poles in the Form of Rafters leaning against the Rock,
               and load them with Flaggs and large Leaves of Trees like a Thatch.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">December</hi> 10th, I began now to think my Cave or Vault finished, when on a
               Sudden, (it seems I had made it too large) a great Quantity of Earth fell down from
               the Top and one Side, so much, that in short it frighted me, and not without Reason too; for if I had been under it I had never wanted a
               Grave-Digger: Upon this Disaster I had <pb n="87" /> a great
               deal of Work to do over again; for I had the loose Earth to carry out; and which was
               of more Importance, I had the Seiling to prop up, so that I might be sure no more
               would come down.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Dec.</hi> 11. This Day I went to Work with it accordingly, and got two Shores or Posts pitch'd upright to the Top, with two Pieces of
               Boards a-cross over each Post, this I finish'd the next Day; and setting more Posts
               up with Boards, in about a Week more I had the Roof secur'd; and the Posts standing
               in Rows, serv'd me for Partitions to part of my House.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Dec.</hi> 17. From this Day to the Twentieth I plac'd Shelves, and knock'd up
               Nails on the Posts to hang every Thing up that could be hung up, and now I began to
               be in some Order within Doors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Dec.</hi> 20. Now I carry'd every Thing into the Cave, and began to furnish my
               House, and set up some Pieces of Boards, like a Dresser, to order my Victuals upon,
               but Boards began to be very scarce with me; also I made me another Table.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Dec.</hi> 24. Much Rain all Night and all Day, no stirring out.</p>
            <p>

               <hi rend="italic">Dec.</hi> 27. Kill'd a young Goat, and lam'd another so
               as that I catch'd it, and led it Home in a String; when I had it Home, I bound and
                  splinter'd up its Leg which was broke, <hi rend="italic">N. B.</hi> I
               took such Care of it, that it liv'd, and the Leg grew well, and as strong as ever;
               but by my nursing it so long it grew tame, and fed upon the
                  little Green at my Door, and would not go away: This was
               the first Time that I entertain'd a Thought of breeding up some tame Creatures, <pb
                  n="88" /> that I might have Food when my Powder and Shot
               was all spent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Dec.</hi> 28, 29, 30. Great Heats and no Breeze; so that there was no Stirring
               abroad, except in the Evening for Food; this Time I spent in putting all my Things in
               Order within Doors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">January</hi> 1. Very hot still, but I went abroad early
               and late with my Gun, and lay still in the Middle of the Day; this Evening going
               farther into the Valleys which lay towards the Center of the Island, I found there
               was plenty of Goats, tho' exceeding shy and hard to come at, however I resolv'd to
               try if I could not bring my Dog to hunt them down.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Jan.</hi> 2. Accordingly, the next Day, I went out with my Dog, and set him upon
               the Goats; but I was mistaken, for they all fac'd about upon the Dog, and he knew his
               Danger too well, for he would not come near them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Jan.</hi> 3. I began my Fence or Wall; which being still

                  >Fearful, apprehensive, or wary.</note> of my being attack'd by some Body, I resolv'd to make very thick and strong.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">N. B.</hi> This Wall being describ'd before, I purposely omit what was said in
               the Journal; it is sufficient to observe, that I was no less
               Time than from the <hi rend="italic">3</hi>d of <hi rend="italic">January</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">14</hi>th of
                  <hi rend="italic">April,</hi> working, finishing, and perfecting this Wall, tho' it was no more
               than about <hi rend="italic">24</hi> Yards in Length, being a half Circle from one Place in the
               Rock to another Place about eight Yards from it, the Door of the Cave being in the
               Center behind it.</p>
            <p>All this Time I work'd very hard, the Rains hindering me many Days, nay sometimes
               Weeks together; but I thought I should never be perfectly
               secure 'till this Wall was finish'd; and it is <pb n="89" />
               scarce credible what inexpressible Labour every Thing was done with, especially the
               bringing Piles out of the Woods, and driving them into the Ground, for I made them
               much bigger than I need to have done.</p>
            <p>When this Wall was finished, and the Out-side double fenc'd with a Turff-Wall rais'd
               up close to it, I perswaded my self, that if any People were to come on Shore there,
               they would not perceive any Thing like a Habitation; and it was very well I did so,
               as may be observ'd hereafter upon a very remarkable Occasion.</p>
            <p>During this Time, I made my Rounds in the Woods for Game every Day when the Rain
                  admitted me, and made frequent Discoveries in these Walks
               of something or other to my Advantage; particularly I found a Kind of wild Pidgeons,
               who built not as Wood Pidgeons in a Tree, but rather as House Pidgeons, in the Holes
               of the Rocks; and taking some young ones, I endeavoured to bread them up tame, and
               did so; but when they grew older they flew all away, which perhaps was at first for
               Want of feeding them, for I had nothing to give them;
               however I frequently found their Nests, and got their young ones, which were very
               good Meat.</p>
            <p>And now, in the managing my houshold Affairs, I found my self wanting in many Things,
               which I thought at first it was impossible for me to make, as indeed as to some of
               them it was; <hi rend="italic">for Instance,</hi> I could never make a Cask to be <ref

               Candle; so that as soon as ever it was dark, which was generally by Seven-a-Clock, I
               was oblig'd to go to Bed: I remembred the Lump of Bees-wax with which I made Candles
               in my <hi rend="italic">African</hi> Adventure, but I had none of that
               now; the only Remedy I had was, that when I had kill'd a
               Goat, I sav'd the Tallow, and with a little Dish made of Clay, which I bak'd in the
               Sun, to which I added a Wick of some Oakum, I made me a Lamp; and this gave me Light,
               tho' not a clear steady Light like a Candle; in the Middle of all my Labours it
               happen'd, that rumaging my Things, I found a little Bag, which, as I hinted before,
               had been fill'd with Corn for the feeding of Poultry, not for this Voyage, but
               before, as I suppose, when the Ship came from <hi rend="italic">Lisbon,</hi> what little Remainder
               of Corn had been in the Bag, was all devour'd with the Rats, and I saw nothing in the
               Bag but Husks and Dust; and being willing to have the Bag for some other Use, I think
               it was to put Powder in, when I divided it for Fear of the Lightning, or some such
               Use, I shook the Husks of Corn out of it on one Side of my Fortification under the
               Rock.</p>
            <p>It was a little before the great Rains, just now mention'd, that I threw this Stuff
               away, taking no Notice of any Thing, and not so much as remembring that I had thrown any Thing there; when about a Month after, or thereabout, I
               saw some few Stalks of something green, shooting out of the Ground, which I fancy'd
               might be some Plant I had not seen, but I was surpriz'd and perfectly astonish'd, when, after a little longer Time, I saw about ten or twelve Ears come out, which were perfect green
               Barley of the same Kind as our <hi rend="italic">European,</hi> nay, as
               our <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Barley.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" />It is impossible to express the Astonishment and
               Confusion of my Thoughts on this Occasion; I had hitherto acted upon no religious
               Foundation at all, indeed I had very few Notions of Religion in my Head, or had
               entertain'd any Sense of any Thing that had befallen me, otherwise than as a Chance,
               or, as we lightly say, what pleases God; without so much as enquiring into the End of
               Providence in these Things, or his Order in governing Events
               in the World: But after I saw Barley grow there, in a
               Climate which I know was not proper for Corn, and especially that I knew not how it
               came there, it startl'd me strangely, and I began to suggest, that God had
               miraculously caus'd this Grain to grow without any Help of Seed sown, and that it was
               so directed purely for my Sustenance, on that wild miserable Place.</p>
            <p>This touch'd my Heart a little, and brought Tears out of my Eyes, and I began to
               bless my self, that such a Prodigy of Nature should happen
               upon my Account; and this was the more strange to me, because I saw near it still all
               along by the Side of the Rock, some other straggling Stalks, which prov'd to be
               Stalks of Ryce, and which I knew, because I had seen it grow in <hi rend="italic">Africa</hi> when
               I was ashore there.</p>
            <p>I not only thought these the pure Productions of Providence for my Support, but not
               doubting, but that there was more in the Place, I went all over that Part of the
               Island, where I had been before, peering in every Corner, and under every Rock, to
               see for more of it, but I could not find any; at last it occur'd to my Thoughts, that
               I had shook a Bag of <ref target="chicken_" corresp="chicken">Chickens
                  Meat</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="chicken" target="chicken_"
                  type="gloss">Chicken's food; in this case, barley (referred to here sometimes as
                  corn), which Crusoe realizes must have germinated and sprouted.</note> out in that
               Place, and then the Wonder began to cease; and I must confess, my religious
               Thankfulness to God's Providence began to abate too upon the
                  Discovering that all this was nothing but what was <pb
                  n="92" /> common; tho' I ought to have been as thankful
               for so strange and unforseen Providence, as if it had been miraculous; for it was
               really the Work of Providence as to me, that should order or appoint, that 10 or 12
               Grains of Corn should remuin unspoil'd, (when the Rats had
               destroy'd all the rest,) as if it had been dropt from Heaven; as also, that I should
               throw it out in that particular Place, where it being in the Shade of a high Rock, it
               sprang up immediately; whereas, if I had thrown it anywhere else, at that Time, it
               had been burnt up and destroy'd.</p>
            <p>I carefully sav'd the Ears of this Corn you may be sure in their Season, which was
               about the End of <hi rend="italic">June</hi>; and laying up every Corn, I resolv'd to sow them all
               again, hoping in Time to have some Quantity sufficient to supply me with Bread; But
               it was not till the 4th Year that I could allow my self the least Grain of this Corn
               to eat, and even then but sparingly, as I shall say afterwards in its Order; for I lost all that I sow'd the first Season, by not
               observing the proper Time; for I sow'd it just before the dry Season, so that it
               never came up at all, at least, not as it would ha' done: <ref target="place_"

            </p>
            <p>Besides this Barley, there was, as above, 20 or 30 Stalks of Ryce, which I preserv'd
               with the same Care, and whose Use was of the same Kind or to the same Purpose,
                  (<hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>) to make me Bread, or rather Food; for I found Ways to cook it up
                  without baking, tho' I did that also after some Time. But
               to return to my Journal,</p>
            <p>I work'd excessive hard these three or four Months to get my Wall done; and the 14th
               of <hi rend="italic">April</hi> I closed it up, contriving to go into it, not by a Door, but over
               the Wall by a Ladder, that <pb n="93" /> there might be no
               Sign in the Out-side of my Habitation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">April</hi> 16. I finish'd the Ladder, so I went up with the Ladder to the Top,
               and then pull'd it up after me, and let it down in the In-side: This was a compleat
               Enclosure to me; for within I had Room enough, and nothing could come at me from
               without, unless it could first mount my Wall.</p>
            <p>The very next Day after this Wall was finish'd, I had almost had all my Labour
               overthrown at once, and my self kill'd, the Case was thus, As I was busy in the
               Inside of it, behind my Tent, just in the Entrance into my Cave, I was terribly
               frighted with a most dreadful surprising Thing indeed; for
               all on a sudden I found the Earth come crumbling down from the Roof of my Cave, and
               from the Edge of the Hill over my Head, and two of the Posts I had set up in the Cave
               crack'd in a frightful Manner; I was heartily scar'd, but thought nothing of what was
               really the Cause, only thinking that the Top of my Cave was falling in, as some of it
               had done before; and for Fear I shou'd be bury'd in it, I run foreward to my Ladder,
               and not thinking my self safe there neither, I got over my Wall for Fear of the
               Pieces of the Hill which I expected might roll down upon me: I was no sooner stepp'd down upon the firm Ground, but I plainly saw it was a terrible Earthquake, for the Ground I stood
               on shook three Times at about eight Minutes Distance, with
               three such Shocks, as would have overturn'd the strongest Building that could be
               suppos'd to have stood on the Earth, and a great Piece of the Top of a Rock, which
               stood about half a Mile from me next the Sea, fell down with
               such a terrible Noise, as I never heard in all my Life, I perceiv'd also, the very
               Sea was put into violent Motion by it; and I believe the <pb n="94"
                  /> Shocks were <ref target="shocks_" corresp="shocks"

                  astonishingly accurate observation, given that Defoe had probably never
                  experienced an earthquake himself, and that plate tectonic theory was only
                  introduced in the 20th century.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I was so amaz'd with the Thing it self, having never felt the like, or discours'd
               with any one that had, that I was like one dead or stupify'd; and the Motion of the
               Earth made my Stomach sick like one that was toss'd at Sea; but the Noise of the
               falling of the Rock awak'd me as it were, and rousing me from the stupify'd Condition
               I was in, fill'd me with Horror, and I thought of nothing then but the Hill falling
               upon my Tent and all my houshold Goods, and burying all at once; and this sunk my
               very Soul within me a second Time.</p>
            <p>After the third Shock was over, and I felt no more for some Time, I began to take
               Courage, and yet I had not Heart enough to go over my Wall again, for Fear of being
               buried alive, but sat still upon the Ground, greatly cast down and disconsolate, not knowing what to do: All this while I had not
               the least serious religious Thought, nothing but the common, <hi rend="italic">Lord ha' Mercy upon
                  me</hi>; and when it was over, that went away too.</p>
            <p>While I sat thus, I found the Air over-cast, and grow cloudy, as if it would Rain;
               soon after that the Wind rose by little and little, so that,
               in less than half an Hour, it blew a most dreadful Hurricane: The Sea was all on a
               Sudden cover'd over with Foam and Froth, the Shore was cover'd with the Breach of the
               Water, the Trees were torn up by the Roots, and a terrible Storm it was; and this
               held about three Hours, and then began to abate, and in two Hours more it was stark
               calm, and began to rain very hard.</p>
            <p>All this while I sat upon the Ground very much terrify'd and dejected, when on a
               sudden it came into my thoughts, that these Winds and Rain being the <ref

                  Earthquake</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="earthquake"
                  target="earthquake_" type="gloss">Defoe's scientific reasoning is interesting, but
                  inaccurate: there is, in fact, no causal link between seismic activity and
                  hurricanes.</note>, the Earthquake <pb n="95" /> it self
               was spent and over, and I might venture into my Cave again: With this Thought my
               Spirits began to revive, and the Rain also helping to perswade me, I went in and sat down in my Tent, but the Rain was so violent, that my
               Tent was ready to be beaten down with it, and I was forc'd to go into my Cave, tho'
               very much affraid and uneasy for fear it should fall on my Head.</p>
            <p>This violent Rain forc'd me to a new Work, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> To cut a Hole thro' my new
               Fortification like a Sink to let the Water go out, which would else have drown'd my
               Cave. After I had been in my Cave some time, and found still no more Shocks of the
               Earthquake follow, I began to be more compos'd; and now to
               support my Spirits, which indeed wanted it very much, I went to my little Store and
               took a small Sup of Rum, which however I did then and always very sparingly, knowing
               I could have no more when that was gone.</p>
            <p>It continu'd raining all that Night, and great Part of the next Day, so that I could
               not stir abroad, but my Mind being more compos'd, I began to think of what I had best do, concluding that if the
               Island was subject to these Earthquakes, there would be no living for me in a Cave,
               but I must consider of building me some little Hut in an open Place which I might
               surround with a Wall as I had done here, and so make my self secure from wild Beasts
               or Men; but concluded, if I staid where I was, I should certainly, one time or other,
               be bury'd alive.</p>
            <p>With these Thoughts I resolv'd to remove my Tent from the Place where it stood, which
               was just under the hanging Precipice of the Hill, and which, if it should be shaken
               again, would certainly fall upon my Tent: And I spent the
               two next <pb n="96" /> Days, being the 19th and 20th of
                  <hi rend="italic">April,</hi> in contriving where and how to remove my
               Habitation.</p>
            <p>The fear of being swallow'd up alive, made me that I never slept in quiet, and yet
               the Apprehensions of lying abroad without any Fence was
               almost equal to it; but still when I look'd about and saw how every thing was put in
               order, how pleasantly conceal'd I was, and how safe from Danger, it made me very
               loath to remove.</p>
            <p>In the mean time it occur'd to me that it would require a vast deal of time for me to
               do this, and that I must be contented to run the Venture where I was, till I had
               form'd a Camp for my self, and had secur'd it so as to remove to it: So with this
               Resolution I compos'd my self for a time, and resolv'd that
               I would go to work with all Speed to build me a Wall with Piles and Cables,
                  <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> in a Circle as before, and set my Tent up in it when it was
               finish'd, but that I would venture to stay where I was till it was finish'd and fit
               to remove to. This was the 21st.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">April</hi> 22. The next Morning I began to consider of Means to put this Resolve
               in Execution, but I was at a great loss about my Tools; I had three large Axes and
               abundance of Hatchets, (for we carried the Hatchets for <ref target="traffick_"

            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">May</hi> 1. In the Morning looking towards the Sea-side, the Tide being low, I
               saw something lye on the Shore bigger than ordinary, and it look'd like a Cask, when
               I came to it, I found a small Barrel, and two or three Pieces of the Wreck of the
               Ship, which were driven on Shore by the late Hurricane, and looking towards the Wreck
               itself, I thought it seem'd to lye higher out of the Water
               than it us'd to do; I examin'd the Barrel which was driven on Shore, and soon found
               it was a Barrel of Gunpowder, but it had taken Water, and the Powder was cak'd as
               hard as a Stone, however I roll'd it farther on Shore for
               the present, and went on upon the Sands as near as I could to the Wreck of the Ship
               to look for more.</p>

            <p>When I came down to the Ship I found it strangely remov'd,
               The Fore-castle which lay before bury'd in Sand, was heav'd
               up at least Six Foot, and the Stern which was broke to Pieces and parted from the
               rest by the Force of the Sea soon after I had left rummaging her, was toss'd, as it
               were, up, and cast on one Side, and the Sand was thrown so high on that Side next her
               Stern, that whereas there was a great Place of Water before, so that I could not come
               within a Quarter of a Mile of the Wreck without swimming, I could now walk <pb n="98"
                  /> quite up to her when the Tide was out; I was surpriz'd with this at first, but soon concluded it must be
               done by the Earthquake, and as by this Violence the Ship was more broken open than
               formerly, so many Things came daily on Shore, which the Sea
               had loosen'd, and which the Winds and Water rolled by Degrees to the Land.</p>
            <p>This wholly diverted my Thoughts from the Design of removing my Habitation; and I
               busied my self mightily that Day especially, in searching whether I could make any
               Way into the Ship, but I found nothing was to be expected of that Kind, for that all
               the In-side of the Ship was choack'd up with Sand: However, as I had learn'd not to
               despair of any Thing, I resolv'd to pull every Thing to Pieces that I could of the
               Ship, concluding, that every Thing I could get from her would be of some Use or other
               to me.</p>

               clear'd away the Sand as well as I could from the Side which lay highest; but the
               Tide coming in, I was oblig'd to give over for that Time.</p>

               was weary of my Sport, when just going to leave off, I caught a young Dolphin. I had
               made me a long Line of some Rope Yarn, but I had no Hooks, yet I frequently caught
               Fish enough, as much as I car'd to eat; all which I dry'd in the Sun, and eat them
               dry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">May</hi> 5. Work'd on the Wreck, cut another Beam asunder, and brought three
               great Fir Planks off from the Decks, which I ty'd together, and made swim on Shore
               when the Tide of Flood came on.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" />
               <hi rend="italic">May</hi> 6. Work'd on the Wreck, got several Iron Bolts out of her, and other
               Pieces of Iron Work, work'd very hard, and came Home very much tyr'd, and had
               Thoughts of giving it over.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">May</hi> 7. Went to the Wreck again, but with an Intent not to work, but found
               the Weight of the Wreck had broke itself down, the Beams being cut, that several
               Pieces of the Ship seem'd to lie loose, and the In-side of the Hold lay so open, that
               I could see into it, but almost full of Water and Sand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">May</hi> 8. Went to the Wreck, and carry'd an Iron Crow to wrench up the Deck,
               which lay now quite clear of the Water or Sand; I wrench'd open two Planks, and
               brought them on Shore also with the Tide: I left the Iron Crow in the Wreck for next
               Day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">May</hi> 9. Went to the Wreck, and with the Crow made Way into the Body of the
               Wreck, and felt several Casks, and loosen'd them with the Crow, but could not break
               them up; I felt also the Roll of <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Lead, and could stir it, but it was
               too heavy to remove.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">May</hi> 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Went every Day to the Wreck, and got a great deal of
               Pieces of Timber, and Boards, or Plank, and 2 or 300 Weight
               of Iron.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">May</hi> 15. I carry'd two Hatchets to try if I could not cut a Piece off of the
               Roll of Lead, by placing the Edge of one Hatchet, and driving it with the other; but
               as it lay about a Foot and a half in the Water, I could not make any Blow to drive
               the Hatchet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">May</hi> 16. It had blow'd hard in the Night, and the Wreck appear'd more broken
               by the Force of the Water; but I stay'd so long in the Woods to get Pidgeons for
               Food, that the Tide prevented me going to the Wreck that Day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" />
               <hi rend="italic">May</hi> 17. I saw some Pieces of the Wreck blown on Shore, at a great Distance,
               near two Miles off me, but resolv'd to see what they were, and found it was a Piece
               of the Head, but too heavy for me to bring away.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">May</hi> 24. Every Day to this Day I work'd on the Wreck, and with hard Labour I
               loosen'd some Things so much with the Crow, that the first blowing Tide several Casks
               floated out, and two of the Seamens Chests; but the Wind blowing from the Shore,
               nothing came to Land that Day, but Pieces of Timber, and a Hogshead which had some
                  <hi rend="italic">Brazil</hi> Pork in it, but the Salt-water and the Sand had spoil'd it.</p>
            <p>I continu'd this Work every Day to the 15th of <hi rend="italic">June,</hi> except the Time
               necessary to get Food, which I always appointed, during this Part of my Employment,
               to be when the Tide was up, that I might be ready when it was ebb'd out, and by this
               Time I had gotten Timber, and Plank, and Iron-Work enough, to have builded a good
               Boat, if I had known how; and also, I got at several Times, and in several Pieces,
               near <ref target="hundredweight3_" corresp="hundredweight3">100 Weight</ref><note

               <hi rend="italic">June</hi> 16. Going down to the Sea-side, I found a large Tortoise or Turtle;
               this was the first I had seen, which it seems was only my Misfortune, not any Defect
               of the Place, or Scarcity; for had I happen'd to be on the
               other Side of the Island, I might have had Hundreds of them every Day, as I found
               afterwards; but perhaps had paid dear enough for them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">June</hi> 17. I spent in cooking the Turtle; I found in her threescore Eggs; and
               her Flesh was to me at that Time the most savoury and pleasant that ever I tasted in
               my Life, having had no Flesh, <pb n="101" /> but of Goats
               and Fowls, since I landed in this horrid Place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">June</hi> 18. Rain'd all Day, and I stay'd within. I thought at this Time the
               Rain felt Cold, and I was something chilly, which I knew was not usual in that
               Latitude.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">June</hi> 19. Very ill, and shivering, as if the Weather
               had been cold.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">June</hi> 20. No Rest all Night, violent Pains in my Head, and feaverish.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">June</hi> 21. Very ill, frighted almost to Death with the Apprehensions of my sad
               Condition, to be sick, and no Help: Pray'd to GOD for the first Time since the Storm
               off of <hi rend="italic">Hull,</hi> but scarce knew what I said, or why; my Thoughts being all
               confused.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">June</hi> 22. A little better, but under dreadful Apprehensions of Sickness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">June</hi> 23. Very bad again, cold and shivering, and then a violent

            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">June</hi> 24. Much better.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">June</hi> 25. An Ague very violent; the Fit held me seven Hours, cold Fit and
               hot, with faint Sweats after it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">June</hi> 26. Better; and having no Victuals to eat, took my Gun, but found my
               self very weak; however I kill'd a She-Goat, and with much Difficulty got it Home, and broil'd some of it, and eat; I wou'd fain have stew'd it,
               and made some Broath, but had no Pot.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">June</hi> 27. The Ague again so violent, that I lay a-Bed all Day, and neither
               eat or drank. I was ready to perish for Thirst, but so weak, I had not Strength to
               stand up, or to get my self any Water to drink: Pray'd to God again, but was
               light-headed, and when I was not, I was so ignorant, that I
               knew not what to say; only I lay and <pb n="102" /> cry'd,
                  <hi rend="italic">Lord look upon me, Lord pity me, Lord have Mercy upon me</hi>: I suppose I did
               nothing else for two or three Hours, till the Fit wearing off, I fell asleep, and did
               not wake till far in the Night; when I wak'd, I found my self much refresh'd, but
               weak, and exceeding thirsty: However, as I had no Water in
               my whole Habitation, I was forc'd to lie till Morning, and
               went to sleep again: In this second Sleep, I had this terrible Dream.</p>
            <p>I thought, that I was sitting on the Ground on the Out-side of my Wall, where I sat
               when the Storm blew after the Earthquake, and that I saw a Man descend from a great
               black Cloud, in a bright Flame of Fire, and <ref target="light_" corresp="light"
                  >light</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="light" target="light_"
                  type="gloss">Alight</note> upon the Ground: He was all over as bright as a Flame,
               so that I could but just bear to look towards him; his Countenance was most
               inexpressibly dreadful, impossible for Words to describe; when he stepp'd upon the
               Ground with his Feet, I thought the Earth trembl'd, just as it had done before in the
               Earthquake, and all the Air look'd, to my Apprehension, as
               if it had been fill'd with Flashes of Fire.</p>
            <p>He was no sooner landed upon the Earth, but he moved forward towards me, with a long
               Spear or Weapon in his Hand, to kill me; and when he came to a rising Ground, at some
               Distance, he spoke to me, or I heard a Voice so terrible, that it is impossible to
               express the Terror of it; all that I can say, I understood, was this, <hi rend="italic">Seeing all
                  these Things have not brought thee to Repentance, now thou shalt die</hi>: At
               which Words, I thought he lifted up the Spear that was in his Hand, to kill me.</p>
            <p>No one, that shall ever read this Account, will expect that I should be able to
               describe the Horrors of my Soul at this terrible Vision, I mean, that even while it
               was a Dream, I even dreamed of those Horrors; nor is it any more possible to describe
                  <pb n="103" /> the Impression that remain'd upon my Mind
               when I awak'd and found it was but a Dream.</p>
            <p>I had alas! no divine Knowledge; what I had received by the
               good Instruction of my Father was then worn out by an uninterrupted Series, for 8
               Years, of Seafaring Wickedness, and a constant Conversation with nothing but such as
               were like my self, wicked and prophane to the last Degree: I do not remember that I
               had in all that Time one Thought that so much as tended either to looking upwards
               toward God, or inwards towards a Reflection upon my own Ways: But a certain Stupidity
               of Soul, without Desire of Good, or Conscience of Evil, had
               entirely overwhelm'd me, and I was all that the most hardned, unthinking, wicked
               Creature among our common Sailors, can be supposed to be, not having the least Sense,
               either of the Fear of God in Danger, or of Thankfulness to God in Deliverances.</p>
            <p>In the relating what is already past of my Story, this will be the more easily
               believ'd, when I shall add, that thro' all the Variety of Miseries that had to this
               Day befallen me, I never had so much as one Thought of it being the Hand of God, or
               that it was a just Punishment for my Sin; my rebellious
               Behaviour against my Father, or my present Sins which were
               great; or so much as a Punishment for the general Course of
               my wicked Life. When I was on the desperate Expedition on the desart Shores of <hi rend="italic">Africa,</hi> I never had so much as one
               Thought of what would become of me; or one Wish to God to direct me whether I should
               go, or to keep me from the Danger which apparently surrounded me, as well from voracious Creatures as cruel Savages: But I was meerly
               thoughtless of a God, or a Providence; acted like a meer Brute from the Principles of
               Nature, and by the Dictates of common Sense only, and indeed hardly that.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" />When I was deliver'd and taken up at Sea by
               the <hi rend="italic">Portugal</hi> Captain, well us'd, and dealt justly and honourably with, as
               well as charitably, I had not the least Thankfulness on my Thoughts: When again I was
               shipwreck'd, ruin'd, and in Danger of drowning on this Island, I was as far from Remorse, or looking on it as a Judgment; I only said to my
               self often, that I was <hi rend="italic">an unfortunate Dog,</hi> and born to be always
               miserable.</p>
            <p>It is true, when I got on Shore first here, and found all my Ship's Crew drown'd, and
               my self spar'd, I was surpriz'd with a Kind of Extasie, and some Transports of Soul,
               which, had the Grace of God assisted, might have come up to true Thankfulness; but it ended where it begun, in a meer common
               Flight of Joy, or as I may say, <hi rend="italic">being glad I was alive,</hi> without the least
               Reflection upon the distinguishing Goodness of the Hand which had preserv'd me, and
               had singled me out to be preserv'd, when all the rest were
               destroy'd; or an Enquiry why Providence had been thus
               merciful to me; even just the same common Sort of Joy which Seamen generally have
               after they are got safe ashore from a Shipwreck, which they drown all in the next
               Bowl of Punch, and forget almost as soon as it is over, and all the rest of my Life
               was like it.</p>
            <p>Even when I was afterwards, on due Consideration, made
               sensible of my Condition, how I was cast on this dreadful Place, out of the Reach of
                  humane Kind, out of all Hope of Relief, or Prospect of
               Redemption, as soon as I saw but a Prospect of living, and that I should not starve
               and perish for Hunger, all the Sense of my Affliction wore off, and I begun to be
               very easy, apply'd my self to the Works proper for my Preservation and Supply, and
               was far enough from being afflicted at my Condition, as a
               Judgment from Heaven, or as the <pb n="105" /> Hand of God
               against me; these were Thoughts which very seldom enter'd into my Head.</p>
            <p>The growing up of the Corn, as is hinted in my Journal, had at first some little
               Influence upon me, and began to affect me with Seriousness, as long as I thought it
               had something miraculous in it; but as soon as ever that Part of the Thought was
               remov'd, all the Impression which was rais'd from it, wore off also, as I have noted
               already.</p>
            <p>Even the Earthquake, tho' nothing could be more terrible in its Nature, or more
               immediately directing to the invisible Power which alone directs such Things, yet no sooner was the first Fright over, but the Impression it
               had made went off also. I had no more Sense of God or his Judgments, much less of the
               present Affliction of my Circumstances being from his Hand,
               than if I had been in the most prosperous Condition of Life.</p>
            <p>But now when I began to be sick, and a leisurely View of the
               Miseries of Death came to place itself before me; when my
               Spirits began to sink under the Burthen of a strong
               Distemper, and Nature was exhausted with the Violence of the Feaver; Conscience that
               had slept so long, begun to awake, and I began to reproach my self with my past Life,
               in which I had so evidently, by uncommon Wickedness,
               provok'd the Justice of God to lay me under uncommon Strokes, and to deal with me in
               so vindictive a Manner.</p>
            <p>These Reflections oppress'd me for the second or third Day of my Distemper, and in
               the Violence, as well of the Feaver, as of the dreadful Reproaches of my Conscience,
               extorted some Words from me, like praying to God, tho' I cannot say they were either
               a Prayer attended with Desires or with Hopes; it was rather the Voice of meer Fright
               and Distress; my Thoughts were confus'd, the <pb n="106" />
               Convictions great upon my Mind, and the Horror of dying in such a miserable Condition
               rais'd Vapours into my Head with the meer Apprehensions; and in these Hurries of my Soul, I know not what my
               Tongue might express: but it was rather Exclamation, such
               as, Lord! what a miserable Creature am I? If I should be sick, I shall certainly die for Want of Help, and what will become of me! Then
               the Tears burst out of my Eyes, and I could say no more for a good while.</p>
            <p>In this Interval, the good Advice of my Father came to my Mind, and presently his
               Prediction which I mention'd at the Beginning of this Story, <hi rend="italic">viz. That if I did
                  take this foolish Step, God would not bless me, and I would have Leisure hereafter
                  to reflect upon having neglected his Counsel, when there might be none to assist
                  in my Recovery.</hi> Now, said I aloud, My dear Father's Words are come to pass:
               God's Justice has overtaken me, and I have none to help or hear me: I rejected the
               Voice of Providence, which had mercifully put me in a Posture or Station of Life, wherein I might have been happy and easy; but
               I would neither see it my self, or learn to know the Blessing of it from my Parents;
               I left them to mourn over my Folly, and now I am left to mourn under the Consequences
               of it: I refus'd their Help and Assistance who wou'd have lifted me into the World,
               and wou'd have made every Thing easy to me, and now I have Difficulties to struggle with, too great for even Nature itself to support, and no Assistance, no Help, no Comfort, no Advice;
               then I cry'd out, <hi rend="italic">Lord be my Help, for I am in great Distress.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the first Prayer, if I may call it so, that I had made for many Years: But I
               return to my Journal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" />
               <hi rend="italic">June</hi> 28. Having been somewhat refresh'd with the Sleep I had had, and the
               Fit being entirely off, I got up; and tho' the Fright and Terror of my Dream was very
               great, yet I consider'd, that the Fit of the Ague wou'd return again the next Day,
               and now was my Time to get something to refresh and support my self when I should be
               ill; and the first Thing I did, I fill'd a large square Case Bottle with Water, and
               set it upon my Table, in Reach of my Bed; and to take off
               the chill or aguish Disposition of the Water, I put about a Quarter of a Pint of Rum
               into it, and mix'd them together; then I got me a Piece of the Goat's Flesh, and
               broil'd it on the Coals, but could eat very little; I walk'd about, but was very
               weak, and withal very sad and heavy-hearted in the Sense of my miserable Condition;
                  dreading the Return of my Distemper the next Day; at
               Night I made my Supper of three of the Turtle's Eggs, which I roasted in the Ashes,
               and eat, as we call it, in the Shell; and this was the first Bit of <ref
                  target="meat_" corresp="meat">Meat</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff"
                  xml:id="meat" target="meat_" type="gloss">Food generally, not necessarily
                  restricted to animal's flesh</note> I had ever ask'd God's Blessing to, even as I
               cou'd remember, in my whole Life.</p>
            <p>After I had eaten, I try'd to walk, but found my self so weak, that I cou'd hardly
               carry the Gun, (for I never went out without that) so I went but a little Way, and
               sat down upon the Ground, looking out upon the Sea, which was just before me, and
               very calm and smooth: As I sat here, some such Thoughts as these occurred to me.</p>
            <p>What is this Earth and Sea of which I have seen so much, whence is it produc'd, and
               what am I, and all the other Creatures, wild and tame, humane and brutal, whence are
               we?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" />Sure we are all made by some secret Power, who
               form'd the Earth and Sea, the Air and Sky; and who is that?</p>
            <p>Then it follow'd most naturally, It is God that has made it all: Well, but then it
               came on strangely, if God has made all these Things, He guides and governs them all,
               and all Things that concern them; for the Power that could make all Things, must
               certainly have Power to guide and direct them.</p>
            <p>If so, nothing can happen in the great Circuit of his Works, either without his
               Knowledge or Appointment.</p>
            <p>And if nothing happens without his Knowledge, he knows that I am here, and am in this
               dreadful Condition; and if nothing happens without his Appointment, he has appointed
               all this to befal me.</p>
            <p>Nothing occurr'd to my Thought to contradict any of these Conclusions; and therefore
               it rested upon me with the greater Force, that it must needs be, that God had
               appointed all this to befal me; that I was brought to this miserable Circumstance by
               his Direction, he having the sole Power, not of me only, but of every Thing that
               happen'd in the World. Immediately it follow'd,</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Why has God done this to me? What have I done to be thus us'd?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Conscience presently check'd me in that Enquiry, as if I
               had blasphem'd, and methought it spoke to me like a Voice; <hi rend="italic">WRETCH! dost thou ask
                  what thou hast done!</hi> look back upon a dreadful mis-spent Life, and ask thy
               self <hi rend="italic">what thou hast not done?</hi> ask, Why is it <hi rend="italic">that thou wert not long ago
                     destroy'd?</hi> Why <hi rend="italic">wert thou not drown'd in</hi>
               Yarmouth Roads? <hi rend="italic">Kill'd in the Fight when the Ship was taken by</hi> the Sallee
               Man of War? <hi rend="italic">Devour'd by the wild Beasts <pb n="109" />
                  on the</hi> Coast of Africa? Or, <hi rend="italic">Drown'd HERE, when all the Crew perish'd but
                  thy self</hi>? Dost thou ask, <hi rend="italic">What have I done?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was struck dumb with these Reflections, as one astonish'd, and had not a Word to
               say, no not to answer to my self, but rise up pensive and sad, walk'd back to my
               Retreat, and went up over my Wall, as if I had been going to Bed, but my Thoughts
               were sadly disturb'd, and I had no Inclination to Sleep; so
               I sat down in my Chair, and lighted my Lamp, for it began to be dark: Now as the
               Apprehension of the Return of my Distemper terrify'd me very
               much, it occurr'd to my Thought, that the <hi rend="italic">Brasilians</hi> take no Physick but
               their Tobacco, for almost all Distempers; and I had a Piece of a Roll of Tobacco in
               one of the Chests, which was quite cur'd, and some also that was green and not quite
               cur'd.</p>
            <p>I went, directed by Heaven no doubt; for in this Chest I found a Cure, both for Soul
               and Body, I open'd the Chest, and found what I look'd for, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> the Tobacco;
               and as the few Books, I had sav'd, lay there too, I took out one of the Bibles which
               I mention'd before, and which to this Time I had not found Leisure, or so much as
               Inclination to look into; I say, I took it out, and brought both that and the Tobacco
               with me to the Table.</p>
            <p>What Use to make of the Tobacco, I knew not, as to my Distemper, or whether it was
               good for it or no; but I try'd several Experiments with it, as if I was resolv'd it
               should hit one Way or other: I first took a Piece of a Leaf, and chew'd it in my
               Mouth, which indeed at first almost stupify'd my Brain, the Tobacco being green and
               strong, and that I had not been much us'd to it; then I took some and steeped it an
               Hour or two in some Rum, and resolv'd to take a Dose of it when I lay down; <pb
                  n="110" /> and lastly, I burnt some upon a Pan of Coals,
               and held my Nose close over the Smoke of it as long as I could bear it, as well for
               the Heat as almost for Suffocation.</p>
            <p>In the Interval of this Operation, I took up the Bible and began to read, but my Head
               was too much disturb'd with the Tobacco to bear reading, at least that Time; only
               having open'd the Book casually, the first Words that
               occurr'd to me were these, <ref target="psalmfifty_" corresp="psalmfifty">Call on me
                  in the Day of Trouble</ref> <note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="psalmfifty"
                     target="psalmfifty_" type="gloss">Psalm 50:15</note>, and I will deliver, and thou shalt glorify me.
            </p>
            <p>The Words were very apt to my Case, and made some Impression upon my Thoughts at the
               Time of reading them, tho' not so much as they did afterwards; for as for being deliver'd, the Word had no Sound, <hi rend="italic">as I may say,</hi> to
               me; the Thing was so remote, so impossible in my Apprehension of Things, that I began
               to say as the Children of <hi rend="italic">Israel</hi> did, <ref target="exodus2_"
                  corresp="exodus2">when they were promis'd Flesh to eat</ref><note
                  resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="exodus2" target="exodus2_" type="gloss"
                  >God grants the hungry Israelites manna to eat as they cross the desert, bound for
                  the promised land (Exodus 16:1-13)</note>, <hi rend="italic">Can God spread a Table in the
                  Wilderness</hi>; so I began to say, Can God himself deliver me from this Place?
               and as it was not for many Years that any Hope appear'd, this prevail'd very often
               upon my Thoughts: But however, the Words made a great Impression upon me, and I mused
               upon them very often. It grew now late, and the Tobacco had, as I said, doz'd my Head
               so much, that I inclin'd to sleep; so I left my Lamp burning in the Cave, least I
               should want any Thing in the Night, and went to Bed; but before I lay down, I did
               what I never had done in all my Life, I kneel'd down and pray'd to God to fulfil the
               Promise to me, that if I call'd upon him in the Day of Trouble, he would deliver me;
                  after my broken and imperfect Prayer was over, I drunk
               the Rum in which I had steep'd the Tobacco, which was so
               strong and rank of the Tobacco, that indeed I could scarce get it down; immediately
                  <pb n="111" /> upon this I went to Bed, I found presently
               it flew up in my Head violently, but I fell into a sound Sleep, and wak'd no more
               'till by the Sun it must necessarily be near Three a-Clock in the Afternoon the next
               Day; nay, to this Hour, I'm partly of the Opinion, that I slept all the next Day and
               Night, and 'till almost Three that Day after; for otherwise
               I knew not how I should lose a Day out of my Reckoning in the Days of the Week, as it
               appear'd some Years after I had done: for if I had lost it by crossing and
               re-crossing the Line, I should have lost more than one Day: But certainly I lost a
               Day in my Accompt, and never knew which Way.</p>
            <p>Be that however one Way or th' other, when I awak'd I found my self exceedingly
               refresh'd, and my Spirits lively and chearful; when I got up, I was stronger than I
               was the Day before, and my Stomach better, for I was hungry; and in short, I had no
               Fit the next Day, but continu'd much alter'd for the better; this was the 29th.</p>
            <p>The 30th was my well Day of Course, and I went abroad with my Gun, but did not care
               to travel too far, I kill'd a Sea Fowl or two, something
               like a brand Goose, and brought them Home, but was not very forward to eat them; so I
               ate some more of the Turtle's Eggs, which were very good. This Evening I renew'd the
               Medicine which I had suppos'd did me good the Day before, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> the Tobacco steep'd in Rum, only I did not take so much as before, nor did I chew any of the Leaf, or hold my Head over
               the Smoke; however, I was not so well the next Day, which was the first of
                  <hi rend="italic">July,</hi> as I hop'd I shou'd have been; for I had a little Spice of the cold
               Fit, but it was not much.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">July</hi> 2. I renew'd the Medicine all the three Ways, and doz'd my self with it
               as at first; and doubled the Quantity which I drank.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" />3. I miss'd the Fit for good and all, tho' I
               did not recover my full Strength for some Weeks after; while I was thus gathering
               Strength, my Thoughts run exceedingly upon this Scripture, <hi rend="italic">I will deliver
                  thee,</hi> and the Impossibility of my Deliverance lay much upon my Mind in Barr
               of my ever expecting it: But as I was discouraging my self with such Thoughts, it
               occurr'd to my Mind, that I pored so much upon my Deliverance from the main Affliction, that I disregarded the Deliverance I had receiv'd; and I was, as it were, made to ask my self such
               Questions as these, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> Have I not been deliver'd, and wonderfully too,
               from Sickness? from the most distress'd Condition that could be, and that was so
               frightful to me, and what Notice I had taken of it: Had I done my Part, <hi rend="italic">God had
                     deliver'd me, but I had not glorify'd him</hi>; that
               is to say, I had not own'd and been thankful for that as a Deliverance, and how cou'd
               I expect greater Deliverance?</p>
            <p>This touch'd my Heart very much, and immediately I kneeel'd
               down and gave God Thanks aloud, for my Recovery from my
               Sickness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">July</hi> 4. In the Morning I took the Bible, and beginning at the New Testament, I began seriously to read it, and impos'd upon my
               self to read a while every Morning and every Night, not tying my self to the Number
               of Chapters, but as long as my Thoughts shou'd engage me: It was not long after I set
               seriously to this Work, but I found my Heart more deeply and sincerely affected with
               the Wickedness of my past Life: The Impression of my Dream
               reviv'd, and the Words, <hi rend="italic">All these Things have not brought thee to
                  Repentance,</hi> ran seriously in my Thought: I was
               earnestly begging of God to give me Repentance, when it happen'd providentially the
               very Day that reading the Scriture, <pb n="113"
                  /> I came to these Words, <ref target="acts_"
                  corresp="acts">He is exalted a Prince and a Saviour, to give Repentance, and to
                  give Remission</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff"
                  xml:id="acts" target="acts_" type="gloss">Acts 5:31</note>: I threw down the Book,
               and with my Heart as well as my Hands lifted up to Heaven, in a Kind of Extasy of
               Joy, I cry'd out aloud, <hi rend="italic">Jesus, thou Son of</hi> David, <hi rend="italic">Jesus, thou exalted
                  Prince and Saviour, give me Repentance!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the first Time that I could say, in the true Sense of the Words, that I
               pray'd in all my Life; for now I pray'd with a Sense of my Condition, and with a true
               Scripture View of Hope founded on the Encouragement of the Word of God; and from this
               Time, I may say, I began to have Hope that God would hear me.</p>
            <p>Now I began to construe the Words mentioned above, <hi rend="italic">Call on me, and I will deliver
                  you,</hi> in a different Sense from what I had ever done
               before; for then I had no Notion of any thing being call'd Deliverance, but my being deliver'd from the Captivity I was
               in; for tho' I was indeed at large in the Place, yet the Island was certainly a
               Prison to me, and that in the worst Sense in the World; but now I learn'd to take it
               in another Sense: Now I look'd back upon my past Life with such Horrour, and my Sins
               appear'd so dreadful, that my Soul sought nothing of God, but Deliverance from the Load of Guilt that bore down all my Comfort:
               As for my solitary Life it was nothing; I did not so much as pray to be deliver'd
               from it, or think of it; It was all of no Consideration in Comparison to this: And I
               add this Part here, to hint to whoever shall read it, that whenever they come to a
               true Sense of things, they will find Deliverance from Sin a
               much greater Blessing, that Deliverance from Affliction.</p>
            <p>But leaving this Part, I return to my Journal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" />My Condition began now to be, tho' not less
                  miserable as to my Way of living, yet much easier to my
               Mind; and my Thoughts being directed, by a constant reading the Scripture, and
               praying to God, to things of a higher Nature: I had a great deal of Comfort within,
               which till now I knew nothing of; also, as my Health and
               Strength returned, I bestirr'd my self to furnish my self with every thing that I
               wanted, and make my Way of living as regular as I could.</p>
            <p>From the 4th of <hi rend="italic">July</hi> to the 14th, I was chiefly employ'd in walking about
               with my Gun in my Hand, a little and a little, at a Time, as a Man that was gathering
               up his Strength after a Fit of Sickness: For it is hardly to be imagin'd, how low I
               was, and to what Weakness I was reduc'd. The Application which I made Use of was
               perfectly new, and perhaps what had never cur'd an Ague before, neither can I
               recommend it to any one to practise, by this Experiment; and tho' it did carry off the Fit, yet it rather contributed to weakening me; for I had frequent Convulsions in my Nerves and
               Limbs for some Time.</p>
            <p>I learn'd from it also this in particular, that being abroad
               in the rainy Season was the most pernicious thing to my
               Health that could be, especially in those Rains which came attended with Storms and
               Hurricanes of Wind; for as the Rain which came in the dry Season was always most
               accompany'd with such Storms, so I found that Rain was much more dangerous than the
               Rain which fell in <hi rend="italic">September</hi> and <hi rend="italic">October.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>I had been now in this unhappy Island above 10 Months, all Possibility of Deliverance
               from this Condition, seem'd to be entirely taken from me; and I firmly believed, that
               no humane Shape had ever set Foot upon that Place: Having now secur'd <pb n="115"
                  /> my Habitation, as I thought, fully to my Mind, I had a
               great Desire to make a more perfect Discovery of the Island,
               and to see what other Productions I might find, which I yet
               knew nothing of.</p>
            <p>It was the 15th of <hi rend="italic">July</hi> that I began to take a more particular Survey of the
               Island it self: I went up the Creek first, where, as I hinted, I brought my Rafts on
               Shore; I found after I came about two Miles up, that the Tide did not flow any
               higher, and that it was no more than a little Brook of running Water, and very fresh
               and good; but this being the dry Season, there was hardly any Water in some Parrs of
               it, at least, not enough to run in any Stream, so as it could be perceiv'd.</p>
            <p>On the Bank of this Brook I found many pleasant
                  <hi rend="italic">Savana's,</hi> or Meadows; plain, smooth, and cover'd with Grass; and on the
               rising Parts of them next to the higher Grounds, where the Water, as it might be supposed, never overflow'd, I found a great deal of Tobacco,
               green, and growing to a great and very strong Stalk; there were divers other Plants which I had no Notion of, or Understanding about, and might perhaps have Vertues of their own, which I could not find out.</p>
            <p>I searched for the <ref target="cassava_" corresp="cassava">Cassava</ref> Root <note
                  resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="cassava" target="cassava_" type="gloss">A
                  woody shrub native to South America</note>, which the <hi rend="italic">Indians</hi> in all that Climate make their Bread of, but I
               could find none. I saw large Plants of Alloes, but did not then understand them. I
               saw several Sugar Canes, but wild, and for want of Cultivation, imperfect. I contented my self with these Discoveries for this
               Time, and came back musing with my self what Course I might take to know the Vertue
               and Goodness of any of the Fruits or Plants which I should discover; but could bring
               it to no Conclusion; for in short, I had made so little
                  Observation while I was in the <hi rend="italic">Brasils,</hi> that I
               knew little <pb n="116" /> of the Plants in the Field, at
               least very little that might serve me to any Purpose now in my Distress.</p>
            <p>The next Day, the 16th, I went up the same Way again, and after going something
               farther than I had gone the Day before, I found the Brook, and the <hi rend="italic">Savana's</hi>
               began to cease, and the Country became more woody than
               before; in this Part I found different Fruits, and particularly I found Mellons upon
               the Ground in great Abundance, and Grapes upon the Trees; the Vines had spread indeed
               over the Trees, and the Clusters of Grapes were just now in their Prime, very ripe
               and rich: This was a surprising Discovery, and I was exceeding glad of them; but I
               was warn'd by my Experience to eat sparingly of them, remembring, that when I was
               ashore in <hi rend="italic">Barbary,</hi> the eating of Grapes kill'd several of our
                  <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Men who were Slaves there, by <ref target="scurvy_"
                  corresp="scurvy">throwing them into Fluxes and Feavers</ref><note

                  >There is no scientific basis for this supposition. More likely, the symptoms
                  Crusoe describes were a result of scurvy, a condition caused by vitamin C
                  deficiency and common among sailors.</note>: But I found an excellent Use for
               these Grapes, and that was to cure or dry them in the Sun, and keep them as dry'd
               Grapes or Raisins are kept, which I thought would be, as indeed they were, as
               wholesom as agreeable to eat, when no Grapes might be to be had.</p>
            <p>I spent all that Evening there, and went not back to my Habitation, which by the Way
               was the first Night, as I might say, I had lain from Home. In the Night I took my
               first Contrivance, and got up into a Tree, where I slept well, and the next Morning
               proceeded upon my Discovery, travelling near four Miles, as
               I might judge by the Length of the Valley, keeping still due North, with a Ridge of
               Hills on the South and North-side of me.</p>
            <p>At the End of this March I came to an Opening, where the
               Country seem'd to descend to the <pb n="117" /> West, and a
               litrle Spring of fresh Water which issued out of the Side of
               the Hill by me, run the other Way, that is due East; and the Country appear'd so fresh, so green, so flourishing, every thing being
               in a constant Verdure, or Flourish of <hi rend="italic">Spring,</hi> that it looked like a planted
               Garden.</p>
            <p>I descended a little on the Side of that delicious Vale, surveying it with a secret
               Kind of Pleasure, (tho' mixt with my other afflicting Thoughts) to think that this
               was all my own, that I was King and Lord of all this Country indefeasibly, and had a
               Right of Possession; and if I could convey it, I might have it in Inheritance, as
               compleatly as any Lord of a Mannor in <hi rend="italic">England.</hi> I saw here Abundance of Cocoa
               Trees, Orange, and Lemmon, and Citron Trees; but all wild,
               and very few bearing any Fruit, at least not then: However,
               the green Limes that I gathered, were not only pleasant to eat, but very wholesome;
               and I mix'd their Juice afterwards with Water, which made it very wholesome, and very
               cool, and refreshing.</p>
            <p>I found now I had Business enough to gather and carry Home; and I resolv'd to lay up
               a Store, as well of Grapes, as Limes and Lemons, to furnish my self for the wet
               Season, which I knew was approaching.</p>
            <p>In Order to this, I gather'd a great Heap of Grapes in one Place, and a lesser Heap
               in another Place, and a great Parcel of Limes and Lemons in another Place; and taking
               a few of each with me, I travell'd homeward, and resolv'd to come again, and bring a
               Bag or Sack, or what I could make to carry the rest Home.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, having spent three Days in this Journey, I came Home; so I must now call
               my Tent and my Cave: But, before I got thither, the <pb n="118"
                  /> Grapes were spoil'd, the Richness of the Fruits, and
               the Weight of the Juice having broken them, and bruis'd them, they were good for
               little or nothing; as to the Limes, they were good, but I
               could bring but a few.</p>
            <p>The next Day, being the 19th, I went back, having made me two small Bags to bring
               Home my Harvest: But I was surpriz'd, when coming to my Heap of Grapes, which were so
               rich and fine when I gather'd them, I found them all spread about, trod to Pieces,
               and dragg'd about, some here, some there, and Abundance eaten and devour'd: By this I
               concluded, there were some wild Creatures thereabouts, which had done this; but what
               they were, I knew not.</p>
            <p>However, as I found there there was no laying them up on Heaps, and no carrying them
               away in a Sack, but that one Way they would be destroy'd, and the other Way they
               would be crush'd with their own Weight. I took another Course; for I gather'd a large
               Quantity of the Grapes, and hung them up upon the out Branches of the Trees, that
               they might cure and dry in the Sun; and as for the Limes and Lemons, I carry'd as
               many back as I could well stand under.</p>
            <p>When I came Home from this Journey, I contemplated with
               great Pleasure the Fruitfulness of that Valley, and the Pleasantness of the
               Scituation, the Security from Storms on that Side the Water, and the Wood, and
               concluded, that I had pitch'd upon a Place to fix my Abode, which was by far the
               worst Part of the Country. Upon the Whole I began to consider of removing my
               Habitation; and to look out for a Place equally safe, as where I now was scituate, if
               possible, in that pleasant fruitful Part of the Island.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" />This Thought run long in my Head, and I was
               exceeding fond of it for some Time, the Pleasantness of the
               Place tempting me; but when I came to a nearer View of it, and to consider that I was
               now by the Sea-Side, where it was at least possible that something might happen to my
               Advantage, and by the same ill Fate that brought me hither, might bring some other
               unhappy Wretches to the same Place; and tho' it was scarce probable that any such
               Thing should ever happen, yet to enclose my self among the Hills and Woods, in the
               Center of the Island, was to anticipate my Bondage, and to rend such an Affair not
               only Improbable, but Impossible; and that therefore I ought not by any Means to
               remove.</p>
            <p>However, I was so Enamour'd of this Place, that I spent much of my Time there, for
               the whole remaining Part of the Month of <hi rend="italic">July</hi>; and tho' upon second Thoughts
               I resolv'd as above, not to remove, yet I built me a little kind of a Bower, and
               surrounded it at a Distance with a strong Fence, being a double Hedge, as high as I
               could reach, well stak'd, and fill'd between with <hi rend="italic">Brushwood</hi>; and here I lay very secure, sometimes two or three Nights together,
               always going over it with a Ladder, as before; so that I fancy'd now I had my
               Country-House, and my Sea-Coast-House: And this Work took me up to the Beginning of <hi rend="italic">August.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had but newly finish'd my Fence, and began to enjoy my
               Labour, but the Rains came on, and made me stick close to my first Habitation; for
               tho' I had made me a Tent like the other, with a Piece of a Sail, and spread it very
               well; yet I had not the Shelter of a Hill to keep me from Storms, nor a Cave behind
               me to retreat into, when the Rains were extraordinary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" />About the Beginning of <hi rend="italic">August, as I
                  said,</hi> I had finish'd my Bower, and began to enjoy my self. The third of
                  <hi rend="italic">August,</hi> I found the Grapes I had hung up were perfectly dry'd, and
               indeed, were excellent good Raisins of the Sun; so I began to take them down from the
               Trees, and it was very happy that I did so; for the Rains which follow'd would have
               spoil'd them, and I had lost the best Part of my Winter Food; for I had above two
               hundred large Bunches of them. No sooner had I taken them all down, and carry'd most
               of them Home to my Cave, but it began to rain, and from hence, which was the
               fourteenth of <hi rend="italic">August,</hi> it rain'd more or less, every Day, till the Middle of
                  <hi rend="italic">October</hi>; and sometimes so violently, that I could not stir out of my Cave
               for several Days.</p>
            <p>In this Season I was much surpriz'd with the Increase of my Family; I had been
               concern'd for the Loss of one of my Cats, who run away from me, or as I thought had
               been dead, and I heard no more Tale or Tidings of her, till to my Astonishment she came Home about the End of <hi rend="italic">August,</hi> with
               three <hi rend="italic">Kittens</hi>; this was the more strange to me, because tho' I had kill'd a
               wild Cat, as I call'd it, with my Gun; yet I thought it was a quite differing Kind
               from our <hi rend="italic">European</hi> Cats; yet the young Cats were the same Kind of House breed
               like the old one; and both my Cats being Females, I thought it very strange: But from
               these three Cats, I afterwards came to be so pester'd with Cats, that I was forc'd to
               kill them like Vermine, or wild Beasts, and to drive them from my House as much as
               possible.</p>
            <p>From the fourteenth of <hi rend="italic">August</hi> to the twenty sixth, incessant Rain, so that I
               could not stir, and was now very careful not to be much wet. In this Confinement I
               began to be straitned for Food, but <pb n="121" /> venturing
               out twice, I one Day kill'd a Goat, and the last Day, which was the twenty sixth,
               found a very large Tortoise, which was a Treat to me, and my Food was regulated thus;
               I eat a Bunch of Raisins for my Breakfast, a Piece of the Goat's Flesh, or of the
               Turtle for my Dinner broil'd; for to my great Misfortune, I had no Vessel to boil or
               stew any Thing; and two or three of the Turtle's Eggs for my
               Supper.</p>
            <p>During this Confinement in my Cover, by the Rain, I work'd daily two or three Hours
               at enlarging my Cave, and by Degrees work'd it on towards one Side, till I came to
               the Out-Side of the Hill, and made a Door or Way out, which came beyond my Fence or
               Wall, and so I came in and out this Way; but I was not perfectly easy at lying so
               open; for as I had manag'd my self before, I was in a perfect Enclosure, whereas now I thought I lay expos'd, and open for
               any Thing to come in upon me; and yet I could not perceive that there was any living
               Thing to fear, the biggest Creature that I had yet seen upon the Island being a
               Goat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">September</hi> the thirtieth, I was now come to the unhappy Anniversary of my
               Landing. I <ref target="castup_" corresp="castup">cast up</ref><note

               Refreshment for twelve Hours, even till the going down of the Sun, I then eat a
               Bisket Cake, and a Bunch of Grapes, and went to Bed, finishing the Day as I began
               it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" />I had all this Time observ'd no Sabbath-Day;
               for as at first I had no Sense of Religion upon my Mind, I had after some Time
               omitted to distinguish the Weeks, by making a longer Notch
               than ordinary for the Sabbath-Day, and so did not really know what any of the Days
               were; but now having cast up the Days, as above, I found I had been there a Year; so
               I divided it into Weeks, and set apart every seventh Day for a Sabbath; though I
               found at the End of my Account I had lost a Day or two in my Reckoning.</p>
            <p>A little after this my Ink began to fail me, and so I contented my self to use it
               more sparingly, and to write down only the most remarkable Events of my Life, without
               continuing a daily <hi rend="italic">Memorandum</hi> of other Things.</p>
            <p>The rainy Season, and the dry Season, began now to appear regular to me, and I
               learn'd to divide them so, as to provide for them accordingly. But I bought all my
               Experience before I had it; and this I am going to relate, was one of the most discouraging Experiments that I made at all: I have mention'd
               that I had sav'd the few Ears of Barley and Rice, which I had so surprizingly found
               spring up, as I thought, of themselves, and believe there was about thirty Stalks of
               Rice, and about twenty of Barley; and now I thought it a proper Time to sow it after
               the Rains, the Sun being in its <hi rend="italic">Southern</hi> Position going from me.</p>
            <p>Accordingly I dug up a Piece of Ground as well as I could with my wooden Spade, and
               dividing it into two Parts, I sow'd my Grain; but as I was sowing, it casually
               occur'd to my Thoughts, That I would not sow it all at first, because I did not know
               when was the proper Time for it; so I sow'd about two Thirds of the Seed, leaving
               about a Handful of each.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" />It was a great Comfort to me afterwards, that
               I did so, for not one Grain of that I sow'd this Time came to any Thing; for the dry
               Months following, the Earth having had no Rain after the Seed was sown, it had no
               Moisture to assist its Growth, and never came up at all, till the wet Season had come
               again, and then it grew as if it had been but newly sown.</p>
            <p>Finding my first Seed did not grow, which I easily imagin'd was by the Drought, I
               sought for a moister Peice of Ground to make another Trial in, and I dug up a Piece
               of Ground near my new Bower, and sow'd the rest of my Seed in <hi rend="italic">February,</hi> a
               little before the <ref target="vernalequinox_" corresp="vernalequinox">Vernal

                  <hi rend="italic">March</hi> and <hi rend="italic">April</hi> to water it, sprung up
               very pleasantly, and yielded a very good Crop; but having Part of the Seed left only,
               and not daring to sow all that I had, I had but a small Quantity at last, my whole
               Crop not amounting to above half a <ref target="peck_" corresp="peck">Peck</ref><note

            <p>But by this Experiment I was made Master of my Business, and knew exactly when the
               proper Season was to sow; and that I might expect two Seed Times, and two Harvests
               every Year.</p>
            <p>While this Corn was growing, I made a little Discovery which was of use to me
               afterwards: As soon as the Rains were over, and the Weather began to settle, which was about the Month of <hi rend="italic">November,</hi> I made a Visit up the Country to my Bower,
               where though I had not been some Months, yet I found all Things just as I left them.
               The Circle or double Hedge that I had made, was not only firm and entire; but the Stakes which I had cut out of
               some Trees that grew thereabouts, were all shot out and grown with long Branches, as
               much as a Willow-Tree usually shoots the first Year after lopping its Head. I could
               not tell what Tree to <pb n="124" /> call it, that these
               Stakes were cut from. I was surpriz'd, and yet very well pleas'd, to see the young
               Trees grow; and I prun'd them, and led them up to grow as much alike as I could; and
               it is scarce credible how beautiful a Figure they grew into in three Years; so that
               though the Hedge made a Circle of about twenty five Yards in Diameter, yet the Trees, for such I might now call them, soon
               cover'd it; and it was a compleat Shade, sufficient to lodge under all the dry
               Season.</p>
            <p>This made me resolve to cut some more Stakes, and make me a Hedge like this in a
               Semicircle round my Wall; I mean that of my first Dwelling, which I did; and placing
               the Trees or Stakes in a double Row, at about eight Yards distance from my first
               Fence, they grew presently, and were at first a fine Cover to my Habitation, and
               afterward serv'd for a Defence also, as I shall observe <ref target="order_"

            <p>The Rainy Season sometimes held longer or shorter, as the Winds happen'd to blow; but
               this was the general Observation I made: After I had found by Experience, the ill
               Consequence of being abroad in the Rain. I took Care to furnish my self with
               Provisions before hand, that I might not be oblig'd to go out; and I sat within Doors
               as much as possible during the wet Months.</p>
            <p>This Time I found much Employment, (and very suitable also to the Time) for I found
               great Occasion of many Things which I had no way to furnish my self with, but by hard
               Labour and constant Application; particularly, I try'd many
               Ways to make my self a Basket, but all the Twigs I could get for the Purpose prov'd
               so brittle, that they would do nothing. It prov'd of excellent Advantage to me now, That when I was a Boy, I used to take
               great Delight in standing at a <hi rend="italic">Basket-makers,</hi> in the Town where my Father
               liv'd, to see them make their <hi rend="italic">Wicker-ware</hi>; and being as Boys usually are,
               very officious to help, and a great Observer of the Manner how they work'd those
               Things, and sometimes lending a Hand, I had by this Means full Knowledge of the
               Methods of it, that I wanted nothing but the Materials; when it came into my Mind,
               That the Twigs of that Tree from whence I cut my Stakes that grew, <pb n="126"
                  /> might possibly be as tough as the <hi rend="italic">Sallows,</hi>
               and <hi rend="italic">Willows,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Osiers</hi> in <hi rend="italic">England,</hi> and I resolv'd to
               try.</p>
            <p>Accordingly the next Day, I went to my Country-House, as I
               call'd it, and cutting some of the smaller Twigs, I found them to my Purpose as much
               as I could desire; whereupon I came the next Time prepar'd with a Hatchet to cut down
               a Quantity, which I soon found, for there was great Plenty of them; these I set up to
               dry within my Circle or Hedge, and when they were fit for Use, I carry'd them to my
               Cave, and here during the next Season, I employ'd my self in making, <hi rend="italic">as well as I
                  could,</hi> a great many Baskets, both to carry Earth, or to carry or lay up any
               Thing as I had occasion; and tho' I did not finish them very handsomly, yet I made them sufficiently serviceable for my
               Purpose; and thus afterwards I took Care never to be without
               them; and as my <hi rend="italic">Wicker-ware</hi> decay'd, I made more, especially, I made strong
               deep Baskets to place my Corn in, instead of Sacks, when I should come to have any
               Quantity of it.</p>
            <p>Having master'd this Difficulty, and employ'd a World of Time about it, I bestirr'd
               my self to see if possible how to supply two Wants: I had no Vessels to hold any
               Thing that was Liquid, except two Runlets which were almost
               full of Rum, and some Glass-Bottles, some of the common Size, and others which were

            <p>I mention'd before, That I had a great Mind to see the whole Island, and that I had
               travell'd up the Brook, and so on to where I built my Bower, and where I had an
               Opening quite to the Sea on the other Side of the Island; I now resolv'd to travel
               quite Cross to the Sea-Shore on that Side; so taking my Gun, a Hatchet, and my Dog,
               and a larger Quantity of Powder and Shot than usual, with two Bisket Cakes, and a
               great Bunch of Raisins in my Pouch for my Store, I began my Journey; when I had
               pass'd the Vale where my Bower stood as above, I came within View of the Sea, to the
                  <hi rend="italic">West,</hi> and it being a very clear Day, I fairly descry'd Land, whether an
               Island or a Continent, I could not tell; but it lay very high, extending from the

               landed, I had been in a worse Condition than I was now; and therefore I acquiesced in the Dispositions of Providence, which I began now to own, and to believe, order'd every Thing for the
               best; I say, I quieted my Mind with this, and left afflicting my self with Fruitless
               Wishes of being there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" />Besides, after some Pause upon this Affair, I
               consider'd, that if this Land was the <hi rend="italic">Spanish</hi> Coast, I should certainly, one
               Time or other, see some Vessel pass or re-pass one Way or other; but if not, then it
               was the <hi rend="italic">Savage</hi> Coast between the <hi rend="italic">Spanish</hi> Country and
                  <hi rend="italic">Brasils,</hi> which are indeed the worst of <hi rend="italic">Savages</hi>; for they are

                  resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="cannibal" target="cannibal_" type="gloss"
                  >The portrayal of aboriginal cultures as savage or alien has an ample precedent:
                  Herodotus describes a mythical race of man-eating "androphagi," and Shakespeare's
                  Othello talks of encountering "The Cannibals that each other eat, / The
                  Anthropophagi and men whose heads / Do grow beneath their shoulders"
                  (I.iii.143-145)</note>, and fail not to murther and devour all the humane Bodies
               that fall into their Hands.</p>
            <p>With these Considerations I walk'd very leisurely forward, I
               found that Side of the Island where I now was, much pleasanter than mine, the open or
                  <hi rend="italic">Savanna</hi> Fields sweet, adorn'd with Flowers and Grass, and full of very
               fine Woods. I saw Abundance of Parrots, and fain I would
               have caught one, if possible to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to speak to
               me. I did, after some Pains taking, catch a young Parrot, for I knock'd it down with
               a Stick, and having recover'd it, I brought it home; but it was some Years before I
               could make him speak: However, at last I taught him to call me by my Name very
               familiarly: But the Accident that follow'd, tho' it be a
               Trifle, will be very diverting in its Place.</p>
            <p>I was exceedingly diverted with this Journey: I found in the low Grounds Hares, as I
               thought them to be, and Foxes, but they differ'd greatly from all the other Kinds I
               had met with; nor could I satisfy my self to eat them, tho' I kill'd several: But I
               had no Need to be ventrous; for I had no Want of Food, and of that which was very
               good too; especially these three Sorts, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> Goats, Pidgeons, and Turtle or Tortoise; which, added to my Grapes,
                  <ref target="leadenhall_" corresp="leadenhall">Leaden-hall</ref> Market <note

                  enough, yet I had great Cause for Thankfulness, <pb
                  n="129" /> that I was not driven to any Extremities for
               Food; but rather Plenty, even to Dainties.</p>
            <p>I never travell'd in this Journey above two Miles outright in a Day, or thereabouts;
               but I took so many Turns and Returns, to see what Discoveries I could make, that I
               came weary enough to the Place where I resolv'd to sit down for all Night; and then I
               either repos'd my self in a Tree, or surrounded my self with
               a Row of Stakes set upright in the Ground, either from one Tree to another, or so as
               no wild Creature could come at me, without waking me.</p>
            <p>As soon as I came to the Sea Shore, I was surpriz'd to see
               that I had taken up my Lot on the worst Side of the Island; for here indeed the Shore
               was cover'd with innumerable Turtles, whereas on the other Side I had found but three
               in a Year and half. Here was also an infinite Number of Fowls, of many Kinds, some
               which I had seen, and some which I had not seen of before, and many of them very good
               Meat; but such as I knew not the Names of, except those call'd <ref target="penguin_"

            <p>I could have shot as many as I pleas'd, but was very sparing of my Powder and Shot;
               and therefore had more Mind to kill a she Goat, if I could, which I could better feed
               on; and though there were many Goats here more than on my Side the Island, yet it was
               with much more Difficulty that I could come near them, the Country being flat and
               even, and they saw me much sooner than when I was on the Hill.</p>
            <p>I confess this Side of the Country was much pleasanter than mine, but yet I had not
               the least Inclination to remove; for as I was fix'd in my Habitation, it became natural to me, and I seem'd all the while I was here, to be as
               it were upon a Journey, and from Home: However, I travell'd
               along <pb n="130" /> the Shore of the Sea, towards the
                  <hi rend="italic">East,</hi> I suppose about twelve Miles; and then setting up a great Pole upon
               the Shore for a Mark, I concluded I would go Home again; and that the next Journey I
               took should be on the other Side of the Island, <hi rend="italic">East</hi> from my Dwelling, and
               so round till I came to my Post again: Of which in its Place.</p>
            <p>I took another Way to come back than that I went, thinking I could easily keep all
               the Island so much in my View, that I could not miss finding my first Dwelling by
               viewing the Country; but I found my self mistaken; for being come about two or three
               Miles, I found my self descended into a very large Valley; but so surrounded with
               Hills, and those Hills cover'd with Wood, that I could not see which was my Way by
               any Direction but that of the Sun, nor even then, unless I knew very well the
               Position of the Sun at that Time of the Day.</p>
            <p>It happen'd to my farther Misfortune, That the Weather prov'd hazey for three or four
               Days, while I was in this Valley; and not being able to see the Sun, I wander'd about
               very uncomfortably, and at last was oblig'd to find out the Sea Side, look for my
               Post, and come back the same Way I went; and then by easy Journies I turn'd Homeward,
               the Weather being exceeding hot, and my Gun, Ammunition,
               Hatchet, and other Things very heavy.</p>
            <p>In this Journey my Dog surpriz'd a young Kid, and seiz'd upon it, and I running in to
               take hold of it, caught it, and sav'd it alive from the Dog: I had a great Mind to
               bring it Home if I could; for I had often been musing, Whether it might not be
               possible to get a Kid or two, and so raise a Breed of tame Goats, which might supply
               me when my Powder and Shot should be all spent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" />I made a Collar to this little Creature, and
               with a String which I made of some Rope-Yarn, which I always carry'd about me, I led
               him along, tho' with some Difficulty, till I came to my Bower, and there I enclos'd
               him, and left him; for I was very impatient to be at Home, from whence I had been
               absent above a Month.</p>
            <p>I cannot express what a Satisfaction it was to me, to come into my old Hutch, and lye
               down in my Hamock-Bed: This little wandring Journey, without settled Place of Abode,
               had been so unpleasant to me, that my own House, as I call'd
               it to my self, was a perfect Settlement to me, compar'd to
               that; and it rendred every Thing about me so comfortable, that I resolv'd I would
               never go a great Way from it again, while it should be my Lot to stay on the
               Island.</p>
            <p>I repos'd my self here a Week, to rest and regale my self after my long Journey;
               during which, most of the Time was taken up in the weighty Affair of making a Cage
               for my <ref target="poll_" corresp="poll">Poll</ref><note

               the poor Kid, which I had penn'd in within my little Circle, and resolv'd to go and
               fetch it Home, or give it some Food; accordingly I went, and found it where I left
               it; for indeed it could not get out, but almost starv'd for want of Food: I went and

               that it became from that Time one of my Domesticks also, and would never leave me
               afterwards.</p>

                  depending on the year</note> was now come, and I kept the 30th of <hi rend="italic">Sept.</hi>
               in the same solemn Manner as before, being the Anniversary
               of my Landing on the Island, having now been there two Years, and no more Prospect of
               being deliver'd, than the first Day I came there. I spent the whole Day in humble and
               thankful Acknowledgments of the many wonderful Mercies which my Solitary Condition
               was attended with, and without which it might have been infinitely more miserable. I
               gave humble and hearty Thanks that God had been pleas'd to discover to me, even that
               it was possible I might be more happy in this Solitary Condition, than I should have
               been in a Liberty of Society, and in all the Pleasures of the World. That he could
               fully make up to me, the Deficiencies of my Solitary State, and the want of Humane
                  Society by his Presence, and the Communications of his
               Grace to my Soul, supporting, comforting, and encouraging me to depend upon his
               Providence here, and hope for his Eternal Presence hereafter.</p>
            <p>It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more happy this Life I now led was,
               with all its miserable Circumstances, than the wicked, cursed, abominable Life I led
               all the past Part of my Days; and now I chang'd both my Sorrows and my Joys; my very
               Desires alter'd, my Affections chang'd their Gusts, and my
               Delights were perfectly new, from what they were at my first Coming, or indeed for the two Years past.</p>
            <p>Before, as I walk'd about, either on my Hunting, or for
               viewing the Country; the Anguish of my Soul at my Condition, would break out upon me
               on a sudden, and my very Heart would die within me, to think of the Woods, the
               Mountains, the Desarts I was in; and how I was a Prisoner lock'd up with the Eternal
               Bars and Bolts of the <pb n="133" /> Ocean, in an
               uninhabited Wilderness, without Redemption: In the midst of
               the greatest Composures of my Mind, this would break out upon me like a Storm, and
               make me wring my Hands, and weep like a Child: Sometimes it would take me in the
               middle of my Work, and I would immediately sit down and sigh, and look upon the
               Ground for an Hour or two together; and this was still worse to me; for if I could
               burst out into Tears, or vent my self by Words, it would go off, and the Grief having
               exhausted it self would abate.</p>
            <p>But now I began to exercise my self with new Thoughts; I daily read the Word of God,
               and apply'd all the Comforts of it to my present State: One
               Morning being very sad, I open'd the Bible upon these Words, <ref target="hebrews_"
                  corresp="hebrews">I will never, never leave thee, nor forsake thee</ref><note
                  resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="hebrews" target="hebrews_" type="gloss"
                  >Hebrews 13:5</note>; immediately it occurr'd, That these Words were to me, Why
               else should they be directed in such a Manner, just at the
               Moment when I was mourning over my Condition, as one forsaken of God and Man? Well
               then, said I, if God does not forsake me, of what ill Consequence can it be, or what
               matters it, though the World should all forsake me, seeing on the other Hand, if I
               had all the World, and should lose the Favour and Blessing
               of God, there wou'd be no Comparison in the Loss.</p>
            <p>From this Moment I began to conclude in my Mind, That it was possible for me to be
               more happy in this forsaken Solitary Condition, than it was probable I should ever
               have been in any other Particular State in the World; and with this Thought I was
               going to give Thanks to God for bringing me to this Place.</p>
            <p>I know not what it was, but something shock'd my Mind at that Thought, and I durst
               not speak the Words: How canst thou be such a Hypocrite, <pb n="134"
                  /> (said I, even audibly) to pretend to be thankful for a
               Condition, which however thou may'st endeavour to be
               contented with, thou would'st rather pray heartily to be deliver'd from; so I stopp'd
               there: But though I could not say, I thank'd God for being there; yet I sincerely
               gave Thanks to God for opening my Eyes, by whatever afflicting Providences, to see
               the former Condition of my Life, and to mourn for my Wickedness, and repent. I never open'd the Bible, or shut it, but my very Soul
               within me, bless'd God for directing my Friend in <hi rend="italic">England,</hi> without any Order
               of mine, to pack it up among my Goods; and for assisting me afterwards to save it out
               of the Wreck of the Ship.</p>
            <p>Thus, and in this Disposition of Mind, I began my third Year; and tho' I have not
               given the Reader the Trouble of so particular Account of my
               Works this Year as the first; yet in General it may be observ'd, That I was very
               seldom idle; but having regularly divided my Time, according to the several daily
               Employments that were before me, such as, <hi rend="italic">First,</hi> My Duty to God, and the
                  Reading the Scriptures, which I constantly set apart some
               Time for thrice every Day. <hi rend="italic">Secondly,</hi> The going Abroad with my Gun for Food,
               which generally took me up three Hours in every Morning, when it did not Rain.
                  <hi rend="italic">Thirdly,</hi> The ordering, curing, preserving, and cooking what I had kill'd
               or catch'd for my Supply; these took up great Part of the Day; also it is to be
               considered that the middle of the Day when the Sun was in the <hi rend="italic">Zenith,</hi> the
               Violence of the Heat was too great to stir out; so that about four Hours in the Evening was all the Time I could be suppos'd to work in;
               with this Exception, That sometimes I chang'd my Hours of
               Hunting and Working, and went to work in the <pb n="135" />
               Morning, and Abroad with my Gun in the Afternoon.</p>
            <p>To this short Time allow'd for Labour, I desire may be added the exceeding
               Laboriousness of my Work; the many Hours which for want of Tools, want of Help, and
               want of Skill; every Thing I did, took up out of my Time: For Example, I was full two
               and forty Days making me a Board for a long Shelf, which I wanted in my Cave; whereas
               two Sawyers with their Tools, and a Saw-Pit, would have cut six of them out of the
               same Tree in half a Day.</p>
            <p>My Case was this, It was to be a large Tree, which was to be cut down, because my
               Board was to be a broad one. This Tree I was three Days a cutting down, and two more
               cutting off the Bows, and reducing it to a Log, or Piece of Timber. With inexpressible hacking and hewing I reduc'd both
               the Sides of it into Chips, till it begun to be light enough
               to move; than I turn'd it, and made one Side of it smooth, and flat, as a Board from
               End to End; then turning that Side downward, cut the other Side, till I brought the
               Plank to be about three Inches thick, and smooth on both Sides. Any one may judge the
               Labour of my Hands in such a Piece of Work; but Labour and Patience carry'd me
               through that and many other Things: I only observe this in Particular, to shew, The
               Reason why so much of my Time went away with so little Work, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> That what
               might be a little to be done with Help and Tools, was a vast Labour, and requir'd a
               prodigious Time to do alone, and by hand.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding this, with Patience and Labour I went through many Things; and
               indeed every Thing that my Circumstances made necessary to
               me to do, as will appear by what follows.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" />I was now, in the Months of <hi rend="italic">November</hi>
               and <hi rend="italic">December,</hi> expecting my Crop of Barley and Rice.
               The Ground I had manur'd or dug up for them was not great; for as I observ'd, my Seed
               of each was not above the Quantity of half a Peck; for I had lost one whole Crop by
               sowing in the dry Season; but now my Crop promis'd very well, when on a sudden I
               found I was in Danger of losing it all again by Enemies of
               several Sorts, which it was scarce possible to keep from it; as First, The Goats, and
               wild Creatures which I call'd Hares, who tasting the Sweetness of the Blade, lay in
               it Night and Day, as soon as it came up, and eat it so close, that it could get no
               Time to shoot up into Stalk.</p>
            <p>This I saw no Remedy for, but by making an Enclosure about it with a Hedge, which I
               did with a great deal of Toil; and the more, because it requir'd Speed. However, as
               my Arable Land was but small, suited to my Crop, I got it totally well fenc'd, in
               about three Weeks Time; and shooting some of the Creatures in the Day Time, I set my
               Dog to guard it in the Night, tying him up to a Stake at the Gate, where he would
               stand and bark all Night long; so in a little Time the Enemies forsook the Place, and
               the Corn grew very strong, and well, and began to ripen
               apace.</p>
            <p>But as the Beasts ruined me before, while my Corn was in the Blade; so the Birds were
               as likely to ruin me now, when it was in the Ear; for going
               along by the Place to see how it throve, I saw my little Crop surrounded with Fowls
               of I know not how many sorts, who stood as it were watching
               till I should be gone: I immediately let fly among them (for
               I always had my Gun with me) I had no sooner shot but there rose up a a little <pb
                  n="137" /> Cloud of Fowls, which I had not seen at all,
               from among the Corn it self.</p>
            <p>This touch'd me sensibly, for I foresaw, that in a few Days they would devour all my
               Hopes, that I should be starv'd, and never be able to raise a Crop at all, and what
               to do I could not tell: However I resolv'd not to loose my Corn, if possible, tho' I
               should watch it Night and Day. In the first Place, I went among it to see what Damage
               was already done, and found they had spoil'd a good deal of it, but that as it was
               yet too Green for them, the Loss was not so great, but that the Remainder was like to be a good Crop if it could be sav'd.</p>
            <p>I staid by it to load my Gun, and then coming away I could easily see the Thieves
               sitting upon all the Trees about me, as if they only waited till I was gone away, and
               the Event proved it to be so; for as I walk'd off as if I was gone, I was no sooner
               out of their sight, but they dropt down one by one into the Corn again. I was so
               provok'd that I could not have Patience to stay till more came on, knowing that every
               Grain that they eat now, was, <hi rend="italic">as it might be said,</hi> a <ref target="peckloaf_"

               and kill'd three of them. This was what I wish'd for; so I took them up, and serv'd
               them <ref target="served_" corresp="served">as we serve notorious Thieves in

               impossible to imagine almost, that this should have such an Effect, as it had; for
               the Fowls wou'd not only not come at the Corn, but in short they forsook all that
               Part of the Island, and I could never see a Bird near the Place as long as my
               Scare-Crows hung there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="138" />This I was very glad of, you may be sure, and
                  about the latter end of <hi rend="italic">December,</hi> which was our
                  second Harvest of the Year, I reap'd my Crop.</p>
            <p>I was sadly put to it for a Scythe or a Sicle to cut it down, and all I could do was
               to make one as well as I could out of one of the Broad Swords or Cutlasses, which I
               sav'd among the Arms out of the Ship. However, as my first Crop was but small I had
               no great Difficulty to cut it down; in short, I reap'd it my Way, for I cut nothing
               off but the Ears, and carry'd it away in a great Basket which I had made, and so
               rubb'd it out with my Hands; and at the End of all my Harvesting, I found that out of
               my half Peck of Seed, I had near two Bushels of Rice, and above two Bushels and half
               of Barley, <hi rend="italic">that is to say,</hi> by my Guess, for I had
               no Measure at that time.</p>
            <p>However, this was a great Encouragement to me, and I foresaw that in time, it wou'd
               please God to supply me with Bread: And yet here I was perplex'd again, for I neither
               knew how to grind or make Meal of my Corn, or indeed how to clean it and part it; nor
               if made into Meal, how to make Bread of it, and if how to make it, yet I knew not how
               to bake it; these things being added to my Desire of having a good Quantity for
               Store, and to secure a constant Supply, I resolv'd not to taste any of this Crop but
               to preserve it all for Seed against the next Season, and in the mean time to employ
               all my Study and Hours of Working to accomplish this great
               Work of Providing my self with Corn and Bread.</p>
            <p>It might be truly said, that now I work'd for my Bread; 'tis a little wonderful, and
               what I believe few People have thought much upon,
                  (<hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>) the strange multitude of little Things necessary in the <pb
                  n="139" /> Providing, Producing, Curing, Dressing, Making
               and Finishing this one Article of Bread.</p>
            <p>I that was reduced to a meer State of Nature, found this to my daily Discouragement,
               and was made more and more sensible of it every Hour, even after I had got the first
               Handful of Seed-Corn, which, as I have said, came up unexpectedly, and indeed to a surprize.</p>
            <p>First, I had no Plow to turn up the Earth, no Spade or Shovel to dig it. Well, this I
               conquer'd, by making a wooden Spade, as I observ'd before; but this did my Work in
               but a wooden manner, and tho' it cost me a great many Days to make it, yet for want
               of Iron it not only wore out the sooner, but made my Work the harder, and made it be
               perform'd much worse.</p>
            <p>However this I bore with, and was content to work it out with Patience, and bear with
               the badness of the Performance. When the Corn was sow'd, I
               had no <ref target="harrow_" corresp="harrow">Harrow</ref><note

               these things I did without, as shall be observ'd; and yet the Corn was an inestimable
               Comfort and Advantage to me too. All this, as I said, made
               every thing laborious and tedious to me, but that there was no help for; neither was
               my time so much Loss to me, because as I had divided it, a certain Part of it was
               every Day appointed to <pb n="140" /> these Works; and as I
               resolv'd to use none of the Corn for Bread till I had a greater Quantity by me, I had
               the next six Months to apply my self wholly by Labour and Invention to furnish my
               self with Utensils proper for the performing all the Operations necessary for the
               making the Corn (when I had it) fit for my use.</p>

            <p>But first, I was to prepare more Land, for I had now Seed enough to sow above an Acre
               of Ground. Before I did this, I had a Weeks-work at least to make me a Spade, which
               when it was done was but a sorry one indeed, and very heavy, and requir'd double
               Labour to work with it; however I went thro' that, and sow'd my Seed in two large
               flat Pieces of Ground, as near my House as I could find them <ref target="tomind_"

               in with a good Hedge, the Stakes of which were all cut of that Wood which I had set
               before, and knew it would grow, so that in one Year's time I knew I should have a
               Quick or Living-Hedge, that would want but little Repair. This Work was not so little

               wet Season, when I could not go abroad.</p>
            <p>Within Doors, <hi rend="italic">that is,</hi> when it rained, and I could not go out, I found
               Employment on the following Occasions; always observing,
               that all the while I was at work I diverted my self with talking to my Parrot, and teaching him to Speak, and I quickly learn'd him to know his
               own Name, and at last to speak it out pretty loud POLL, which was the first Word I
               ever heard spoken in the Island by any Mouth but my own. This therefore was not my
               Work, but an <ref target="assistant_" corresp="assistant">assistant to my

                  recreational, rather than work</note>, for now, as I said, I had a great Employment upon my Hands, as follows, (<hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>) I had <pb
                  n="141" /> long study'd by some Means or other, to make
               my self some Earthen Vessels, which indeed I wanted sorely, but knew not where to
               come at them: However, considering the Heat of the Climate,
               I did not doubt but if I could find out any such Clay, I might botch up some such
               Pot, as might, being dry'd in the Sun, be hard enough, and strong enough to bear
               handling, and to hold any Thing that was dry, and requir'd to be kept so; and as this
               was necessary in the preparing Corn, Meal, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> which was the Thing I was
                  upon, I resolv'd to make some as large as I could, and
               fit only to stand like Jarrs to hold what should be put into them.</p>
            <p>It would make the Reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, to tell how many awkward
               ways I took to raise this Paste, what odd mishapen ugly things I made, how many of
               them fell in, and how many fell out, the Clay not being stiff enough to bear its own
               Weight; how many crack'd by the over violent Heat of the Sun, being set out too
               hastily; and how many fell in pieces with only removing, as
               well before as after they were dry'd; and in a word, how after having labour'd hard
               to find the Clay, to dig it, to temper it, to bring it home and work it; I could not
               make above two large earthen ugly things, I cannot call them Jarrs, in about two
               Months Labour.</p>
            <p>However, as the Sun bak'd these Two, very dry and hard, I lifted them very gently up,
               and set them down again in two great Wicker-Baskets which I had made on purpose for
               them, that they might not break, and as between the Pot and the Basket there was a
               little room to spare, I stuff'd it full of the Rice and Barley Straw, and these two
               Pots being to stand always dry, I thought would <pb n="142" facs="tcp:0653600100:146"

            <p>Tho' I miscarried so much in my Design for large Pots, yet I made several smaller

               the Sun bak'd them strangely hard.</p>
            <p>But all this would not answer my End, which was to get an earthen Pot to hold what
               was Liquid, and bear the Fire, which none of these could do.
               It happen'd after some time, making a pretty large Fire for cooking my Meat, when I
               went to put it out after I had done with it, I found a broken Piece of one of my Earthen-ware Vessels in the Fire, burnt as hard as a Stone,
               and red as a Tile. I was agreeably suppris'd to see it, and said to my self, that
               certainly they might be made to burn whole if they would burn broken.</p>
            <p>This set me to studying how to order my Fire, so as to make it burn me some Pots. I
               had no Notion of a Kiln, such as the Potters burn in, or of glazing them with Lead,
               tho' I had some Lead to do it with; but I plac'd three large Pipkins, and two or three Pots in a Pile one upon another, and
               plac'd my Fire-wood all round it with a great Heap of Embers under them, I ply'd the
               Fire with fresh Fuel round the out-side, and upon the top, till I saw the Pots in the
               inside red hot quite thro', and observ'd that they did not crack at all; when I saw
               them clear red, I let them stand in that Heat about 5 or 6 Hours, till I found one of
               them, tho' it did not crack, did melt or run, for the Sand which was mixed with the
               Clay melted by the violence of the Heat, and would have run into Glass if I had gone
               on, so I slack'd my Fire gradually till the Pots began to abate of the red <pb
                  n="143" /> Colour, and watching them all Night, that I
               might not let the Fire abate too fast, in the Morning I had three very good, I will
               not say handsome Pipkins; and two other Earthen Pots, as
               hard burnt as cou'd be desir'd; and one of them perfectly glaz'd with the Running of
               the Sand.</p>
            <p>After this Experiment, I need not say that I wanted no sort of Earthen Ware for my
               Use; but I must needs say, as to the Shapes of them, they were very indifferent, as
               any one may suppose, when I had no way of making them; but as the Children make
               Dirt-Pies, or as a Woman would make Pies, that never learn'd to <ref target="past_"

                  xml:id="past" target="past_" type="gloss">To make pastry</note>
            </p>
            <p>No Joy at a Thing of so mean a Nature was ever equal to mine, when I found I had made
               an Earthen Pot that would bear the Fire; and I had hardly Patience to stay till they
               were cold, before I set one upon the Fire again, with some Water in it, to boil me
               some Meat, which it did admirably well; and with a Piece of a Kid, I made some very
               good Broth, though I wanted Oatmeal, and several other Ingredients, requisite to make
               it so good as I would have had it been.</p>
            <p>My next Concern was, to get me a Stone Mortar, to stamp or beat some Corn in; for as
               to the Mill, there was no thought at arriving to that Perfection of Art, with one Pair of Hands. To supply this Want I was at a great Loss;
               for of all Trades in the World I was as perfectly unqualify'd for a Stone-cutter, as
               for any whatever; neither had I any Tools to go about it with. I spent many a Day to
               find out a great Stone big enough to cut hollow, and make fit for a Mortar, and could
               find none at all; except what was in the solid Rock, and which I had no way to dig or
               cut out; nor indeed were the Rocks in the Island of Hardness
                  sufficient, but were all of a sandy crumbling Stone, <pb
                  n="144" /> which neither would bear the Weight of a heavy
               Pestle, or would break the Corn without filling it with Sand; so after a great deal
               of Time lost in searching for a Stone, I gave it over, and resolv'd to look out for a
               great Block of hard Wood, which I found indeed much easier; and getting one as big as
               I had Strength to stir, I rounded it, and form'd it in the Out-side with my Axe and
               Hatchet, and then with the Help of Fire, and infinite Labour, made a hollow Place in
               it, as the <hi rend="italic">Indians</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Brasil</hi> make their <hi rend="italic">Canoes.</hi> After
               this, I made a great heavy Pestle or Beater, of the Wood

               see it possible I could have any Bread. This was a most difficult Thing, so much as
               but to think on; for to be sure I had nothing like the necessary Thing to make it; I
               mean fine thin Canvas, or Stuff, to search the Meal through. And here I was at a full
               Stop for many Months; nor did I really know what to do;
               Linnen I had none left, but what was meer Rags; I had Goats Hair, but neither knew I how to weave it, or spin it; and had I known
               how, here was no Tools to work it with; all the Remedy that I found for this, was,
               That at last I did remember I had among the Seamens Cloaths which were sav'd out of
               the Ship, some Neckcloths of Callicoe, or Muslin; and with some Pieces of these, I
               made three small Sieves, but proper enough for the Work; and thus I made shift for
               some Years; how I did afterwards, I shall shew in its Place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="145" />The baking Part was the next Thing to be consider'd, and how I should make Bread when I came to have
               Corn; for first I had no <ref target="yeast_" corresp="yeast">Yeast</ref><note

               supplying the Want, so I did not concern my self much about it: But for an Oven, I
               was indeed in great Pain; at length I found out an Experiment for that also, which
               was this; I made some Earthen Vessels very broad, but not deep; that is to say, about
               two Foot Diameter, and not above nine Inches deep; these I
               burnt in the Fire, as I had done the other, and laid them by; and when I wanted to
               bake, I made a great Fire upon my Hearth, which I had pav'd with some square Tiles of
               my own making, and burning also; but I should not call them square.</p>
            <p>When the Fire-wood was burnt pretty much into Embers, or
               live Coals, I drew them forward upon this Hearth, so as to cover it all over, and
               there I let them lye, till the Hearth was very hot, then sweeping away all the
               Embers, I set down my Loaf, or Loaves, and whelming down the Earthen Pot upon them,
               drew the Embers all round the Out-side of the Pot, to keep in, and add to the Heat;
               and thus, as well as in the best Oven in the World, I bak'd my Barley Loaves, and
               became in little Time a meer Pastry-Cook into the Bargain; for I made my self several
               Cakes of the Rice, and <ref target="pudding_" corresp="pudding">Puddings</ref><note

                  sweetened bread.</note>; indeed I made no Pies, neither had I any Thing to put
               into them, supposing I had, except the Flesh either of Fowls
               or Goats.</p>
            <p>It need not be wondred at, if all these Things took me up most Part of the third Year
               of my Abode here; for it is to be observ'd, That in the Intervals of these Things, I had my new Harvest and Husbandry
               to manage; for I reap'd my Corn in its Season, and carry'd it Home as well as I
               could, and laid it up in the Ear, in my large Baskets, till I had <pb n="146"

               no Floor to thrash it on, or Instrument to thrash it with.</p>
            <p>And now indeed my Stock of Corn increasing, I really wanted to build my Barns bigger.
               I wanted a Place to lay it up in; for the Increase of the Corn now yielded me so
               much, that I had of the Barley about twenty Bushels, and of the Rice as much, or
               more; insomuch, that now I resolv'd to begin to use it freely; for my Bread had been
               quite gone a great while; Also I resolved to see what Quantity would be sufficient
               for me a whole Year, and to sow but once a Year.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, I found that the forty Bushels of Barley and Rice, was much more than
               I could consume in a Year; so I resolv'd to sow just the same Quantity every Year,
               that I sow'd the last, in Hopes that such a Quantity would fully provide me with
               Bread, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the while these Things were doing, you may be sure my Thoughts run many times
               upon the Prospect of Land which I had seen from the other Side of the Island, and I
               was not without secret Wishes that I were on Shore there, fancying the seeing the main Land, and in an inhabited Country, I might find
               some Way or other to convey my self farther, and perhaps at last find some Means of
               Escape.</p>
            <p>But all this while I made no Allowance for the Dangers of such a Condition, and how I
               might fall into the Hands of Savages, and perhaps such as I might have Reason to
               think far worse than the Lions and Tigers of
                  <hi rend="italic">Africa.</hi> That if I once came into their Power, I
               should run a Hazard more than a thousand to one of being kill'd, and perhaps of being eaten; for I had heard that the People of the
                  <hi rend="italic">Carribean</hi> Coast were Canibals, or Man-eaters; and I knew by the Latiude
               that I could not be far off <pb n="147" /> from that Shore.
               That suppose they were not Canibals, yet that they might
               kill me, as many <hi rend="italic">Europeans</hi> who had fallen into their Hands had been serv'd,
               even when they had been ten or twenty together; much more I that was but one, and
               could make little or no Defence: All these Things, I say,
               which I ought to have consider'd well of, and did cast up in my Thoughts afterwards,
               yet took up none of my Apprehensions at first; but my Head run mightily upon the
               Thought of getting over to the Shore.</p>
            <p>Now I wish'd for my Boy <hi rend="italic">Xury,</hi> and the long Boat, with the Shoulder of Mutton
               Sail, with which I sail'd above a thousand Miles on the Coast of <hi rend="italic">Africk</hi>; but
               this was in vain. Then I thought I would go and look at our Ship's Boat, which, as I
               have said, was blown up upon the Shore, a great Way in the Storm, when we were first
               cast away. She lay almost where she did at first, but not quite; and was turn'd by
               the Force of the Waves and the Winds almost Bottom upward, against a high Ridge of
               Beachy rough Sand; but no Water about her as before.</p>
            <p>If I had had Hands to have refitted her, and to have launch'd her into the Water, the
               Boat would have done well enough, and I might have gone back into the
                  <hi rend="italic">Brasils</hi> with her easily enough; but I might have foreseen, That I could
               no more turn her, and set her upright upon her Bottom, than I could remove the
               Island: However, I went to the Woods, and cut Levers and Rollers, and brought them to
               the Boat, resolv'd to try what I could do, suggesting to my self, That I if could but
               turn her down, I might easily repair the Damage she had receiv'd, and she would be a
               very good Boat, and I might go to Sea in her very easily.</p>
            <p>I spar'd no Pains indeed, in this Piece of fruitless Toil, and spent, I think, three
               or four Weeks about <pb n="148" />
               it; at last finding it impossible to heave it up with my little Strength, I fell to
               digging away the Sand, to undermine it, and so to make it fall down, setting Pieces
               of Wood to thrust and guide it right in the Fall.</p>
            <p>But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it up again, or to get under it, much
               less to move it forward, towards the Water; so I was forc'd to give it over; and yet,
               though I gave over the Hopes of the Boat, my desire to venture over for the Main
               increased, rather than decreased, as the Means for it seem'd impossible.</p>
            <p>This at length put me upon thinking, Whether it was not possible to make my self a

               my self extreamly with the Thoughts of making it, and with my having much more
               Convenience for it than any of the <hi rend="italic">Negroes</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Indians</hi>; but not at
               all considering the particular Inconveniences which I lay
               under, more than the <hi rend="italic">Indians</hi> did, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> Want of Hands to move it,
               when it was made, into the Water, a Difficulty much harder for me to surmount, than
               all the Consequences of Want of Tools could be to them; for what was it to me, That
               when I had chosen a vast Tree in the Woods, I might with much Trouble cut it down, if
               after I might be able with my Tools to hew and dub the
               Out-side into the proper Shape of a Boat, and burn or cut out the In-side to make it
               hollow, so to make a Boat of it: If after all this, I must leave it just there where
               I found it, and was not able to launch it into the Water.</p>
            <p>One would have thought, I could not have had the least Reflection upon my Mind of my
                  Circumstance, <pb n="149" />
               while I was making this Boat; but I should have immediately thought how I should get
               it into the Sea; but my Thoughts were so intent upon my
               Voyage over the Sea in it, that I never once consider'd how I should get it off of
               the Land; and it was really in its own Nature more easy for me to guide it over forty
               five Miles of Sea, than about forty five Fathom of Land, where it lay, to set it a
               float in the Water.</p>
            <p>I went to work upon this Boat, the most like a Fool, that ever Man did, who had any
               of his Senses awake. I pleas'd my self with the Design, without determining whether I was ever able to undertake it;
               not but that the Difficulty of launching my Boat came often into my Head; but I put a
               stop to my own Enquiries into it, by this foolish Answer which I gave my self,
                  <hi rend="italic">Let's first make it, I'll warrant I'll find some Way or other to get it along,
                  when 'tis done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was a most preposterous Method; but the Eagerness of my Fancy prevail'd, and to
               work I went. I fell'd a Cedar Tree: I question much whether <ref target="solomon_"
                  corresp="solomon">Solomon</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff"
                  xml:id="solomon" target="solomon_" type="gloss">Solomon, King of Israel and Judah,
                  was said to have built a great temple to Yahweh, which housed the Ark of the

                  B.C.)</note> ever had such a One for the Building of the
               Temple at <hi rend="italic">Jerusalem.</hi> It was five Foot ten Inches Diameter at the lower Part
               next the Stump, and four Foot eleven Inches Diameter at the End of twenty two Foot,
               after which it lessen'd for a while, and then parted into
               Branches: It was not without infinite Labour that I fell'd this Tree: I was twenty
               Days hacking and hewing at it at the Bottom. I was fourteen
               more getting the Branches and Limbs, and the vast spreading Head of it cut off, which I hack'd and hew'd through
               with Axe and Hatchet, and inexpressible Labour: After this, it cost me a Month to
               shape it, and dub it to a Proportion, and to something like the Bottom of a Boat,
               that it might swim upright <pb n="150"
                  /> as it ought to do. It cost me near three Months more
               to clear the In-side, and work it out so, as to make an exact Boat of it: This I did
                  indeed without Fire, by meer Malett and Chissel, and by
               the dint of hard Labour, till I had brought it to be a very handsome
                  <hi rend="italic">Periagua,</hi> and big enough to have carry'd six and twenty Men, and
               consequently big enough to have carry'd me and all my Cargo.</p>
            <p>When I had gone through this Work, I was extremely delighted
               with it. The Boat was really much bigger than I ever saw a <hi rend="italic">Canoe,</hi> or
                     <hi rend="italic">Periagua,</hi> that was made of one Tree, in my
               Life. Many a weary Stroke it had cost, you may be sure; and
               there remain'd nothing but to get it into the Water; and had I gotten it into the
               Water, I make no question but I should have began the maddest Voyage, and the most
               unlikely to be perform'd, that ever was undertaken.</p>
            <p>But all my Devices to get it into the Water fail'd me; tho' they cost me infinite
               Labour too. It lay about one hundred Yards from the Water, and not more: But the
               first Inconvenience was, it was up Hill towards the Creek; well, to take away this Discouragement, I resolv'd to dig into the Surface
               of the Earth, and so make a <ref target="declivity_" corresp="declivity"
                  >Declivity</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="declivity"
                  target="declivity_" type="gloss">A downward slope, so that the boat might slide
                  down into the water.</note>: This I begun, and it cost me a prodigious deal of
               Pains; but who grutches Pains, that have their Deliverance in View: But when this was
               work'd through, and this Difficulty manag'd, it was still much at one; for I could no
               more stir the <hi rend="italic">Canoe,</hi> than I could the other Boat.</p>
            <p>Then I measur'd the Distance of Ground, and resolv'd to cut a Dock, or Canal, to
               bring the Water up to the <hi rend="italic">Canoe,</hi> seeing I could not
               bring the <hi rend="italic">Canoe</hi> down to the Water: Well, I began this Work, and when I began
               to enter into it, and calculate how deep it was to be dug,
               how broad, <pb n="151" /> how the Stuff to be thrown out, I
               found, That by the Number of Hands I had, being none but my own, it must have been
               ten or twelve Years before I should have gone through with it; for the Shore lay
               high, so that at the upper End, it must have been at least twenty Foot Deep; so at
               length, tho' with great Reluctancy, I gave this Attempt over
               also.</p>
            <p>This griev'd me heartily, and now I saw, tho' too late, the Folly of beginning a Work
               before we count the Cost; and before we judge rightly of our own Strength to go
               through with it.</p>
            <p>In the middle of this Work, I finish'd my fourth Year in this Place, and kept my
               Anniversary with the same Devotion, and with as much Comfort as ever before; for by a
               constant Study, and serious Application of the Word of God, and by the Assistance of his Grace, I gain'd a different Knowledge from what I had before. I entertain'd different Notions of Things. I look'd now upon the World as a
               Thing remote, which I had nothing to do with, no Expectation from, and indeed no Desires about: In a Word, I had nothing indeed to do with it,
               nor was ever like to have; so I thought it look'd as we may perhaps look upon it
               hereafter, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> as a Place I had liv'd in, but was come out of it; and well
               might I say, as Father <ref target="abraham_" corresp="abraham">Abraham</ref> to

                     hell, while Lazarus, the leper outside his gates, dies and is taken to
                     Abraham's bosom. When the rich man begs Abraham to send Lazarus down from
                     heaven to grant him reprieve from hellfire, Abraham refuses, telling him,
                     "Between us and you there is a great gulf fixed" (Luke 16:26). Crusoe places

            </p>
            <p>In the first Place, I was remov'd from all the Wickedness of the World here. I had
               neither the <hi rend="italic">Lust of the Flesh, the Lust of the Eye, or the Pride of Life.</hi> I
               had nothing to covet; for I had all that I was now capable of enjoying: I was Lord of
               the whole Mannor; or if I pleas'd, I might call my self King, or Emperor over the
               whole Country which I had Possession of. There were no Rivals. I had no Competitor,
               none to dispute Sovereignty or <pb n="152" /> Command with
               me. I might have rais'd Ship Loadings of Corn; but I had no use for it; so I let as
               little grow as I thought enough for my Occasion. I had Tortoise or Turtles enough;
               but now and then one, was as much as I could put to any use. I had Timber enough to
               have built a Fleet of Ships. I had Grapes enough to have made Wine, or to have cur'd
               into Raisins, to have loaded that Fleet, when they had been built.</p>
            <p>But all I could make use of, was, All that was valuable. I had enough to eat, and to
               supply my Wants, and, what was all the rest to me? If I kill'd more Flesh than I
               could eat, the Dog must eat it, or the Vermin. If I sow'd more Corn than I could eat,
               it must be spoil'd. The Trees that I cut down, were lying to rot on the Ground. I
               could make no more use of them than for <ref target="fuel_" corresp="fuel"

            <p>In a Word, The Nature and Experience of Things dictated to me upon just Reflection,
               That all the good Things of this World, are no farther good to us, than they are for
               our Use; and that whatever we may heap up indeed to give others, we enjoy just as
               much as we can use, and no more. The most covetous griping Miser in the World would
               have been cur'd of the Vice of Covetousness, if he had been in my Case; for I
               possess'd infinitely more than I knew what to do with. I had no room for Desire,
               except it was of Things which I had not, and they were but Trifles, though indeed of
               great Use to me. I had, as I hinted before, a Parcel of
               Money, as well Gold as Silver, about thirty six Pounds Sterling: Alas! There the
               nasty sorry useless Stuff lay; I had no manner of Business for it; and I often
               thought with my self, That I would have given a Handful of it for a <ref

                  <hi rend="italic">Turnip</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Carrot</hi> Seed out of <hi rend="italic">England,</hi> or for a Handful
               of <hi rend="italic">Pease</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Beans,</hi> and a Bottle of Ink: <hi rend="italic">As it was,</hi> I had
               not the least Advantage by it, or Benefit from it; but there it lay in a Drawer, and
               grew mouldy with the Damp of the Cave, in the wet Season; and if I had had the Drawer
               full of Diamonds, it had been the same Case; and they had been of no manner of Value
               to me, because of no Use.</p>
            <p>I had now brought my State of Life to be much easier in it self than it was at first,
               and much easier to my Mind, as well as to my Body. I frequently sat down to my Meat
               with Thankfulness, and admir'd the Hand of God's Providence,
               which had thus spread my Table in the Wilderness. I learn'd to look more upon the
               bright Side of my Condition, and less upon the dark Side;
               and to consider what I enjoy'd, rather than what I wanted; and this gave me sometimes
               such secret Comforts, that I cannot express them; and which I take Notice of here, to
               put those discontented People in Mind of it, who cannot enjoy comfortably what God
               has given them; because they see, and covet something that
               he has not given them: All our Discontents about what we
               want, appear'd to me, to spring from the <ref target="want_" corresp="want"
                  >Want</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="want" target="want_"
                  type="gloss">Lack</note> of Thankfulness for what we have.</p>
            <p>Another Reflection was of great Use to me, and doubtless would be so to any one that
               should fall into such Distress as mine was; and this was, To compare my present
               Condition with what I at first expected it should be; nay, with what it would
               certainly have been, if the good Providence of God had not wonderfully order'd the
               Ship to be cast up nearer to the Shore, where I not only could <pb n="154"
                  /> come at her, but could bring what I got out of her to
               the Shore, for my Relief and Comfort; without which, I had wanted for Tools to work,
               Weapons for Defence, or Gun-Powder and Shot for getting my Food.</p>
            <p>I spent whole Hours, I may say whole Days, in representing to my self in the most
               lively Colours, how I must have acted, if I had got nothing out of the Ship. How I
               could not have so much as got any Food, except Fish and Turtles; and that as it was
               long before I found any of them, I must have perish'd first. That I should have
               liv'd, if I had not perish'd, like a meer Savage. That if I had kill'd a Goat, or a
               Fowl, by any Contrivance, I had no way to <ref target="flay_" corresp="flay"
                  >flea</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="flay" target="flay_"

               Skin, and the Bowels, or to cut it up; but must gnaw it with my Teeth, and pull it
               with my Claws like a Beast.</p>
            <p>These Reflections made me very sensible of the Goodness of Providence to me, and very
               thankful for my present Condition, with all its Hardships and Misfortunes: And this
               Part also I cannot but recommend to the Reflection of those, who are apt in their
               Misery to say, <hi rend="italic">Is any Affliction like mine!</hi> Let them consider, How much
               worse the Cases of some People are, and their Case might have been, if Providence had
               thought fit.</p>
            <p>I had another Reflection which assisted me also to comfort my Mind with Hopes; and
               this was, comparing my present Condition with what I had deserv'd, and had therefore
               Reason to expect from the Hand of Providence. I had liv'd a dreadful Life, perfectly
               destitute of the Knowledge and Fear of God. I had been well instructed by Father and
               Mother; <ref target="wanting_" corresp="wanting">neither had they been wanting to
                  me</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="wanting" target="wanting_"
                  type="gloss">Neither had they failed</note>, in their early Endeavours, to infuse
               a religious Awe of God into my Mind, a Sense of my Duty, and <pb n="155"

               me. But alas! falling early into the Seafaring Life, which of all the Lives is the
               most destitute of the Fear of God, though his Terrors are always before them; I say, falling early into the Seafaring Life, and into Seafaring
               Company, all that little Sense of Religion which I had entertain'd, was laugh'd out
               of me by my Mess-Mates, by a harden'd despising of Dangers; and the Views of Death,
               which grew habitual to me; by my long Absence from all Manner of Opportunities to
                  converse with any thing but what was like my self, or to
               hear any thing that was good, or tended towards it.</p>
            <p>So void was I of every Thing that was good, or of the least Sense of what I was, or
               was to be, that in the greatest Deliverances I enjoy'd, such as my Escape from
                  <hi rend="italic">Sallee</hi>; my being taken up by the <hi rend="italic">Portuguese</hi> Master of the Ship;
               my being planted so well in the <hi rend="italic">Brasils</hi>; my
               receiving the Cargo from <hi rend="italic">England,</hi> and the like; I never had once the Word
                  <hi rend="italic">Thank God,</hi> so much as on my Mind, or in my Mouth; nor in the greatest
               Distress, had I so much as a Thought to pray to him, or so much as to say, <hi rend="italic">Lord
                  have Mercy upon me</hi>; no nor to mention the Name of God, unless it was to swear
               by, and blaspheme it.</p>
            <p>I had terrible Reflections upon my Mind for many Months, as I have already observ'd,
               on the Account of my wicked and hardned Life past; and when I look'd about me and
               considered what particular Providences had attended me since
               my coming into this Place, and how God had dealt bountifully with me; had not only punished me less than my
               Iniquity had deserv'd, but had so plentifully provided for
               me; this gave me great hopes that my <pb n="156" />
               Repentance was accepted, and that God had yet Mercy in store for me.</p>
            <p>With these Reflections I work'd my Mind up, not only to Resignation to the Will of
               God in the present Disposition of my Circumstances; but even to a sincere
               Thankfulness for my Condition, and that I who was yet a living Man, ought not to
                  complain, seeing I had not the due Punishment of my Sins;
               that I enjoy'd so many Mercies which I had no reason to have expected in that Place;
               that I ought never more to repine at my Condition but to rejoyce, and to give daily

               that I could hardly have nam'd a Place in the unhabitable Part of the World where I
               could have been cast more to my Advantage: A Place, where as I had no Society, which
               was my Affliction on one Hand, so I found no ravenous Beast, no furious Wolves or
               Tygers to threaten my Life, no venomous Creatures or poisonous, which I might feed on
               to my Hurt, no Savages to murther and devour me.</p>
            <p>In a word, as my Life was a Life of Sorrow, one way, so it was a Life of Mercy,
               another; and I wanted nothing to make it a Life of Comfort, but to be able to make my

            <p>I had now been here so long, that many Things which I brought on Shore for my Help,
               were either quite gone, or very much wasted and near spent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" />My Ink, as I observed, had been gone some
               time, all but a very little, which I eek'd out with Water a
               little and a little, till it was so pale it scarce left any Appearance of black upon
               the Paper: As long as it lasted, I made use of it to minute down the Days of the
               Month on which any remarkable Thing happen'd to me, and
               first by casting up Times past: I remember that there was a strange Concurrence of
               Days, in the various Providences which befel me; and which,
               if I had been superstitiously inclin'd to observe Days as Fatal or Fortunate, I might
               have had Reason to have look'd upon with a great deal of Curiosity.</p>
            <p>First I had observed, that the same Day that I broke away from my Father and my
               Friends, and run away to <hi rend="italic">Hull,</hi> in order to go to Sea; the same Day
               afterwards I was taken by the Sally Man of War, and made a Slave.</p>
            <p>The same Day of the Year that I escaped out of the Wreck of that Ship in
                  <hi rend="italic">Yarmouth</hi> Rodes, that same Day-Year afterwards I made my escape from
                  <hi rend="italic">Sallee</hi> in the Boat.</p>
            <p>The same Day of the Year I was born on (<hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>) the 30<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of
                  <hi rend="italic">September,</hi> that same Day, I had my Life so miraculously saved 26 Year
               after, when I was cast on Shore in this Island, so that my wicked Life, and my
               solitary Life begun both on a Day.</p>
            <p>The next Thing to my Ink's, being wasted, was that of my Bread, I mean the Bisket
               which I brought out of the Ship, this I had husbanded to the last degree, allowing my
               self but one Cake of Bread a Day for above a Year, and yet I was quite without Bread
               for near a Year before I got any Corn of my own, and great Reason I had to be
               thankful that I had any at all, the getting it being, as has been already observed,
               next to miraculous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" />My Cloaths began to decay too mightily: As to
               Linnen, I had had none a good while, except some chequer'd Shirts which I found in
               the Chests of the other Seamen, and which I carefully preserved, because many times I could bear no other Cloaths on but a
               Shirt; and it was a very great help to me that I had among all the Men's Cloaths of
               the Ship almost three dozen of Shirts. There were also several thick Watch Coats of the Seamens, which were left indeed, but they were too
               hot to wear; and tho' it is true, that the Weather was so violent hot, that there was
               no need of Cloaths, yet I could not go quite naked; no, tho' I had been inclin'd to
               it, which I was not, nor could not abide the thoughts of it, tho' I was all
               alone.</p>
            <p>The Reason why I could not go quite naked, was, I could not bear the heat of the Sun
               so well when quite naked, as with some Cloaths on; nay, the very Heat frequently
               blistered my Skin; whereas with a Shirt on, the Air itself made some Motion and
               whistling under that Shirt was twofold cooler than without it, no more could I ever
               bring my self to go out in the heat of Sun, without a Cap or a Hat; the heat of the
               Sun beating with such Violence as it does in that Place, would give me the Head-ach
               presently, by darting so directly on my Head, without a Cap or Hat on, so that I
               could not bear it, whereas, if I put on my Hat, it would presently go away.</p>
            <p>Upon those Views I began to consider about putting the few
               Rags I had, which I call'd Cloaths, into some Order; I had worn out all the
               Wast-coats I had, and my Business was now to try if I could not make Jackets out of
               the great Watch-Coats which I had by me, and with such other Materials as I had, so I
               set to Work a Taylering, or rather indeed a Botching, for I made most <pb n="159"
                  /> piteous Work of it. However, I <ref target="shift_"
                  corresp="shift">made shift</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff"
                  xml:id="shift" target="shift_" type="gloss">Contrived (ie. a makeshift
                  waistcoat)</note> to make two or three new Wastcoats, which I hoped wou'd serve me
               a great while; as for Breeches or Drawers, I made but a very sorry shift indeed, till
               afterward.</p>
            <p>I have mentioned that I saved the Skins of all the Creatures that I kill'd, I mean
               four-footed ones, and I had hung them up stretch'd out with Sticks in the Sun, by
               which means some of them were so dry and hard that they were fit for little, but
               others it seems were very useful. The first thing I made of these was a great Cap for
               my Head, with the Hair on the out Side to shoor off the Rain; and this I perform'd so
               well, that after this I made me a Suit of Cloaths wholly of these Skins, that is to
               say, a Wastcoat, and Breeches open at Knees, and both loose, for they were rather
               wanting to keep me cool than to keep me warm. I must not omit to acknowledge that
               they were wretchedly made; for if I was a bad <hi rend="italic">Carpenter,</hi> I was a worse
                  <hi rend="italic">Tayler.</hi> However, they were such as I made very good shift with; and when
               I was abroad, if it happen'd to rain, the Hair of my Wastcoat and Cap being
               outermost, I was kept very dry.</p>
            <p>After this I spent a great deal of Time and Pains to make me an Umbrella; I was
               indeed in great want of one, and had a great Mind to make one; I had seen them made
               in the <hi rend="italic">Brasils,</hi> where they are very useful in the great Heats which are
               there. And I felt the Heats every jot as great here, and greater too, being nearer
               the Equinox; besides, as I was oblig'd to be much abroad, it was a most useful thing
               to me, as well for the Rains as the Heats. I took a world of Pains at it, and was a
               great while before I could make any thing likely to hold; nay, after I thought I had
               hit the Way, I spoil'd 2 or 3 before I made one to my Mind; but <pb n="160"
                  /> at last I made one that <ref target="answer_"
                  corresp="answer">answer'd</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff"
                  xml:id="answer" target="answer_" type="gloss">Served the need</note> indifferently
               well: The main Difficulty I found was to make it to let down. I could make it to
               spread, but if it did not let down too, and draw in, it was not portable for me any
               Way but just over my Head, which wou'd not do. However, at last, as I said, I made
               one to answer, and covered it with Skins, the Hair upwards, so that it cast off the
               Rains like a Penthouse, and kept off the Sun so effectually,
               that I could walk out in the hottest of the Weather with greater Advantage than I
               could before in the coolest, and when I had no need of it, cou'd close it and carry
               it under my Arm.</p>
            <p>Thus I liv'd mighty comfortably, my Mind being entirely
               composed by resigning to the Will of God, and throwing my self wholly upon the Disposal of his Providence. This made my Life better than sociable, for when I began to regret the want of
               Conversation, I would ask my self whether thus conversing mutually with my own
               Thoughts, and, as I hope I may say, with even God himself by Ejaculations, was not
               better than the utmost Enjoyment of humane Society in the World.</p>

Smith</note></head>
            <p>I cannot say that after this, for five Years, any extraordinary thing happened to me,
               but I liv'd on in the same Course, in the same Posture and Place, just as before; the
               chief things I was employ'd in, besides my yearly Labour of planting my Barley and
               Rice, and curing my Raisins, of both which I always kept up
               just enough to have sufficient Stock of one Year's Provisions beforehand. I say,
               besides this yearly Labour, and my daily Labour of going out with my Gun, I had one
               Labour to make me a Canoe, which at last I finished. So that by digging a Canal to it of six Foot wide, and four Foot deep, I
               brought it into the Creek, almost half a Mile. As for the first, which was so vastly
               big, <pb n="161" /> as I made it without considering
               before-hand, as I ought to do, how I should be able to launch it; so never being able
               to bring it to the Water, or bring the Water to it, I was oblig'd to let it lye where
               it was, as a <ref target="memorandum_" corresp="memorandum">Memorandum</ref><note
                  resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="memorandum" target="memorandum_"
                  type="gloss">In Latin, literally "a thing that must be remembered"</note> to
               teach me to be wiser next Time: Indeed, the next Time, tho' I could not get a Tree
               proper for it, and in a Place where I could not get the Water to it, at any less
               Distance, than as I have said, near half a Mile; yet as I saw it was practicable at
               last, I never gave it over; and though I was near two Years about it, yet I never
               grutch'd my Labour, in Hopes of having a Boat to go off to Sea at last.</p>
            <p>However, though my little <hi rend="italic">Periagau</hi> was finish'd;
               yet the Size of it was not at all answerable to the Design which I had in View, when
               I made the first; I mean, Of venturing over to the <hi rend="italic">Terra Firma,</hi> where it was
               above forty Miles broad; accordingly, the Smallness of my
               Boat assisted to put an End to that Design, and now I thought no more of it: But as I
               had a Boat, my next Design was to make a Tour round the Island; for as I had been on
               the other Side, in one Place, crossing as I have already
               describ'd it, over the Land; so the Discoveries I made in
               that little Journey, made me very eager to see other Parts
               of the Coast; and now I had a Boat, I thought of nothing but sailing round the
               Island.</p>
            <p>For this Purpose, that I might do every Thing with Discretion and Consideration, I
               fitted up a little Mast to my Boat, and made a Sail to it, out of some of the Pieces
               of the Ship's Sail, which lay in store; and of which I had a great Stock by me.</p>
            <p>Having fitted my Mast and Sail, and try'd the Boat, I found she would sail very well:
               Then I made little Lockers, or Boxes, at either End of my Boat, to put Provisions,
               Necessaries and Ammunition, <pb n="162"
                  />
               <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> into, to be kept dry, either from Rain, or the Sprye of the Sea; and
               a little long hollow Place I cut in the In-side of the Boat, where I could lay my
               Gun, making a Flap to hang down over it to keep it dry.</p>
            <p>I fix'd my Umbrella also in a Step at the Stern, like a Mast, to stand over my Head,
               and keep the Heat of the Sun off of me like an Auning; and thus I every now and then
               took a little Voyage upon the Sea, but never went far out, nor far from the little
               Creek; but at last being eager to view the Circumference of my little Kingdom, I
               resolv'd upon my Tour, and accordingly I victuall'd my Ship for the Voyage, putting
               in two Dozen of my Loaves <ref target="cake_" corresp="cake">(Cakes I should rather
                  call them)</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="cake" target="cake_"
                  type="gloss">Because they are unleavened</note> of Barley
               Bread, an Earthen Pot full of parch'd Rice, a Food I eat a great deal of, a little
               Bottle of Rum, half a Goat, and Powder and Shot for killing more, and two large
               Watch-coats, of those which, as I mention'd before, I had sav'd out of the Seamen's
               Chests; these I took, one to lye upon, and the other to
               cover me in the Night.</p>
            <p>It was the sixth of <hi rend="italic">November,</hi> in the sixth Year of my Reign, or my
               Captivity, which you please, That I set out on this Voyage, and I found it much
               longer than I expected; for though the Island it self was not very large, yet when I
               came to the <hi rend="italic">East</hi> Side of it, I found a great Ledge of Rocks lye out above
               two Leagues into the Sea, some above Water, some under it;
               and beyond that, a Shoal of Sand, lying dry half a League more; so that I was oblig'd
               to go a great Way out to Sea to double the Point.</p>
            <p>When first I discover'd them, I was going to give over my Enterprise, and come back
               again, not knowing how far it might oblige me to go out to Sea; and above all,
               doubting how I should get back <pb n="163" /> again; so I
               came to an Anchor; for I had made me a kind of an Anchor with a Piece of a broken
                  <ref target="graplin_" corresp="graplin">Graplin</ref><note
                  resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="graplin" target="graplin_" type="gloss"
                  >Grappling-iron</note>, which I got out of the Ship.</p>
            <p>Having secur'd my Boat, I took my Gun, and went on Shore, climbing up upon a Hill,
               which seem'd to over-look that Point, where I saw the full Extent of it, and resolv'd
               to venture.</p>
            <p>In my viewing the Sea from that Hill where I stood, I perceiv'd a strong, and indeed,
               a most furious Current, which run to the <hi rend="italic">East,</hi> and
               even came close to the Point; and I took the more Notice of
               it, because I saw there might be some Danger; that when I
               came into it, I might be carry'd out to Sea by the Strength of it, and not be able to
               make the Island again; and indeed, had I not gotten first up upon this Hill, I
               believe it would have been so; for there was the same Current on the other Side the
               Island, only, that it set off at a farther Distance; and I saw there was a strong
               Eddy under the Shore; so I had nothing to do but to get in out of the first Current,
               and I should presently be in an Eddy.</p>
            <p>I lay here, however, two Days; because the Wind blowing pretty fresh at <ref
                  target="ese_" corresp="ese">E. S. E.</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff"
                  xml:id="ese" target="ese_" type="gloss">East-southeast</note> and that being just
               contrary to the said Current, made a great Breach of the Sea upon the Point; so that
               it was not safe for me to keep too close to the Shore for the Breach, nor to go too
               far off because of the Stream.</p>
            <p>The third Day in the Morning, the Wind having abated over
               Night, the Sea was calm, and I ventur'd; but I am a warning Piece again, to all rash
               and ignorant Pilots; for no sooner was I come to the Point, when even I was not my
               Boat's Length from the Shore, but I found my self in a great Depth of Water, and a
               Current like the Sluice of a Mill: It carry'd my Boat a long with it <pb n="164"
                  /> with such Violence, That all I could do, could not
               keep her so much as on the Edge of it; but I found it hurry'd me farther and farther
               out from the Eddy, which was on my left Hand. There was no Wind stirring to help me,
               and all I could do with my Paddlers signify'd nothing, and now I began to give my
               self over for lost; for as the Current was on both Sides the
               Island, I knew in a few Leagues Distance they must joyn again, and then I was
               irrecoverably gone; nor did I see any Possibility of
               avoiding it; so that I had no Prospect before me but of
               Perishing; not by the Sea, for that was calm enough, but of starving for Hunger. I
               had indeed found a Tortoise on the Shore, as big almost as I could lift, and had
               toss'd it into the Boat; and I had a great Jar of fresh Water, that is to say, one of
               my Earthen Pots; but what was all this to being driven into the vast Ocean, where to
               be sure, there was no Shore, no main Land, or Island, for a
               thousand Leagues at least.</p>
            <p>And now I saw how easy it was for the Providence of God to
               make the most miserable Condition Mankind could be in
                  <hi rend="italic">worse.</hi> Now I look'd back upon my desolate solitary Island, as the most
               pleasant Place in the World, and all the Happiness my Heart could wish for, was to be
               but there again. I stretch'd out my Hands to it with eager
               Wishes. O happy Desart, said I, I shall never see thee more. O miserable Creature,
               said I, whether am I going: Then I reproach'd my self with
               my unthankful Temper, and how I had repin'd at my solitary Condition; and now what
               would I give to be on Shore there again. Thus we never see the true State of our
               Condition, till it is illustrated to us by its Contraries; nor know how to value what
               we enjoy, but by the want of it. It is scarce possible to imagine the Consternation I
               was now in, <pb n="165" /> being driven from my beloved
               Island (for so it appear'd to me now to be) into the wide
               Ocean, almost two Leagues, and in the utmost Despair of ever
               recovering it again. However, I work'd hard, till indeed my Strength was almost
               exhausted, and kept my Boat as much to the <hi rend="italic">Northward,</hi> that is, towards the
               Side of the Current which the Eddy lay on, as possibly I could; when about Noon, as
               the Sun pass'd the Meridian, I thought I felt a little
               Breeze of Wind in my Face, springing up from the <ref target="sse_" corresp="sse">S.
                  S. E.</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="sse" target="sse_"
                  type="gloss">South-southeast</note> This chear'd my Heart a little, and especially
               when in about half an Hour more, it blew a pretty small gentle Gale. By this Time I
               was gotten at a frightful Distance from the Island, and had the least Cloud or haizy
               Weather interven'd, I had been undone another Way too; for I had no Compass on Board,
               and should never have known how to have steer'd towards the Island, if I had but once
               lost Sight of it; but the Weather continuing clear, I
               apply'd my self to get up my Mast again, spread my Sail, standing away to the
                  <hi rend="italic">North,</hi> as much as possible, to get out of the Current.</p>
            <p>Just as I had set my Mast and Sail, and the Boat began to stretch away, I saw even by
               the Clearness of the Water, some Alteration of the Current was near; for where the
               Current was so strong, the Water was foul; but perceiving
               the Water clear, I found the Current abate, and presently I found to the
                  <hi rend="italic">East,</hi> at about half a Mile, a Breach of the Sea upon some Rocks; these
               Rocks I found caus'd the Current to part again, and as the main Stress of it ran away
               more <hi rend="italic">Southerly,</hi> leaving the Rocks to the <hi rend="italic">North-East</hi>; so the other
               return'd by the Repulse of the Rocks, and made a strong Eddy, which run back again to
               the <hi rend="italic">North-West,</hi> with a very sharp Stream.</p>

               from Thieves just a going to murther them, or, who have been in such like
               Extremities, may guess what my present Surprise of Joy was, and how gladly I put my Boat into the Stream of this Eddy, and the Wind
               also freshning, how gladly I spread my Sail to it, running chearfully before the
               Wind, and with a strong Tide or Eddy under Eoot.</p>
            <p>This Eddy carryed me about a League in my Way back again directly towards the Island,
               but about two Leagues more to the Northward than the Current which carried me away at
               first; so that when I came near the Island, I found my self open to the Northern
               Shore of it, that is to say, the other End of the Island
               opposite to that which I went out from.</p>
            <p>When I had made something more than a League of Way by the help of this Current or
               Eddy, I found it was spent and serv'd me no farther. However, I found that being
               between the two great Currents, (<hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>) that on the South Side which had
               hurried me away, and that on the North which lay about a
               League on the other Side. I say between these two, in the wake of the Island, I found
               the Water at least still and running no Way, and having still a Breeze of Wind fair
               for me, I kept on steering directly for the Island, tho' not
               making such fresh Way as I did before.</p>
            <p>About four a-Clock in the Evening, being then within about a League of the Island, I
               found the Point of the Rocks which occasioned this Disaster, stretching out as is
               describ'd before to the Southward, and casting off the
               Current more Southwardly, had of Course made another Eddy to
               the North, and this I found very strong, but not directly setting the Way my Course
               lay which was due West, but <pb n="167" /> almost full
               North. However having a fresh Gale, I stretch'd a-cross this Eddy slanting
               North-west, and in about an Hour came within about a Mile of the Shore, where it
               being smooth Water, I soon got to Land.</p>
            <p>When I was on Shore I fell on my Knees and gave God Thanks for my Deliverance,
               resolving to lay aside all Thoughts of my Deliverance by my Boat, and refreshing my
               self with such Things as I had, I brought my Boat close to the Shore in a little Cove
               that I had spy'd under some Trees, and lay'd me down to sleep, being quite spent with
               the Labour and Fatigue of the Voyage.</p>
            <p>I was now at a great Loss which Way to get Home with my Boat, I had run so much
               Hazard, and knew too much the Case to think of attempting it
               by the Way I went out, and what might be at the other Side (I mean the West Side) I
               knew not, nor had I any Mind to run any more Ventures; so I only resolved in the
               Morning to make my Way Westward along the Shore and to see if there was no Creek
               where I might lay up my Frigate in Safety, so as to have her
               again if I wanted her; in about three Mile or thereabout coasting the Shore, I came
               to a very good Inlet or Bay about a Mile over, which narrowed till it came to a very
               little Rivulet or Brook, where I found a very convenient Harbour for my Boat and
               where she lay as if she had been in a little Dock made on Purpose for her. Here I put
               in, and having stow'd my Boat very safe, I went on Shore to look about me and see
               where I was.</p>
            <p>I soon found I had but a little past by the Place where I had been before, when I
               travell'd on Foot to that Shore; so taking nothing out of my Boat, but my Gun and my
               Umbrella, for it was exceeding hot, I began my March: The
               Way was comfortable enough after such a Voyage as I had <pb n="168"
                  /> been upon, and I reach'd my old Bower in the Evening,
               where I found every thing standing as I left it; for I always kept it in good Order,
                  being, as I said before, my Country House.</p>
            <p>I got over the Fence, and laid me down in the Shade to rest my Limbs; for I was very
               weary, and fell asleep: But judge you, if you can, that read my Story, what a
               Surprize I must be in, when I was wak'd out of my Sleep by a Voice calling me by my
               Name several times, <hi rend="italic">Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe,</hi> poor <hi rend="italic">Robin Crusoe,</hi>
               where are you <hi rend="italic">Robin Crusoe</hi>? Where are you? Where
               have you been?</p>
            <p>I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigu'd with Rowing, or Paddling, as it is
               call'd, the first Part of the Day, and with walking the latter Part, that I did not
               wake thoroughly, but dozing between sleeping and waking,
               thought I dream'd that some Body spoke to me: But as the Voice continu'd to repeat
                  <hi rend="italic">Robin Crusoe, Robin Crusoe,</hi> at last I began to wake more perfectly, and
               was at first dreadfully frighted, and started up in the utmost Consternation: But no sooner were my Eyes open, but I saw my <hi rend="italic">Poll</hi>
               sitting on the Top of the Hedge; and immediately knew that it was he that spoke to
               me; for just in such bemoaning Language I had used to talk to him, and teach him; and
               he had learn'd it so perfectly, that he would sit upon my Finger, and lay his Bill
               close to my Face, and cry, <hi rend="italic">Poor</hi> Robin Crusoe, <hi rend="italic">Where are you? Where have
                  you been? How come you here?</hi> And such things as I had taught him.</p>
            <p>However, even though I knew it was the Parrot, and that indeed it could be no Body
               else, it was a good while before I could compose my self: First, I was amazed how the
               Creature got thither, and then, how he should just keep about the Place, and no where
               else: But as I was well satisfied it <pb n="169" /> could be
               no Body but honest <hi rend="italic">Poll,</hi> I got it over; and holding out my Hand, and calling
               him by his Name <hi rend="italic">Poll,</hi> the sociable Creature came to me, and sat upon my
               Thumb, as he used to do, and continu'd talking to me, <hi rend="italic">Poor</hi> Robin Crusoe, and
                  <hi rend="italic">how did I come here?</hi> and <hi rend="italic">where had I been?</hi> just as if he had
               been overjoy'd to see me again; and so I carry'd him Home along with me.</p>
            <p>I had now had enough of rambling to Sea for some time, and had enough to do for many
               Days to sit still, and reflect upon the Danger I had been in: I would have been very
               glad to have had my Boat again on my Side of the Island; but I knew not how it was
               practicable to get it about as to the East Side of the Island, which I had gone
               round; I knew well enough there was no venturing that Way;
               my very heart would shrink, and my very Blood run chill but to think of it: And as to
               the other Side of the Island, I did not know how it might be there; but supposing the
               Current ran with the same Force against the Shore at the East as it pass'd by it on
               the other, I might run the same Risk of being driven down the Stream, and carry'd by
               the Island, as I had been before, of being carry'd away from it; so with these
               Thoughts I contented my self to be without any Boat, though it had been the Product
               of so many Months Labour to make it, and of so many more to get it unto the Sea.</p>
            <p>In this Government of my Temper, I remain'd near a Year, liv'd a very sedate retir'd
               Life, as you may well suppose; and my Thoughts being very much composed as to my
               Condition, and fully comforted in resigning my self to the Dispositions of Providence, I thought I liv'd really very happily in all things,
               except that of Society.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" />I improv'd my self in this time in all the
                  mechanick Exercises which my Necessities put me upon
               applying my self to, and I believe cou'd, upon Occasion,
               make a very good <hi rend="italic">Carpenter,</hi> especially considering
               how few Tools I had.</p>
            <p>Besides this, I arriv'd at an unexpected Perfection in my
               Earthen Ware, and contriv'd well enough to make them with a Wheel, which I found
                  infinitely easyer and better; because I made things round
               and shapable, which before were filthy things indeed to look on. But I think I was
               never more vain of my own Performance, or more joyful for any thing I found out, than
               for my being able to make a Tobacco-Pipe. And tho' it was a very ugly clumsy thing, when it was done, and only burnt red like other Earthen Ware,
               yet as it was hard and firm, and would draw the Smoke, I was exceedingly comforted
               with it, for I had been always used to smoke, and there were
               Pipes in the Ship, but I forgot them at first, not knowing that there was Tobacco in
               the Island; and afterwards, when I search'd the Ship again, I could not come at any
               Pipes at all.</p>
            <p>In my Wicker Ware also I improved much, and made abundance of necessary Baskets, as
               well as my Invention shew'd me, tho' not very handsome, yet they were such as were
               very handy and convenient for my laying things up in, or
               fetching things home in. For Example, if I kill'd a Goat abroad, I could hang it up
               in a Tree, flea it, and dress it, and cut it in Pieces, and bring it home in a
               Basket, and the like by a Turtle, I could cut it up, take out the Eggs, and a Piece
               or two of the Flesh, which was enough for me, and bring them home in a Basket, and
               leave the rest behind me. Also large deep Baskets were my
                  Receivers for my Corn, which I always rubb'd out as <pb
                  n="171" /> soon as it was dry, and cured, and kept it in
               great Baskets.</p>
            <p>I began now to perceive my Powder abated considerably, and
               this was a Want which it was impossible for me to supply,
               and I began seriously to consider what I must do when I should have no more Powder;
               that is to say, how I should do to kill any Goat, I had, as is observ'd in the third
               Year of my being here, kept a young Kid, and bred her up tame, and I was in hope of
               getting a He-Goat, but I could not by any Means bring it to pass, 'till my Kid grew
               an old Goat; and I could never find in my Heart to kill her, till she dy'd at last of
               meer Age.</p>
            <p>But being now in the eleventh Year of my Residence, and, as
               I have said, my Ammunition growing low, I set my self to
               study some Art to trap and snare the Goats, to see whether I could not catch some of
               them alive, and particularly I wanted a She-Goat great with young.</p>
            <p>To this Purpose I made Snares to hamper them, and I do believe they were more than
               once taken in them, but my Tackle was not good, for I had no Wire, and I always found
               them broken, and my Bait devoured.</p>
            <p>At length I resolv'd to try a Pit-fall, so I dug several
               large Pits in the Earth, in Places where I had observ'd the Goats used to feed, and
               over these Pits I plac'd Hurdles of my own making too, with a great Weight upon them;
               and several times I put Ears of Barley, and dry Rice, without setting the Trap, and I could easily perceive that the Goats
               had gone in and eaten up the Corn, for I could see the Mark of their Feet. At length
               I set three Traps in one Night, and going the next Morning I found them all standing,
               and yet the Bait eaten and gone: This was very discouraging. <pb n="172"
                  /> However, I alter'd my Trap, and, not to trouble you
               with Particulars, going one Morning to see my Trap, I found in one of them a large
               old He-Goat, and in one of the other, three Kids, a Male and two Females.</p>
            <p>As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him, he was so fierce I durst not go
               into the Pit to him; that is to say, to go about to bring him away alive, which was
               what I wanted. I could have kill'd him, but that was not my Business, nor would it
               answer my End. So I e'en let him out, and he ran away as if he had been frighted out
               of his Wits: But I had forgot then what I learn'd afterwards, that Hunger will tame a Lyon. If I had let him stay there three or four
               Days without Food, and then have carry'd him some Water to drink, and then a little
               Corn, he would have been as tame as one of the Kids, for they are mighty sagacious
               tractable Creatures where they are well used.</p>
            <p>However, for the present I let him go, knowing no better at that time; then I went to
               the three Kids, and taking them one by one, I tyed them with Strings together, and
               with some Difficulty brought them all home.</p>
            <p>It was a good while before they wou'd feed, but throwing them some sweet Corn, it
               tempted them and they began to be tame; and now I found that if I expected to supply
               my self with Goat-Flesh when I had no Powder or Shot left, breeding some up tame was
               my only way, when perhaps I might have them about my House like a Flock of Sheep.</p>
            <p>But then it presently occurr'd to me, that I must keep the tame from the wild, or
               else they would always run wild when they grew up, and the
               only Way for this was to have some enclosed Piece of <pb n="173"
                  /> Ground, well fenc'd either with Hedge or Pale, to keep
               them in so effectually, that those within might not break out, or those without break
               in.</p>
            <p>This was a great Undertaking for one Pair of Hands, yet as I saw there was an
               absolute Necessity of doing it, my first Piece of Work was
               to find out a proper Piece of Ground, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> where there was likely to be
               Herbage for them to eat, Water for them to drink, and Cover to keep them from the
               Sun.</p>
            <p>Those who understand such Enclosures will think I had very little <ref

                  larger his enclosure is, the harder it will be to catch the goats inside</note>,
               when I shall tell them I began my enclosing of this Piece of Ground in such a manner, that my Hedge or Pale must have been at least two Mile
               about. Nor was the Madness of it so great as to the Compass, for if it was ten Mile
                  about I was like to have time enough to do it in. But I
               did not consider that my Goats would be as wild in so much Compass as if they had had
               the whole Island, and I should have so much Room to chace them in, that I should
               never catch them.</p>
            <p>My Hedge was begun and carry'd on, I believe, about fifty Yards, when this Thought
               occurr'd to me, so I presently stopt short, and for the first beginning I resolv'd to
               enclose a Piece of about 150 Yards in length, and 100 Yards in breadth, which as it
               would maintain as many as I should have in any reasonable time, so as my Flock encreased, I could add more Ground to my Enclosure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" />This was acting with some Prudence, and I went
               to work with Courage. I was about three Months hedging in the first Piece, and till I
               had done it I tether'd the three Kids in the best part of it, and us'd them to feed
               as near me as possible to make them familiar; and very often I would go and carry them some Ears of Barley, or a handful of Rice, and feed
               them out of my Hand; so that after my Enclosure was finished, and I let them loose,
               they would follow me up and down, bleating after me for a handful of Corn.</p>
            <p>This answer'd my End, and in about a Year and half I had a Flock of about twelve
               Goats, Kids and all; and in two Years more I had three and forty, besides several
               that I took and kill'd for my Food. And after that I enclosed five several Pieces of Ground to feed them in, with little Pens to drive
               them into, to take them as I wanted, and Gates out of one Piece of Ground into another.</p>
            <p>But this was not all, for now I not only had Goats Flesh to feed on when I pleas'd,
               but Milk too, a thing which indeed in my beginning I did not so much as think of, and
               which, when it came into my Thoughts, was really an agreeable Surprize. For now I set up my Dairy, and had sometimes a Gallon or two of Milk in a Day, And as Nature, who
               gives Supplies of Food to every Creature, dictates even naturally how to make use of
               it; so I that had never milk'd a Cow, much less a Goat, or seen Butter or Cheese
               made, very readily and handily, tho' after a great many
               Essays and Miscarriages, made me both Butter and Cheese at last, and never wanted it
               afterwards.</p>
            <p>How mercifully can our great Creator treat his Creatures, even in those Conditions in
               which they seem'd to be overwhelm'd in Destruction. How <pb n="175"

            <p>It would have made a Stoick smile to have seen, me and my little Family sit down to
               Dinner; there was my Majesty the Prince and Lord of the whole Island; I had the Lives
               of all my Subjects at my absolute Command. I could hang, draw, give Liberty, and take

               one Side the Table, and one on the other, expecting now and then a Bit from my Hand,
               as a Mark of special Favour.</p>
            <p>But these were not the two Cats which I brought on Shore at first, for they were both
               of them dead, and had been interr'd near my Habitation by my own Hand; but one of
               them having multiply'd by I know not what Kind of Creature, these were two which I
               had preserv'd tame, whereas the rest run wild in the Woods, and became indeed
               troublesom to me at last; for they would often come into my House, and plunder me
               too, till at last I was obliged to shoot them, and did kill a great many; at length
               they left me with this Attendance, and in this plentiful
               Manner I lived; neither could I be said to want any thing
               but Society, and of that in some time after this, I was like
               to have too much.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="176" />I was something impatient, as I have observ'd,
               to have the Use of my Boat; though very loath to run any more Hazards; and therefore
               sometimes I sat contriving Ways to get her about the Island, and at other Times I sat
               my self down contented enough without her. But I had a
               strange Uneasiness in my Mind to go down to the Point of the Island, where, as I have
               said, in my last Ramble, I went up the Hill to see how the Shore lay, and how the
               Current set, that I might see what I had to do: This Inclination encreas'd upon me
               every Day, and at length I resolv'd to travel thither by Land, following the Edge of the Shore, I did so: But had any one in
                  <hi rend="italic">England</hi> been to meet such a Man as I was, it must either have frighted
               them, or rais'd a great deal of Laughter; and as I frequently stood still to look at
               my self, I could not but smile at the Notion of my travelling through
                  <hi rend="italic">Yorkshire</hi> with such an Equipage, and in such a Dress: Be pleas'd to take
               a Scetch of my Figure as follows,</p>
            <p>I had a great high shapeless Cap, made of a Goat's Skin, with a Flap hanging down
               behind, as well to keep the Sun from me, as to shoot the Rain off from running into
               my Neck; nothing being so hurtful in these Climates, as the Rain upon the Flesh under
               the Cloaths.</p>
            <p>I had a short Jacket of Goat-Skin, the Skirts coming down to
               about the middle of my Thighs; and a Pair of open-knee'd Breeches of the same, the
               Breeches were made of the Skin of an old <hi rend="italic">He-goat,</hi> whose Hair hung down such

               have pass'd for frightful.</p>
            <p>But all this is by the by; for as to my Figure, I had so few to observe me, that it
               was of no manner of Consequence; so I say no more to that Part. In this kind of
               Figure I went my new Journey, and was out five or six Days. I travell'd first along
               the <pb n="178" /> Sea Shore, directly to the Place where I
               first brought my Boat to an Anchor, to get up upon the Rocks; and having no Boat now
               to take care of, I went over the Land a nearer Way to the
               same Height that I was upon before, when looking forward to the Point of the Rocks
               which lay out, and which I was oblig'd to double with my Boat, as is said above: I
               was surpriz'd to see the Sea all smooth and quiet, no Ripling, no Motion, no Current,
               any more there than in other Places.</p>
            <p>I was at a strange Loss to understand this, and resolv'd to spend some Time in the
               observing it, to see if nothing from the Sets of the Tide had occasion'd it; but I was presently convinc'd how it was,
                  <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> That the Tide of Ebb setting from the <hi rend="italic">West,</hi> and joyning
               with the Current of Waters from some great River on the Shore, must be the Occasion
               of this Current; and that according as the Wind blew more forcibly from the
                  <hi rend="italic">West,</hi> or from the <hi rend="italic">North,</hi> this Current came nearer, or went
               farther from the Shore; for waiting thereabouts till Evening, I went up to the Rock
               again, and then the Tide of Ebb being made, I plainly saw the Current again as before, only, that it run farther of, being near half a League
               from the Shore; whereas in my Case, it set close upon the Shore, and hurry'd me and
               my <hi rend="italic">Canoe</hi> along with it, which at another Time it would not have done.</p>
            <p>This Observation convinc'd me, That I had nothing to do but
               to observe the Ebbing and the Flowing of the Tide, and I might very easily bring my
               Boat about the Island again: But when I began to think of
               putting it in Practice, I had such a Terror upon my Spirits at the Remembrance of the
               Danger I had been in, that I could not think of it again with any Patience; but on
               the contrary, I took up another Resolution which was more safe, <pb n="179"
                  /> though more laborious; and this was, That I would
               build, or rather make me another <hi rend="italic">Periagau</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Canoe</hi>; and so have one
               for one Side of the Island, and one for the other.</p>
            <p>You are to understand, that now I had, as I may call it, two Plantations in the
               Island; one my little Fortification or Tent, with the Wall about it under the Rock,
               with the Cave behind me, which by this Time I had enlarg'd into several Apartments,
               or Caves, one within another. One of these, which was the dryest, and largest, and
               had a Door out beyond my Wall or Fortification; that is to say, beyond where my Wall
               joyn'd to the Rock, was all fill'd up with the large Earthen Pots, of which I have
               given an Account, and with fourteen or fifteen great Baskets, which would hold five
               or six Bushels each, where I laid up my Stores of Provision, especially my Corn, some
               in the Ear cut off short from the Straw, and the other rubb'd out with my Hand.</p>
            <p>As for my Wall made, <hi rend="italic">as before,</hi> with long Stakes or Piles, those Piles grew
               all like Trees, and were by this Time grown so big, and spread so very much, that
               there was not the least Appearance to any one's View of any Habitation behind
               them.</p>
            <p>Near this Dwelling of mine, but a little farther within the Land, and upon lower
               Ground, lay my two Pieces of Corn-Ground, which I kept duly cultivated and sow'd, and
               which duly yielded me their Harvest in its Season; and whenever I had occasion for
               more Corn, I had more Land adjoyning as fit as that.</p>
            <p>Besides this, I had my Country Seat, and I had now a tollerable Plantation there
               also; for first, I had my little Bower, as I call'd it, which I kept in Repair;
                  <hi rend="italic">that is to say,</hi> I kept the Hedge which circled it in, constantly fitted
               up to its usual Height, <pb n="180" /> the Ladder standing
               always in the Inside; I kept the Trees which at first were no more than my Stakes,
               but were now grown very firm and tall; I kept them always so cut, that they might
               spread and grow thick and wild, and make the more agreeable Shade, which they did
               effectually to my Mind. In the Middle of this I had my Tent always standing, being a piece of a Sail spread over Poles set up for
               that Purpose, and which never wanted any Repair or Renewing; and under this I had
               made me a <ref target="squab_" corresp="squab">Squab</ref><note
                  resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="squab" target="squab_" type="gloss">A

               the Skins of the Creatures I had kill'd, and with other soft
               Things, and a Blanket laid on them, such as belong'd to our Sea-Bedding, which I had
               saved, and a great Watch-Coat to cover me; and here, whenever I had Occasion to be
               absent from my chief Seat, I took up my Country Habitation.</p>
            <p>Adjoyning to this I had my Enclosures for my Cattle, that is to say, my Goats: And as
               I had taken an inconceivable deal of Pains to fence and enclose this Ground, so I was so uneasy to see it kept entire,
               lest the Goats should break thro', that I never left off till with infinite Labour I
               had stuck the Out-side of the Hedge so full of small Stakes, and so near to one
               another, that it was rather a Pale than a Hedge, and there was scarce Room to put a
               Hand thro' between them, which afterwards when those Stakes grew, as they all did in
               the next rainy Season, made the Enclosure strong like a Wall, indeed stronger than
               any Wall.</p>
            <p>This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I spared no Pains to bring to
               pass whatever appear'd necessary for my comfortable Support; for I consider'd the keeping up a Breed of tame
               Creatures thus at my Hand, would be a living Magazine of
               Flesh, Milk, Butter and Cheese, <pb n="181" /> for me as
               long as I liv'd in the Place, if it were to be forty Years; and that keeping them in
               my Reach, depended entirely upon my perfecting my Enclosures
               to such a Degree, that I might be sure of keeping them together; which by this Method
                  indeed I so effectually secur'd, that when these little Stakes began to grow, I had planted them so very thick,
               I was forced to pull some of them up again.</p>
            <p>In this Place also I had my Grapes growing, which I principally depended on for my
               Winter Store of Raisins; and which I never fail'd to preserve very carefully, as the best and most agreeable Dainty of my whole Diet; and
               indeed they were not agreeable only, but physical, wholesome, nourishing, and refreshing to the last Degree.</p>
            <p>As this was also about half Way between my other Habitation,
               and the Place where I had laid up my Boat, I generally stay'd, and lay here in my Way
               thither; for I used frequently to visit my Boat, and I kept all Things about or
               belonging to her in very good Order; sometimes I went out in her to divert my self,
               but no more hazardous Voyages would I go, nor scarce ever above a <ref

               Shore, I was so apprehensive of being hurry'd out of my
               Knowledge again by the Currents, or Winds, or any other Accident. But now I come to a new Scene of my Life.</p>
            <p>It happen'd one Day about Noon going towards my Boat, I was exceedingly surpriz'd
               with the Print of a Man's naked Foot on the Shore, which was very plain to be seen in
               the Sand: I stood like one Thunder-struck, or as if I had seen an Apparition; I
               listen'd, I look'd round me, I could hear nothing, nor see any Thing, I went up to a
               rising Ground to look farther, I went up the Shore and down the Shore, but it was all
               one, I could see no other <pb n="182" /> Impression but that
               one, I went to it again to see if there were any more, and to observe if it might not
               be my Fancy; but there was no Room for that, for there was exactly the very Print of
               a Foot, Toes, Heel, and every Part of a Foot; how it came thither, I knew not, nor
               could in the least imagine. But after innumerable fluttering Thoughts, like a Man
               perfectly confus'd and out of my self, I came Home to my Fortification, not feeling,
               as we say, the Ground I went on, but terrify'd to the last Degree, looking behind me
               at every two or three Steps, mistaking every Bush and Tree, and fancying every Stump at a Distance to be a Man; nor is it
               possible to describe how many various Shapes affrighted
               Imagination represented Things to me in, how many wild Ideas were found every Moment
               in my Fancy, and what strange unaccountable Whimsies came into my Thoughts by the
               Way.</p>
            <p>When I came to my Castle, for so I think I call'd it ever after this, I fled into it
               like one pursued; whether I went over by the Ladder as first contriv'd, or went in at the Hole in the Rock, which I call'd a
               Door, I cannot remember; no, nor could I remember the next Morning, for never
               frighted Hare fled to Cover, or Fox to Earth, with more Terror of Mind than I to this
               Retreat.</p>
            <p>I slept none that Night; the farther I was from the Occasion of my Fright, the
               greater my Apprehensions were, which is something contrary
               to the Nature of such Things, and especially to the usual
               Practice of all Creatures in Fear: But I was so embarrass'd with my own frightful
               Ideas of the Thing, that I form'd nothing but dismal Imaginations to my self, even tho' I was now a great way off of it. Sometimes I fancy'd it
               must be the Devil; and Reason joyn'd in with me upon this
                  Supposition: For how should any other Thing in human <pb n="183" /> Shape come into
               the Place? Where was the Vessel that brought them? What Marks was there of any other
               Footsteps? And how was it possible a Man should come there? But then to think that
                  <hi rend="italic">Satan</hi> should take human Shape upon him in such a Place where there could
               be no manner of Occasion for it, but to leave the Print of his Foot behind him, and
               that even for no Purpose too, for he could not be sure I should see it; this was an
               Amusement the other Way; I consider'd that the Devil might have found out abundance
               of other Ways to have terrify'd me than this of the single Print of a Foot. That as I
               liv'd quite on the other Side of the Island, he would never have been so simple to
               leave a Mark in a Place where 'twas Ten Thousand to one whether I should ever see it or not, and in the Sand too, which the first Surge of the
               Sea upon a high Wind would have defac'd entirely: All this seem'd inconsistent with
               the Thing it self, and with all the Notions we usually entertain of the Subtilty of
               the Devil.</p>
            <p>Abundance of such Things as these assisted to argue me out
               of all Apprehensions of its being the Devil: And I presently concluded then, that it
               must be some more dangerous Creature, (<hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>) That it must be some of the
               Savages of the main Land over-against me, who had wander'd out to Sea in their
                  <hi rend="italic">Canoes</hi>; and either driven by the Currents, or by contrary Winds had <ref

                  >Arrived at</note> the Island; and had been on Shore, but were gone away again to
               Sea, being as loth, perhaps, to have stay'd in this desolate
               Island, as I would have been to have had them.</p>
            <p>While these Reflections were rowling upon my Mind, I was very thankful in my
               Thoughts, that I was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that Time, or that they did
               not see my Boat, by which they would have concluded that some Inhabitants 
               
               <pb n="184" /> had been in the Place, and perhaps have
               search'd farther for me: Then terrible Thoughts rack'd my Imagination about their
               having found my Boat, and that there were People here; and that if so, I should
               certainly have them come again in greater Numbers, and devour me; that if it should
               happen so that they should not find me, yet they would find my Enclosure, destroy all
               my Corn, carry away all my Flock of tame Goats, and I should
                  perish at last for meer Want.</p>
            <p>Thus my Fear banish'd all my religious Hope; all that former Confidence in God which
               was founded upon such wonderful Experience as I had had of his Goodness, now
               vanished, as if he that had fed me by Miracle hitherto, could not preserve by his
               Power the Provision which he had made for me by his Goodness. I reproach'd my self
               with my Easiness, that would not sow any more Corn one Year than would just serve me
               till the next Season, as if no Accident could intervene to prevent my enjoying the
               Crop that was upon the Ground; and this I thought so just a Reproof, that I resolv'd
               for the future to have two or three Years Corn beforehand,
               so that whatever might come, I might not perish for want of Bread.</p>

               differing Springs are the Affections hurry'd about as differing Circumstance present! To Day we love what to Morrow we hate; to Day we seek
               what to Morrow we shun; to Day we desire what to Morrow we
               fear; nay even tremble at the Apprehensions of; this was exemplify'd in me at this
               Time in the most lively Manner imaginable; for I whose only Affliction was, that I
               seem'd banished from human Society, that I was alone, circumscrib'd by the boundless
               Ocean, cut off from Mankind, and condemn'd <pb n="185"
                  /> to what I call'd silent Life; that I was as one who
               Heaven thought not worthy to be number'd among the Living,
               or to appear among the rest of his Creatures; that to have seen one of my own
               Species, would have seem'd to me a Raising me from Death to Life, and the greatest
               Blessing that Heaven it self, next to the supreme Blessing of Salvation, could
               bestow; <hi rend="italic">I say,</hi> that I should now tremble at the very Apprehensions of seeing
               a Man, and was ready to sink into the Ground at but the Shadow or silent Appearance
               of a Man's having set his Foot in the Island.</p>
            <p>Such is the uneven State of human Life: And it afforded me a great many curious
               Speculations afterwards, when I had a little recover'd my
               first Surprize; I consider'd that this was the Station of Life the infinitely wise
               and good Providence of God had determin'd for me, that as I could not foresee what
               the Ends of Divine Wisdom might be in all this, so I was not to dispute his
               Sovereignty, who, as I was his Creature, had an undoubted Right by Creation to govern
               and dispose of me absolutely as he thought fit; and who, as
               I was a Creature who had offended him, had likewise a judicial Right to condemn me to what Punishment he thought fit; and that it was my
               Part to submit to bear his Indignation, because I had sinn'd against him.</p>
            <p>I then reflected that God, who was not only Righteous but Omnipotent, as he had
               thought fit thus to punish and afflict me, so he was able to deliver me; that if he
               did not think fit to do it, 'twas my unquestion'd Duty to resign my self absolutely
               and entirely to his Will; and on the other Hand, it was my Duty also to hope in him,
               pray to him, and quietly to attend the Dictates and Directions of his daily
               Providence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186" />These Thoughts took me up many Hours, Days;
               nay, I may say, Weeks and Months; and one particular Effect
               of my Cogitations on this Occasion, I cannot omit, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> One Morning early,
               lying in my Bed, and fill'd with Thought about my Danger from the Appearance of
               Savages, I found it discompos'd me very much, upon which
               those Words of the Scripture came into my Thoughts, <ref target="psalm50_"
                  corresp="psalm50">Call upon me in the Day of Trouble, and I will deliver, and thou

            </p>
            <p>Upon this, rising chearfully out of my Bed, my Heart was not only comforted, but I
               was guided and encourag'd to pray earnestly to God for Deliverance: When I had done praying, I took up my Bible, and opening it to read, the
               first Words that presented to me, were, <ref target="psalms_" corresp="psalms">Wait
                  on the Lord, and be of good Cheer, and he shall strengthen thy Heart; wait, I say,

            <p>In the middle of these Cogitations, Apprehensions and
               Reflections, it came into my Thought one Day, that all this might be a meer <ref

                  head, a goat's body, and a serpent's tail)</note> of my own; and that this Foot
               might be the Print of my own Foot, when I came on Shore from my Boat: This chear'd me
               up a little too, and I began to perswade my self it was all
               a Delusion; that it was nothing else but my own Foot, and
               why might not I come that way from the Boat, as well as I was going that way to the Boat; again, I consider'd also that I
               could by no Means tell for certain where I had trod, and where I had not; and that if
               at last this was only the Print of my own Foot, I had play'd the Part of those Fools,
               who strive to make stories of Spectres, and Apparitions; and then are frighted at
               them more than any body.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="187" />Now I began to take Courage, and to peep
               abroad again; for I had not stirr'd out of my Castle for three Days and Nights; so
               that I began to starve for Provision; for I had little or nothing within Doors, but
               some Barley Cakes and Water. Then I knew that my Goats wanted to be milk'd too, which
                  usually was my Evening Diversion; and the poor Creatures
               were in great Pain and Inconvenience for want of it; and indeed, it almost spoil'd
               some of them, and almost dry'd up their Milk.</p>
            <p>Heartning my self therefore with the Belief that this was nothing but the Print of
               one of my own Feet, and so I might be truly said to <ref target="start_"

                  target="start_" type="gloss">Startle</note> at my own Shadow, I began to go abroad
               again, and went to my Country House, to milk my Flock; but to see with what Fear I
               went forward, how often I look'd behind me, how I was ready every now and then to lay
               down my Basket, and run for my Life, it would have made any one have thought I was
                  haunted with an evil Conscience, or that I had been
                  lately most terribly frighted, and so indeed I had.</p>
            <p>However, as I went down thus two or three Days, and having seen nothing, I began to
               be a little bolder; and to think there was really nothing in
               it, but my own Imagination: But I cou'd not perswade my self
               fully of this, till I should go down to the Shore again, and see this Print of a
               Foot, and measure it by my own, and see if there was any Similitude or Fitness, that I might be assur'd it was my own Foot: But when I came to
               the Place, <hi rend="italic">First,</hi> It appear'd evidently to me, that when I laid up my Boat,
               I could not possibly be on Shore any where there about. <hi rend="italic">Secondly,</hi> When I
               came to measure the Mark with my own Foot, I found my Foot
               not so large by a great deal; both these Things fill'd my Head with new Imaginations,
               and gave me <ref target="humors2_" corresp="humors2">the Vapours</ref><note

                  illness.</note> again, to the highest Degree; so that I <pb n="188"
                  /> shook with cold, like one in an Ague: And I went Home
               again, fill'd with the Belief that some Man or Men had been on Shore there; or in
               short, that the Island was inhabited, and I might be surpriz'd before I was aware; and what course to take for my Security I
               knew not.</p>
            <p>O what ridiculous Resolution Men take, when possess'd with Fear! It deprives them of
               the Use of those Means which Reason offers for their Relief. The first Thing I
               propos'd to my self, was, to throw down my Enclosures, and turn all my tame Cattle
               wild into the Woods, that the Enemy might not find them; and then frequent the Island
               in Prospect of the same, or the like Booty: Then to the
               simple Thing of Digging up my two Corn Fields, that they might not find such a Grain
               there, and still be prompted to frequent the Island; then to demolish my Bower, and Tent, that they might not see any
               Vestiges of Habitation, and be prompted to look farther, in order to find out the
               Persons inhabiting.</p>
            <p>These were the Subject of the first Night's Cogitation,
               after I was come Home again, while the Apprehensions which had so over-run my Mind
               were fresh upon me, and my Head was full of Vapours, as
               above: Thus Fear of Danger is ten thousand Times more
               terrifying than Danger it self, when apparent to the Eyes; and we find the Burthen of Anxiety greater by much, than the Evil which we are
               anxious about; and which was worse than all this, I had not that Relief in this
               Trouble from the Resignation I used to practise, that I hop'd to have. I look'd, I
               thought, like <ref target="philistines_" corresp="philistines">Saul,</ref> who
               complain'd not only that the <hi rend="italic">Philistines</hi> were upon him; but that God had

                  target="philistines_" type="gloss">Saul, the first king of the Israelites, summons
                  the spirit of the prophet Samuel and tells him, "I am sore distressed; for the

                  more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams" (1 Samuel 28:15).</note>; for I did not
               now take due Ways to compose my Mind, by crying to God in my Distress, and resting
               upon his Providence, <pb n="189" />
               as I had done before, for my Defence and Deliverance; which if I had done, I had, at
               least, been more cheerfully supported under this new Surprise, and perhaps carry'd through it with more Resolution.</p>
            <p>This Confusion of my Thoughts kept me waking all Night; but in the Morning I fell
               asleep, and having by the Amusement of my Mind, been, as it were, tyr'd, and my
               Spirits exhausted; I slept very soundly, and wak'd much
               better compos'd than I had ever been before; and now I began to think sedately; and
               upon the utmost Debate with my self, I concluded, That this Island, which was so
               exceeding pleasant, fruitful, and no farther from the main Land than as I had seen,
               was not so entirely abandon'd as I might imagine: That
               altho' there were no stated Inhabitants who liv'd on the Spot; yet that there might
               sometimes come Boats off from the Shore, who either with Design, or perhaps never,
               but when they were driven by cross Winds, might come to this Place.</p>
            <p>That I had liv'd here fifteen Years now, and had not met with the least Shadow or
               Figure of any People yet; and that if at any Time they should be driven here, it was
               probable they went away again as soon as ever they could, seeing they had never
               thought fit to fix there upon any Occasion, to this Time.</p>
            <p>That the most I cou'd suggest any Danger from, was, from any such casual accidental
               Landing of straggling People from the Main, who, as it was likely if they were driven
               hither, were here against their Wills; so they made no stay here, but went off again
               with all possible Speed, seldom staying one Night on Shore, least they should not
               have the Help of the Tides, and Day-light back again; and that therefore I had
               nothing to do but to consider <pb n="190" /> of some safe
               Retreat, in Case I should see any Savages land upon the
               Spot.</p>
            <p>Now I began sorely to repent, that I had dug my Cave so large, as to bring a Door
               through again, which Door, as I said, came out beyond where
               my Fortification joyn'd to the Rock; upon maturely considering this therefore, I
               resolv'd to draw me a second Fortification, in the same Manner of a Semicircle, at a Distance from my Wall, just where I had planted a double
               Row of Trees, about twelve Years before, of which I made mention: These Trees having been planted so thick before, they wanted but a few Piles
               to be driven between them, that they should be thicker, and stronger, and my Wall
               would be soon finish'd.</p>
            <p>So that I had now a double Wall, and my outer Wall was thickned with Pieces of
               Timber, old Cables, and every Thing I could think of, to
               make it strong; having in it seven little Holes, about as big as I might put my Arm
               out at: In the In-side of this, I thickned my Wall to above ten Foot thick, with
               continual bringing Earth out of my Cave, and laying it at the Foot of the Wall, and
               walking upon it; and through the seven Holes, I contriv'd to plant the Musquets, of
               which I took Notice, that I got seven on Shore out of the Ship; these, I say, I
               planted like my Cannon, and fitted them into Frames that held them like a Carriage,
               that so I could fire all the seven Guns in two Minutes Time:
               This Wall I was many a weary Month a finishing, and yet never thought my self safe
               till it was done.</p>
            <p>When this was done, I stuck all the Ground without my Wall, for a great way every
               way, as full with Stakes or Sticks of the <ref target="osier_" corresp="osier"

               to grow, as they could well stand; insomuch, that I believe I might set in near <pb

               large Space between them and my Wall, that I might have room to see an Enemy, and
               they might have no shelter from the young Trees, if they attempted to approach my
               outer Wall.</p>
            <p>Thus in two Years Time I had a thick Grove and in five or six Years Time I had a Wood
               before my Dwelling, growing so monstrous thick and strong, that it was indeed
               perfectly impassable; and no Men of what kind soever, would ever imagine that there was any Thing beyond it, much less a
               Habitation: As for the Way which I propos'd to my self to go in and out, for I left
               no Avenue; it was by setting two Ladders, one to a Part of the Rock which was low,
               and then broke in, and left room to place another Ladder upon that; so when the two
               Ladders were taken down, no Man living could come down to me without mischieving
                  himself; and if they had come down, they were still on
               the Out-side of my outer Wall.</p>
            <p>Thus I took all the Measures humane Prudence could suggest for my own Preservation;
               and it will be seen at length, that they were not altogether without just Reason;
               though I foresaw nothing at that Time, more than my meer Fear suggested to me.</p>

            <p>While this was doing, I was not altogether Careless of my
               other Affairs; for I had a great Concern upon me, for my little Herd of Goats; they
               were not only a present Supply to me upon every Occasion,
               and began to be sufficient to me, without the Expence of Powder and Shot; but also
               without the Fatigue of Hunting after the wild Ones, and I was loth to lose the
               Advantage of them, and to have them all to nurse up over again.</p>
            <p>To this Purpose, after long Consideration, I could think of but two Ways to preserve
               them; <pb n="192" /> one was to find another convenient
               Place to dig a a Cave Under-ground, and to drive them into it every Night; and the
               other was to enclose two or three little Bits of Land, remote from one another and as
               much conceal'd as I could, where I might keep about half a Dozen young Goats in each
               Place: So that if any Disaster happen'd to the Flock in general, I might be able to
               raise them again with little Trouble and Time: And this,
               tho' it would require a great deal of Time and Labour, I
               thought was the most rational Design.</p>
            <p>Accordingly I spent some Time to find out the most retir'd Parts of the Island; and I
               pitch'd upon one which was as private indeed as my Heart
               could wish for; it was a little damp Piece of Ground in the Middle of the hollow and
               thick Woods, where, as is observ'd, I almost lost my self once before, endeavouring to come back that Way from the Eastern
               Part of the Island: Here I found a clear Piece of Land near three Acres, so
                  surrounded with Woods, that it was almost an Enclosure by
               Nature, at least it did not want near so much Labour to make
               it so, as the other Pieces of Ground I had work'd so hard at.</p>
            <p>I immediately went to Work with this Piece of Ground, and in less than a Month's
               Time, I had so fenc'd it round, that my Flock or Herd, call it which you please, who
               were not so wild now as at first they might be supposed to be, were well enough secur'd in it. So, without any farther Delay, I removed ten young She-Goats and two He-Goats to this
               Piece; and when they were there, I continued to perfect the Fence till I had made it
               as secure as the other, which, however, I did at more Leisure, and it took me up more
               Time by a great deal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="193" />All this Labour I was at the Expence of,
               purely from my Apprehensions on the Account of the Print of a Man's Foot which I had
               seen; for as yet I never saw any human Creature come near the Island, and I had now
               liv'd two Years under these Uneasinesses, which indeed made
               my Life much less comfortable than it was before; as may well be imagin'd by any who
               know what it is to live in the constant Snare of <hi rend="italic">the Fear of Man</hi>; and this I
               must observe with Grief too, that the Discomposure of my
               Mind had too great Impressions also upon the religious Part
               of my Thoughts, for the Dread and Terror of falling into the Hands of Savages and Canibals, lay so upon my Spirits, that I seldom
               found my self in a due Temper for <ref target="supplication_" corresp="supplication"
                     >Application to my Maker</ref><note

                  type="gloss">Prayer or supplication</note>, at least not with the sedate Calmness
               and Resignation of Soul which I was wont to do; I rather pray'd to God as under great
               Affliction and Pressure of Mind, surrounded with Danger, and in Expectation every
               Night of being murther'd and devour'd before Morning; and I must testify from my
               Experience that a <ref target="temper_" corresp="temper">Temper</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="temper" target="temper_"
                  type="gloss">Temperament</note> of Peace, Thankfulness, Love and Affection, is
               much more the proper Frame for Prayer than that of Terror and Discomposure; and that
               under the Dread of Mischief impending, a Man is no more fit for a comforting
               Performance of the Duty of praying to God, than he is for Repentance on a sick Bed:
               For these Discomposures affect the Mind as the others do the Body; and the
               Discomposure of the Mind must necessarily be as great a Disability as that of the Body, and much greater, Praying to God
               being properly an Act of the Mind, not of the Body.</p>
            <p>But to go on; After I had thus secur'd one Part of my little living Stock, I went
               about the whole Island, searching for another private Place, to make <pb n="194"
                  /> such another Deposit; when wandring more to the
                  <hi rend="italic">West</hi> Point of the Island, than I had ever done yet, and looking out to
               Sea, I thought I saw a Boat upon the Sea, at a great
               Distance; I had found a Prospective <ref target="glass_"
                  corresp="glass">Glass</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="glass"
                  target="glass_" type="gloss">A spyglass, or sailor's telescope</note>, or two, in
               one of the Seamen's Chests, which I sav'd out of our Ship; but I had it not about me,
               and this was so remote, that I could not tell what to make of it; though I look'd at
               it till my Eyes were not able to hold to look any longer; whether it was a Boat, or
               not, I do not know; but as I descended from the Hill, I could see no more of it, so I
               gave it over; only I resolv'd to go no more out without a Prospective Glass in my
               Pocket.</p>
            <p>When I was come down the Hill, to the End of the Island, where indeed I had never
               been before, I was presently convinc'd, that the seeing the Print of a Man's Foot,
               was not such a strange Thing in the Island as I imagin'd; and but that it was a special Providence that I was cast upon the Side of the Island,
               where the Savages never came: I should easily have known,
               that nothing was more frequent than for the <hi rend="italic">Canoes</hi> from the Main, when they
                  happen'd to be a little too far out at Sea, to shoot over
               to that Side of the Island for Harbour; likewise as they often met, and fought in
               their <hi rend="italic">Canoes,</hi> the Victors having taken any
               Prisoners, would bring them over to this Shore, where according to their dreadful Customs, being all <hi rend="italic">Canibals,</hi> they would kill
               and eat them; of which hereafter.</p>
            <p>When I was come down the Hill, to the Shore, as I said above, being the <hi rend="italic">S.
                  W.</hi> Point of the Island, I was perfectly confounded
               and amaz'd; nor is it possible for me to express the Horror of my Mind, at seeing the
               Shore spread with Skulls, Hands, Feet, and other Bones of humane Bodies; and
               particularly I observ'd a Place where there had <pb n="195" facs="tcp:0653600100:201"
               /> been a Fire made, and a Circle dug in the Earth, like a <ref target="cockpit_"

               suppos'd the Savage Wretches had sat down to their inhumane Feastings upon the Bodies of their Fellow-Creatures.</p>
            <p>I was so astonish'd with the Sight of these Things, that I entertain'd no Notions of
               any Danger to my self from it for a long while; All my Apprehensions were bury'd in
               the Thoughts of such a Pitch of inhuman, hellish Brutality,
               and the Horror of the Degeneracy of Humane Nature; which
               though I had heard of often, yet I never had so near a View of before; in short, I
               turn'd away my Face from the horrid Spectacle; my Stomach grew sick, and I was just
               at the Point of Fainting, when Nature discharg'd the
               Disorder from my Stomach; and having vomited with an
               uncommon Violence, I was a little reliev'd; but cou'd not bear to stay in the Place a
               Moment; so I gat me up the Hill again, with all the Speed I cou'd, and walk'd on
               towards my own Habitation.</p>
            <p>When I came a little out of that Part of the Island, I stood
               still a while as amaz'd; and then recovering my self, I
               look'd up with the utmost Affection of my Soul, and with a
               Flood of Tears in my Eyes, gave God Thanks that had cast my first Lot in a Part of
               the World, where I was <ref target="distinguished_" corresp="distinguished_"
                  >distinguish'd</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="distinguished"
                  target="distinguished_" type="gloss">Physically separated</note> from such
               dreadful Creatures as these; and that though I had esteem'd my present Condition very
               miserable, had yet given me so many Comforts in it, that I had still more to give
               Thanks for than to complain of; and this above all, that I had even in this miserable
               Condition been comforted with the Knowledge of himself, and the Hope of his Blessing,
               which was a Felicity more than sufficiently equivalent to
               all the Misery which I had suffer'd, or could suffer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="196" />In this Frame of Thankfulness, I went Home to
               my Castle, and began to be much easier now, as to the Safety of my Circumstances,
               than ever I was before; for I observ'd, that these Wretches never came to this Island
               in search of what they could get; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not expecting any Thing here; and having often, no doubt, been up
               in the cover'd woody Part of it, without finding any Thing to their Purpose. I knew I
               had been here now almost eighteen Years, and never saw the least Foot-steps of Humane
               Creature there before; and I might be here eighteen more, as entirely conceal'd as I was now, if I did not discover my self
               to them, which I had no manner of Occasion to do, it being
               my only Business to keep my self entirely conceal'd where I was, unless I found a
               better sort of Creatures than <hi rend="italic">Canibals</hi> to make my self known to.</p>
            <p>Yet I entertain'd such an Abhorrence of the Savage Wretches, that I have been
               speaking of, and of the wretched inhuman Custom of their devouring and eating one
               another up, that I continu'd pensive, and sad, and kept close within my own Circle
               for almost two Years after this: When I say my own Circle, I mean by it, my three
               Plantations, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> my Castle, my Country Seat, which I call'd my Bower, and
               my Enclosure in the Woods; nor did I look after this for any other Use than as an
               Enclosure for my Goats; for the Aversion which Nature gave me to these hellish
               Wretches, was such, that I was fearful of seeing them, as of seeing the Devil
               himself; nor did I so much as go to look after my Boat, in all this Time; but began
               rather to think of making me another; for I cou'd not think of ever making any more
               Attempts, to bring the other Boat round the Island to me, <ref target="lest_"
                  corresp="lest">least</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="lest"

               at Sea, <pb n="197" /> in which, if I had happen'd to have
               fallen into their Hands, I knew what would have been my Lot.</p>
            <p>Time however, and the Satisfaction I had, that I was in no Danger of being discover'd
               by these People, began to wear off my Uneasiness about them; and I began to live just
               in the same compos'd Manner as before; only with this Difference, that I used more
               Caution, and kept my Eyes more about me than I did before,
               least I should happen to be seen by any of them; and particularly, I was more
               cautious of firing my Gun, least any of them being on the Island, should happen to
               hear of it; and it was therefore a very good Providence to me, that I had furnish'd
               my self with a tame Breed of Goats, that I needed not hunt any more about the Woods,
               or shoot at them; and if I did catch any of them after this, it was by Traps, and
               Snares, as I had done before; so that for two Years after this, I believe I never
               fir'd my Gun once of, though I never went out without it; and which was more, as I
               had sav'd three Pistols out of the Ship, I always carry'd
               them out with me, or at least two of them, sticking them in my Goat-skin Belt; also I
               furbish'd up one of the great <ref target="cutlass_" corresp="cutlass"

               so that I was now a most formidable Fellow to look at, when I went abroad, if you add
               to the former Description of my self, the Particular of two Pistols, and a great
               broad Sword, hanging at my Side in a Belt, but without a Scabbard.</p>
            <p>Things going on thus, as I have said, for some Time; I seem'd, excepting these
               Cautions, to be reduc'd to my former calm, sedate Way of Living, all these Things
               tended to shewing me more and more how far my Condition was from being miserable, compar'd to some others; nay, to many other Particulars of Life, which it might have pleased, <pb n="198" /> God to have
               made my Lot. It put me upon reflecting, How little repining there would be among Mankind, at any Condition of Life, if People would rather compare their Condition with those that are
               worse, in order to be thankful, than be always comparing them with those which are
               better, to assist their Murmurings and Complainings.</p>
            <p>As in my present Condition there were not really many Things which I wanted; so
               indeed I thought that the Frights I had been in about these Savage Wretches, and the
               Concern I had been in for my own Preservation, had taken off the Edge of my Invention for my own Conveniences; and I had dropp'd a good

                  >Plan or scheme</note>, which I had once bent my Thoughts too much upon; and that
               was, to try if I could not make some of my Barley into Malt, and then try to brew my
               self some Beer: This was really a whimsical Thought, and I
               reprov'd my self often for the Simplicity of it; for I presently saw there would be
               the want of several Things necessary to the making my Beer, that it would be
               impossible for me to supply; as First, Casks to preserve it in, which was a Thing,
               that as I have observ'd already, I cou'd never compass; no,
               though I spent not many Days, but Weeks, nay, Months in attempting it, but to no purpose. In the next Place, I had no <ref

               it boil; and yet all these Things, notwithstanding, I verily believe, had not these
               Things interven'd, I mean the Frights and Terrors I was in about the Savages, I <ref

               seldom gave any Thing over without accomplishing it, when I
               once had it in my Head enough to begin it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="199" />But my Invention now run quite another Way;
               for Night and Day, I could think of nothing but how I might destroy some of these
               Monsters in their cruel bloody Entertainment, and if possible, save the Victim they
               should bring hither to destroy. It would take up a larger Volume than this whole Work
               is intended to be, to set down all the Contrivances I
               hatch'd, or rather brooded upon in my Thought, for the destroying these Creatures, or
               at least frighting them, so as to prevent their coming hither any more; but all was
               abortive, nothing could be possible to take effect, unless I was to be there to do it
               my self; and what could one Man do among them, when perhaps there might be twenty or
               thirty of them together, with their Darts, or their Bows and Arrows, with which they
               could shoot as true to a Mark, as I could with my Gun?</p>
            <p>Sometimes I contriv'd to dig a Hole under the Place where they made their Fire, and
               put in five or six Pound of Gun-powder, which when they kindled their Fire, would
               consequently take Fire, and blow up all that was near it; but as in the first Place I
               should be very loth to wast so much Powder upon them, my Store being now within the
                  Quantity of one Barrel; so neither could I be sure of its
               going off, at any certain Time; when it might surprise them,
               and at best, that it would do little more than just blow the Fire about their Ears
               and fright them, but not sufficient to make them forsake the Place; so I laid it
               aside, and then propos'd, that I would place my self in Ambush, in some convenient Place, with my three Guns, all double loaded; and in
               the middle of their bloody Ceremony, let fly at them, when I
               should be sure to kill or wound perhaps two or three at every shoot; and then falling
               in upon them with my three Pistols, <pb n="200" /> and my
               Sword, I made no doubt, but that if there was twenty I should kill them all: This
               Fancy pleas'd my Thoughts for some Weeks, and I was so full of it, that I often
               dream'd of it; and sometimes that I was just going to let fly at them in my
               Sleep.</p>
            <p>I went so far with it in my Imagination, that I employ'd my self several Days to find
               out proper Places to put my self in <ref target="ambuscade_" corresp="ambuscade"
                  >Ambuscade</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="ambuscade"
                  target="ambuscade_" type="gloss">Ambush</note>, as I said, to watch for them; and
               I went frequently to the Place it self, which was now grown more familiar to me; and
               especially while my Mind was thus fill'd with Thoughts of Revenge, and of a bloody
                  putting twenty or thirty of them to the Sword, as I may
               call it; the Horror I had at the Place, and at the <ref target="signal_"

                  Crusoe found on the beach</note> of the barbarous Wretches devouring one another, abated my Malice.</p>
            <p>Well, at length I found a Place in the Side of the Hill, where I was satisfy'd I
               might securely wait, till I saw any of their Boats coming, and might then, even
               before they would be ready to come on Shore, convey my self unseen into Thickets of
               Trees, in one of which there was a Hollow large enough to conceal me entirely; and
               were I might sit, and observe all their bloody Doings, and take my full aim at their
               Heads, when they were so close together, as that it would be next to impossible that I should miss my Shoot, or that I could fail
               wounding three or four of them at the first Shoot.</p>
            <p>In this Place then I resolv'd to fix my Design, and accordingly I prepar'd two
               Muskets, and my ordinary Fowling Piece. The two Muskets I loaded with a <ref

                  /> Posture, well provided with Ammunition for a second and third Charge, I prepar'd my self for my
               Expedition.</p>
            <p>After I had thus laid the Scheme of my Design, and in my Imagination put it in
               Practice, I continually made my Tour every Morning up to the
               Top of the Hill, which was from my Castle, as I call'd it, about three Miles, or
               more, to see if I cou'd observe any Boats upon the Sea, coming near the Island, or
               standing over towards it; but I began to tire of this hard
               Duty, after I had for two or three Months constantly kept my Watch; but came always
               back without any Discovery, there having not in all that Time been the least Appearance, not only on, or near the Shore; but not on the whole
               Ocean, so far as my Eyes or <ref target="glasses_" corresp="glasses"

                  target="glasses_" type="gloss">Spyglasses</note> could reach every Way.</p>
            <p>As long as I kept up my daily Tour to the Hill, to look out; so long also I kept up
               the Vigour of my Design, and my Spirits seem'd to be all the while in a suitable
               Form, for so outragious an Execution as the killing twenty
               or thirty naked Savages, for an Offence which I had not at all entred into a
               Discussion of in my Thoughts, any farther than my Passions were at first fir'd by the
               Horror I conceiv'd at the unnatural Custom of that People of the Country, who it seems had been suffer'd by Providence in his
               wise <ref target="disposition_" corresp="disposition">Disposition</ref><note
                  resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="disposition" target="disposition_"
                  type="gloss">Arrangement or organization; setting forth</note> of the World, to
               have no other Guide than that of their own abominable and
               vitiated Passions; and consequently were left, and perhaps had been so for some Ages,
               to act such horrid Things, and receive such dreadful Customs, as nothing but Nature entirely abandon'd of Heaven, and acted by some
               hellish Degeneracy, could have run them into: But now, when as I have said, I began
               to be weary of the fruitless Excursion, which I had made so
               long, and so far, every <pb n="202"
                  /> Morning in vain, so my Opinion of the Action it self
               began to alter, and I began with cooler and calmer Thoughts to consider what it was I
               was going to engage in. What Authority, or Call I had, to
               pretend to be Judge and Executioner upon these Men as Criminals, whom Heaven had
               thought fit for so many Ages to suffer unpunish'd, to go on, and to be as it were,
               the Executioners of his Judgments one upon another. How far
               these People were Offenders against me, and what Right I had to engage in the Quarrel
               of that Blood, which they shed promiscuously one upon another. I debated this very
               often with my self thus; How do I know what God himself judges in this particular
               Case; it is certain these People either do not commit this as a Crime; it is not
               against their own Consciences reproving, or their Light reproaching them. They do not
               know it be an Offence, and then commit it in Defiance of Divine Justice, as we do in
               almost all the Sins we commit. They think it no more a Crime to kill a Captive taken
               in War, than we do to kill an Ox; nor to eat humane Flesh, than we do to eat
               Mutton.</p>
            <p>When I had consider'd this a little, it follow'd necessarily, that I was certainly in
               the Wrong in it, that these People were not Murtherers in the Sense that I had before
               condemn'd them, in my Thoughts; any more than those Christians were Murtherers, who
               often put to Death the Prisoners taken in Battle; or more frequently, upon many
               Occasions, put whole Troops of Men to the Sword, without giving Quarter, though they
               threw down their Arms and submitted.</p>
            <p>In the next Place it occurr'd to me, that albeit the Usage they thus gave one
               another, was thus brutish and inhuman; yet it was really nothing to me: These People
               had done me no Injury. That if they <pb n="203" /> attempted
               me, or I saw it necessary for my immediate Preservation to
               fall upon them, something might be said for it; but that as I was yet out of their
               Power, and they had really no Knowledge of me, and consequently no Design upon me;
               and therefore it could not be just for me to fall upon them. That this would justify
               the Conduct of the <hi rend="italic">Spaniards</hi> in all their Barbarities practis'd in <hi rend="italic">America,</hi> and where they destroy'd Millions of these
               People, who however they were Idolaters and Barbarians, and
               had several bloody and barbarous Rites in their Customs, such as sacrificing human
               Bodies to their Idols, were yet, as to the <hi rend="italic">Spaniards,</hi> very innocent People;
               and that the rooting them out of the Country, is spoken of with the utmost Abhorrence
               and Detestation, by even the <hi rend="italic">Spaniards</hi> themselves, at this Time; and by all
               other Christian Nations of <hi rend="italic">Europe,</hi> as a meer
               Butchery, a bloody and unnatural Piece of Cruelty,
               unjustifiable either to God or Man; and such, as for which
               the very Name of a <hi rend="italic">Spaniard</hi> is reckon'd to be
               frightful and terrible to all People of Humanity, or of Christian Compassion: As if the Kingdom of <hi rend="italic">Spain</hi> were particularly Eminent for
               the Product of a Race of Men, who were without Principles of Tenderness, or the
               common Bowels of Pity to the Miserable, which is reckon'd to be a Mark of generous
                  Temper in the Mind.</p>
            <p>These Considerations really put me to a Pause, and to a kind of a Full-stop; and I
               began by little and little to be off of my Design, and to conclude, I had taken wrong
               Measures in my Resolutions to attack the Savages; that it was not my Business to
               meddle with them, unless they first attack'd me, and this it was my Business if
               possible to prevent; but that if I were discover'd, and attack'd, then I knew my
               Duty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="204" />On the other hand, I argu'd with my self, That
               this really was the way not to deliver my self, but entirely to ruin and destroy my
               self; for unless I was sure to kill every one that not only should be on Shore at
               that Time, but that should ever come on Shore afterwards, if but one of them escap'd,
               to tell their Country People what had happen'd, they would come over again by
               Thousands to revenge the Death of their Fellows, and I
               should only bring upon my self a certain Destruction, which at present I had no
               manner of occasion for.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole I concluded, That neither in Principle or in Policy, I ought one way
               or other to concern my self in this Affair. That my Business was by all possible
               Means to conceal my self from them, and not to leave the least Signal to them to
               guess by, that there were any living Creatures upon the
               Island; I mean of humane Shape.</p>
            <p>Religion joyn'd in with this Prudential, and I was convinc'd now many Ways, that I
               was perfectly out of my Duty, when I was laying all my
               bloody Schemes for the Destruction of innocent Creatures, I mean innocent as to me:
               As to the Crimes they were guilty of towards one another, I had nothing to do with
               them; they were National, and I ought to leave them to the
               Justice of God, who is the Governour of Nations, and knows how by National
               Punishments to make a just Retribution for National Offences; and to bring publick
               Judgments upon those who offend in a publick Manner, by such
               Ways as best pleases him.</p>
            <p>This appear'd so clear to me now, that nothing was a greater Satisfaction to me, than
               that I had not been suffer'd to do a Thing which I now saw so much Reason to believe
               would have been no less a Sin, than that of wilful Murther, if I had committed <pb n="205" /> it; and I
               gave most humble Thanks on my Knees to God, that had thus deliver'd me from
               Blood-Guiltiness; beseeching him to grant me the Protection of his Providence, that I
               might not fall into the Hands of the Barbarians; or that I might not lay my Hands
               upon them, unless I had a more clear Call from Heaven to do it, in Defence of my own
               Life.</p>
            <p>In this Disposition I continu'd, for near a Year after this; and so far was I from
               desiring an Occasion for falling upon these Wretches, that
               in all that Time, I never once went up the Hill to see whether there were any of them
               in Sight, or to know whether any of them had been on Shore there, or not, that I
               might not be tempted to renew any of my Contrivances against
               them, or be provok'd by any Advantage which might present it self, to fall upon them;
               only this I did, I went and remov'd my Boat, which I had on the other Side the
               Island, and carry'd it down to the <hi rend="italic">East</hi> End of the whole Island, where I ran
               it into a little Cove which I found under some high Rocks, and where I knew, by
               Reason of the Currents, the Savages durst not, at least would not come with their
               Boats, upon any Account whatsoever.</p>
            <p>With my Boat I carry'd away every Thing that I had left there belonging to her,
               though not necessary for the bare going thither,
                  <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> A Mast and Sail which I had made for her, and a Thing like an
               Anchor, but indeed which could not be call'd either Anchor or Grapling; however, it
               was the best I could make of its kind: All these I remov'd,
               that there might not be the least Shadow of any Discovery, or any Appearance of any
               Boat, or of any human Habitation upon the Island.</p>
            <p>Besides this, I kept my self, as I said, more retir'd than
               ever, and seldom went from my Cell, other <pb n="206"
                  /> than upon my constant Employment, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> To
               milk my She-goats, and manage my little Flock, in the Wood; which as it was quite on
               the other Part of the Island, was quite out of Danger; for certain it is, that these
               Savage People who sometimes haunted this Island, never came with any Thoughts of
               finding any Thing here; and consequently never wandred off from the Coast; and I
               doubt not, but they might have been several Times on Shore, after my Apprehensions of
               them had made me cautious as well as before; and indeed, I look'd back with some
               Horror upon the Thoughts of what my Condition would have
               been, if I had <ref target="chopped_" corresp="chopped">chop'd upon them</ref><note
                  resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="chopped" target="chopped_" type="gloss"
                  >Happened upon them accidentally</note>, and been discover'd before that, when
               naked and unarm'd, except with one Gun, and that loaden often only with small Shot, I walk'd every where peeping, and peeping about the
               Island, to see what I could get; what a Surprise should I have been in, if when I
               discover'd the Print of a Man's Foot, I had instead of that, seen fifteen or twenty
               Savages, and found them pursuing me, and by the Swiftness of their Running, no
               Possibility of my escaping them.</p>
            <p>The Thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very Soul within me, and distress'd my Mind so
               much, that I could not soon recover it, to think what I should have done, and how I
               not only should not have been able to resist them, but even should not have had
               Presence of Mind enough to do what I might have done; much less, what now after so
               much Consideration and Preparation I might be able to do:
               Indeed, after serious thinking of these Things, I should be very Melancholly, and
                  sometimes it would last a great while; but I resolv'd it
               at last all into Thankfulness to that Providence, which had deliver'd me from so many
               unseen Dangers, and had kept me from those Mischiefs which
                  <pb n="207" /> I could no way have been the Agent in
               delivering my self from; because I had not the least Notion of any such Thing
               depending, or the least Supposition of it being possible.</p>
            <p>This renew'd a Contemplation, which often had come to my Thoughts in former Time,
               when first I began to see the merciful Dispositions of Heaven, in the Dangers we run
               through in this Life. How wonderfully we are deliver'd, when we know nothing of it. How when we are in (a <hi rend="italic">Quandary,</hi> as we
               call it) a Doubt or Hesitation, whether to go this Way, or that Way, a secret Hint
               shall direct us this Way, when we intended to go that Way; nay, when Sense, our own
               Inclination, and perhaps Business has call'd to go the other Way, yet a strange
               Impression upon the Mind, from we know not what Springs, and by we know not what
               Power, shall over-rule us to go this Way; and it shall
               afterwards appear, that had we gone that Way which we should have gone, and even to
               our Imagination ought to have gone, we should have been ruin'd and lost: Upon these,
               and many like Reflections, I afterwards made it a certain
               Rule with me, That whenever I found those secret Hints, or
               pressings of my Mind, to doing, or not doing any Thing that presented; or to going this Way, or that Way, I never fail'd to
               obey the secret Dictate; though I knew no other Reason for it, than that such a
               Pressure, or such a Hint hung upon my Mind: I could give many Examples of the Success of this Conduct in the Course of my Life; but more
               especially in the latter Part of my inhabiting this unhappy
               Island; besides many Occasions which it is very likely I
               might have taken Notice of, if I had seen with the same Eyes then, that I saw with
               now: But 'tis never too late to be wise; and I cannot but advise all considering Men, whose Lives are attended with such extraordinary <pb n="208" />
               Incidents as mine, or even though not so extraordinary, not to slight such secret
                  Intimations of Providence, let them come from what
                  invisible Intelligence they will, that I shall not
               discuss, and perhaps cannot account for; but certainly they are a Proof of the <ref

               Occasion to give some very remarkable Instances, in the Remainder of my solitary Residence in this dismal Place.</p>
            <p>I believe the Reader of this will not think strange, if I confess that these
               Anxieties, these constant Dangers I liv'd in, and the
               Concern that was now upon me, put an End to all Invention, and to all the
               Contrivances that I had laid for my future Accommodations and Conveniencies. I had
               the Care of my Safety more now upon my Hands, than that of my Food. I car'd not to
               drive a Nail, or chop a Stick of Wood now, for fear the Noise I should make should be
               heard; much less would I fire a Gun, for the same Reason; and above all, I was
               intollerably uneasy at making any Fire, least the Smoke which is visible at a great
               Distance in the Day should betray me; and for this Reason I remov'd that Part of my Business which requir'd Fire; such as burning of Pots, and
               Pipes, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> into my new Apartment in the Woods, where after I had been
               some time, I found to my unspeakable Consolation, a meer
               natural Cave in the Earth, which went in a vast way, and where, I dare say, no Savage, had he been at the Mouth of it, would be so hardy as
               to venture in, nor indeed, would any Man else; but one who like me, wanted nothing so
               much as a safe Retreat.</p>

               <pb n="209" />The Mouth of this Hollow, was at the Bottom of

               to ascribe all such Things now to Providence) I was cutting down some thick Branches
               of Trees, to make Charcoal; and before I go on, I must observe the Reason of my
               making this Charcoal; which was thus:</p>
            <p>I was afraid of making a Smoke about my Habitation, as I
               said before; and yet I could not live there without baking my Bread, cooking my Meat,
                  <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> so I contriv'd to burn some Wood here, as I had seen done in
                  <hi rend="italic">England,</hi> under Turf, till it became Chark, or
               dry Coal; and then putting the Fire out, I preserv'd the Coal to carry Home; and
               perform the other Services which Fire was wanting for at
               Home without Danger of Smoke.</p>
            <p>But this is by the by: While I was cutting down some Wood here, I perceiv'd that
               behind a very thick Branch of low Brushwood, or under Wood, there was a kind of
               hollow Place; I was curious to look into it, and getting with Difficulty into the
               Mouth of it, I found it was pretty large; that is to say, sufficient for me to stand
               upright in it, and perhaps another with me; but I must confess to you, I made more
               hast out than I did in, when looking farther into the Place, and which was perfectly dark, I saw two broad shining Eyes of some Creature,
               whether Devil or Man I knew not, which twinkl'd like two Stars, the dim Light from
               the Cave's Mouth shining directly in and making the Reflection.</p>
            <p>However, after some Pause, I recover'd my self, and began to call my self a thousand
               Fools, and tell my self, that he that was afraid to see the Devil, was not fit to live twenty Years in an Island all alone; and that I durst to
               believe there was nothing <pb n="210"
                  /> in this Cave that was more frightful than my self;
               upon this, plucking up my Courage, I took up a great Firebrand, and in I rush'd
               again, with the Stick flaming in my Hand; I had not gone three Steps in, but I was
               almost as much frighted as I was before; for I heard a very loud Sigh, like that of a
               Man in some Pain, and it was follow'd by a broken Noise, <hi rend="italic">as if</hi> of Words half
               express'd, and then a deep Sigh again: I stepp'd back, and was indeed struck with
               such a Surprize, that it put me into a cold Sweat; and if I had had a Hat on my Head,
               I will not answer for it, that my Hair might not have lifted it off. But still
               plucking up my Spirits as well as I could, and encouraging my self a little with
               considering that the Power and Presence of God was every where, and was able to
               protect me; upon this I stepp'd forward again, and by the Light of the Firebrand,
               holding it up a little over my Head, I saw lying on the Ground a most monstrous
               frightful old He-goat, just making his Will, as we say, and
               gasping for Life, and dying indeed of meer old Age.</p>
            <p>I stirr'd him a little to see if I could get him out, and he essay'd to get up, but
               was not able to raise himself; and I thought with my self, he might even lie there; for if he had frighted me so, he would
               certainly fright any of the Savages, if any of them should be so hardy as to come in
               there, while he had any Life in him.</p>
            <p>I was now recover'd from my Surprize, and began to look
               round me, when I found the Cave was but very small, that is to say, it might be about
               twelve Foot over, but in no manner of Shape, either round or
               square, no Hands having ever been employ'd in making it, but those of meer Nature: I
               observ'd also, that there was a Place at the farther Side of
               it, that went in farther, but was so <pb n="211" /> low,
               that it requir'd me to creep upon my Hands and Knees to go into it, and whither I
               went I knew not; so having no Candle, I gave it over for some Time; but resolv'd to
               come again the next Day, provided with Candles, and a <ref target="tinderbox_"
                  corresp="tinderbox">Tinder-box</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff"

            </p>
            <p>Accordingly the next Day, I came provided with six large Candles of my own making;
               for I made very good Candles now of <ref target="tallow_" corresp="tallow">Goat's

                  type="gloss">Made from mutton fat</note>; and going into this low Place, I was
               oblig'd to creep upon all Fours, <hi rend="italic">as I have said,</hi> almost ten Yards; which by
               the way, I thought was a Venture bold enough, considering that I knew not how far it
               might go, nor what was beyond it. When I was got through the <ref target="strait_"
                  corresp="strait">Strait</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="strait"
                  target="strait_" type="gloss">Narrow opening</note>, I found the Roof rose higher
               up, I believe near twenty Foot; but never was such a glorious Sight seen in the Island, I dare say, as it was, to look round the Sides and
               Roof of this Vault, or Cave; the Walls reflected 100 thousand Lights to me from my
               two Candles; what it was in Rock, whether Diamonds, or any
               other precious Stones, or Gold, which I rather suppos'd it to be, I knew not.</p>
            <p>The Place I was in, was a most delightful Cavity, or Grotto,
               of its kind, as could be expected, though perfectly dark; the Floor was dry and
               level, and had a sort of small lose Gravel upon it, so that there was no nauseous or
               venemous Creature to be seen, neither was there any damp, or wet, on the Sides or
               Roof: The only Difficulty in it was the Entrance, which
               however as it was a Place of Security, and such a Retreat as I wanted, I thought that
               was a Convenience; so that I was really rejoyc'd at the Discovery, and resolv'd without any Delay, to bring some of those Things
               which I was most anxious about, to this <pb n="212" />
               Place; particularly, I resolv'd to bring hither my Magazine of Powder, and all my
               spare Arms, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> Two Fowling-Pieces, for I had three in all; and three
               Muskets, for of them I had eight in all; so I kept at my Castle only five, which
               stood ready mounted like Pieces of Cannon, on my out-most Fence; and were ready also
               to take out upon any Expedition.</p>
            <p>Upon this Occasion of removing my Ammunition, I took
               occasion to open the Barrel of Powder which I took up out of
               the Sea, and which had been wet; and I found that the Water had penetrated about
               three or four Inches into the Powder, on every Side, which caking and growing hard, had preserv'd the inside like a Kernel in a Shell;
               so that I had near sixty Pound of very good Powder in the Center of the Cask, and
               this was an agreeable Discovery to me at that Time; so I carry'd all away thither,
               never keeping above two or three Pound of Powder with me in my Castle, for fear of a
               Surprize of any kind: I also carry'd thither all the Lead I had left for Bullets.</p>
            <p>I fancy'd my self now like one of the ancient Giants, which are said to live in
               Caves; and Holes, in the Rocks, where none could come at them; for I perswaded my
               self while I was here, if five hundred Savages were to hunt me, they could never find me out; or if they did, they would not venture to
               attack me here.</p>
            <p>The old Goat who I found expiring, dy'd in the Mouth of the Cave, the next Day after
               I made this Discovery; and I found it much easier to dig a great Hole there, and
               throw him in, and cover him with Earth, than to drag him
               out; so I interr'd him there, to prevent the Offence to my Nose.</p>

                  <p>I was now in my twenty third Year of Residence in this Island, and was so naturaliz'd to the Place,
               and to the Manner of Living, that could I have but enjoy'd the Certainty that no
               Savages would come to the Place to disturb me, I could have been content to have
               capitulated for spending the rest of my Time there, even to the last Moment, till I had laid me down and dy'd, like the old Goat in
               the Cave. I had also arriv'd to some little Diversions and Amusements, which made the
               Time pass more pleasantly with me a great deal, than it did before; as First, I had
               taught my Poll, as I noted before, to speak; and he did it so familiarly, and talk'd
               so articulately and plain, that it was very pleasant to me; and he liv'd with me no
               less than six and twenty Years: How long he might live afterwards, I know not; though
               I know they have a Notion in the <hi rend="italic">Brasils,</hi> that they live a hundred Years; perhaps poor Poll may be alive there still,
               calling after <hi rend="italic">Poor Robin Crusoe</hi> to this Day. I wish no <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Man
               the ill Luck to come there and hear him; but if he did, he would certainly believe it
               was the Devil. My Dog was a very pleasant and loving Companion to me, for no less
               than sixteen Years of my Time, and then dy'd, of meer old
               Age; as for my Cats, they multiply'd as I have observ'd to that Degree, that I was
               oblig'd to shoot several of them at first, to keep them from devouring me, and all I had; but at length, when the two old Ones
               I brought with me were gone, and after some time continually driving them from me,
               and letting them have no Provision with me, they all ran wild into the Woods, except
               two or three Favourites, which I kept tame; and whose Young when they had any, I
               always drown'd; and these were part of my Family: Besides these, I always kept two or
               three houshold Kids about me, who I <pb n="214" /> taught to
               feed out of my Hand; and I had two more Parrots which talk'd pretty well, and would
               all call <hi rend="italic">Robin Crusoe</hi>; but none like my first; nor indeed did I take the Pains with any of them that I had done with him. I had also
               several tame Sea-Fowls, whose Names I know not, who I caught upon the Shore, and cut
               their Wings; and the little Stakes which I had planted
               before my Castle Wall being now grown up to a good thick Grove, these Fowls all liv'd
               among these low Trees, and bred there, which was very agreeable to me; so that as I
               said above, I began to be very well contented with the Life
               I led, if it might but have been secur'd from the dread of the Savages.</p>
            <p>But <ref target="providence_" corresp="providence">it was otherwise
                  directed</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="providence"
                  target="providence_" type="gloss">Providence decreed otherwise</note>; and it may
               not be amiss for all People who shall meet with my Story, to make this just
               Observation from it, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> How frequently in the Course of our Lives, the
               Evil which in it self we seek most to shun, and which when we are fallen into it, is
               the most dreadful to us, is oftentimes the very Means or Door of our Deliverance, by
               which alone we can be rais'd again from the Affliction we are fallen into. I cou'd
               give many Examples of this in the Course of my unaccountable
               Life; but in nothing was it more particularly remarkable,
               than in the Circumstances of my last Years of solitary Residence in this Island.</p>
            <p>It was now the Month of <hi rend="italic">December,</hi> as I said above,
               in my twenty third Year; and this being the <hi rend="italic">Southern</hi> Solstice, for Winter I
               cannot call it, was the particular Time of my Harvest, and requir'd my being pretty
               much abroad in the Fields, when going out pretty early in the Morning, even before it
               was thorow Day-light, I was surpriz'd with seeing a Light of
               some Fire upon the Shore, at a Distance from me, of about
               two Mile towards the End of the Island, where I had observ'd some Savages <pb n="215" /> had been as
               before; but not on the other Side; but to my great Affliction, it was on my Side of
               the Island.</p>
            <p>I was indeed terribly surpriz'd at the Sight, and stepp'd short within my Grove, not
               daring to go out, least I might be surpriz'd; and yet I had no more Peace within,
               from the Apprehensions I had, that if these Savages in rambling over the Island,
               should find my Corn standing, or cut, or any of my Works and Improvements, they would
                  immediately conclude, that there were People in the
               Place, and would then never give over till they had found me out: In this Extremity I
               went back directly to my Castle, pull'd up the Ladder after me, and made all Things
               without look as wild and natural as I could.</p>
            <p>Then I prepar'd my self within, putting my self in a Posture of Defence; I loaded all
               my Cannon, as I call'd them; that is to say, my Muskets, which were mounted upon my
               new Fortification, and all my Pistols, and resolv'd to defend my self to the last
               Gasp, not forgetting seriously to commend my self to the Divine Protection, and
               earnestly to pray to God to deliver me out of the Hands of the Barbarians; and in
               this Posture I continu'd about two Hours; but began to be mighty impatient for
               Intelligence abroad, for I had no Spies to send out.</p>
            <p>After sitting a while longer, and musing what I should do in this Case, I was not
               able to bear sitting in Ignorance any longer; so setting up
               my Ladder to the Side of the Hill, where there was a flat
               Place, as I observ'd before, and then pulling the Ladder up after me, I set it up
               again, and mounted to the Top of the Hill; and pulling out
               my Perspective Glass, which I had taken on Purpose, I laid me down flat on my Belly,
               on the Ground, and began to look for the Place; I presently found <pb n="216"
                  /> there was no less than nine naked Savages, sitting
               round a small Fire, they had made, not to warm them; for they had no need of that,
               the Weather being extreme hot; but as I suppos'd, to dress some of their barbarous
               Diet, of humane Flesh, which they had brought with them, whether alive or dead I
               could not know.</p>
            <p>They had two <hi rend="italic">Canoes</hi> with them, which they had haled up upon the Shore; and
               as it was then Tide of Ebb, they seem'd to me to wait for the Return of the Flood, to
               go away again; it is not easy to imagine what Confusion this Sight put me into,
               especially seeing them come on my Side the Island, and so near me too; but when I
               observ'd their coming must be always with the Current of the Ebb, I began afterwards
               to be more sedate in my Mind, being satisfy'd that I might go abroad with Safety all
               the Time of the Tide of Flood, if they were not on Shore before: And having made this
               Observation, I went abroad about my Harvest Work with the more Composure.</p>
            <p>As I expected, so it prov'd; for as soon as the Tide made to the <hi rend="italic">Westward,</hi> I
               saw them all take Boat, and row (or paddle as we call it) all away: I should have
               observ'd, that for an Hour and more before they went off, they went to dancing, and I
               could easily discern their Postures, and Gestures, by my Glasses: I could not
               perceive by my <ref target="nicest_" corresp="nicest">nicest</ref><note
                  resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="nicest" target="nicest_" type="gloss">Most
                  careful</note> Observation, but that they were stark naked, and had not the least
               covering upon them; but whether they were Men or Women, that I could not distinguish.</p>
            <p>As soon as I saw them shipp'd, and gone, I took two Guns upon my Shoulders, and two
               Pistols at my Girdle, and my great Sword by my Side, without
               a Scabbard, and with all the Speed I was able to make, I went away to the Hill, where
               I had discover'd <pb n="217" /> the
               first Appearance of all; and as soon as I gat thither, which was not less than two
               Hours; for I could not go apace, being so loaden with Arms as I was. I perceiv'd
               there had been three <hi rend="italic">Canoes</hi> more of Savages on that Place; and looking out
               farther, I saw they were all at Sea together, making over
               for the Main.</p>
            <p>This was a dreadful Sight to me, especially when going down to the Shore, I could see
               the Marks of Horror, which the dismal Work they had been about had left behind it, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> The Blood, the Bones, and part of the Flesh
               of humane Bodies, eaten and devour'd by those Wretches, with Merriment and Sport: I
               was so fill'd with Indignation at the Sight, that I began now to premeditate the
               Destruction of the next that I saw there, let them be who, or how many soever.</p>
            <p>It seem'd evident to me, that the Visits which they thus make to this Island, are not
               very frequent; for it was above fifteen Months before any
               more of them came on Shore there again; that is to say, I neither saw them, or any
               Footsteps, or Signals of them, in all that Time; for as to the rainy Seasons, then
               they are sure not to come abroad, at least not so far; yet
               all this while I liv'd uncomfortably, by reason of the constant Apprehensions I was in of their coming upon me by Surprize; from
               whence I observe, that the Expectation of Evil is more
               bitter than the Suffering, especially if there is no room to shake off that
               Expectation, or those Apprehensions.</p>
            <p>During all this Time, I was in the murthering Humour; and took up most of my Hours,
               which should have been better employ'd, in contriving how to circumvent, and fall
               upon them, the very next Time I should see them; especially if they should be
               divided, as they were the last Time, into <pb n="218"
                  /> two Parties; nor did I consider at all, that if I
               kill'd one Party, suppose Ten, or a Dozen, I was still the next Day, or Week, or

               at length no less a Murtherer than they were in being Man-eaters; and perhaps much
               more so.</p>
            <p>I spent my Days now in great Perplexity, and Anxiety of Mind, expecting that I should
               one Day or other fall into the Hands of these merciless Creatures; and if I did at any Time venture abroad, it was not without looking round me
               with the greatest Care and Caution imaginable; and now I
               found to my great Comfort, how <ref target="happy_" corresp="happy">happy</ref><note

                  >Fortunate</note> it was that I provided for a tame Flock or Herd of Goats; for I
               durst not upon any account fire my Gun, especially near that
               Side of the Island where they usually came, least I should alarm the Savages; and if
               they had fled from me now, I was sure to have them come back again, with perhaps two
               or three hundred <hi rend="italic">Canoes</hi> with them, in a few Days, and then I knew what to
               expect.</p>
            <p>However, I wore out a Year and three Months more, before I ever saw any more of the
               Savages, and then I found them again, as I shall soon observe. It is true, they might
               have been there once, or twice; but either they made no stay, or at least I did not
               hear them; but in the Month of <hi rend="italic">May,</hi> as near as I could calculate, and in my
               four and twentieth Year, I had a very strange Encounter with them, of which in its
               Place.</p>
            <p>The Perturbation of my Mind, during this fifteen or sixteen
               Months Interval, was very great; I slept unquiet, dream'd always frightful Dreams,
               and often started out of my Sleep in the Night: In the Day great Troubles overwhelm'd
               my Mind, and in the Night I dream'd often of killing the <pb n="219"
                  /> Savages, and of the Reasons why I might justify the
               doing of it; but to <ref target="waive_" corresp="waive">wave</ref><note

                  set aside</note> all this for a while; it was in the middle of <hi rend="italic">May,</hi> on
               the sixteenth Day I think, as well as my poor wooden Calendar would reckon; for I
               markt all upon the Post still; I say, it was the sixteenth of <hi rend="italic">May,</hi> that it
               blew a very great Storm of Wind, all Day, with a great deal of Lightning, and
               Thunder, and a very foul Night it was after it; I know not what was the particular
               Occasion of it; but as I was reading in the Bible, and taken up with very serious
               Thoughts about my present Condition, I was surpriz'd with a Noise of a Gun as I
               thought fir'd at Sea.</p>
            <p>This was to be sure a Surprize of a quite different Nature
               from any I had met with before; for the Notions this put into my Thoughts, were quite
               of another kind. I started up in the greatest hast imaginable, and in a trice clapt
               my Ladder to the middle Place of the Rock, and pull'd it after me, and mounting it
               the second Time, got to the Top of the Hill, the very Moment, that a Flash of Fire
               bid me listen for a second Gun, which accordingly, in about half a Minute I heard;
               and by the sound, knew that it was from that Part of the Sea where I was driven down
               the Current in my Boat.</p>
            <p>I immediately consider'd that this must be some Ship in Distress, and that they had
               some Comrade, or some other Ship in Company, and fir'd these Guns for Signals of
               Distress, and to obtain Help: I had this Presence of Mind at that Minute, as to think
               that though I could not help them, it may be they might help me; so I brought
               together all the dry Wood I could get at hand, and making a good handsome Pile, I set
               it on Fire upon the Hill; the Wood was dry, and blaz'd freely; and though the Wind
               blew very hard, yet it burnt fairly out; that I was certain, if there was any such
               Thing as a <pb n="220" /> Ship, they must needs see it, and
               no doubt they did; for as soon as ever my Fire blaz'd up, I heard another Gun, and
               after that several others, all from the same Quarter; I ply'd my Fire all Night long,
               till Day broke; and when it was broad Day, and the Air clear'd up, I saw something at
               a great Distance at Sea, full <hi rend="italic">East</hi> of the Island,
               whether a Sail, or a Hull, I could not distinguish, no not with my Glasses, the
               Distance was so great, and the Weather still something haizy also; at least it was so
               out at Sea.</p>
            <p>I look'd frequently at it all that Day, and soon perceiv'd that it did not move; so I
               presently concluded, that it was a Ship at an Anchor, and
               being eager, you may be sure, to be satisfy'd, I took my Gun in my Hand, and run
               toward the <hi rend="italic">South</hi> Side of the Island, to the Rocks where I had formerly been
               carry'd away with the Current, and getting up there, the Weather by this Time being
               perfectly clear, I could plainly see to my great Sorrow, the Wreck of a Ship cast
               away in the Night, upon those concealed Rocks which I found, when I was out in my
               Boat; and which Rocks, as they check'd the Violence of the Stream, and made a kind of
               Counter-stream, or Eddy, were the Occasion of my recovering from the most desperate
               hopeless Condition that ever I had been in, in all my
               Life.</p>
            <p>Thus what is one Man's Safety, is another Man's Destruction; for it seems these Men,
               whoever they were, being out of their Knowledge, and the Rocks being wholly under
               Water, had been driven upon them in the Night, the Wind blowing hard at <hi rend="italic">E.</hi>
               and <hi rend="italic">E. N. E:</hi> Had they seen the Island, as I must necessarily suppose they
               did not, they must, as I thought, have endeavour'd to have sav'd themselves on Shore
               by the Help of their Boat; but their firing of Guns for Help, especially when they
               saw, as I <pb n="221" /> imagin'd, my Fire, fill'd me with
               many Thoughts: First, I imagin'd that upon seeing my Light, they might have put
               themselves into their Boat, and have endeavour'd to make the Shore; but that the Sea
               going very high, they might have been cast away; other Times
               I imagin'd, that they might have lost their Boat before, as might be the Case many
               Ways; as particularly by the Breaking of the Sea upon their Ship, <ref
                  target="breaking_" corresp="breaking">which many Times obliges Men to stave, or
                  take in Pieces their Boat</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff"
                  xml:id="breaking" target="breaking_" type="gloss">If the violent storm damaged the
                  lifeboat, the men would be forced to break apart the ruined boat and throw it
                  overboard, to alleviate excess weight on the sinking ship.</note>; and sometimes
               to throw it over-board with their own Hands: Other Times I imagin'd, they had some
               other Ship, or Ships in Company, who upon the Signals of Distress they had made, had
               taken them up, and carry'd them off: Other whiles I fancy'd, they were all gone off
               to Sea in their Boat, and being hurry'd away by the Current
               that I had been formerly in, were carry'd out into the great Ocean, where there was
               nothing but Misery and Perishing; and that perhaps they might by this Time think of
               starving, and of being in a Condition to eat one another.</p>
            <p>As all these were but Conjectures at best; so in the Condition I was in, I could do
               no more than look on upon the Misery of the poor Men, and pity them, which had still
               this good Effect on my Side, that it gave me more and more Cause to give Thanks to
               God who had so happily and comfortably provided for me in my desolate Condition; and that of two Ships Companies who were now cast
               away upon this part of the World, not one Life should be spar'd but mine: I learn'd
               here again to observe, that it is very rare that the Providence of God casts us into any Condition of Life so low, or any Misery so great,
               but we may see something or other to be thankful for; and may see others in worse
               Circumstances than our own.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="222" />Such certainly was the Case of these Men, of
               whom I could not so much as see room to suppose any of them
               were sav'd; nothing could make it rational, so much as to wish, or expect that they
               did not all perish there; except the Possibility only of their being taken up by
               another Ship in Company, and this was but meer Possibility
               indeed; for I saw not the least Signal or Appearance of any such Thing.</p>
            <p>I cannot explain by any possible Energy of Words, what a strange longing or hankering
               of Desires I felt in my Soul upon this Sight; breaking out sometimes thus; O that there had been but one or two; nay, or
               but one Soul sav'd out of this Ship, to have escap'd to me, that I might but have had
               one Companion, one Fellow-Creature to have spoken to me, and
               to have convers'd with! In all the Time of my solitary Life, I never felt so earnest,
               so strong a Desire after the Society of my Fellow-Creatures, or so deep a Regret at
               the want of it.</p>
            <p>There are some secret moving Springs in the Affections,
               which when they are set a going by some Object in view, or be it some Object, though
               not in view, yet rendred present to the Mind by the Power of Imagination, that Motion
               carries out the Soul by its Impetuosity to such violent eager embracings of the Object, that the Absence of it is insupportable.</p>
            <p>Such were these earnest Wishings, That but one Man had been sav'd! <hi rend="italic">O that it had
                  been but One!</hi> I believe I repeated the Words, <hi rend="italic">O that it had been but
                  One!</hi> A thousand Times; and the Desires were so mov'd by it, that when I spoke
               the Words, my Hands would clinch together, and my Fingers press the Palms of my
               Hands, that if I had had any soft Thing in my Hand, it wou'd have crusht it involuntarily; and my Teeth in my Head wou'd strike <pb n="223"
                  /> together, and set against one another so strong, that
               for some time I cou'd not part them again.</p>
            <p>Let the Naturalists explain these Things, and the Reason and Manner of them; all I
               can say to them, is, to describe the Fact, which was even surprising to me when I
                  <ref target="find_" corresp="find">found it</ref><note

                  >Experienced these emotions</note>; though I knew not from what it should proceed;
               it was doubtless the effect of ardent Wishes, and of strong Ideas form'd in my Mind,
               realizing the Comfort, which the Conversation of one of my Fellow-Christians would
               have been to me.</p>
            <p>But it was not to be; either their Fate or mine, or both, forbid it; for till the
               last Year of my being on this Island, I never knew whether any were saved out of that Ship or no; and had only the Affliction some Days after, to see the Corps of a drownded Boy come on Shore, at the End of the Island which was
                  <ref target="next_" corresp="next">next</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff"
                  xml:id="next" target="next_" type="gloss">Nearest</note> the Shipwreck: He had on
               no Cloaths, but a Seaman's Wastcoat, a pair of open knee'd Linnen Drawers, and a blew
               Linnen Shirt; but nothing to direct me so much as to guess what Nation he was of: He
               had nothing in his Pocket, but two Pieces of Eight, and a Tobacco Pipe; the last was
               to me of ten times more value than the first.</p>
            <p>It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in my Boat, to this Wreck; not
                  doubting but I might find something on board, that might
               be useful to me; but that did not altogether press me so much, as the Possibility
               that there might be yet some living Creature on board, whose Life I might not only
               save, but might by saving that Life, comfort my own to the last Degree; and this
               Thought clung so to my Heart, that I could not be quiet, Night or Day, but I must
               venture out in my Boat on board this Wreck; and committing the rest to God's
               Providence, I thought <pb n="224" /> the Impression was so
               strong upon my Mind, that it could not be resisted, that it must come from some
               invisible Direction, and that I should be wanting to my self
               if I did not go.</p>
            <p>Under the Power of this Impression, I hasten'd back to my Castle, prepar'd every
               Thing for my Voyage, took a Quantity of Bread, a great Pot for fresh Water, a Compass
               to steer by, a Bottle of Rum; for I had still a great deal of that left; a Basket full of Raisins: And thus loading my self with every
               Thing necessary, I went down to my Boat, got the Water out of her, and got her
               afloat, loaded all my Cargo in her, and then went Home again for more; my second Cargo was a great Bag full of Rice,
               the Umbrella to set up over my Head for Shade; another large Pot full of fresh Water,
               and about two Dozen of my small Loaves, or Barley Cakes, more than before, with a
               Bottle of Goat's-Milk, and a Cheese; all which, with great Labour and Sweat, I
               brought to my Boat; and praying to God to direct my Voyage, I put out, and Rowing or
               Padling the Canoe along the Shore, I came at last to the utmost Point of the Island on that Side, <hi rend="italic">(viz.) N. E.</hi> And now I was to
               launch out into the Ocean, and either to venture, or not to venture. I look'd on the
               rapid Currents which ran constantly on both Sides of the Island, at a Distance, and
               which were very terrible to me, from the Remembrance of the Hazard I had been in
               before, and my Heart began to fail me; for I foresaw that if I was driven into either
               of those Currents, I should be carry'd a vast Way out to Sea, and perhaps out of my
               Reach, or Sight of the Island again; and that then, as my Boat was but small, if any
               little Gale of Wind should rise, I should be inevitably lost.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="225" />These Thoughts so oppress'd my Mind, that I
               began to give over my Enterprize, and having haled my Boat
               into a little Creek on the Shore, I stept out, and sat me down upon a little rising
               bit of Ground, very pensive and anxious, between Fear and Desire about my Voyage;
               when as I was musing, I could perceive that the Tide was turn'd, and the Flood come
               on, upon which my going was for so many Hours impracticable; upon this presently it occurr'd to me, that I should go up to the highest
               Piece of Ground I could find, and observe, if I could, how the Sets of the Tide, or
               Currents lay, when the Flood came in, that I might judge whether if I was driven one
               way out, I might not expect to be driven another way home, with the same Rapidness of
               the Currents: This Thought was no sooner in my Head, but I cast my Eye upon a little Hill, which sufficiently over-look'd the Sea
               both ways, and from whence I had a clear view of the Currents, or Sets of the Tide,
               and which way I was to guide my self in my Return; here I found, that as the Current
               of the Ebb set out close by the South Point of the Island; so the Current of the
               Flood set in close by the Shore of the North Side, and that I had nothing to do but
               to keep to the North of the Island in my Return, and I should do well enough.</p>
            <p>Encourag'd with this Observation, I resolv'd the next Morning to set out with the
               first of the Tide; and reposing my self for the Night in the Canoe, under the great
               Watch-coat, I mention'd, I launched out: I made first a little out to Sea full North,
               till I began to feel the Benefit of the Current, which set
               Eastward, and which carry'd me at a great rate, and yet did not so hurry me as the
               Southern Side Current had done before, and so as to take from me all Government of
               the Boat; but having a <pb n="226" /> strong Steerage with
               my Paddle, I went at a great rate, directly for the Wreck, and in less than two Hours
               I came up to it.</p>
            <p>It was a dismal Sight to look at: The Ship, which by its building was
                  <hi rend="italic">Spanish,</hi> stuck fast, jaum'd in between two Rocks; all the Stern and
               Quarter of her was beaten to pieces, with the Sea; and as her Forecastle, which stuck
               in the Rocks, had run on with great Violence, her Mainmast and Foremast were brought
               by the Board; that is to say, broken short off; but her <ref target="boltspirit_"
                  corresp="boltspirit">Boltsprit</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff"
                  xml:id="boltspirit" target="boltspirit_" type="gloss">Bowsprit; a large spar or
                  beam extending forth from the front of a ship</note> was sound, and the Head and
               Bow appear'd firm; when I came close to her, a Dog appear'd upon her, who seeing me
               coming, yelp'd, and cry'd; and as soon as I call'd him, jump'd into the Sea, to come
               to me, and I took him into the Boat; but found him almost dead for Hunger and Thirst:
               I gave him a Cake of my Bread, and he eat it like a ravenous Wolf, that had been
               starving a Fortnight in the Snow: I then gave the poor Creature some fresh Water,
               with which, if I would have let him, he would have burst himself.</p>
            <p>After this I went on board; but the first Sight I met with, was two Men drown'd, in
               the Cookroom, or Forecastle of the Ship, with their Arms
               fast about one another: I concluded, as is indeed probable, that when the Ship
               struck, it being in a Storm, the Sea broke so high, and so continually over her, that
               the Men were not able to bear it, and were strangled with the constant rushing in of
               the Water, as much as if they had been under Water. Besides
               the Dog, there was nothing left in the Ship that had Life; nor any Goods that I could
               see, but what were spoil'd by the Water. There were some Casks of Liquor, whether
               Wine or Brandy, I knew not, which lay lower in the Hold; and which, the Water being
               ebb'd out, I <pb n="227" /> could see; but they were too big
               to meddle with: I saw several Chests, which I believ'd belong'd to some of the
               Seamen; and I got two of them into the Boat, without examining what was in them.</p>
            <p>Had the Stern of the Ship been fix'd, and the Forepart broken off, I am perswaded I
               might have made a good Voyage; for by what I found in these two Chests, I had room to
               suppose, the Ship had a great deal of Wealth on board; and if I may guess by the

                  eventually causing enormous inflation throughout Western Europe. Buenos Aires
                  exported silver to Spain.</note> She had no doubt a great Treasure in her; but of
               no use at that time to any body; and what became of the rest of her People, I then
               knew not.</p>
            <p>I found besides these Chests, a little Cask full of Liquor, of about twenty Gallons,
               which I got into my Boat, with much Difficulty; there were several Muskets in a
               Cabin, and a great Powder-horn, with about 4 Pounds of Powder in it; as for the
               Muskets, I had no occasion for them; so I left them, but took the Powder-horn: I took
               a Fire Shovel and Tongs, which I wanted extremely; as also two little Brass Kettles,
               a Copper Pot to make Chocolate, and a Gridiron; and with
               this Cargo, and the Dog, I came away, the Tide beginning to make home again; and the
               same Evening, about an Hour within Night, I reach'd the Island again, weary and
               fatigu'd to the last Degree.</p>
            <p>I repos'd that Night in the Boat, and in the Morning I
               resolved to harbour what I had gotten in my new Cave, not to carry it home to my
               Castle. After refreshing my self, I got all my Cargo on
               Shore, and began to examine the Particulars: The Cask of Liquor I found to be a kind
               of Rum, but not such <pb n="228" /> as we had at the
                  <hi rend="italic">Brasils</hi>; and in a Word, not at all good; but when I came to open the
               Chests, I found several Things, of great use to me: For Example, I found in one, a
               fine Case of Bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and fill'd with Cordial Waters, fine, and very good; the Bottles held about three
               Pints each, and were tipp'd with Silver: I found two Pots of very good <ref

               a dozen and half of Linnen white Handkerchiefs, and colour'd

            <p>Having now brought all my Things on Shore, and secur'd them, I went back to my Boat,
               and row'd, or paddled her along the Shore, to her old Harbour, where I laid her up,
               and made the best of my way to my old Habitation, where I found every thing safe and
               quiet; so I began to repose my self, live after my old fashion, and take care of my
               Family Affairs; and for a while, I liv'd easy enough; only that I was more vigilant
               than I us'd to be, look'd out oftner, and did not go abroad so much; and if at any
               time I did stir with any Freedom, it was always to the <hi rend="italic">East</hi> Part of the
               Island, where I was pretty well satisfy'd the Savages never
               came, and where I could go without so many Precautions, and such a Load of Arms and
               Ammunition, as I always carry'd with me, if I went the other way.</p>
            <p>I liv'd in this Condition near two Years more; but my unlucky Head, that was always
               to let me <pb n="230" /> know it was born to make my Body
               miserable, was all this two Years fill'd with Projects and Designs, how, if it were
               possible, I might get away from this Island; for sometimes I was for making another Voyage to the Wreck, though my Reason told me
               that there was nothing left there, worth the Hazard of my Voyage: Sometimes for a
               Ramble one way, sometimes another; and I believe verily, if

               great a Hazard.</p>
            <p>But as this is ordinarily the Fate of young Heads, so Reflection upon the Folly of
               it, is as ordinarily the Exercise of more Years, or of the dear bought Experience of
               Time; and so it was with me now; and yet so deep had the Mistake taken root in my
               Temper, that I could not satisfy my self in my Station, but was continually poring
               upon the Means, and Possibility of my Escape from this Place; and that I may with the
               greater Pleasure to the Reader, bring on the remaining Part
               of my Story, it may not be improper, to give some Account of my first Conceptions on
               the Subject of this foolish Scheme, for my Escape; and how, and upon what Foundation
               I acted.</p>
            <p>I am now to be suppos'd retir'd into my Castle, after my late Voyage to the Wreck, my
               Frigate laid up, and secur'd under Water, as usual, and my Condition restor'd to what it was before: I had more Wealth indeed than I had before,
               but was not at all the richer; for I had no more use for it, than the
                  <hi rend="italic">Indians</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Peru</hi> had, before the <hi rend="italic">Spaniards</hi> came
               there.</p>
            <p>It was one of the Nights in the rainy Season in <hi rend="italic">March,</hi> the four and
               twentieth Year of my first setting Foot in this Island of
               Solitariness; I was lying in my Bed, or Hammock, awake, very well in Health, had no
               Pain, no Distemper, no Uneasiness of Body; no, nor any Uneasiness of Mind, more than
               ordinary; but could by no means close my Eyes; that is, so as to sleep; no, not a
               Wink all Night long, otherwise than as follows:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="232" />It is as impossible, as needless, to set down
               the innumerable Crowd of Thoughts that whirl'd through that great thorow-fare of the
               Brain, the Memory, in this Night's Time: I run over the whole History of my Life in
               Miniature, or by Abridgment, <hi rend="italic">as I may call it,</hi> to
               my coming to this Island; and also of the Part of my Life, since I came to this
               Island. In my Reflections upon the State of my Case, since I came on Shore on this
                  Island, I was comparing the happy Posture of my Affairs,
               in the first Years of my Habitation here, compar'd to the Life of Anxiety, Fear and
               Care, which I had liv'd ever since I had seen the Print of a Foot in the Sand; not
               that I did not believe the Savages had frequented the Island even all the while, and
               might have been several Hundreds of them at Times on Shore there; but I had never
               known it, and was incapable of any Apprehensions about it; my Satisfaction was
               perfect, though my Danger was the same; and I was as happy in not knowing my Danger,
               as if I had never really been expos'd to it: This furnish'd my Thoughts with many
               very profitable Reflections, and particularly this one, How infinitely Good that
               Providence is, which has provided in its Government of Mankind, such narrow bounds to his Sight and Knowledge of Things, and though
               he walks in the midst of so many thousand Dangers, the Sight
               of which, if discover'd to him, would distract his Mind, and sink his Spirits; he is
               kept serene, and calm, by having the Events of Things hid from his Eyes, and knowing
               nothing the Dangers which surround him.</p>
            <p>After these Thoughts had for some Time entertain'd me, I
               came to reflect seriously upon the real Danger I had been in, for so many Years, in
               this very Island; and how I had walk'd about in the greatest Security, and with all
               possible Tranquillity; <pb n="233" facs="tcp:0653600100:239"
               /> even when perhaps nothing but a Brow of a Hill, a great Tree, or the casual
               Approach of Night, had been between me and the worst kind of Destruction,
                  <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> That of falling into the Hands of Cannibals, and Savages, who would
               have seiz'd on me with the same View, as I did of a Goat, or a Turtle; and have
               thought it no more a Crime to kill and devour me, than I did of a Pidgeon, or a <ref

               should say I was not sincerely thankful to my great Preserver, to whose singular
               Protection I acknowledg'd, with great Humility, that all
               these unknown Deliverances were due; and without which, I must inevitably have fallen
               into their merciless Hands.</p>
            <p>When these Thoughts were over, my Head was for some time taken up in considering the
               Nature of these wretched Creatures; I mean, the Savages; and how it came to pass in
               the World, that the wise Governour of all Things should give up any of his Creatures
               to such Inhumanity; nay, to something so much below, even
               Brutality it self, as to devour its own kind; but as this ended in some (at that Time
               fruitless) Speculations, it occurr'd to me to enquire, what Part of the World these
               Wretches liv'd in; how far off the Coast was from whence they came; what they
               ventur'd over so far from home for; what kind of Boats they had; and why I might not
               order my self, and my Business so, that I might be as able
               to go over thither, as they were to come to me.</p>
            <p>I never so much as troubl'd my self, to consider what I should do with my self, when
               I came thither; what would become of me, if I fell into the
               Hands of the Savages; or how I should escape from them, if they attempted me; no, nor
               so much as how it was possible for me to reach the Coast, and <pb n="234"
                  /> not be attempted by some or other of them, without any Possibility of delivering my self; and if I should
               not fall into their Hands, what I should do for Provision, or whither I should bend
               my Course; none of these Thoughts, I say, so much as came in my way; but my Mind was
               wholly bent upon the Notion of my passing over in my Boat, to the Main Land: I look'd
               back upon my present Condition, as the most miserable that
               could possibly be, that I was not able to throw my self into any thing but Death,
               that could be call'd worse; that if I reached the Shore of the Main, I might perhaps
               meet with Relief, or I might coast along, as I did on the Shore of <hi rend="italic">Africk,</hi>
               till I came to some inhabited Country, and where I might
               find some Relief; and after all perhaps, I might fall in
               with some Christian Ship, that might take me in; and if the worse came to the worst,
               I could but die, which would put an end to all these Miseries at once. Pray note, all
               this was the fruit of a disturb'd Mind, an impatient Temper,
               made as it were desperate by the long Continuance of my Troubles, and the
               Disappointments I had met in the Wreck, I had been on board of; and where I had been
               so near the obtaining what I so earnestly long'd for, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> Some-body to
               speak to, and to learn some Knowledge from of the Place where I was, and of the
               probable Means of my Deliverance; I say, I was agitated wholly by these Thoughts: All
               my Calm of Mind in my Resignation to Providence, and waiting
               the Issue of the Dispositions of Heaven, seem'd to be suspended; and I had, as it
               were, no Power to turn my Thoughts to any thing, but to the Project of a Voyage to
               the Main, which came upon me with such Force, and such an Impetuosity of Desire, that it was not to be resisted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="235" />When this had agitated my Thoughts for two
               Hours, or more, with such Violence, that it set my very Blood into a Ferment, and my
               Pulse beat as high as if I had been in a Feaver, meerly with the extraordinary
               Fervour of my Mind about it; Nature, as if I had been fatigued and exhausted with the
               very Thought of it, threw me into a sound Sleep; one would have thought, I should
               have dream'd of it: But I did not, nor of any Thing relating to it; but I dream'd,
               that as I was going out in the Morning as usual from my Castle, I saw upon the Shore,
               two <hi rend="italic">Canoes,</hi> and eleven Savages coming to Land, and
               that they brought with them another Savage, who they were going to kill, in Order to
               eat him; when on a sudden, the Savage that they were going
               to kill, jumpt away, and ran for his Life; and I thought in my Sleep, that he came
               running into my little thick Grove, before my Fortification, to hide himself; and
               that I seeing him alone, and not perceiving that the other
               sought him that Way, show'd my self to him, and smiling upon him, encourag'd him;
               that he kneel'd down to me, seeming to pray me to assist him; upon which I shew'd my
               Ladder, made him go up, and carry'd him into my Cave, and he became my Servant; and that as soon as I had gotten this Man, I said to my self, now I may certainly venture to the main Land; for this Fellow will serve
               me as a Pilot, and will tell me what to do, and whether to go for Provisions; and
                  whether not to go for fear of being devoured, what Places to venture into, and what to escape: I wak'd with this
               Thought, and was under such inexpressible Impressions of
               Joy, at the Prospect of my Escape in my Dream, that the Disappointments which I felt
               upon coming to my self, and finding it was no more than a Dream, were equally
               extravagant the <pb n="236" /> other Way, and threw me into
               a very great Dejection of Spirit.</p>
            <p>Upon this however, I made this Conclusion, that my only Way to go about an Attempt
               for an Escape, was, if possible, to get a Savage into my Possession; and if possible,
               it should be one of their Prisoners, who they had condemn'd to be eaten, and should
               bring thither to kill; but these Thoughts still were attended with this Difficulty,
               that it was impossible to effect this, without attacking a
               whole Caravan of them, and killing them all; and this was not only a very desperate
                  Attempt, and might miscarry; but on the other Hand, I had
               greaty scrupled the Lawfulness of it to me; and my Heart trembled at the thoughts of
               shedding so much Blood, tho' it was for my Deliverance. I
               need not repeat the Arguments which occurr'd to me against this, they being the same
               mention'd before; but tho' I had other Reasons to offer now (<hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>) that
               those Men were Enemies to my Life, and would devour me, if they could; that it was
               Self-preservation in the highest Degree, to deliver my self from this Death of a
               Life, and was acting in my own Defence, as much as if they were actually assaulting
               me, and the like. I say, tho' these Things argued for it, yet the Thoughts of
               shedding Humane Blood for my Deliverance, were very Terrible to me, and such as I
               could by no Means reconcile my self to, a great while.</p>
            <p>However at last, after many secret Disputes with my self, and after great
               Perplexities about it, for all these Arguments one Way and another struggl'd in my
               Head a long Time, the eager prevailing Desire of Deliverance at length master'd all
               the rest; and I resolv'd, if possible, to get one of those Savages into my Hands,
               cost what it <pb n="237" /> would. My next Thing then was to
               contrive how to do it, and this indeed was very difficult to resolve on: But as I could pitch upon no probable Means for
               it, so I resolv'd to put my self upon the Watch, to see them when they came on Shore,
               and leave the rest to the Event, taking such Measures as the Opportunity should
               present, let be what would be.</p>
            <p>With these Resolutions in my Thoughts, I set my self upon the Scout, as often as
               possible, and indeed so often till I was heartily tir'd of
               it, for it was above a Year and Half that I waited, and for great part of that Time
               went out to the <hi rend="italic">West</hi> End, and to the <hi rend="italic">South West</hi> Corner of the
               Island, almost every Day, to see for Canoes, but none appear'd. This was very
               discouraging, and began to trouble me much, tho' I cannot
               say that it did in this Case, as it had done some time before that, (<hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>)
               wear off the Edge of my Desire to the Thing. But the longer it seem'd to be delay'd,
               the more eager I was for it; in a Word, I was not at first so careful to shun the sight of these Savages, and avoid being seen
               by them, as I was now eager to be upon them.</p>
            <p>Besides, I fancied my self able to manage One, nay, Two or Three Savages, if I had
               them so as to make them entirely Slaves to me, to do whatever I should direct them,
               and to prevent their being able at any time to do me any
               Hurt. It was a great while, that I pleas'd my self with this Affair, but nothing
               still presented; all my Fancies and Schemes came to nothing, for no Savages came near
               me for a great while.</p>
            <p>About a Year and half after I had entertain'd these Notions, and by long musing, had
               as it were resolved them all into nothing, for want of an Occasion to put them in Execution, I was surpriz'd <pb n="238"
                  /> one Morning early, with seeing no less than five
                  <hi rend="italic">Canoes</hi> all on Shore together on my side the Island; and the People who
               belong'd to them all landed, and out of my sight: The Number of them broke all my
               Measures, for seeing so many, and knowing that they always came four or six, or
               sometimes more in a Boat, I could not tell what to think of it, or how to take my
               Measures, to attack Twenty or Thirty Men single handed; so I
               lay still in my Castle, perplex'd and discomforted: However I put my self into all
               the same Postures for an Attack that I had formerly
               provided, and was just ready for Action, if any Thing had presented; having waited a good while, listening to hear if they made any
               Noise; at length being very impatient, I set my Guns at the Foot of my Ladder, and
               clamber'd up to the Top of the Hill, by my two Stages as usual; standing so however
               that my Head did not appear above the Hill, so that they could not perceive me by any
               Means; here I observ'd by the help of my Perspective Glass, that they were no less
               than Thirty in Number, that they had a Fire kindled, that they had had Meat dress'd.
               How they had cook'd it, that I knew not, or what it was; but they were all Dancing in
               I know not how many barbarous Gestures and Figures, their own Way, round the
               Fire.</p>
            <p>While I was thus looking on them, I perceived by my Perspective, two miserable
               Wretches dragg'd from the Boats, where it seems they were laid by, and were now
               brought out for the Slaughter. I perceived one of them immediately fell, being
               knock'd down, I suppose with a Club or Wooden Sword, for that was their way, and two
               or three others were at work immediately cutting him open for their Cookery, while
               the other Victim was left standing by himself, till they should be ready for <pb
                  n="239" /> him. In that very Moment this poor Wretch
                  seeing himself a little at Liberty, Nature inspir'd him
               with Hopes of Life, and he started away from them, and ran with incredible Swiftness
               along the Sands directly towards me, I mean towards that part of the Coast, where my
               Habitation was.</p>
            <p>I was dreadfully frighted, (that I must acknowledge) when I
               perceived him to run my Way; and especially, when as I thought I saw him pursued by
               the whole Body, and now I expected that part of my Dream was coming to pass, and that
               he would certainly take shelter in my Grove; but I could not depend by any means upon
               my Dream for the rest of it, (<hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>) that the other Savages would not pursue
               him thither, and find him there. However I kept my Station, and my Spirits began to
               recover, when I found that there was not above three Men that follow'd him, and still
               more was I encourag'd, when I found that he outstrip'd them exceedingly in running,
               and gain'd Ground of them, so that if he could but hold it for half an Hour, I saw
               easily he would fairly get away from them all.</p>
            <p>There was between them and my Castle, the Creek which I mention'd often at the first
               part of my Story, when I landed my Cargoes out of the Ship; and this I saw plainly,
               he must necessarily swim over, or the poor Wretch would be taken there: But when the
               Savage escaping came thither, he made nothing of it, tho'
               the Tide was then up, but plunging in, swam thro' in about Thirty Strokes or
               thereabouts, landed and ran on with exceeding Strength and Swiftness; when the Three
               Persons came to the Creek, I found that Two of them could Swim, but the Third cou'd
               not, and that standing on the other Side, he look'd at the other, but went no
               further; and soon after went <pb n="240" /> softly back
               again, which as it happen'd, was very well for him in the
               main.</p>
            <p>I observ'd, that the two who swam, were yet more than twice as long swimming over the
               Creek, as the Fellow was, that fled from them: It came now very warmly upon my
               Thoughts, and indeed irresistibly, that now was my Time to get me a Servant, and
               perhaps a Companion, or Assistant; and that I was call'd plainly by Providence to
               save this poor Creature's Life; I immediately run down the Ladders with all possible
               Expedition, fetches my two Guns, for they were both but at the Foot of the Ladders,
               as I observ'd above; and getting up again, with the same haste, to the Top of the
               Hill, I cross'd toward the Sea; and having a very short Cut, and all down Hill, <ref
                  target="clap_" corresp="clap">clapp'd</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff"
                  xml:id="clap" target="clap_" type="gloss">Placed</note> my self in the way,
               between the Pursuers, and the Pursu'd; hallowing aloud to him that fled, who looking
               back, was at first perhaps as much frighted at me, as at them; but I beckon'd with my
               Hand to him, to come back; and in the mean time, I slowly advanc'd towards the two that follow'd; then rushing at once upon the foremost, I
               knock'd him down with the <ref target="stock_" corresp="stock">Stock</ref><note
                  resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="stock" target="stock_" type="gloss">The
                  butt of a gun</note> of my Piece; I was loath to fire, because I would not have
               the rest hear; though at that distance, it would not have been easily heard, and
               being out of Sight of the Smoke too, they wou'd not have easily known what to make of
               it: Having knock'd this Fellow down, the other who pursu'd with him stopp'd, as if he
               had been frighted; and I advanc'd a-pace towards him; but as
               I came nearer, I perceiv'd presently, he had a Bow and Arrow, and was fitting it to
               shoot at me; so I was then necessitated to shoot at him first, which I did, and
               kill'd him at the first Shoot; the poor Savage who fled, but had stopp'd; though he
               saw both his Enemies fallen, and kill'd, as he thought; yet <pb n="241"
                  /> was so frighted with the Fire, and Noise of my Piece;
               that he stood Stock still, and neither came forward or went backward, tho' he seem'd
               rather enclin'd to fly still, than to come on; I hollow'd again to him, and made
               Signs to come forward, which he easily understood, and came a little way, then
               stopp'd again, and then a little further, and stopp'd again, and I cou'd then
               perceive that he stood trembling, as if he had been taken Prisoner, and had just been
               to be kill'd, as his two Enemies were; I beckon'd him again to come to me, and gave
               him all the Signs of Encouragement that I could think of, and he came nearer and
               nearer, kneeling down every Ten or Twelve steps in token of acknowledgement for my
               saving his Life: I smil'd at him, and look'd pleasantly, and beckon'd to him to come
               still nearer; at length he came close to me, and then he kneel'd down again, kiss'd
               the Ground, and laid his Head upon the Ground, and taking me
               by the Foot, set my Foot upon his Head; this it seems was in token of swearing to be
               my Slave for ever; I took him up, and made much of him, and encourag'd him all I
               could. But there was more work to do yet, for I perceived the Savage who I knock'd down, was not kill'd, but stunn'd with
               the blow, and began to come to himself; so I pointed to him,
               and showing him the Savage, that he was not dead; upon this
               he spoke some Words to me, and though I could not understand
               them, yet I thought they were pleasant to hear, for they were the first sound of a
               Man's Voice, that I had heard, <hi rend="italic">my own excepted,</hi> for above Twenty Five Years.
               But there was no time for such Reflections now, the Savage
               who was knock'd down recover'd himself so far, as to sit up upon the Ground, and I
               perceived that my Savage began to be afraid; but when I saw that, I presented my other <pb n="242" /> Piece at the
               Man, as if I would shoot him, upon this my Savage, <hi rend="italic">for so I call him now,</hi>
               made a Motion to me to lend him my Sword, which hung naked in a Belt by my side; so I
               did, he no sooner had it, but he runs to his Enemy, and at
               one blow cut off his Head as cleaverly, no Executioner in <hi rend="italic">Germany,</hi> could
               have done it sooner or better; which I thought very strange, for one who I had Reason
               to believe never saw a Sword in his Life before, except
               their own Wooden Swords; however it seems, as I learn'd afterwards, they make their
               Wooden Swords so sharp, so heavy, and the Wood is so hard, that they will cut off
               Heads even with them, ay and Arms, and that at one blow too; when he had done this,
               he comes laughing to me in Sign of Triumph, and brought me the Sword again, and with
               abundance of Gestures which I did not understand, laid it down with the Head of the
               Savage, that he had kill'd just before me.</p>
            <p>But that which astonish'd him most, was to know how I had kill'd the other Indian so
               far off, so pointing to him, he made Signs to me to let him go to him, so I bad him
               go, as well as I could, when he came to him, he stood like one amaz'd, looking at
               him, turn'd him first on one side, then on t'other, look'd at the Wound the Bullet
               had made, which it seems was just in his Breast, where it had made a Hole, and no
               great Quantity of Blood had follow'd, but he had bled inwardly, for he was quite
               dead; He took up his Bow, and Arrows, and came back, so I
               turn'd to go away, and beckon'd to him to follow me, making Signs to him, that more
               might come after them.</p>
            <p>Upon this he sign'd to me, that he should bury them with Sand, that they might not be
               seen by the rest if they follow'd; and so I made Signs again to him to do so; he fell
               to Work, and in an instant he <pb n="243" /> had scrap'd a
               Hole in the Sand, with his Hands, big enough to bury the first in, and then dragg'd
               him into it, and cover'd him, and did so also by the other; I believe he had bury'd
               them both in a Quarter of an Hour; then calling him away, I carry'd him not to my Castle, but quite away to my Cave, on the
               farther Part of the Island; so I did not let my Dream come to pass in that Part,
                  <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> That he came into my Grove for shelter.</p>
            <p>Here I gave him Bread, and a Bunch of Raisins to eat, and a Draught of Water, which I
               found he was indeed in great Distress for, by his Running; and having refresh'd him,
               I made Signs for him to go lie down and sleep; pointing to a Place where I had laid a
               great Parcel of Rice Straw, and a Blanket upon it, which I used to sleep upon my self
               sometimes; so the poor Creature laid down, and went to sleep.</p>
            <p>He was a comely handsome Fellow, perfectly well made; with straight strong Limbs, not
               too large; tall and well shap'd, and as I reckon, about twenty six Years of Age. He
               had a very good Countenance, not a fierce and surly Aspect; but seem'd to have
               something very manly in his Face, and yet he had all the Sweetness and Softness of an
                  <hi rend="italic">European</hi> in his Countenance too, especially when he smil'd. His Hair was
               long and black, not curl'd like Wool; his Forehead very high, and large, and a great
               Vivacity and sparkling Sharpness in his Eyes. The Colour of his Skin was not quite
               black, but very tawny; and yet not of an ugly yellow nauseous tawny, as the
                  <hi rend="italic">Brasilians,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Virginians,</hi> and other Natives of <hi rend="italic">America</hi> are; but of a bright kind of a dun olive Colour, that had in it something very agreeable; tho' not very
               easy to describe. His Face was round, and plump; his Nose small, not flat like the
                  Negroes, a very good Mouth, thin Lips, and his <pb
                  n="244" /> fine Teeth well set, and white as Ivory. After
               he had slumber'd, rather than slept, about half an Hour, he wak'd again, and comes
               out of the Cave to me; for I had been milking my Goats, which I had in the Enclosure
               just by: When he espy'd me, he came running to me, laying himself down again upon the
               Ground, with all the possible Signs of an humble thankful Disposition, making a many
               antick Gestures to show it: At last he lays his Head flat upon the Ground, close to
               my Foot, and sets my other Foot upon his Head, as he had done before; and after this,
               made all the Signs to me of Subjection, Servitude, and Submission imaginable, to let
               me know, how he would serve me as long as he liv'd; I understood him in many Things,
               and let him know, I was very well pleas'd with him; in a little Time I began to speak
               to him, and teach him to speak to me; and first, I made him know his Name should be
                  <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> which was the Day I sav'd his Life; I call'd him so for the
               Memory of the Time; I likewise taught him to say <hi rend="italic">Master,</hi> and then let him
               know, that was to be my Name; I likewise taught him to say, YES, and NO, and to know
               the Meaning of them; I gave him some Milk, in an earthen Pot, and let him see me
               Drink it before him, and sop my Bread in it; and I gave him a Cake of Bread, to do
               the like, which he quickly comply'd with, and made Signs that it was very good for
               him.</p>
            <p>I kept there with him all that Night; but as soon as it was Day, I beckon'd to him to
               come with me, and let him know, I would give him some Cloaths, at which he seem'd
               very glad, for he was stark naked: As we went by the Place where he had bury'd the
               two Men, he pointed exactly to the Place, and shew'd me the Marks that he had made to
               find them again, making Signs to me, <pb n="245" /> that we
               should dig them up again, and eat them; at this I appear'd very angry, express'd my
                  Abhorrence of it, made as if I would vomit at the
               Thoughts of it, and beckon'd with my Hand to him to come away, which he did
               immediately, with great Submission. I then led him up to the Top of the Hill, to see
               if his Enemies were gone; and pulling out my Glass, I look'd, and saw plainly the Place where they had been, but no appearance of them, or of their <hi rend="italic">Canoes</hi>; so that it was
               plain they were gone, and had left their two Comrades behind them, without any search
               after them.</p>
            <p>But I was not content with this Discovery; but having now more Courage, and
               consequently more Curiosity, I takes my Man <ref target="friday_" corresp="friday"

                  to an especially faithful servant or personal assistant. It came into use with the
                  release of the film "His Girl Friday" (1940), whose title alludes to Defoe's
                  novel.</note> with me, giving him the Sword in his Hand, with the Bow and Arrows
               at his Back, which I found he could use very dextrously, making him carry one Gun for
               me, and I two for my self, and away we march'd to the Place, where these Creatures
               had been; for I had a Mind now to get some fuller Intelligence of them: When I came
               to the Place, my very Blood ran chill in my Veins, and my Heart sunk within me, at
               the Horror of the Spectacle: Indeed it was a dreadful Sight, at least it was so to
               me; though <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> made nothing of it: The Place was cover'd with humane
               Bones, the Ground dy'd with their Blood, great Pieces of Flesh left here and there,
               half eaten, mangl'd and scorch'd; and in short, all the Tokens of the triumphant
               Feast they had been making there, after a Victory over their Enemies: I saw three
               Skulls, five Hands, and the Bones of three or four Legs and Feet, and abundance of
               other Parts of the Bodies; and <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> by his Signs, made me understand,
               that they brought over four Prisoners to feast upon; that three of them were eaten
               up, <pb n="246" /> and that he, pointing to himself, was the
               fourth: That there had been a great Battle between them, and their next King, whose
               Subjects it seems he had been one of; and that they had taken a great Number of Prisoners, all which were carry'd to several Places
               by those that had taken them in the Fight, in order to feast upon them, as was done
               here by these Wretches upon those they brought hither.</p>
            <p>I caus'd <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> to gather all the Skulls, Bones, Flesh, and whatever
               remain'd, and lay them togethere on a Heap, and make a great
               Fire upon it, and burn them all to Ashes: I found <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> had still a
               hankering Stomach after some of the Flesh, and was still a Cannibal in his Nature;
               but I <ref target="demonstrate_" corresp="demonstrate">discover'd</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="demonstrate"

               he offer'd it.</p>
            <p>When we had done this, we came back to our Castle, and there I fell to work for my
               Man <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi>; and first of all, I gave him a pair of Linnen Drawers, which I had out of the poor Gunner's Chest I mention'd,
               and which I found in the Wreck; and which with a little Alteration fitted him very
               well; then I made him a Jerkin of Goat's-skin, as well as my Skill would allow; and I
               was now grown a tollerable good Taylor; and I gave him a Cap, which I had made of a
               Hare-skin, very convenient, and fashionable enough; and thus he was cloath'd for the
               present, tollerably well; and was mighty well pleas'd to see himself almost as well
               cloath'd as his Master: It is true, he went awkardly in these Things at first;
               wearing the Drawers was very awkard to him, and the Sleeves of the Wast-coat gall'd
               his Shoulders, and the inside of his Arms; but a little easing them where he
               complain'd <pb n="247" /> they hurt him, and using himself
               to them, at length he took to them very well.</p>
            <p>The next Day after I came home to my Hutch with him, I began to consider where I
               should lodge him, and that I might do well for him, and yet be perfectly easy my
               self; I made a little Tent for him in the vacant Place between my two Fortifications,
               in the inside of the last, and in the outside of the first; and as there was a Door,
               or Entrance there into my Cave, I made a formal fram'd Door Case, and a Door to it of
               Boards, and set it up in the Passage, a little within the Entrance; and causing the
               Door to open on the inside, I barr'd it up in the Night, taking in my Ladders too; so
               that <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> could no way come at me in the inside of my innermost Wall,
               without making so much Noise in getting over, that it must needs waken me; for my
               first Wall had now a compleat Roof over it of long Poles, covering all my Tent, and
               leaning up to the side of the Hill, which was again laid cross with smaller Sticks
                  instead of <ref target="laths_" corresp="laths"
                  >Laths</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="laths" target="laths_"
                  type="gloss">Thin, narrow strips of wood used to form a groundwork upon which to
                  fasten the slates of a roof</note>, and then thatch'd over a great Thickness, with
               the Rice Straw, which was strong like Reeds; and at the Hole or Place which was left
               to go in or out by the Ladder, I had plac'd a kind of Trap-door, which if it had been
                  attempted on the outside, would not have open'd at all,
               but would have fallen down, and made a great Noise; and as to Weapons, I took them
               all in to my Side every Night.</p>
            <p>But I needed none of all this Precaution; for never Man had
               a more faithful, loving, sincere Servant, than
                  <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> was to me; without Passions, Sullenness or Designs, perfectly
               oblig'd and engag'd; his very Affections were ty'd to me,
               like those of a Child to a Father; and I dare say, he would have sacrific'd his Life
               for the saving mine, upon any occasion whatsoever; the many Testimonies <pb n="248" /> he gave me of
               this, put it out of doubt, and soon convinc'd me, that I needed to use no Precautions, as to my Safety on his Account.</p>
            <p>This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that with wonder, that however it
               had pleas'd God, in his Providence, and in the Government of the Works of his Hands,
               to take from so great a Part of the World of his Creatures, the best uses to which
               their Faculties, and the Powers of their Souls are adapted; yet that he has bestow'd
               upon them the same Powers, the same Reason, the same Affections, the same Sentiments
               of Kindness and Obligation, the same Passions and Resentments of Wrongs; the same
               Sense of Gratitude, Sincerity, Fidelity, and all the Capacities of doing Good, and
               receiving Good, that he has given to us; and that when he pleases to offer to them
               Occasions of exerting these, they are as ready, nay, more ready to apply them to the
               right Uses for which they were bestow'd, than we are; and this made me very
               melancholly sometimes, in reflecting as the several Occasions presented, how mean a
               Use we make of all these, even though we have these Powers enlighten'd by the great Lamp of Instruction, the Spirit of
               God, and by the Knowledge of his Word, added to our Understanding; and why it has
               pleas'd God to hide the like saving Knowledge from so many
               Millions of Souls, who if I might judge by this poor Savage, would make a much better
               use of it than we did.</p>
            <p>From hence, I sometimes was led too far to invade the Soveraignty of
                  <hi rend="italic">Providence,</hi> and as it were arraign the Justice of so arbitrary a
               Disposition of Things, that should hide that Light from some, and reveal it to
               others, and yet expect a like Duty from both: But I shut it up, and check'd my
               Thoughts with this Conclusion, (1st.) That we <pb n="249" />
               did not know by what Light and Law these should be Condemn'd; but that as God was
               necessarily, and by the Nature of his Being, infinitely Holy and Just, so it could
               not be; but that if these Creatures were all sentenc'd to Absence from himself, it was on account of sinning against that Light which,
               as the Scripture says, was a Law to themselves, and by such
               Rules as their Consciences would acknowledge to be just, tho' the Foundation was not
               discover'd to us: And (2d.) that still as we are all the Clay in the Hand of the
               Potter, no Vessel could say to him, Why hast thou form'd me thus?</p>
            <p>But to return to my New Companion; I was greatly delighted with him, and made it my
                  Business to teach him every Thing, that was proper to
               make him useful, handy, and helpful; but especially to make
               him speak, and understand me when I spake, and he was the aptest Schollar that ever
               was, and particularly was so merry, so constantly diligent, and so pleased, when he
               cou'd but understand me, or make me understand him, that it
               was very pleasant to me to talk to him; and now my Life began to be so easy, that I
               began to say to my self, that could I but have been safe from more Savages, I cared
               not, if I was never to remove from the place while I lived.</p>

            <p>After I had been two or three Days return'd to my Castle, I thought that, in order to
               bring <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> off from his horrid way of feeding, and from the Relish of a
               Cannibal's Stomach, I ought to let him taste other Flesh; so I took him out with me
               one Morning to the Woods: I went indeed intending to kill a Kid out of my own Flock,
               and bring him home and dress it. But as I was going, I saw a She Goat lying down in
               the Shade, and two young Kids sitting by her, I catch'd hold of <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> hold says I, stand still; and made Signs to him
                  <pb n="250" /> not to stir, immediately I presented my
               Piece, shot and kill'd one of the Kids. The poor Creature who had at a Distance
               indeed seen me kill the Savage his Enemy, but did not know, or could imagine how it
               was done, was sensibly surpriz'd, trembled, and shook, and
               look'd so amaz'd, that I thought he would have sunk down. He
               did not see the Kid I shot at, or perceive I had kill'd it, but ripp'd up his
               Wastcoat to feel if he was not wounded, and as I found, presently thought I was
               resolv'd to kill him; for he came and kneel'd down to me, and embraceing my Knees,
               said a great many Things I did not understand; but I could
               easily see that the meaning was to pray me not to kill him.</p>
            <p>I soon found a way to convince him that I would do him no harm, and taking him up by
               the Hand laugh'd at him, and pointed to the Kid which I had kill'd, beckoned to him
               to run and fetch it, which he did; and while he was wondering and looking to see how
               the Creature was kill'd, I loaded my Gun again, and by and
               by I saw a great Fowl like a Hawk sit upon a Tree within Shot; so to let
                  <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> understand a little what I would do, I call'd him to me again,
               pointed at the Fowl which was indeed a Parrot, tho' I thought it had been a Hawk, I
               say pointing to the Parrot, and to my Gun, and to the Ground under the Parrot, to let
               him see I would make it fall, I made him understand that I would shoot and kill that
               Bird; according I fir'd and bad him look, and immediately he saw the Parrot fall, he
               stood like one frighted again, notwithstanding all I had
               said to him; and I found he was the more amaz'd, because he did not see me put any
               Thing into the Gun; but thought that there must be some wonderful Fund of Death and
               Destruction in that Thing, able to kill Man, Beast, <pb n="251"
                  /> Bird, or any Thing near, or far off; and the Astonishment this created in him was such, as could not wear off
               for a long Time; and I believe, if I would have let him, he would have worshipp'd me
               and my Gun: As for the Gun it self, he would not so much as touch it for several Days
               after; but would speak to it, and talk to it, as if it had answer'd him, when he was by himself; which, as I afterwards learn'd of him, was to
               desire it not to kill him.</p>
            <p>Well, after his Astonishment was a little over at this, I pointed to him to run and
               fetch the Bird I had shot, which he did, but stay'd some Time; for the Parrot not
               being quite dead, was flutter'd away a good way off from the Place where she fell;
               however, he found her, took her up, and brought her to me; and as I had perceiv'd his
               Ignorance about the Gun before, I took this Advantage to
               charge the Gun again, and not let him see me do it, that I might be ready for any
               other Mark that might present; but nothing more offer'd at that Time; so I brought
               home the Kid, and the same Evening I took the Skin off, and cut it out as well as I
               could; and having a Pot for that purpose, I boil'd, or stew'd some of the Flesh, and
               made some very good Broth; and after I had begun to eat some, I gave some to my Man,
               who seem'd very glad of it, and lik'd it very well; but that
               which was strangest to him, was, to see me eat Salt with it; he made a Sign to me,
               that the Salt was not good to eat, and putting a little into his own Mouth, he seem'd
               to nauseate it, and would spit and sputter at it, washing his Mouth with fresh Water
               after it; on the other hand, I took some Meat in my Mouth without Salt, and I
               pretended to spit and sputter for want of Salt, as fast as he had done at the Salt;
               but it would not do, he <pb n="252" /> would never care for
               Salt with his Meat, or in his Broth; at least not a great while, and then but a very
               little.</p>
            <p>Having thus fed him with boil'd Meat and Broth, I was resolv'd to feast him the next
               Day with roasting a Piece of the Kid; this I did by hanging it before the Fire, in a
               String, as I had seen many People do in <hi rend="italic">England,</hi> setting two Poles up, one
               on each side the Fire, and one cross on the Top, and tying the String to the
               Cross-stick, letting the Meat turn continually: This <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> admir'd very much; but when he came to taste the Flesh, he took so
               many ways to tell me how well he lik'd it, that I could not but understand him; and
               at last he told me he would never eat Man's Flesh any more, which I was very glad to
               hear.</p>
            <p>The next Day I set him to work to beating some Corn out, and sifting it in the manner
               I us'd to do, as I observ'd before, and he soon understood how to do it as well as I,
               especially after he had seen what the Meaning of it was, and that it was to make
               Bread of; for after that I let him see me make my Bread, and bake it too, and in a
               little Time <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> was able to do all the Work for me, as well as I could do
               it my self.</p>
            <p>I begun now to consider, that having two Mouths to feed, instead of one, I must
               provide more Ground for my Harvest, and plant a larger Quantity of Corn, than I us'd
               to do; so I mark'd out a larger Piece of Land, and began the Fence in the same Manner
               as before, in which <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> not only work'd very willingly, and very hard;
               but did it very chearfully, and I told him what it was for; that it was for Corn to
               make more Bread, because he was now with me, and that I might have enough for him,
               and my self too: He appear'd very sensible of that Part, and let me know, that he
               thought I had <pb n="253" /> much more Labour upon me on his
               Account, than I had for my self; and that he would work the harder for me, if I would
               tell him what to do.</p>
            <p>This was the pleasantest Year of all the Life I led in this Place; <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi>
               began to talk pretty well, and understand the Names of almost every Thing I had
               occasion to call for, and of every Place I had to send him to, and talk'd a great
               deal to me; so that in short I began now to have some Use for my Tongue again, which
               indeed I had very little occasion for before; that is to say, <hi rend="italic">about Speech</hi>;
               besides the Pleasure of talking to him, I had a singular Satisfaction in the Fellow himself; his simple unfeign'd Honesty,
               appear'd to me more and more every Day, and I began really to love the Creature; and
               on his Side, I believe he lov'd me more than it was possible for him ever to love any
               Thing before.</p>
            <p>I had a Mind once to try if he had any hankering Inclination to his own Country
               again, and having learn'd him <hi rend="italic">English</hi> so well that he could answer me almost
               any Questions, I ask'd him whether the Nation that he
               belong'd to never conquer'd in Battle, at which he smil'd; and said; yes, yes, we
               always fight the better; that is, he meant always get the better in Fight; and so we
               began the following Discourse: You always fight the better said I, How came you to be
               taken Prisoner then, <hi rend="italic">Friday?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Master,</hi> How beat; if your Nation beat them, how come you to be taken?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> They more many than my Nation in the Place where me was; they take
               one, two, three, and me; my Nation over beat them in the yonder Place, where me no
               was; there my Nation take one, two, great Thousand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Master,</hi> But why did not your Side recover you from the Hands of your Enemies
               then?</p>

               <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> They run one, two, three, and me, and make go in the <hi rend="italic">Canoe</hi>;
               my Nation have no <hi rend="italic">Canoe</hi> that time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Master,</hi> Well, <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> and What does your Nation do with the Men they take, do they carry them away, and eat them, as these
               did?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> Yes, my Nation eat Man's too, eat all up.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Master,</hi> Where do they carry them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> Go to other Place where they think.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Master,</hi> Do they come hither?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> Yes, yes, they come hither; come other else Place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Master,</hi> Have you been here with them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> Yes, I been here; [<hi rend="italic">points to the</hi> N. W. <hi rend="italic">Side of the
                  Island</hi>] which it seems was their Side.</p>
            <p>By this I understood, that my Man <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> had formerly been among the
               Savages, who us'd to come on Shore on the farther Part of the Island, on the same Man eating Occasions that he was now
               brought for; and sometime after, when I took the Courage to carry him to that Side,
                  being the same I formerly mention'd, he presently knew
               the Place, and told me, he was there once when they eat up twenty Men, two Women, and
               one Child; he could not tell Twenty in <hi rend="italic">English</hi>; but he numbred them by
               laying so many Stones on a Row, and pointing to me to tell them over.</p>
            <p>I have told this Passage, because it introduces what follows; that after I had had
               this Discourse with him, I ask'd him how far it was from our Island to the Shore, and whether the <hi rend="italic">Canoes</hi> were not often lost; he told
               me, there was no Danger, no <hi rend="italic">Canoes</hi> ever lost; but that after a little way
               out to the Sea, there was a Current, and Wind, always one way in the Morning, the
               other in the Afternoon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="255" />This I understood to be no more than the Sets
               of the Tide, as going out, or coming in; but I afterwards understood, it was
               occasion'd by the great Draft and Reflux of the mighty River <hi rend="italic">Oroonooko</hi>; in the Mouth, or the Gulph of which River, as I found afterwards, our Island lay; and this Land
               which I perceiv'd to the <hi rend="italic">W.</hi> and <hi rend="italic">N. W.</hi> was the great Island
                  <hi rend="italic">Trinidad,</hi> on the <hi rend="italic">North</hi> Point of the Mouth of the River: I ask'd
                  <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> a thousand Questions about the Country, the Inhabitants, the Sea,
               the Coast, and what Nation were near; he told me all he knew with the greatest
               Openness imaginable; I ask'd him the Names of the several
               Nations of his Sort of People; but could get no other Name
               than <hi rend="italic">Caribs</hi>; from whence I easily understood, that
               these were the <hi rend="italic">Caribbees,</hi> which our Maps place on the Part of
                  <hi rend="italic">America,</hi> which reaches from the Mouth of the River <hi rend="italic">Oroonooko</hi> to
                  <hi rend="italic">Guiana,</hi> and onwards to <hi rend="italic">St. Martha:</hi> He told me that up a great
               way beyond the Moon, that was, beyond the Setting of the Moon, which must be
                  <hi rend="italic">W.</hi> from their Country, there dwelt white bearded Men, like me; and
               pointed to my great Whiskers, which I mention'd before; and that they had kill'd
                  <hi rend="italic">much Mans,</hi> that was his Word; by all which I understood, he meant the
                  <hi rend="italic">Spaniards,</hi> whose Cruelties in <hi rend="italic">America</hi> had been spread over the
               whole Countries, and was remember'd by all the Nations from Father to Son.</p>
            <p>I enquir'd if he could tell me how I might come from this Island, and get among those
               white Men; he told me, yes, yes, I might go <hi rend="italic">in two Canoe</hi>; I could not
               understand what he meant, or make him describe to me what he meant by <hi rend="italic">two
                  Canoe,</hi> till at last with great Difficulty, I found he meant it must be in a
               large great Boat, as big as <hi rend="italic">two Canoes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="256" />This Part of <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi>'s Discourse began
               to relish with me very well, and from this Time I entertain'd some Hopes, that one
               Time or other, I might find an Opportunity to make my Escape from this Place; and
               that this poor Savage might be a Means to help me to do it.</p>
            <p>During the long Time that <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> has now been with me, and that he began to
               speak to me, and understand me, I was not wanting to lay a Foundation of religious Knowledge in his Mind; particularly I ask'd him one Time who made him? The poor
               Creature did not understand me at all, but thought I had ask'd who was his Father;
               but I took it by another handle, and ask'd him who made the Sea, the Ground we walk'd
               on, and the Hills, and Woods; he told me it was one old <hi rend="italic">Benamuckee,</hi> that liv'd beyond all: He could describe nothing of this great
               Person, but that he was very old; much older he said than the Sea, or the Land; than
               the Moon, or the Stars: I ask'd him then, if this old Person had made all Things, why
               did not all Things worship him; he look'd very grave, and with a perfect Look of
               Innocence, said, <hi rend="italic">All Things do say O to him:</hi> I ask'd him if the People who
               die in his Country went away any where; he said, yes, they all went to <ref

                  type="gloss">There is no historic mythological source for this deity.</note>; then
               I ask'd him whether these they eat up went thither too, he said yes.</p>
            <p>From these Things, I began to instruct him in the Knowledge of the true God: I told
               him that the great Maker of all Things liv'd up there, pointing up towards Heaven:
               That he governs the World by the same Power and Providence by which he had made it:
               That he was omnipotent, could do every Thing for us, give every Thing to us, take
               every Thing from us; and thus by Degrees I open'd his Eyes.
               He listned with great Attention, <pb n="257"
                  /> and receiv'd with Pleasure the Notion of <hi rend="italic">Jesus
                  Christ</hi> being sent to redeem us, and of the Manner of making our Prayers to
               God, and his being able to hear us, even into Heaven; he told me one Day, that if our
               God could hear us up beyond the Sun, he must needs be a
               greater God than their <hi rend="italic">Benamuckee,</hi> who liv'd but a little way off, and yet
               could not hear, till they went up to the great Mountains where he dwelt, to speak to
               him; I ask'd him if ever he went thither, to speak to him; he said no, they never
               went that were young Men; none went thither but the old Men, who he call'd their <ref

                  type="gloss">There is no historical source for this.</note> that is, as I made him
               explain it to me, their Religious, or Clergy, and that they went to say <hi rend="italic">O,</hi>
               (so he called saying Prayers) and then came back, and told them what
                  <hi rend="italic">Benamuckee</hi> said: By this I observ'd, That there is <hi rend="italic">Priestcraft,</hi>
               even amongst the most blinded ignorant Pagans in the World;
               and the Policy of making a secret Religion, in order to
               preserve the Veneration of the People to the Clergy, is not
               only to be found in the <hi rend="italic">Roman,</hi> but perhaps among
               all Religions in the World, even among the most brutish and barbarous Savages.</p>
            <p>I endeavour'd to clear up this Fraud, to my Man <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> and told him, that
               the Pretence of their old Men going up the Mountains, to say <hi rend="italic">O</hi> to their God
                  <hi rend="italic">Benamuckee,</hi> was a Cheat, and their bringing Word from thence what he
               said, was much more so; that if they met with any Answer, or spake with any one
               there, it must be with an evil Spirit: And then I entred into a long Discourse with him about the Devil, the Original of him, his
               Rebellion against God, his Enmity to Man, the Reason of it, his setting himself up in
               the dark Parts of the World to be Worship'd instead of God,
               and as God; and the many Stratagems <pb n="258"
                  /> he made use of to delude Mankind to his Ruine; how he
               had a secret access to our Passions, and to our Affections, to adapt his Snares so to
               our Inclinations, as to cause us even to be our own Tempters, and to run upon our
               Destruction by our own Choice.</p>
            <p>I found it was not so easie to imprint right Notions in his
               Mind about the Devil, as it was about the Being of a God. Nature assisted all my
                  Arguments to Evidence to him, even the Necessity of a
               great first Cause and over-ruling governing Power; a secret directing Providence, and
               of the Equity, and Justice, of paying Homage to him that made us, and the like. But
               there appeared nothing of all this in the Notion of an evil Spirit; of his Original, his Being, his Nature, and above all of his
               Inclination to do Evil, and to draw us in to do so too; and the poor Creature puzzl'd
               me once in such a manner, by a Question meerly natural and innocent, that I scarce
               knew what to say to him. I had been talking a great deal to him of the Power of God, his Omnipotence, his dreadful Nature to Sin, his
               being a consuming Fire to the Workers of Iniquity, how, as he had made us all, he
               could destroy us and all the World in a Moment; and he listen'd with great
               Seriousness to me all the while.</p>
            <p>After this, I had been telling him how the Devil was God's
               Enemy in the Hearts of Men, and used all his Malice and Skill to defeat the good
               Designs of Providence, and to ruine the Kingdom of Christ in the World; and the like.
               Well, says <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> but you say, God is so strong, so great, is he not much
               strong, much might as the Devil? Yes, yes, says I, <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> God is stronger
               than the Devil, God is above the Devil, and therefore we pray to God to tread him
               down under our Feet, <pb n="259" /> and enable us to resist
               his Temptations and quench his fiery Darts. <hi rend="italic">But,</hi> says he again, <hi rend="italic">if God
                  much strong, much might as the Devil, why God no kill the Devil, so make him no
                  more do wicked?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was strangely surpriz'd at his Question, and after all, tho' I was now an old Man,
               yet I was but a young Doctor, and ill enough quallified for a Casuist, or a Solver of
               Difficulties: And at first I could not tell what to say, so I pretended not to hear
               him, and ask'd him what he said? But he was too earnest for an Answer to forget his
                  Question; so that he repeated it in the very same broken
               Words, as above. By this time I had recovered my self a little, and I said, <hi rend="italic">God
                  will at last punish him severely</hi>; he is <hi rend="italic">reserv'd for the Judgment, and is
                  to be cast into the Bottomless-Pit, to dwell with everlasting Fire.</hi> This did not satisfie <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> but he returns upon
               me, repeating my Words, RESERVE, AT LAST, <hi rend="italic">me no underderstand; but, Why not kill
                  the Devil now, not kill great ago?</hi> You may as well ask me, <hi rend="italic">said I,</hi>
               Why God does not kill you and I, when we do wicked Things here that offend him? We
               are preserv'd to repent and be pardon'd: He muses a while at this; <hi rend="italic">well,
                  well,</hi> says he, mighty affectionately, <hi rend="italic">that well; so you, I, Devil, all
                     wicked, all preserve, repent, God pardon all.</hi>
               Here I was run down again by him to the last Degree, and it was a Testimony to me,
               how the meer Notions of Nature, though they will guide reasonable Creatures to the Knowledge of a God, and of a Worship or Homage due to the supreme Being, of God as the
               Consequence of our Nature; yet nothing but divine Revelation can from the Knowledge
               of <hi rend="italic">Jesus Christ,</hi> and of a Redemption purchas'd for
               us, of a Mediator of the new Covenant, and of an Intercessor, at the Foot-stool of
               God's Throne; I say, nothing but a Revelation from Heaven, can form these in <pb
                  n="260" /> the Soul, and that therefore the Gospel of our
               Lord and Saviour <hi rend="italic">Jesus Christ</hi>; I mean, the Word of God, and the Spirit of
               God promis'd for the Guide and Sanctifier of his People, are the absolutely necessary Instructors of the Souls of Men, in the saving
               Knowledge of God, and the Means of Salvation.</p>
            <p>I therefore diverted the present Discourse between me and my
               Man, rising up hastily, as upon some sudden Occasion of going out; then sending him
               for something a good way off, I seriously pray'd to God that he would enable me to
               instruct savingly this poor Savage, assisting by his Spirit
               the Heart of the poor ignorant Creature, to receive the Light of the Knowledge of God
               in <hi rend="italic">Christ,</hi> reconciling him to himself, and would
               guide me to speak so to him from the Word of God, as his Conscience might be
               convinc'd, his Eyes open'd, and his Soul sav'd. When he came again to me, I entred
               into a long Discourse with him upon the Subject of the Redemption of Man by the
               Saviour of the World, and of the Doctrine of the Gospel preach'd from Heaven,
                  <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> of Repentance towards God, and Faith in our Blessed Lord
                  <hi rend="italic">Jesus.</hi> I then explain'd to him, as well as I could, why our Blessed
               Redeemer took not on him the Nature of Angels, but the Seed of <hi rend="italic">Abraham,</hi> and
               how for that Reason the fallen Angels had no Share in the Redemption; that he came
               only to the lost Sheep of the House of <hi rend="italic">Israel,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>I had, <hi rend="italic">God knows,</hi> more Sincerity than Knowledge, in
               all the Methods I took for this poor Creature's Instruction, and must acknowledge
               what I believe all that act upon the same Principle will find, That in laying Things
               open to him, I really inform'd and instructed my self in many Things, that either I
               did not know, or had not fully consider'd <pb n="261" />
               before; but which occurr'd naturally to my Mind, upon my searching into them, for the
               Information of this poor Savage; and I had more Affection in my Enquiry after Things
               upon this Occasion, than ever I felt before; so that whether this poor wild Wretch
               was the better for me, or no, I had great Reason to be thankful that ever he came to
               me: My Grief set lighter upon me, my Habitation grew comfortable to me beyond
               Measure; and when I reflected that in this solitary Life which I had been confin'd
               to, I had not only been moved my self to look up to Heaven, and to seek to the Hand
               that had brought me there; but was now to be made an Instrument under Providence to
               save the Life, and <hi rend="italic">for ought I knew,</hi> the Soul of a poor Savage, and bring him to the true Knowledge of Religion, and
               of the Christian Doctrine, that he might know Christ Jesus, <hi rend="italic">to know whom is Life
                     eternal.</hi> I say, when I reflected upon all these
               Things, a secret Joy run through every Part of my Soul, and I frequently rejoyc'd
               that ever I was brought to this Place, which I had so often thought the most dreadful
               of all Afflictions that could possibly have befallen me.</p>
            <p>In this thankful Frame I continu'd all the Remainder of my
               Time, and the Conversation which employ'd the Hours between <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> and I,
               was such, as made the three Years which we liv'd there together perfectly and
               compleatly happy, <hi rend="italic">if any such Thing as compleat Happiness can be form'd in a
                     sublunary State.</hi> The Savage was now a good
                  Christian, a much better than I; though I have reason to
               hope, and bless God for it, that we were equally penitent, and comforted restor'd
               Penitents; we had here the Word of God to read, and no farther off from his Spirit to
               instruct, than if we had been in <hi rend="italic">England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="262" />I always apply'd my self in Reading the
                  Scripture, to let him know, as well as I could, the
               Meaning of what I read; and he again, by his serious
               Enquiries, and Questionings, made me, <hi rend="italic">as I said before,</hi> a much better
               Scholar in the Scripture Knowledge, than I should ever have been by my own private
               meer Reading. Another thing I cannot refrain from observing
               here also from Experience, in this retir'd Part of my Life,
                  <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> How infinite and inexpressible a Blessing
               it is, that the Knowledge of God, and of the Doctrine of Salvation by <hi rend="italic">Christ Jesus,</hi> is so plainly laid down in the Word of God; so easy
               to be receiv'd and understood: That as the bare reading the
               Scripture made me capable of understanding enough of my Duty, to carry me directly on
               to the great Work of sincere Repentance for my Sins, and laying hold of a Saviour for Life and Salvation, to a stated Reformation in Practice,
               and Obedience to all God's Commands, and this without any Teacher or Instructer; I mean, humane; so the same plain
               Instruction sufficiently serv'd to the enlightning this
               Savage Creature, and bringing him to be such a Christian, as I have known few equal
               to him in my Life.</p>
            <p>As to all the Disputes, Wranglings, Strife and Contention, which has happen'd in the
               World about Religion, whether Niceties in Doctrines, or Schemes of Church Government,
               they were all perfectly useless to us; as for ought I can
               yet see, they have been to all the rest of the World: We had the <hi rend="italic">sure Guide</hi>
               to Heaven, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> The Word of God; and we had, <hi rend="italic">blessed be God,</hi>
               comfortable Views of the Spirit of God teaching and
               instructing us by his Word, <hi rend="italic">leading us into all Truth,</hi> and making us both
                  willing and obedient to the Instruction of his Word; and
               I cannot see the least Use that the greatest <pb n="263" />
               Knowledge of the disputed Points in Religion which have made such Confusions in the
               World would have been to us, if we could have obtain'd it;
               but I must go on with the Historical Part of Things, and take every Part in its
               order.</p>
            <p>After <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> and I became more intimately acquainted, and that he could understand almost all I said to him, and speak
               fluently, though in broken <hi rend="italic">English</hi> to me; I acquainted him with my own Story, or at least so much of it as related to my coming into
               the Place, how I had liv'd there, and how long. I let him into the Mystery, for such
               it was to him, of Gunpowder, and Bullet, and taught him how to shoot: I gave him a
               Knife, which he was wonderfully delighted with, and I made
               him a Belt, with a Frog hanging to it, such as in <hi rend="italic">England</hi> we wear <ref
                  target="hanger_" corresp="hanger">Hangers</ref><note
                  resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="hanger" target="hanger_" type="gloss"
                  >Swords</note> in; and in the Frog, instead of a Hanger, I gave him a Hatchet,
               which was not only as good a Weapon in some Cases, but much more useful upon other Occasions.</p>
            <p>I describ'd to him the Country of <hi rend="italic">Europe,</hi> and particularly <hi rend="italic">England,</hi>
               which I came from; how we liv'd, how we worshipp'd God, how we behav'd to one
               another; and how we traded in Ships to all Parts of the World: I gave him an Account
               of the Wreck which I had been on board of, and shew'd him as near as I could, the
               Place where she lay; but she was all beaten in Pieces before, and gone.</p>
            <p>I shew'd him the Ruins of our Boat, which we lost when we escap'd, and which I could
               not stir with my whole Strength then; but was now fallen almost all to Pieces: Upon
               seeing this Boat, <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> stood musing a great while, and said nothing; I
               ask'd him what it was he study'd upon, at last says he, <hi rend="italic">me see such Boat like
                  come to Place at my Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I did not understand him a good while; but at last, when I had examin'd farther into
               it, I understood <pb n="264" /> by
               him, that a Boat, such as that had been, came on Shore upon the Country where he
               liv'd; that is, as he explain'd it, was driven thither by Stress of Weather: I
               presently imagin'd, that some <hi rend="italic">European</hi> Ship must have been cast away upon
               their Coast, and the Boat might get loose, and drive a Shore; but was so dull, that I
               never once thought of Men making escape from a Wreck thither, much less whence they
               might come; so I only enquir'd after a Description of the
               Boat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> describ'd the Boat to me well enough; but brought me better to
               understand him, when he added with some Warmth, <hi rend="italic">we save
                  the white Mans from drown:</hi> Then I presently ask'd him, if there was any <hi rend="italic">white Mans,</hi> as he call'd them, in the Boat;
                  <hi rend="italic">yes,</hi> he said, <hi rend="italic">the Boat full white Mans:</hi> I ask'd him how many; he
               told upon his Fingers seventeen: I ask'd him then what become of them; he told me,
                  <hi rend="italic">they live, they dwell at my Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This put new Thoughts into my Head; for I presently imagin'd, that these might be the
               Men belonging to the Ship, that was cast away in Sight of <hi rend="italic">my Island,</hi> as I
               now call it; and who after the Ship was struck on the Rock, and they saw her inevitably lost, had sav'd themselves in their Boat, and were
               landed upon that wild Shore among the Savages.</p>
            <p>Upon this, I enquir'd of him more critically, What was become of them? He assur'd me
               they lived still there; that they had been there about four
               Years; that the Savages let them alone, and gave them Victuals to live. I ask'd him,
               How it came to pass they did not kill them and eat them? He said, <hi rend="italic">No, they make
                  Brother with them</hi>; that is, as I understood him, a Truce: And then he added,
                  <hi rend="italic">They no eat Mans but when make the War fight</hi>; that is to <pb n="265"
                  /> say, they never eat any Men but such as come to fight
               with them, and are taken in Battle.</p>
            <p>It was after this some considerable Time, that being upon the Top of the Hill, at the
                  <hi rend="italic">East</hi> Side of the Island, from whence as I have said, I had in a clear Day
               discover'd the Main, or Continent of <hi rend="italic">America; Friday,</hi> the Weather being very
               serene, looks very earnestly towards the Main Land, and in a kind of Surprise, falls
               a jumping and dancing, and calls out to me, for I was at some Distance from him: I
               ask'd him, What was the Matter? <hi rend="italic">O joy!</hi> Says he, <hi rend="italic">O glad! There see my
                  Country, there my Nation!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I observ'd an extraordinary Sense of Pleasure appear'd in
               his Face, and his Eyes sparkled, and his Countenance discover'd a strange Eagerness,
               as if he had a Mind to be in his own Country again; and this Observation of mine, put
               a great many Thoughts into me, which made me at first not so easy about my new Man
                  <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> as I was before; and I made no doubt, but that if <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi>
               could get back to his own Nation again, he would not only forget all his Religion,
               but all his Obligation to me; and would be forward enough to give his Countrymen an
               Account of me, and come back perhaps with a hundred or two
               of them, and make a Feast upon me, at which he might be as merry as he us'd to be
               with those of his Enemies, when they were taken in War.</p>
            <p>But I wrong'd the poor honest Creature very much, for which I was very sorry
               afterwards. However as my Jealousy encreased, and held me some Weeks, I was a little
               more circumspect, and not so familiar and kind to him as before; in which I was
               certainly in the Wrong too, the honest grateful Creature
               having no thought about it, but what consisted with the best Principles, both <pb
                  n="266" /> as a religious Christian, and as a grateful
               Friend, as appeared afterwards to my full Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>While my Jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was every Day pumping him to see
               if he would discover any of the new Thoughts, which I suspected were in him; but I found every thing he said was so Honest, and so Innocent,
               that I could find nothing to nourish my Suspicion; and in spight of all my Uneasiness
               he made me at last entirely his own again, nor did he in the
               least perceive that I was Uneasie, and therefore I could not
               suspect him of Deceit.</p>
            <p>One Day walking up the same Hill, but the Weather being haizy at Sea, so that we
               could not see the Continent, I call'd to him, and said, <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> do not you wish your self in your own Country, your own Nation? Yes, he said, <hi rend="italic">he be much O glad to
                  be at his own Nation.</hi> What would you do there said I, would you turn Wild
               again, eat Mens Flesh again, and be a Savage as you were before. He lookt full of
               Concern, and shaking his Head said, <hi rend="italic">No no,</hi> Friday <hi rend="italic">tell them to live
                  Good,</hi> tell them <hi rend="italic">to pray God,</hi> tell them <hi rend="italic">to eat Corn-bread,
                  Cattle-flesh, Milk, no eat Man again</hi>: Why then said I to him, <hi rend="italic">They will
                  kill you.</hi> He look'd grave at that, and then said, <hi rend="italic">No, they no kill me,
                  they willing love learn</hi>: He meant by this, they would be willing to learn. He
               added, they learn'd much of the Bearded-Mans that come in the Boat. Then I ask'd him
               if he would go back to them? He smil'd at that, and told me he could not swim so far.
               I told him I would make a <hi rend="italic">Canoe</hi> for him. He told me, <hi rend="italic">he would go, if I
                  would go with him.</hi> I go! says I, why they will Eat me if I come there? No,
               no, says he, <hi rend="italic">me make they no Eat you; me make they much Love you:</hi> He meant
               he would tell them how I had kill'd his Enemies, and sav'd his Life, and so he <pb
                  n="267" /> would make them love me; then he told me as
               well as he could, how kind they were to seventeen White-men, or Bearded-men, as he
               call'd them, who came on Shore there in Distress.</p>
            <p>From this time I confess I had a Mind to venture over, and see if I could possibly
               joyn with these Bearded-men, who I made no doubt were <hi rend="italic">Spaniards</hi> or
                  <hi rend="italic">Portuguese</hi>; not doubting but if I could we might find some Method to
               Escape from thence, being upon the Continent, and a good Company together; better
               than I could from an Island 40 Miles off the Shore, and alone without Help. So after
               some Days I took <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> to work again, by way of Discourse, and told him I
               would give him a Boat to go back to his own Nation; and accordingly I carry'd him to
               my Frigate which lay on the other Side of the Island, and having clear'd it of Water, for I always kept it sunk in the Water; I brought it out,
               shewed it him, and we both went into it.</p>
            <p>I found he was a most dextrous Fellow at managing it, would
               make it go almost as swift and fast again as I could; so when he was in, I said to
               him, Well now, <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> shall we go to your Nation?
               He look'd very dull at my saying so, which it seems was, because he thought the Boat
               too small to go so far. I told him then I had a bigger; so the next Day I went to the
               Place where the first Boat lay which I had made, but which I could not get into
               Water: He said that was big enough; but then as I had taken no Care of it, and it had
               lain two or three and twenty Years there, the Sun had split and dry'd it, that it was
               in a manner rotten. <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> told me such a Boat would do very well, and would
               carry <hi rend="italic">much enough Vittle, Drink, Bread,</hi> that was his Way of Talking.</p>
            <head> <ref target="Audio18_" corresp="Audio18">[Audio File]</ref><note xml:id="Audio18" target="Audio18_"><graphic url="https://lic-assets-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/defoe-crusoe/soundFiles/robinsoncrusoe_18_defoe_64kb.mp3"></graphic>Librivox recording, read by Mark F.

            <p>
               <pb n="268" />Upon the whole, I was by this Time so fix'd
               upon my Design of going over with him to the Continent, that I told him we would go
               and make one as big as that, and he should go home in it. He answer'd not one Word,
               but look'd very grave and sad: I ask'd him what was the matter with him? He ask'd me
               again thus; <hi rend="italic">Why, you angry mad with</hi> Friday, <hi rend="italic">what me done?</hi> I ask'd
               him what he meant; I told him I was not angry with him at all. <hi rend="italic">No angry! No
                  angry!</hi> says he, repeating the Words several Times, <hi rend="italic">Why send</hi> Friday
                  <hi rend="italic">home away to my Nation?</hi> Why, (says I) <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> did you not say
               you wish'd you were there? <hi rend="italic">Yes, yes,</hi> says he, <hi rend="italic">wish be both there, no
                  wish</hi> Friday <hi rend="italic">there, no Master there.</hi> In a Word, he would not think of
               going there without me; <hi rend="italic">I go there!</hi> Friday, (says I) <hi rend="italic">what shall I do
                  there?</hi> He turn'd very quick upon me at this: <hi rend="italic">You do great deal much
                  good,</hi> says he, <hi rend="italic">you teach wild Mans be good sober tame Mans; you tell them
                  know God, pray God, and live new Life. Alas!</hi> Friday, (says I) <hi rend="italic">thou
                  knowest not what thou sayest, I am but an ignorant Man my self. Yes, yes,</hi>
               says he, <hi rend="italic">you teachee me Good, you teachee them Good. No, no,</hi> Friday, (says
               I) <hi rend="italic">you shall go without me, leave me here to live by my self, as I did
                  before.</hi> He look'd confus'd again at that Word, and running to one of the
               Hatchets which he used to wear, he takes it up hastily, comes and gives it me,
                  <hi rend="italic">What must I do with this?</hi> says I to him. <hi rend="italic">You take, kill</hi> Friday;
               (says he.) <hi rend="italic">What must I kill you for?</hi> said I again. He returns very quick,
                  <hi rend="italic">What you send</hi> Friday <hi rend="italic">away for? take, kill</hi> Friday, <hi rend="italic">no
                  send</hi> Friday <hi rend="italic">away.</hi> This he spoke so
               earnestly, that I saw Tears stand in his Eyes: In a Word, I so plainly discover'd the
               utmost Affection in him to me, and a firm Resolution in him, that I told him then,
               and often after, that I would never send him away from me, if he was willing to stay
               with me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="269" />Upon the whole, as I found by all his
               Discourse a settled Affection to me, and that nothing should part him from me, so I
               found all the Foundation of his Desire to go to his own Country, was laid in his
               ardent Affection to the People, and his Hopes of my doing them good; a Thing which as
               I had no Notion of my self, so I had not the least Thought or Intention, or Desire of
               undertaking it. But still I found a strong Inclination to my attempting an Escape as
               above, founded on the Supposition gather'd from the
               Discourse, (<hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>) That there were seventeen bearded Men there; and
               therefore, without any more Delay, I went to Work with
                  <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> to find out a great Tree proper to fell, and make a large Periagua
               or Canoe to undertake the Voyage. There were Trees enough in the Island to have built
               a little Fleet, not of Periagua's and Canoes, but even of good large Vessels. But the
               main Thing I look'd at, was to get one so near the Water that we might launch it when
               it was made, to avoid the Mistake I committed at first.</p>
            <p>At last, <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi>

               it was much of the same Colour and Smell. <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> was for burning the Hollow
               or Cavity of this Tree out to make it for a Boat. But I shew'd him how rather to cut
               it out with Tools, which, after I had shew'd him how to use, he did very handily, and
               in about a Month's hard Labour, we finished it, and made it very handsome, especially
               when with our Axes, which I shew'd him how to handle, we cut and hew'd the out-side
               into the true Shape of a Boat; after this, however, it cost us near a Fortnight's
               Time to get <pb n="270" /> her along as it were Inch by Inch
               upon great Rowlers into the Water. But when she was in, she
               would have carry'd twenty Men with great Ease.</p>
            <p>When she was in the Water, and tho' she was so big it amazed me to see with what
               Dexterity and how swift my Man <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> would manage her, and paddle her
               along; so I ask'd him if he would, and if we might venture over in her. <hi rend="italic">Yes</hi>,
               he said, <hi rend="italic">he venture over in her very well, tho' great blow Wind.</hi> However, I
               had a farther Design that he knew nothing of, and that was to make a Mast and Sail
               and to fit her with an Anchor and Cable: As to a Mast, that was easy enough to get;
               so I pitch'd upon a strait young Cedar-Tree, which I found near the Place, and which
               there was great Plenty of in the Island, and I set <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> to Work to cut it
               down, and gave him Directions how to shape and order it. But as to the Sail, that was
               my particular Care; I knew I had old Sails, or rather Pieces
               of old Sails enough; but as I had had them now six and twenty Years by me, and had
               not been very careful to preserve them, not imagining that I should ever have this
               kind of Use for them, I did not doubt but they were all rotten, and indeed most of
               them were so; however, I found two Pieces which appear'd pretty good, and with these
               I went to Work, and with a great deal of Pains, and awkward tedious stitching (you
               may be sure) for Want of Needles, I at length made a three Corner'd ugly Thing, like
               what we call in <hi rend="italic">England,</hi> a Shoulder of Mutton Sail, to go with a <ref

               sail with, and such as I best knew how to manage; because it was such a one as I had
               to the Boat, in which I made my Escape from <hi rend="italic">Barbary,</hi> as related in the first
               Part of my Story.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="271" />I was near two Months performing this last
               Work, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> rigging and fitting my Mast and Sails; for I finish'd them very
               compleat, making a small Stay, and a Sail, or Foresail to it, to assist, if we should
               turn to Windward; and which was more than all, I fix'd a Rudder to the Stern of her,
               to steer with; and though I was but a bungling Shipwright, yet as I knew the
               Usefulness, and even Necessity of such a Thing, I apply'd my self with so much Pains
               to do it, that at last I brought it to pass; though considering the many dull
               Contrivances I had for it that fail'd, I think it cost me almost as much Labour as
               making the Boat.</p>
            <p>After all this was done too, I had my Man <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> to
               teach as to what belong'd to the Navigation of my Boat; for though he knew very well
               how to paddle a <hi rend="italic">Canoe,</hi> he knew nothing what belong'd to a Sail, and a
               Rudder; and was the most amaz'd, when he saw me work the Boat too and again in the
               Sea by the Rudder, and how the Sail <ref target="gib2_" corresp="gib2"
                  >gyb'd</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="gib2" target="gib2_"
                  type="gloss">Turned downwind</note>, and fill'd this way, or that way, as the
               Course we sail'd chang'd; I say, when he saw this, he stood like one, astonish'd, and
               amaz'd: However, with a little Use, I made all these Things familiar to him; and he
               became an expert Sailor, except that as to the Compass, I could make him understand
               very little of that. On the other hand, as there was very little cloudy Weather, and
               seldom or never any Fogs in those Parts, there was the less occasion for a Compass, seeing the Stars were always to be seen by Night, and
               the Shore by Day, except in the rainy Seasons, and then no body car'd to stir abroad,
                  either by Land or Sea.</p>
            <p>I was now entred on the seven and twentieth Year of my Captivity in this Place;
               though the three last Years that I had this Creature with me, ought rather to be left
               out of the Account, my Habitation <pb n="272"
                  /> being quite of another kind than in all the rest of
               the Time. I kept the Anniversary of my Landing here with the same Thankfulness to God
               for his Mercies, as at first; and if I had such Cause of Acknowledgment at first, I
               had much more so now, having such additional Testimonies of the Care of Providence
               over me, and the great Hopes I had of being effectually, and speedily deliver'd; for
               I had an invincible Impression upon my Thoughts, that my Deliverance was at hand, and
               that I should not be another Year in this Place: However, I went on with my
               Husbandry, digging, planting, fencing, as usual; I gather'd and cur'd my Grapes, and
               did every necessary Thing as before.</p>
            <p>The rainy Season was in the mean Time upon me, when I kept more within Doors than at
               other Times; so I had stow'd our new Vessel as secure as we could, bringing her up
               into the Creek, where as I said, in the Beginning I landed my Rafts from the Ship,
               and haling her up to the Shore, at high Water mark, I made my Man <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> dig
               a little Dock, just big enough to hold her, and just deep enough to give her Water enough to <ref target="float_" corresp="float"
                  >fleet</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="float" target="float_"
                  type="gloss">Float</note> in; and then when the Tide was out, we made a strong Dam
               cross the End of it, to keep the Water out; and so she lay dry, as to the Tide from
               the Sea; and to keep the Rain off, we laid a great many Boughs of Trees, so thick,
               that she was as well thatch'd as a House; and thus we waited for the Month of
                  <hi rend="italic">November</hi> and <hi rend="italic">December,</hi> in which I design'd to make my Adventure.</p>
            <p>When the settled Season began to come in, as the thought of my Design return'd with
               the fair Weather, I was preparing daily for the Voyage; and the first Thing I did,
               was to lay by a certain Quantity of Provisions, being the Stores for our Voyage; and
               intended in a Week or a Fortnight's <pb n="273" /> Time, to
               open the Dock, and launch out our Boat. I was busy one Morning upon some Thing of
               this kind, when I call'd to <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> and bid him go to the Sea Shore, and see
               if he could find a Turtle, or Tortoise, a Thing which we generally got once a Week,
               for the Sake of the Eggs, as well as the Flesh: <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> had not been long
               gone, when he came running back, and flew over my outer Wall, or Fence, like one that
               felt not the Ground, or the Steps he set his Feet on; and before I had time to speak
               to him, he cries out to me, <hi rend="italic">O Master! O Master! O
                  Sorrow! O bad!</hi> What's the Matter, <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> says I; <hi rend="italic">O yonder,
                  there,</hi> says he, <hi rend="italic">one, two, three Canoe! one, two, three!</hi> By his way
               of speaking, I concluded there were six; but on enquiry, I
               found it was but three: Well, <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> says I, do not be frighted; so I
               heartned him up as well as I could: However, I saw the poor Fellow was most terribly
               scar'd; for nothing ran in his Head but that they were come to look for him, and
               would cut him in Pieces, and eat him; and the poor Fellow trembled so, that I scarce
               knew what to do with him: I comforted him as well as I could, and told him I was in
               as much Danger as he, and that they would eat me as well as him; <hi rend="italic">but,</hi> says
               I, <hi rend="italic">Friday, we must resolve to fight them; Can you fight,</hi> Friday? <hi rend="italic">Me
                  shoot,</hi> says he, <hi rend="italic">but there come many great Number.</hi> No matter for
               that, said I again, our Guns will fright them that we do not kill; so I ask'd him,
               Whether if I resolv'd to defend him, he would defend me, and stand by me, and do just
               as I bid him? He said, <hi rend="italic">Me die, when you bid die, Master</hi>; so I went and
               fetch'd a good Dram of Rum, and gave him; for I had been so good a Husband of my Rum, that I had a great deal left: When he had
               drank it, I made him take the two Fowling-Pieces, which we always carry'd, and load
               them with large Swan-Shot, as big as small Pistol <pb n="274"
                  /> Bullets; then I took four Muskets, and loaded them
               with two Slugs, and five small Bullets each; and my two Pistols I loaded with a Brace
               of Bullets each; I hung my great Sword as usual, naked by my Side, and gave
                  <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> his Hatchet.</p>
            <p>When I had thus prepar'd my self, I took my Perspective-Glass, and went up to the Side of the Hill, to see what I could discover;
               and I found quickly, by my Glass, that there were one and twenty Savages, three Prisoners, and three <hi rend="italic">Canoes</hi>; and that
               their whole Business seem'd to be the triumphant Banquet
               upon these three humane Bodies, (a barbarous Feast indeed) but nothing else more than
               as I had observ'd was usual with them.</p>
            <p>I observ'd also, that they were landed not where they had done, when <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi>
               made his Escape; but nearer to my Creek, where the Shore was low, and where a thick
               Wood came close almost down to the Sea: This, with the Abhorrence of the inhumane
               Errand these Wretches came about, fill'd me with such Indignation, that I came down
               again to <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> and told him, I was resolv'd to go down to them, and kill
               them all; and ask'd him, If he would stand by me? He was now gotten over his Fright,
               and his Spirits being a little rais'd, with the Dram I had given him, he was very
               chearful, and told me, as before, <hi rend="italic">he would die, when I bid die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Fit of Fury, I took first and divided the Arms which I had charg'd, as
               before, between us; I gave <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> one Pistol to stick in his Girdle, and
               three Guns upon his Shoulder; and I took one Pistol, and the
               other three my self; and in this Posture we march'd out: I
               took a small Bottle of Rum in my Pocket, and gave <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> a large Bag, with
               more Powder and Bullet; and as to Orders, I charg'd him to keep close behind me, and
               not to stir, or shoot, or do any Thing, till I bid him; and <pb n="275"
                  /> in the mean Time, not to speak a Word: In this Posture
               I <ref target="compass_" corresp="compass">fetch'd a Compass to my Right-Hand, of
                  near a Mile</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="compass"

                  ("compass" here refers to a circuitous route, not a navigation tool)</note>, as
               well to get over the Creek, as to get into the Wood; so that I might come within
               shoot of them, before I should be discover'd, which I had seen by my Glass, it was
               easy to do.</p>
            <p>While I was making this March, my former Thoughts returning, I began to abate my
                  Resolution; I do not mean, that I entertain'd any Fear of
               their Number; for as they were naked, unarm'd Wretches, 'tis certain I was superior
               to them; nay, <ref target="though_" corresp="though">though</ref><note
                  resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="though" target="though_" type="gloss">Even
                  if</note> I had been alone; but it occurr'd to my Thoughts, What Call? What
               Occasion? much less, What Necessity I was in to go and dip my Hands in Blood, to
               attack People, who had neither done, or intended me any Wrong? Who as to me were
               innocent, and whose barbarous Customs were their own Disaster, being in them a Token
               indeed of God's having left them, with the other Nations of that Part of the World,
               to such Stupidity, and to such inhumane Courses; but did not call me to take upon me
               to be a Judge of their Actions, much less an Executioner of his Justice; that
               whenever he thought fit, he would take the Cause into his own Hands, and by national
               Vengeance punish them as a People, for national Crimes; but that in the mean time, it
               was none of my Business; that it was true, <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> might justify it, because
               he was a declar'd Enemy, and in a State of War with those very particular People; and
               it was lawful for him to attack them; but I could not say the same with respect to
               me: These Things were so warmly press'd upon my Thoughts, all the way as I went, that
               I resolv'd I would only go and place my self near them, that I might observe their
               barbarous Feast, and that I would act then as God should direct; but that unless something offer'd that was <pb n="276"
                  /> more a Call to me than yet I knew of, I would not
               meddle with them.</p>
            <p>With this Resolution I enter'd the Wood, and with all possible Waryness and Silence,
                  <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> following close at my Heels, I march'd
               till I came to the <ref target="skirt_" corresp="skirt">Skirt</ref><note

                  xml:id="bade" target="bade_" type="gloss">Bade/bid</note> him go to the Tree, and
               bring me Word if he could see there plainly what they were doing; he did so, and came
               immediately back to me, and told me they might be plainly view'd there; that they
               were all about their Fire, eating the Flesh of one of their Prisoners; and that another lay bound upon the Sand, a little
               from them, which he said they would kill next, and which fir'd all the very Soul
               within me; he told me it was not one of their Nation; but one of the bearded Men, who
               he had told me of, that came to their Country in the Boat: I was fill'd with Horror
               at the very naming the white-bearded Man, and going to the Tree, I saw plainly by my
               Glass, a white Man who lay upon the Beach of the Sea, with his Hands and his Feet
               ty'd, with Flags, or Things like Rushes; and that he was an <hi rend="italic">European,</hi> and
               had Cloaths on.</p>
            <p>There was another Tree, and a little Thicket beyond it, about fifty Yards nearer to
               them than the Place where I was, which by going a little way about, I saw I might
               come at undiscover'd, and that then I should be within half Shot of them; so I
               with-held my Passion, though I was indeed enrag'd to the
               highest Degree, and going back about twenty Paces, I got behind some Bushes, which
               held all the way, till I came to the other Tree; and then I came to a little rising
               Ground, which gave me a <pb n="277" /> full View of them, at
               the Distance of about eighty Yards.</p>
            <p>I had now not a Moment to loose; for nineteen of the dreadful Wretches sat upon the
               Ground, all close huddled together, and had just sent the other two to butcher the
               poor <hi rend="italic">Christian,</hi> and bring him perhaps Limb by Limb to their Fire, and they
               were stoop'd down to untie the Bands, at his Feet; I turn'd to <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> now
                  <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> said I, do as I bad thee; <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> said he would; then
                  <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> says I, do exactly as you see me do, fail in nothing; so I set
               down one of the Muskets, and the Fowling-Piece, upon the Ground, and <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi>
               did the like by his; and with the other Musket, I took my aim at the Savages, bidding
               him do the like; then asking him, If he was ready? He said, yes, then fire at them,
               said I; and the same Moment I fir'd also.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> took his Aim so much better than I, that on the Side that he shot, he
               kill'd two of them, and wounded three more; and on my Side, I kill'd one, and wounded
               two: They were, you may be sure, in a dreadful Consternation; and all of them, who
               were not hurt, jump'd up upon their Feet, but did not immediately know which way to
               run, or which way to look; for they knew not from whence their Destruction came:
                  <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> kept his Eyes close upon me, that as I had bid him, he might
               observe what I did; so as soon as the first Shot was made, I threw down the Piece,
               and took up the Fowling-Piece, and <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> did the like; he see me cock, and
                  <ref target="cock_" corresp="cock">present</ref><note

               I; yes, says he; let fly then, says I, in the Name of God, and with that I fir'd
               again among the amaz'd Wretches, and so did <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi>; and as our Pieces were
               now loaden with what I call'd Swan-Shot, or small Pistol Bullets, <pb n="278" /> we found only two drop; but so many
               were wounded, that they run about yelling, and skreaming,
               like mad Creatures, all bloody, and miserably wounded, most of them; whereof three
               more fell quickly after, though not quite dead.</p>
            <p>Now <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> says I, laying down the discharg'd Pieces, and taking up the
               Musket, which was yet loaden; follow me, says I, which he did, with a great deal of
               Courage; upon which I rush'd out of the Wood, and shew'd my self, and <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi>
               close at my Foot; as soon as I perceiv'd they saw me, I shouted as loud as I could,
               and bad <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> do so too; and running as fast as I could, <hi rend="italic">which by the
                  way, was not very fast, being loaden with Arms as I was,</hi> I made directly
               towards the poor Victim, who was, as I said, lying upon the Beach, or Shore, between
               the Place where they sat, and the Sea; the two Butchers who were just going to work
               with him, had left him, at the Suprize of our first Fire, and fled in a terrible
               Fright, to the Sea Side, and had jump'd into a <hi rend="italic">Canoe,</hi> and three more of the
               rest made the same way; I turn'd to <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> and bid him step forwards, and
               fire at them; he understood me immediately, and running
               about forty Yards, to be near them, he shot at them, and I thought he had kill'd them
               all; for I see them all fall of a Heap into the Boat; though I saw two of them up
               again quickly: However, he kill'd two of them, and wounded the third; so that he lay
               down in the Bottom of the Boat, as if he had been dead.</p>
            <p>While my Man <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> fir'd at them, I pull'd out my Knife, and cut the Flags
               that bound the poor Victim, and loosing his Hands, and Feets, I lifted him up, and
               ask'd him in the <hi rend="italic">Portuguese</hi> Tongue, What he was? He answer'd in Latin,
                  <hi rend="italic">Christianus</hi>; but was so weak, and faint, that he could scarce <pb n="279"
                  /> stand, or speak; I took my Bottle out of my Pocket, and gave it him, making Signs that he should drink,
               which he did; and I gave him a Piece of Bread, which he eat; then I ask'd him, What
               Countryman he was? And he said, <hi rend="italic">Espagniole</hi>; and being a little recover'd,
               let me know by all the Signs he could possibly make, how much he was in my Debt for
               his Deliverance; <hi rend="italic">Seignior,</hi> said I, with as much <hi rend="italic">Spanish</hi> as I could
               make up, we will talk afterwards; but we must fight now; if you have any Strength
               left, take this Pistol, and Sword, and lay about you; he took them very thankfully,
               and no sooner had he the Arms in his Hands, but as if they had put new Vigour into
               him, he flew upon his Murtherers, like a Fury, and had cut two of them in Pieces, in
               an instant; for the Truth is, as the whole was a Surprize to them; so the poor
               Creatures were so much frighted with the Noise of our Pieces, that they fell down for
               meer Amazement, and Fear; and had no more Power to attempt their own Escape, than their Flesh had to resist our
               Shot; and that was the Case of those Five that <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> shot at in the Boat;
               for as three of them fell with the Hurt they receiv'd; so the other two fell with the Fright.</p>
            <p>I kept my Piece in my Hand still, without firing, being willing to keep my Charge
               ready; because I had given the <hi rend="italic">Spaniard</hi> my Pistol, and Sword; so I call'd to
                  <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> and bad him run up to the Tree, from whence we first fir'd, and
               fetch the Arms which lay there, that had been discharg'd, which he did with great
               Swiftness; and then giving him my Musket, I sat down my self to load all the rest
               again, and bad them come to me when they wanted: While I was
               loading these Pieces, there happen'd a fierce Engagement
               between the <hi rend="italic">Spaniard,</hi> and one of the Savages, who made at him with one of
                  <pb n="280" /> their great wooden Swords, the same Weapon
               that was to have kill'd him before, if I had not prevented
               it: The <hi rend="italic">Spaniard,</hi> who was as bold, and as brave as could be imagin'd, though
               weak, had fought this <hi rend="italic">Indian</hi> a good while, and had cut him two great Wounds
               on his Head; but the Savage being a stout lusty Fellow, closing in with him, had
               thrown him down (being faint) and was wringing my Sword out of his Hand, when the
                  <hi rend="italic">Spaniard,</hi> tho' undermost wisely quitting the Sword, drew the Pistol from
               his Girdle, shot the Savage through the Body, and kill'd him upon the Spot; before I,
               who was running to help him, could come near him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> being now left to his Liberty, pursu'd the flying Wretches with no
               Weapon in his Hand, but his Hatchet; and with that he dispatch'd those three, who, as
               I said before, were wounded at first and fallen, and all the rest he could come up
               with, and the <hi rend="italic">Spaniard</hi> coming to me for a Gun, I gave him one of the
               Fowling-Pieces, with which he pursu'd two of the Savages, and wounded them both; but
               as he was not able to run, they both got from him into the Wood, where
                  <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> pursu'd them, and kill'd one of them; but the other was too nimble
               for him, and though he was wounded, yet had plunged himself into the Sea, and swam
               with all his might off to those two who were left in the <hi rend="italic">Canoe,</hi> which three
               in the <hi rend="italic">Canoe,</hi> with one wounded, who we know not
               whether he dy'd or no, were all that escap'd our Hands of one and twenty: The Account
               of the Rest is as follows;</p> 
            <p><lg type="list">
                  <l>3 Kill'd at our first Shot from the Tree.</l>

                  <l>4 Escap'd in the Boat, whereof one wounded if not dead.</l>
                  <l>21 In all.</l>
               </lg>
            </p>
            <p>Those that were in the <hi rend="italic">Canoe,</hi> work'd hard to get out of Gun-Shot; and though
                  <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> made two or three Shot at them, I did not find that he hit any of
               them: <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> would fain have had me took one of their <hi rend="italic">Canoes,</hi> and
               pursu'd them; and indeed I was very anxious about their Escape, least carrying the News home to their People, they should come back
               perhaps with two or three hundred of their <hi rend="italic">Canoes,</hi> and devour us by meer
               Multitude; so I consented to pursue them by Sea, and running to one of their
                  <hi rend="italic">Canoes,</hi> I jump'd in, and bad <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> follow me; but when I was in
               the <hi rend="italic">Canoe,</hi> I was surpriz'd to find another poor Creature lye there alive, bound Hand and Foot, as the <hi rend="italic">Spaniard</hi> was, for
               the Slaughter, and almost dead with Fear, not knowing what the Matter was; for he had
               not been able to look up over the Side of the Boat, he was ty'd so hard, Neck and
               Heels, and had been ty'd so long, that he had really but little Life in him.</p>
            <p>I immediately cut the twisted Flags, or Rushes, which they had bound him with, and
               would have helped him up; but he could not stand, or speak, but groan'd most
               piteously, believing it seems still that he was only unbound in order to be
               kill'd.</p>
            <p>When <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> came to him, I bad him speak to him, and tell him of his
               Deliverance, and pulling out my Bottle, made him give the poor Wretch a <pb n="282"
                  /> Dram, which, with the News of his being deliver'd, reviv'd him, and he sat up in the Boat; but when
                  <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> came to hear him speak, and look in his Face, it would have mov'd
               any one to Tears, to have seen how <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> kiss'd him, embrac'd him, hugg'd
               him, cry'd, laugh'd, hollow'd, jump'd about, danc'd, sung,
               then cry'd again, wrung his Hands, beat his own Face, and Head, and then sung, and
               jump'd about again, like a distracted Creature: It was a good while before I could
               make him speak to me, or tell me what was the Matter; but
               when he came a little to himself, he told me, that it was his Father.</p>
            <p>It is not easy for me to express how it mov'd me to see what Extasy and filial
               Affection had work'd in this poor <hi rend="italic">Savage,</hi> at the Sight of his Father, and of his being deliver'd from Death; nor indeed can
               I describe half the Extravagancies of his Affection after this; for he went into the
               Boat and out of the Boat a great many times: When he went in to him, he would sit
               down by him, open his Breast, and hold his Father's Head close to his Bosom, half an
               Hour together, to nourish it; then he took his Arms and
               Ankles, which were numb'd and stiff with the Binding, and chaffed and rubbed them
               with his Hands; and I perceiving what the Case was, gave him
               some Rum out of my Bottle, to rub them with, which did them a great deal of Good.</p>
            <p>This Action put an End to our Pursuit of the Canoe, with the other <hi rend="italic">Savages,</hi>
               who were now gotten almost out of Sight; and it was happy for us that we did not; for
               it blew so hard within two Hours after, and before they could be gotten a Quarter of
               their Way, and continued blowing so hard all Night, and that from the
                  <hi rend="italic">North-west,</hi> which was against them, that I could not suppose <pb n="283"
                  /> their Boat could live, or that they ever reach'd to
               their own Coast.</p>
            <p>But to return to <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> he was so busy about his Father, that I could not
               find in my Heart to take him off for some time: But after I thought he could leave
               him a little, I call'd him to me, and he came jumping and laughing, and pleas'd to
               the highest Extream; then I ask'd him, If he had given his Father any Bread? He shook
               his Head, and said, <hi rend="italic">None: <ref target="uglydog_" corresp="uglydog">Ugly
                     Dog</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="uglydog"
                     target="uglydog_" type="gloss">As tempting as it is to read this as Friday
                     insulting the Spaniard, he is actually referring (rather alarmingly) to
                     himself!</note> eat all up self;</hi> so I gave him a Cake of Bread out of a
               little Pouch I carry'd on Purpose; I also gave him a Dram for himself, but he would
               not taste it, but carry'd it to his Father: I had in my
               Pocket also two or three Bunches of my Raisins, so I gave
               him a Handful of them for his Father. He had no sooner given his Father these Raisins, but I saw him come out of the Boat, and
               run away, as if he had been bewitch'd, he run at such a Rate; for he was the swiftest
                  Fellow of his Foot that ever I saw; I say, he run at such
               a Rate, that he was out of Sight, as it were, in an instant; and though I call'd, and
               hollow'd too, after him, it was all one, away he went, and in a Quarter of an Hour, I
               saw him come back again, though not so fast as he went; and
               as he came nearer, I found his Pace was slacker, because he had something in his
               Hand.</p>
            <p>When he came up to me, I found he had been quite Home for an Earthen Jugg or Pot to
               bring his Father some fresh Water, and that he had got two more Cakes, or Loaves of
               Bread: The Bread he gave me, but the Water he carry'd to his Father: However, as I
               was very thirsty too, I took a little Sup of it. This Water
               reviv'd his Father more than all the Rum or Spirits I had given him; for he was just
               fainting with Thirst.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="284" />When his Father had drank, I call'd to him to
               know if there was any Water left; he said, yes; and I bad him give it to the poor
                  <hi rend="italic">Spaniard,</hi> who was in as much Want of it as his Father; and I sent one of
               the Cakes, that <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> brought, to the <hi rend="italic">Spaniard</hi> too, who was indeed
               very weak, and was reposing himself upon a green Place under the Shade of a Tree; and
               whose Limbs were also very stiff, and very much swell'd with the rude Bandage he had
               been ty'd with. When I saw that upon <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi>'s
               coming to him with the Water, he sat up and drank, and took the Bread, and began to
               eat, I went to him, and gave him a Handful of Raisins; he look'd up in my Face with
               all the Tokens of Gratitude and Thankfulness, that could appear in any Countenance;
               but was so weak, notwithstanding he had so exerted himsef in
               the Fight, that he could not stand up upon his Feet; he try'd to do it two or three
               times, but was really not able, his Ankles were so swell'd and so painful to him; so
               I bad him sit still, and caused <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> to rub his Ankles, and bathe them
               with Rum, as he had done his Father's.</p>
            <p>I observ'd the poor affectionate Creature every two Minutes, or perhaps less, all the
               while he was here, turn'd his Head about, to see if his Father was in the same Place, and Posture, as he left him sitting; and at last he
               found he was not to be seen; at which he started up, and without speaking a Word,
               flew with that Swiftness to him, that one could scarce perceive his Feet to touch the
               Ground, as he went: But when he came, he only found he had laid himself down to ease
               his Limbs; so <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> came back to me presently, and I then spoke to the
                  <hi rend="italic">Spaniard</hi> to let <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> help him up if he could, and lead him to
               the Boat, and then he should carry him to our Dwelling, where <pb n="285"
                  /> I would take Care of him: But <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> a lusty
               strong Fellow, took the <hi rend="italic">Sqaniard</hi> quite up upon his Back, and carry'd him
               away to the Boat, and set him down softly upon the Side or Gunnel of the Canoe, with
               his Feet in the inside of it, and then lifted him quite in, and set him close to his
                  Father, and presently stepping out again, launched the
               Boat off, and paddled it along the Shore faster than I could
               walk, tho' the Wind blew pretty hard too; so he brought them
               both safe into our Creek; and leaving them in the Boat, runs away to fetch the other
               Canoe. As he pass'd me, I spoke to him, and ask'd him, whither he went, he told me,
                  <hi rend="italic">Go fetch more Boat</hi>; so away he went like the Wind; for sure never Man or
               Horse run like him, and he had the other Canoe in the Creek, almost as soon as I got
               to it by Land; so he wafted me over, and then went to help
               our new Guests out of the Boat, which he did; but they were neither of them able to
               walk; so that poor <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> knew not what to do.</p>
            <p>To remedy this, I went to Work in my Thought, and calling to <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> to bid
               them sit down on the Bank while he came to me, I soon made a Kind of Hand-Barrow to
               lay them on, and <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> and I carry'd them up both together upon it between
               us: But when we got them to the outside of our Wall or Fortification, we were at a
               worse Loss than before; for it was impossible to get them
               over; and I was resolv'd not to break it down: So I set to Work again; and
                  <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> and I, in about 2 Hours time, made a very handsom Tent, cover'd
               with old Sails, and above that with Boughs of Trees, being in the Space without our
               outward Fence, and between that and the Grove of young Wood which I had planted: And
               here we made them two Beds of such things as I had <hi rend="italic">(viz.)</hi> of good
               Rice-Straw, <pb n="286" /> with Blankets laid upon it to lye
               on, and another to cover them on each Bed.</p>
            <p>My Island was now peopled, and I thought my self very rich in Subjects; and it was a
               merry Reflection which I frequently made, How like a King I
               look'd. First of all, the whole Country was my own meer Property; so that I had an
               undoubted Right of Dominion. 2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> My People were perfectly subjected: I was absolute Lord and Lawgiver; they
               all owed their Lives to me, and were ready to lay down their Lives, <hi rend="italic">if there had
                  been Occasion of it,</hi> for me. It was remarkable too,
               we had but three Subjects, and they were of three different Religions. My Man
                  <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> was a Protestant, his Father was a <hi rend="italic">Pagan</hi> and a
                  <hi rend="italic">Cannibal,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Spaniard</hi> was a Papist: However, I allow'd
               Liberty of Conscience throughout my Dominions: But this is

               them, I sat down and eat my own Dinner also with them, and,
               as well as I could, chear'd them and encourag'd them; <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> being my

            <p>After we had dined, or rather supped, I order'd <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> to take one of the

               had left upon the Place of Battle, and the next Day I order'd him to go and bury the
               dead Bodies of the Savages, which lay open to the Sun, and would presently be
               offensive; and I also order'd him to bury the horrid Remains of their barbarous
               Feast, which I knew were <ref target="prettymuch_" corresp="prettymuch">pretty much</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff"

               could not think of doing my self; nay, I could not bear to see them, if I went that
               Way: All which he punctually performed, and <ref target="deface_" corresp="deface"

               the <hi rend="italic">Savages</hi> being there; so that when I went again, I could scarce know
               where it was, otherwise than by the Corner of the Wood pointing to the Place.</p>
            <p>I then began to enter into a little Conversation with my two new Subjects; and first
               I set <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> to enquire of his Father, what he thought of the Escape of the
                  <hi rend="italic">Savages</hi> in that Canoe, and whether we might expect a Return of them with
               a Power too great for us to resist: His first Opinion was, that the Savages in the
               Boat never could live out the Storm which blew that Night they went off, but must of
                  Necessity be drowned or driven <hi rend="italic">South</hi> to those
               other Shores where they were as sure to be devoured as they were to be drowned if
               they were cast away; but as to what they would do if they came safe on Shore, he said
               he knew not; but it was his Opinion that they were so dreadfully frighted with the
               Manner of their being attack'd, the Noise and the Fire, that he believed they would
               tell their People, they were all kill'd by Thunder and Lightning, not by the Hand of
               Man, and that the two which appear'd, <hi rend="italic">(viz.) Friday</hi>
               and me, were two Heavenly <pb n="288" /> Spirits or Furies,
               come down to destroy them, and not Men with Weapons: This he said he knew, because he
               heard them all cry out so in their Language to one another,
               for it was impossible to them to conceive that a Man could dart Fire, and speak
               Thunder, and kill at a Distance without lifting up the Hand, as was done now: And
               this old Savage was in the right; for, as I understood since by other Hands, the
               Savages never attempted to go over to the Island afterwards;
               they were so terrified with the Accounts given by those four Men, (for it seems they
               did escape the Sea) that they believ'd whoever went to that enchanted Island would be
               destroy'd with Fire from the Gods.</p>
            <p>This however I knew not, and therefore was under continual
               Apprehensions for a good while, and kept always upon my Guard, me and all my Army;
               for as we were now four of us, I would have ventur'd upon a
               hundred of them fairly in the open Field at any Time.</p>

            <p>In a little Time, however, no more Canoes appearing, the
               Fear of their Coming wore off, and I began to take my former Thoughts of a Voyage to
               the Main into Consideration, being likewise assur'd by
                  <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi>'s Father, that I might depend upon good Usage from their Nation on
               his Account, if I would go.</p>
            <p>But my Thoughts were a little suspended, when I had a serious Discourse with the
                  <hi rend="italic">Spaniard,</hi> and when I understood that there were sixteen more of his
               Countrymen and <hi rend="italic">Portuguese,</hi> which is near that Number, who having been cast
               away, and made their Escape to that Side, liv'd there at Peace indeed with the Savages, but were very sore put to it for
               Necessaries, and indeed for Life: I ask'd him all the Particulars of their Voyage,
               and found they were a <hi rend="italic">Spanish</hi> Ship bound from the <hi rend="italic">Rio de la Plata</hi>
               <pb n="289" /> to the <hi rend="italic">Havana,</hi> being directed to
               leave their Loading there, which was chiefly Hides and
               Silver, and to bring back what <hi rend="italic">European</hi> Goods they could meet with there;
               that they had five <hi rend="italic">Portuguese</hi> Seamen on Board, who
               they took out of another Wreck; that five of their own Men were drowned when the
               first Ship was lost, and that these escaped thro' infinite Dangers and Hazards, and
               arriv'd almost starv'd on the <hi rend="italic">Cannibal</hi> Coast, where
               they expected to have been devour'd every Moment.</p>
            <p>He told me, they had some Arms with them, but they were perfectly useless, for that
               they had neither Powder or Ball, the Washing of the Sea having spoil'd all their Powder but a little, which they used at their first Landing
               to provide themselves some Food.</p>
            <p>I ask'd him what he thought would become of them there, and if they had form'd no
               Design of making any Escape? He said, They had many Consultations about it, but that
               having neither Vessel, or Tools to build one, or Provisions of any kind, their
               Councils always ended in Tears and Despair.</p>
            <p>I ask'd him how he thought they would receive a Proposal from me, which might tend
               towards an Escape? And whether, if they were all here, it
               might not be done? I told him with Freedom, I fear'd mostly their Treachery and ill
               Usage of me, if I put my Life in their Hands; for that Gratitude was no inherent
               Virtue in the Nature of Man; nor did Men always square their Dealings by the Obligations they had receiv'd, so much as they did by the
               Advantages they expected. I told him it would be very hard, that I should be the
               Instrument of their Deliverance, and that they should afterwards make me their Prisoner in <ref target="newspain_" corresp="newspain">New

               Necessity, or what Accident soever, brought him thither: And that I had rather be

               alive, than fall into the merciless Claws of the Priests, and be carry'd into the
                  <hi rend="italic">Inquisition.</hi> I added, That otherwise I was
               perswaded, if they were all here, we might, with so many Hands, build a Bark large
               enough to carry us all away, either to the <hi rend="italic">Brasils</hi> South-ward, or to the

                  type="gloss">Caribbean</note> or <hi rend="italic">Spanish</hi> Coast North-ward: But that if in
               Requital they should, when I had put Weapons into their Hands, carry me by Force
               among their own People, I might be ill used for my Kindness to them, and make my Case
               worse than it was before.</p>
            <p>He answer'd with a great deal of Candor and Ingenuity, That their Condition was so
                  miserable, and they were so sensible of it, that he believed they would abhor the Thought of using any Man
               unkindly that should contribute to their Deliverance; and
               that, if I pleased, he would go to them with the old Man, and discourse with them
               about it, and return again, and bring me their Answer: That
               he would make Conditions with them upon their solemn Oath, That they should be absolutely under my Leading, as their Commander and Captain;
               and that they should swear upon the Holy Sacraments and the Gospel, to be true to me,
               and to go to such Christian Country, as that I should agree to, and no other; and to
               be directed wholly and absolutely to my Orders, 'till they were landed safely in such
               Country, as I intended; and that he would bring a Contract
               from them under their Hands for that Purpose.</p>
            <p>Then he told me, he would first swear to me himself, That he would never stir from me
               as long as he liv'd, 'till I gave him Orders; and that he would take my Side to the
               last Drop of his Blood, <pb n="291" /> if there should
               happen the least Breach of Faith among his Country-men.</p>
            <p>He told me, they were all of them very civil honest Men, and they were under the
               greatest Distress imaginable, having neither Weapons or
               Cloaths, nor any Food, but at the Mercy and Discretion of the <hi rend="italic">Savages</hi>; out
               of all Hopes of ever returning to their own Country; and that he was sure, if I would
               undertake their Relief, they would live and die by me.</p>
            <p>Upon these Assurances, I resolv'd to venture to relieve them, if possible, and to
               send the old <hi rend="italic">Savage</hi> and this <hi rend="italic">Spaniard</hi> over to them to treat: But
               when we had gotten all things in a Readiness to go, the <hi rend="italic">Spaniard</hi> himself
               started an Objection, which had so much Prudence in it on one hand, and so much
               Sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but be very well satisfy'd in it; and
               by his Advice, put off the Deliverance of his Comerades, for at least half a Year.
               The Case was thus:</p>
            <p>He had been with us now about a Month; during which time, I
               had let him see in what Manner I had provided, with the
               Assistance of Providence, for my Support; and he saw
               evidently what Stock of Corn and Rice I had laid up; which as it was more than
               sufficient for my self, so it was not sufficient, at least without good Husbandry,
               for my Family; now it was encreas'd to Number four: But much
               less would it be sufficient, if his Country-men, who were, as he said, fourteen still
               alive, should come over. And least of all should it be sufficient to victual our
               Vessel, if we should build one, for a Voyage to any of the Christian Colonies of <hi rend="italic">America.</hi> So he told me, he
               thought it would be more advisable, to let him and the two other, dig and cultivate
               some more Land, as much as I could spare Seed to sow; and that we <pb n="292"
                  /> should wait another Harvest, that we might have a
               Supply of Corn for his Country-men when they should come; for Want might be a
               Temptation to them to disagree, or not to think themselves delivered, otherwise than out of one Difficulty into another.
               You know, says he, the Children of <hi rend="italic">Israel,</hi> though
               they rejoyc'd at first for their being deliver'd out of <hi rend="italic">Egypt,</hi> yet rebell'd
               even against God himself that deliver'd them, <ref target="exodus_" corresp="exodus"
                  >when they came to want Bread in the Wilderness</ref>. <note

                  >Exodus 16:3</note>
            </p>
            <p>His Caution was so seasonable, and his Advice so good, that I could not but be very
               well pleased with his Proposal, as well as I was satisfy'd with his Fidelity. So we
               fell to digging all four of us, as well as the Wooden Tools we were furnish'd with
               permitted; and in about a Month's time, by the End of which it was Seed time, we had
                  gotten as much Land cur'd and trim'd up, as we sowed 22 Bushels of Barley on, and 16 Jarrs of Rice, which was
               in short all the Seed we had to spare; nor indeed did we leave our selves Barley
                  sufficient for our own Food, for the six Months that we
               had to expect our Crop, that is to say, reckoning from the time we set our Seed aside
               for sowing; for it is not to be supposed it is six Months in the Ground in the
               Country.</p>
            <p>Having now Society enough, and our Number being sufficient to put us out of Fear of
               the <hi rend="italic">Savages,</hi> if they had come, unless their Number
               had been very great, we went freely all over the Island, where-ever we found
               Occasion; and as here we had our Escape or Deliverance upon our Thoughts, it was
               impossible, <hi rend="italic">at least for me,</hi> to have the Means of it out of mine; to this
               Purpose, I mark'd out several Trees which I thought fit for our Work, and I set
                  <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> and his Father to cutting them down; and
               then I caused the <hi rend="italic">Spaniard,</hi>
               <pb n="293" /> to whom I imparted my Thought on that Affair,
               to oversee and direct their Work. I shewed them with what indefatigable Pains I had
               hewed a large Tree into single Planks, and I caused them to do the like, till they
               had made about a Dozen large Planks of good Oak, near 2 Foot broad, 35 Foot long, and
               from 2 Inches to 4 Inches thick: What prodigious Labour it took up, any one may imagine.</p>
            <p>At the same time I contriv'd to encrease my little Flock of
               tame Goats as much as I could; and to this Purpose, I made <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> and the
                  <hi rend="italic">Spaniard</hi> go out one Day, and my self with <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> the next Day;
               for we took our Turns: And by this Means we got above 20 young Kids to breed up with
               the rest; for when-ever we shot the Dam, we saved the Kids, and added them to our
               Flock: But above all, the Season for curing the Grapes coming on, I caused such a prodigious Quantity to be hung up in
               the Sun, that I believe, had we been at <ref target="alicant_" corresp="alicant"

               where the Raisins of the Sun are cur'd, we could have fill'd 60 or 80 Barrels; and
               these with our Bread was a great Part of our Food, and very good living too, I assure
               you; for it is an exceeding nourishing Food.</p>
            <p>It was now Harvest, and our Crop in good Order; it was not
               the most plentiful Encrease I had seen in the Island, but however it was enough to
               answer our End; for from our 22 Bushels of Barley, we
               brought in and thrashed out above 220 Bushels; and the like in Proportion of the
               Rice, which was Store enough for our Food to the next Harvest, tho' all the 16
                  <hi rend="italic">Spaniards</hi> had been on Shore with me; or if we had been ready for a
               Voyage, it would very plentifully have victualled our Ship, to have carry'd us to any
               Part of the World, that is to say, of <hi rend="italic">America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="294" />When we had thus hous'd and secur'd our Magazine of Corn, we fell to Work to make more Wicker Work,
                  <hi rend="italic">(viz.)</hi> great Baskets in which we kept it; and the <hi rend="italic">Spaniard</hi> was
               very handy and dexterous at this Part, and often blam'd me
               that I did not make some things, for Defence, of this Kind of Work; but I saw no Need
               of it.</p>
            <p>And now having a full Supply of Food for all the Guests I expected, I gave the
                  <hi rend="italic">Spaniard</hi> Leave to go over to the <hi rend="italic">Main,</hi> to see what he could do
               with those he had left behind him there. I gave him a strict Charge in Writing, Not
               to bring any Man with him, who would not first swear in the Presence of himself and
               of the old <hi rend="italic">Savage,</hi> That he would no way injure, fight with, or attack the
               Person he should find in the Island, who was so kind to send for them in order to
               their Deliverance; but that they would stand by and defend
               him against all such Attempts, and where-ever they went, would be entirely under and
               subjected to his Commands; and that this should be put in Writing, and signed with
               their Hands: How we were to have this done, when I knew they had neither Pen or Ink; that indeed was a Question which we never
               asked.</p>
            <p>Under these Instructions, the <hi rend="italic">Spaniard,</hi> and the old <hi rend="italic">Savage</hi> the
               Father of <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> went away in one of the Canoes, which they might be said

            <p>This was a chearful Work, being the first Measures used by

               and some Days. I gave them Provisions of Bread, and of dry'd
               Grapes, sufficient for themselves for many Days, and sufficient for all their
               Country-men for about eight Days time; and wishing them a good Voyage, I see them go,
               agreeing with them about a Signal they should hang out at their Return, by which I
               should know them again, when they came back, at a Distance, before they came on
               Shore.</p>
            <p>They went away with a fair Gale on the Day that the Moon was at Full by my Account,
               in the Month of <hi rend="italic">October:</hi> But as for an exact Reckoning of Days, after I had
               once lost it, I could never recover it again; nor had I kept even the Number of Years
               so punctually, as to be sure that I was right, tho' as it prov'd, when I afterwards
               examin'd my Account, I found I had kept a true Reckoning of
               Years.</p>
            <p>It was no less than eight Days I had waited for them, when a strange and unforeseen
               Accident interveen'd, of which the like has not perhaps been
               heard of in History: I was fast asleep in my Hutch one Morning, when my Man
                  <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> came running in to me, and call'd aloud, Master, Master, they are
               come, they are come.</p>
            <p>I jump'd up, and regardless of Danger, I went out, as soon as I could get my Cloaths
               on, thro' my little Grove, which by the Way was by this time grown to be a very thick
               Wood; I say, regardless of Danger, I went without my Arms,
               which was not my Custom to do: But I was surpriz'd, when
               turning my Eyes to the Sea, I presently saw a Boat at about
               a League and half's Distance, standing in for the Shore,
               with a <hi rend="italic">Shoulder of Mutton Sail,</hi> as they call it; and the Wind blowing pretty fair to bring them in; also I observ'd presently,
               that they did not come from that Side which the Shore lay on, but from the Southermost <pb n="296" /> End of the
               Island: Upon this I call'd <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> in, and bid him lie close, for these were
               not the People we look'd for, and that we might not know yet whether they were
               Friends or Enemies.</p>
            <p>In the next Place, I went in to fetch my Perspective Glass,
               to see what I could make of them; and having taken the Ladder out, I climb'd up to
               the Top of the Hill, as I used to do when I was apprehensive of any thing, and to
               take my View the plainer without being discover'd.</p>
            <p>I had scarce set my Foot on the Hill, when my Eye plainly discover'd a Ship lying at
               an Anchor, at about two Leagues and an half's Distance from me South-south-east, but
               not above a League and an half from the Shore. By my Observation it appear'd plainly to be an <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Ship, and the Boat
               appear'd to be an <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Long-Boat.</p>
            <p>I cannot express the Confusion I was in, tho' the Joy of seeing a Ship, and one who I
               had Reason to believe was Mann'd by my own Country-men, and consequently Friends, was
               such as I cannot describe; but yet I had some secret Doubts
               hung about me, I cannot tell from whence they came, bidding
               me keep upon my Guard. In the first Place, it occurr'd to me to consider what
               Business an <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Ship could have in that Part of the World, since it was
               not the Way to or from any Part of the World, where the <hi rend="italic">English</hi> had any
                  Traffick; and I knew there had been no Storms to drive
               them in there, as in Distress; and that if they were <hi rend="italic">English</hi> really, it was
               most probable that they were here upon no good Design; and that I had better continue
               as I was, than fall into the Hands of Thieves and Murtherers.</p>
            <p>Let no Man despise the secret Hints and Notices of Danger,
               which sometimes are given him, when he may think there is no Possibility of its being <pb n="297" /> real. That such
               Hints and Notices are given us, I believe few that have made
               any Observations of things, can deny; that they are certain
                  Discoveries of an invisible World, and a Converse of
               Spirits, we cannot doubt; and if the Tendency of them seems to be to warn us of
               Danger, why should we not suppose they are from some friendly Agent, whether supreme,
               or inferior, and subordinate, is not the Question; and that
               they are given for our Good?</p>
            <p>The present Question abundantly confirms me in the Justice of this Reasoning; for had
               I not been made cautious by this secret Admonition, come it from whence it will, I
               had been undone inevitably, and in a far worse Condition
               than before, as you will see presently.</p>
            <p>I had not kept my self long in this Posture, but I saw the Boat draw near the Shore,
               as if they look'd for a Creek to thrust in at for the Convenience of Landing; however, as they did not come quite far enough, they did not see
               the little Inlet where I formerly landed my Rafts; but run their Boat on Shore upon
               the Beach, at about half a Mile from me, which was very happy for me; for otherwise
               they would have landed just as I may say at my Door, and would soon have beaten me
               out of my Castle, and perhaps have plunder'd me of all I had.</p>
            <p>When they were on Shore, I was fully satisfy'd that they were <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Men;
               at least, most of them; one or two I thought were <hi rend="italic">Dutch</hi>; but it did not
               prove so: There were in all eleven Men, whereof three of them I found were unarm'd,
               and as I thought, bound; and when the first four or five of them were jump'd on
               Shore, they took those three out of the Boat as Prisoners: One of the three I could
               perceive using the most passionate Gestures of <pb n="298" facs="tcp:0653600100:304"
               /> Entreaty, Affliction and Despair, even to a kind of Extravagance; the other two I
               could perceive lifted up their Hands sometimes, and appear'd concern'd indeed, but not to such a Degree as the first.</p>
            <p>I was perfectly confounded at the Sight, and knew not what the Meaning of it should
               be. <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> call'd out to me in <hi rend="italic">English,</hi> as
               well as he could, <hi rend="italic">O</hi> Master! <hi rend="italic">You see</hi> English <hi rend="italic">Mans eat Prisoner
                  as well as</hi> Savage <hi rend="italic">Mans.</hi> Why, says I, <hi rend="italic">Friday, Do you think they
                  are a going to eat them then? Yes,</hi> says Friday,
                  <hi rend="italic">They will eat them: No, no,</hi> says I, Friday, <hi rend="italic">I am afraid they will
                  murther them indeed, but you may be sure they will not eat them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this while I had no thought of what the Matter really was; but stood trembling
               with the Horror of the Sight, expecting every Moment when the three Prisoners should
               be kill'd; nay, once I saw one of the Villains lift up his Arm with a great Cutlash, as the Seamen call it, or Sword, to strike one of the
               poor Men; and I expected to see him fall every Moment, at
               which all the Blood in my Body seem'd to run chill in my Veins.</p>
            <p>I wish'd heartily now for my <hi rend="italic">Spaniard,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Savage</hi> that was gone
               with him; or that I had any way to have come undiscover'd
               within shot of them, that I might have rescu'd the three Men; for I saw no Fire Arms
               they had among them; but it fell out to my Mind another way.</p>
            <p>After I had observ'd the outragious Usage of the three Men, by the insolent Seamen, I
               observ'd the Fellows run scattering about the Land, as if they wanted to see the
               Country: I observ'd that the three other Men had Liberty to go also where they
               pleas'd; but they sat down all three upon the Ground, very pensive, and look'd like
               Men in Despair.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="299" />This put me in Mind of the first Time when I
               came on Shore, and began to look about me; How I gave my self over for lost: How
               wildly I look'd round me: What dreadful Apprehensions I had: And how I lodg'd in the
               Tree all Night for fear of being devour'd by wild Beasts.</p>
            <p>As I knew nothing that Night of the Supply I was to receive by the providential
               Driving of the Ship nearer the Land, by the Storms and Tide, by which I have since
               been so long nourish'd and supported; so these three poor
               desolate Men knew nothing how certain of Deliverance and
               Supply they were, how near it was to them, and how effectually and really they were in a Condition of Safety, at the same Time that they
               thought themselves lost, and their Case desperate.</p>
            <p>So little do we see before us in the World, and so much reason have we to depend
               chearfully upon the great Maker of the World, that he does not leave his Creatures so
               absolutely destitute, but that in the worst Circumstances they have always something to be thankful for, and sometimes are nearer their
               Deliverance than they imagine; nay, are even brought to their Deliverance by the
               Means by which they seem to be brought to their Destruction.</p>
            <p>It was just at the Top of High-Water when these People came on Shore, and while
               partly they stood parlying with the Prisoners they brought, and partly while they rambled about to see what kind of a Place they
               were in; they had carelesly staid till the Tide was spent, and the Water was ebb'd
                  considerably away, leaving their Boat a-ground.</p>
            <p>They had left two Men in the Boat, who as I found afterwards, having drank a little
               too much Brandy, fell a-sleep; however, one of them waking sooner than the other, and
               finding the Boat too fast <pb n="300" /> a-ground for him to
               stir it, hollow'd for the rest who were straggling about, upon which they all soon
               came to the Boat; but it was past all their Strength to launch her, the Boat being
               very heavy, and the Shore on that Side being a soft ousy Sand, almost like a
               Quick-Sand.</p>
            <p>In this Condition, like true Seamen who are perhaps the
               least of all Mankind given to fore-thought, they gave it over, and away they stroll'd
               about the Country again; and I heard one of them say aloud to another, calling them
               off from the Boat, <hi rend="italic">Why let her alone,</hi> Jack, <hi rend="italic">can't ye, she will float
                  next Tide</hi>; by which I was fully confirm'd in the main Enquiry, of what
               Countrymen they were.</p>
            <p>All this while I kept my self very close, not once daring to stir out of my Castle,
               any farther than to my Place of Observation, near the Top of the Hill; and very glad
               I was, to think how well it was fortify'd: I knew it was no
               less than ten Hours before the Boat could be on float again, and by that Time it
               would be dark, and I might be at more Liberty to see their Motions, and to hear their
               Discourse, if they had any.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time, I fitted my self up for a Battle, as
               before; though with more Caution, knowing I had to do with another kind of Enemy than
               I had at first: I order'd <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> also, who I had made an excellent Marks-Man
               with his Gun, to load himself with Arms: I took my self two
               Fowling-Pieces, and I gave him three Muskets; my Figure indeed was very fierce; I had
               my formidable Goat-Skin Coat on, with the great Cap I have mention'd, a naked Sword
               by my Side, two Pistols in my Belt, and a Gun upon each Shoulder.</p>
            <p>It was my Design, as I said above, not to have made any Attempt till it was Dark: But
               about Two a Clock, being the Heat of the Day, I found <pb n="301"
                  /> that in short they were all gone straggling into the
               Woods, and as I thought were laid down to Sleep. The three poor distressed Men, too
               Anxious for their Condition to get any Sleep, were however set down under the Shelter
               of a great Tree, at about a quarter of a Mile from me, and
               as I thought out of sight of any of the rest.</p>
            <p>Upon this I resolv'd to discover my self to them, and learn something of their
               Condition: Immediately I march'd in the Figure as above, my Man <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> at a
               good Distance behind me, as formidable for his Arms as I,
               but not making quite so staring a <hi rend="italic">Spectre-like</hi> Figure as I did.</p>
            <p>I came as near them undiscover'd as I could, and then before any of them saw me, I
               call'd aloud to them in <hi rend="italic">Spanish, What are ye
                  Gentlemen?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They started up at the Noise, but were ten times more confounded when they saw me,
               and the uncouth Figure that I made. They made no Answer at all, but I thought I
               perceiv'd them just going to fly from me, when I spoke to them in <hi rend="italic">English,</hi>
               Gentlemen, said I, do not be surpriz'd at me; perhaps you may have a Friend near you
               when you did not expect it. He must be sent directly from
               Heaven then, <hi rend="italic">said one of them very gravely to me, and pulling off his Hat at the
                  same time to me,</hi> for our Condition is past the Help of Man. All Help is from
               Heaven, <hi rend="italic">Sir, said I.</hi> But can you put a Stranger in the way how to help you,
               for you seem to me to be in some great Distress? I saw you when you landed, and when
               you seem'd to make Applications to the Brutes that came with you, I saw one of them
               lift up his Sword to kill you.</p>
            <p>The poor Man with Tears running down his Face, and trembling, looking like one
               astonish'd, return'd, <hi rend="italic">Am I talking to God, or Man! Is it a real <pb n="302"
                     /> Man, or an Angel!</hi> Be in no fear about that,
               Sir, <hi rend="italic">said I,</hi> if God had sent an Angel to relieve you, he would have come
               better Cloath'd, and Arm'd after another manner than you see me in; pray lay aside
               your Fears, I am a Man, an <hi rend="italic">English-man,</hi> and dispos'd to assist you, you see; I have one Servant only; we have Arms and Ammunition;
               tell us freely, Can we serve you? — What is your Case?</p>
            <p>Our Case, said he, Sir, is too long to tell you, while our Murtherers are so near;
               but in short, Sir, I was Commander of that Ship, my Men have Mutinied against me;
               they have been hardly prevail'd on not to Murther me, and at
               last have set me on Shore in this desolate Place, with these two Men with me; one my
               Mate, the other a Passenger, where we expected to Perish,
                  believing the Place to be uninhabited, and know not yet
               what to think of it.</p>
            <p>Where are those Brutes, your Enemies, said I, do you know where they are gone?
                  <hi rend="italic">There they lye,</hi> Sir, said he, pointing to a Thicket of Trees; <hi rend="italic">my
                  Heart trembles, for fear they have seen us, and heard you speak, if they have,
                  they will certainly Murther us all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Have they any Fire-Arms, <hi rend="italic">said I,</hi> He answered they had only two Pieces, and
               one which they left in the Boat. Well then, said I, leave the rest to me; I see they
               are all asleep, it is an easie thing to kill them all; but shall we rather take them
               Prisoners? He told me there were two desperate Villains
               among them, that it was scarce safe to shew any Mercy to; but if they were secur'd, he believ'd all the rest would return to their Duty.
               I ask'd him, which they were? He told me he could not at that distance describe them;
               but he would obey my Orders in any thing <pb n="303" /> I
               would direct. Well, says I, let us retreat out of their View or Hearing, least they
               awake, and we will resolve further; so they willingly went back with me, till the
               Woods cover'd us from them.</p>
            <p>Look you, Sir, said I, if I venture upon your Deliverance, are you willing to make
               two Conditions with me; he anticipated my Proposals, by
               telling me, that both he and the Ship, if recover'd, should
               be wholly Directed and Commanded by me in every thing; and if the Ship was not
               recover'd, he would live and dye with me in what Part of the World soever I would
               send him; and the two other Men said the same.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Well,</hi> says I, <hi rend="italic">my Conditions are but two.</hi> 1. That while you stay on
               this Island with me, you will not pretend to any Authority here; and if I put Arms
               into your Hands, you will upon all Occasions give them up to me, and do no Prejudice
               to me or mine, upon this Island, and in the mean time be govern'd by my Orders.</p>
            <p>2. That if the Ship is, or may be recover'd, you will carry me and my Man to
                  <hi rend="italic">England</hi> Passage free.</p>
            <p>He gave me all the Assurances that the Invention and Faith of Man could devise, that
               he would comply with these most reasonable Demands, and besides would owe his Life to me, and acknowledge it upon all
               Occasions as long as he liv'd.</p>
            <p>Well then, <hi rend="italic">said I,</hi> here are three Muskets for you, with Powder and Ball;
               tell me next what you think is proper to be done. He shew'd all the Testimony of his
               Gratitude that he was able; but offer'd to be wholly guided by me. I told him I
               thought it was hard venturing any thing; but the best Method I could think of was to
               fire upon them at once, as they lay; and if any was not kill'd at the first Volley,
               and offered to submit, <pb n="304" /> we might save them,
               and so put it wholly upon God's Providence to direct the Shot.</p>
            <p>He said very modestly, that he was loath to kill them, if he could help it, but that
               those two were incorrigible Villains, and had been the Authors of all the Mutiny in the Ship, and if they escaped, we should be undone
               still; for they would go on Board, and bring the whole Ship's Company, and destroy us all. <hi rend="italic">Well then,</hi> says I,
                     <hi rend="italic">Necessity</hi> legitimates my Advice; for it is
               the only Way to save our Lives. However, seeing him still cautious of shedding Blood,
               I told him they should go themselves, and manage as they found convenient.</p>
            <p>In the Middle of this Discourse, we heard some of them awake, and soon after, we saw
               two of them on their Feet, I ask'd him, if either of them were of the Men who he had
               said were the Heads of the Mutiny? He said, <hi rend="italic">No</hi>: Well then, said I, you may
               let them escape, and Providence seems to have wakned them on Purpose to save
               themselves. Now, says I, if the rest escape you, <hi rend="italic">it is your Fault.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Animated with this, he took the Musket, I had given him, in his Hand, and a Pistol in
               his Belt, and his two Comerades with him, with each Man a Piece in his Hand, The two
               Men who were with him, going first, made some Noise, at which one of the Seamen who
               was awake, turn'd about, and seeing them coming, cry'd out to the rest; but it was
               too late then; for the Moment he cry'd out, they fir'd; <hi rend="italic">I mean the two Men,</hi>
               the Captain wisely reserving his own Piece: They had so well aim'd their Shot at the
               Men they knew, that one of them was kill'd on the Spot, and the other very much
               wounded; but not being dead, he started up upon his Feet, and call'd eagerly for <pb
                  n="305" /> help to the other; but the Captain stepping to
               him told him, 'twas too late to cry for help, he should call upon God to forgive his
               Villany, and with that Word knock'd him down with the Stock of his Musket, so that he never spoke more: There were three more in
               the Company, and one of them was also slightly wounded: By this Time I was come, and
               when they saw their Danger, and that it was in vain to resist, they begg'd for Mercy:
               The Captain told them, he would spare their Lives, if they would give him any
               Assurance of their Abhorrence of the Treachery they had been guilty of, and would
               swear to be faithful to him in recovering the Ship, and afterwards in carrying her
               back to <hi rend="italic">Jamaica</hi> from whence they came: They gave him all the Protestations
               of their Sincerity that could be desir'd, and he was willing to believe them, and
               spare their Lives, which I was not against, only that I oblig'd him to keep them
               bound Hand and Foot while they were upon the Island.</p>
            <p>While this was doing, I sent <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> with the Captain's Mate to the Boat,
               with Orders to secure her, and bring away the Oars, and Sail, which they did; and by
               and by, three straggling Men that were (happily for them) parted from the rest came
               back upon hearing the Guns fir'd, and seeing their Captain, who before was their
               Prisoner, now their Conqueror, they submitted to be bound also; and so our Victory
               was compleat.</p>
            <p>It now remain'd, that the Captain and I should enquire into one another's
               Circumstances: I began first, and told him my whole History, which he heard with an
               Attention even to Amazement; and particularly, at the wonderful Manner of my being
               furnish'd with Provisitions and Ammunition; and indeed, as my Story is a whole
               Collection of Wonders, it affected him deeply; but when he
               reflected <pb n="306" /> from thence upon himself, and how I
               seem'd to have been preserv'd there, on purpose to save his Life, the Tears ran down
               his Face, and he could not speak a Word more.</p>
            <p>After this Communication was at an End, I carry'd him and
               his two Men into my Apartment, leading them in, just where I came out, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>
               At the Top of the House, where I refresh'd them with such Provisions as I had, and
               shew'd them all the Contrivances I had made, during my long, long, inhabiting that
               Place.</p>
            <p>All I shew'd them, all I said to them, was perfectly
               amazing; but above all, the Captain admir'd my Fortification, and how perfectly I had
               conceal'd my Retreat with a Grove of Trees, which having been now planted near twenty
               Years, and the Trees growing much faster than in <hi rend="italic">England,</hi> was become a
               little Wood, and so thick, that it was unpassable in any Part of it, but at that one
               Side, where I had reserv'd my little winding Passage into it: I told him, this was my
               Castle, and my Residence; but that I had a Seat in the Country, as most Princes have, whither I could retreat upon Occasion, and I would
               shew him that too another Time; but at present, our Business was to consider how to
               recover the Ship: He agreed with me as to that; but told me, he was perfectly at a
               Loss what Measures to take; for that there were still six
               and twenty Hands on board, who having entred into a cursed Conspiracy, by which they
               had all forfeited their Lives to the Law, would be harden'd in it now by Desperation;
               and would carry it on, knowing that if they were reduc'd, they should be brought to
               the Gallows, as soon as they came to <hi rend="italic">England,</hi> or to any of the
                  <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Colonies; and that therefore there would be no attacking them,
               with so small a Number as we were.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="307" />I mus'd for some Time upon what he had said,
               and found it was a very rational Conclusion; and that therefore something was to be
               resolv'd on very speedily, as well to draw the Men on board
                  into some Snare for their Surprize, as to prevent their
               Landing upon us, and destroying us; upon this it presently occurr'd to me, that in a
               little while the Ship's Crew wondring what was become of their Comrades, and of the
               Boat, would certainly come on Shore in their other Boat, to see for them, and that
               then perhaps they might come arm'd, and be too strong for us; this he allow'd was
               rational.</p>
            <p>Upon this, I told him the first Thing we had to do, was to <ref target="stave2_"
                  corresp="stave2">stave</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="stave2"
                  target="stave2_">Break up, dismantle. Source: <hi rend="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</hi></note> the
               Boat, which lay upon the Beach, so that they might not carry her off; and taking
               every Thing out of her, leave her so far useless as not to be fit to swim;
               accordingly we went on board, took the Arms which were left on board, out of her, and
               whatever else we found there, which was a Bottle of Brandy, and another of Rum, a few
               Bisket Cakes, a Horn of Powder, and a great Lump of Sugar, in a Piece of Canvas; the
               Sugar was five or six Pounds, all which was very welcome to
               me, especially the Brandy, and Sugar, of which I had had none left for many
               Years.</p>
            <p>When we had carry'd all these Things on Shore (the Oars, Mast, Sail, and Rudder of
               the Boat, were carry'd away before, as above) we knock'd a great Hole in her Bottom,
               that if they had come strong enough to master us, yet they could not carry off the Boat.</p>
            <p>Indeed, it was not much in my Thoughts, that we could be able to recover the Ship;
               but my View was that if they went away without the Boat, I did not much question to
               make her fit again, to carry us away to the <ref target="leeward_" corresp="leeward"

            <p>While we were thus preparing our Designs, and had first, by main Strength heav'd the
               Boat up upon the Beach, so high that the Tide would not
               fleet her off at High-Water-Mark; and besides, had broke a Hole in her Bottom, too
               big to be quickly stopp'd, and were sat down musing what we should do; we heard the
               Ship fire a Gun, and saw her <ref target="waft_" corresp="waft">make a Waft with her
                  Antient</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="waft" target="waft_"
                  >Hoist a particular flag up the mast to signal the boat to return. Source: Oxford
                  English Dictionary</note>, as a Signal for the Boat to come on board; but no Boat
               stirr'd; and they fir'd several Times, making other Signals for the Boat.</p>
            <p>At last, when all their Signals and Firings prov'd fruitless, and they found the Boat
               did not stir, we saw them by the Help of my Glasses, hoist another Boat out, and row
               towards the Shore; and we found as they approach'd, that there was no less than ten
               Men in her, and that they had Fire-Arms with them.</p>
            <p>As the Ship lay almost two Leagues from the Shore, we had a full View of them as they
               came, and a plain Sight of the Men even of their Faces,
               because the Tide having set them a little to the <hi rend="italic">East</hi> of the other Boat,
               they row'd up under Shore, to come to the same Place, where the other had landed, and where the Boat lay.</p>
            <p>By this Means, I say, we had a full View of them, and the Captain knew the Persons
               and Characters of all the Men in the Boat, of whom he said,
               that there were three very honest Fellows, who he was sure were led into this
               Conspiracy by the rest, being over-power'd and frighted.</p>
            <p>But that as for the Boatswain, who it seems was the chief Officer among them, and all
               the rest, they were as outragious as any of the Ship's Crew, and were no doubt made
               desperate in their new Enterprize, <pb n="309"
                  /> and terribly apprehensive he was, that they would be
               too powerful for us.</p>
            <p>I smil'd at him, and told him, that Men in our Circumstances were past the Operation
               of Fear: That seeing almost every Condition that could be, was better than that which
               we were suppos'd to be in, we ought to expect that the Consequence, whether Death or Life, would be sure to be a Deliverance: I ask'd him, What he thought of the Circumstances of my Life? And, Whether a Deliveance were not worth venturing for? And where, Sir, said I,
               is your Belief of my being preserv'd here on purpose to save your Life, which
               elevated you a little while ago? For my Part, said I, there seems to be but one Thing
               amiss in all the Prospect of it; <hi rend="italic">What's that?</hi> Says he; why, said I, 'Tis,
               that as you say, there are three or four honest Fellows among them, which should be
               spar'd; had they been all of the wicked Part of the Crew, I should have thought God's
               Providence had singled them out to deliver them into your Hands; for depend upon it,
               every Man of them that comes a-shore are our own, and shall die, or live, as they
               behave to us.</p>
            <p>As I spoke this with a rais'd Voice and chearful Countenance, I found it greatly
               encourag'd him; so we set vigorously to our Business: We had upon the first
               Appearance of the Boat's coming from the Ship, consider'd of separating our
               Prisoners, and had indeed secur'd them effectually.</p>
            <p>Two of them, of whom the Captain was less assur'd than
               ordinary, I sent with <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> and one of the three (deliver'd Men) to my
               Cave, where they were remote enough, and out of Danger of being heard or discover'd,
               or of finding their way out of the Woods, if they could have deliver'd themselves:
               Here they left them bound, but gave them Provisions, and
               promis'd them if they continu'd there quietly, <pb n="310"
                  /> to give them their Liberty in a Day or two; but that
               if they attempted their Escape, they should be put to Death without Mercy: They
               promis'd faithfully to bear their Confinement with Patience, and were very thankful
               that they had such good Usage, as to have Provisions, and a
               Light left them; for <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> gave them Candles (such as we made our selves)
               for their Comfort; and they did not know but that he stood Sentinel over them at the
                  Entrance.</p>
            <p>The other Prisoners had better Usage; two of them were kept pinion'd indeed, because
               the Captain was not free to trust them; but the other two
               were taken into my Service upon their Captain's Recommendation, and upon their solemnly engaging to live and die with us; so with
               them and the three honest Men, we were seven Men, well arm'd; and I made no doubt we
               shou'd be able to deal well enough with the Ten that were a
               coming, considering that the Captain had said, there were
               three or four honest Men among them also.</p>
            <p>As soon as they got to the Place where their other Boat lay,
               they run their Boat in to the Beach, and came all on Shore, haling the Boat up after
               them, which I was glad to see; for I was afraid they would rather have left the Boat
               at an Anchor, some Distance from the Shore, with some Hands in her, to guard her; and
               so we should not be able to seize the Boat.</p>
            <p>Being on Shore, the first Thing they did, they ran all to their other Boat, and it
               was easy to see that they were under a great Surprize, to find her stripp'd as above,
               of all that was in her, and a great hole in her Bottom.</p>
            <p>After they had mus'd a while upon this, they set up two or three great Shouts, <ref

               could make their <pb n="311" /> Companions hear; but all was
               to no purpose: Then they came all close in a Ring, and fir'd a Volley of their small
               Arms, which indeed we heard, and the Ecchos made the Woods ring; but <ref

               we were sure could not hear, and those in our keeping, though they heard it well enough, yet durst give no Answer to them.</p>
            <p>They were so astonish'd at the Surprize of this, that as they told us afterwards,
               they resolv'd to go all on board again to their Ship, and let them know, that the Men
               were all murther'd, and the Long-Boat stav'd; accordingly they immediately launch'd
               their Boat again, and gat all of them on board.</p>
            <p>The Captain was terribly amaz'd, and even confounded at
               this, believing they would go on board the Ship again, and set Sail, giving their
               Comrades for lost, and so he should still lose the Ship, which he was in Hopes we
               should have recover'd; but he was quickly as much frighted the other way.</p>
            <p>They had not been long put off with the Boat, but we perceiv'd them all coming on
               Shore again; but with this new Measure in their Conduct, which it seems they
               consulted together upon, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> To leave three Men in the Boat, and the rest
               to go on Shore, and go up into the Country to look for their Fellows.</p>
            <p>This was a great Disappointment to us; for now we were at a Loss what to do; for our
               seizing those seven Men on Shore would be no Advantage to us, if we let the Boat
               escape; because they would then row away to the Ship, and then the rest of them would
               be sure to weigh and set Sail, and so our recovering the Ship would be lost.</p>
            <p>However, we had no Remedy, but to wait and see what the Issue of Things might
               present; the seven Men came on Shore, and the three who remain'd <pb n="312" /> in the Boat, put her off to a good
               Distance from the Shore, and came to an Anchor to wait for them; so that it was
               impossible for us to come at them in the Boat.</p>
            <p>Those that came on Shore, kept close together, marching towards the Top of the little
               Hill, under which my Habitation lay; and we could see them plainly, though they could
               not perceive us: We could have been very glad they would have come nearer to us, so
               that we might have fir'd at them, or that they would have gone farther off, that we
               might have come abroad.</p>
            <p>But when they were come to the <ref target="brow_" corresp="brow">Brow</ref><note
                  resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="brow" target="brow_">Crest. Source: Oxford

               Valleys and Woods, which lay towards the <hi rend="italic">North-East</hi> Part, and where the
               Island lay lowest, they shouted, and hollow'd, till they were weary; and not caring
               it seems to venture far from the Shore, nor far from one another, they sat down
               together under a Tree, to consider of it: Had they thought fit to have gone to sleep
               there, as the other Party of them had done, <ref target="would3_" corresp="would3"
                  >they had</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="would3"

               Jobb for us; but they were too full of Apprehensions of Danger, to venture to go to
               sleep, though they could not tell what the Danger was they had to fear neither.</p>
            <p>The Captain made a very just Proposal to me, upon this Consultation of theirs,
                  <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> That perhaps they would all fire a Volley
               again, to endeavour to make their Fellows hear, and that we
               should all Sally upon them, just at the Juncture when their Pieces were all
               discharg'd, and they would certainly yield, and we should have them without
               Blood-shed: I lik'd the Proposal, provided it was done while we were near enough to
               come up to them, before they could load their Pieces again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="313" />But this Event did not happen, and we lay
               still a long Time, very irresolute what Course to take; at length I told them, there
               would be nothing to be done in my Opinion till Night, and then if they did not return
               to the Boat, perhaps we might find a way to get between them, and the Shore, and so
               might use some Stratagem with them in the Boat, to get them on Shore.</p>
            <p>We waited a great while, though very impatient for their removing; and were very
               uneasy, when after long Consultations, we saw them start all up, and march down
               toward the Sea: It seems they had such dreadful Apprehensions upon them, of the
               Danger of the Place, that they resolv'd to go on board the Ship again, give their
               Companions over for lost, and so go on with their intended
                  Voyage with the Ship.</p>
            <p>As soon as I perceiv'd them go towards the Shore, I imagin'd it to be as it really
               was, That they had given over their Search, and were for going back again; and the
               Captain, as soon as I told him my Thoughts, was ready to sink at the Apprehensions of
               it; but I presently thought of a Stratagem to fetch them back again, and which
               answer'd my End to a Tittle.</p>
            <p>I order'd <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> and the Captain's Mate, to go over the little Creek
                  <hi rend="italic">Westward,</hi> towards the Place were the <hi rend="italic">Savages</hi> came on Shore, when
                  <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> was rescu'd; and as soon as they came to a little rising Ground,
               at about half a Mile Distance, I bad them hollow, as loud as they could, and wait
               till they found the Seamen heard them; that as soon as ever they heard the Seamen
               answer them, they should return it again, and then keeping out of Sight, take a
               round, always answering when the other hollow'd, to draw them as far into the Island,
               and among the <pb n="314" /> Woods, as possible, and then
               wheel about again to me, by such ways as I directed them.</p>
            <p>They were just going into the Boat, when <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> and the Mate hollow'd, and
               they presently heard them, and answering, run along the Shore <hi rend="italic">Westward,</hi> towards the Voice they heard, when they were
               presently stopp'd by the Creek, where the Water being up, they could not get over,
               and call'd for the Boat to come up, and <ref target="setover_" corresp="setover">set
                  them over</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="setover"
                  target="setover_">Transport them inland, closer to the voices.</note>, as indeed I
               expected.</p>
            <p>When they had set themselves over, I observ'd, that the Boat being gone up a good way
               into the Creek, and as it were, in a Harbour within the Land, they took one of the
               three Men out of her to go along with them, and left only two in the Boat, having
               fastned her to the Stump of a little Tree on the Shore.</p>
            <p>This was what I wish'd for, and immediately leaving
                  <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> and the Captain's Mate to their Business, I took the rest with me,
               and crossing the Creek out of their Sight, we surpriz'd the two Men before they were
               aware; one of them lying on Shore, and the other being in the Boat; the Fellow on
               Shore, was between sleeping and waking, and going to start up, the Captain who was
               foremost, ran in upon him, and knock'd him down, and then call'd out to him in the
               Boat, to yield, or he was a dead Man.</p>
            <p>There needed very few Arguments to perswade a single Man to yield, when he saw five
               Men upon him, and his Comrade knock'd down; besides, this was it seems one of the
               three who were not so hearty in the Mutiny as the rest of the Crew, and therefore was
               easily perswaded, not only to yield, but afterwards to joyn
               very sincere with us.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> and the Captain's Mate so well manag'd their
               Business with the rest, that they drew them by hollowing and answering, from <pb
                  n="315" /> one Hill to another, and from one Wood to
                  another, till they not only heartily tyr'd them, but left
               them, where they were very sure they could not reach back to the Boat, before it was
               dark; and indeed they were heartily tyr'd themselves also by the Time they came back
               to us.</p>
            <p>We had nothing now to do, but to watch for them, in the Dark, and to fall upon them,
               so as to make sure work with them.</p>
            <p>It was several Hours after <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> came back to me, before they came back to
               their Boat; and we could hear the foremost of them long before they came quite up,
               calling to those behind to come along, and could also hear them answer and complain,
               how lame and tyr'd they were, and not able to come any faster, which was very welcome
               News to us.</p>
            <p>At length they came up to the Boat; but 'tis impossible to express their Confusion,
               when they found the Boat fast a-Ground in the Creek, the Tide ebb'd out, and their
               two Men gone: We could hear them call to one another in a most lamentable Manner, telling one another, they were gotten into
               an inchanted Island; that either there were Inhabitants in it, and they should all be
                  murther'd, or else there were Devils and Spirits in it,
               and they should be all carry'd away, and devour'd.</p>
            <p>They hallow'd again, and call'd their two Comerades by their
               Names, a great many times, but no Answer. After some time, we could see them, by the
               little Light there was, run about wringing their Hands like Men in Despair; and that
               sometimes they would go and sit down in the Boat to rest themselves, then come ashore
               again, and walk about again, and so over the same thing again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="316" />My Men would fain have me given them Leave to
               fall upon them at once in the Dark; but I was willing to take them at some Advantage,
               so to spare them, and kill as few of them as I could; and especially I was unwilling
               to hazard the killing any of our own Men, knowing the other were very well armed. I resolved to wait to see if they did not
               separate; and therefore to make sure of them, I drew my Ambuscade nearer, and order'd
                  <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> and the Captain, to creep upon their Hands and Feet as close to
               the Ground as they could, that they might not be discover'd, and get as near them as
               they could possibly, before they offered to fire.</p>
            <p>They had not been long in that Posture, but that the Boatswain, who was the principal
               Ringleader of the Mutiny, and had now shewn himself the most dejected and dispirited
               of all the rest, came walking towards them with two more of their Crew; the Captain
               was so eager, as having this principal Rogue so much in his Power, that he could
               hardly have Patience to let him come so near, as to be sure of him; for they only
               heard his Tongue before: But when they came nearer, the Captain and <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi>
               starting up on their Feet, let fly at them.</p>
            <p>The Boatswain was kill'd upon the Spot, the next Man was shot into the Body, and fell
               just by him, tho' he did not die 'till an Hour or two after; and the third run for
               it.</p>
            <p>At the Noise of the Fire, I immediately advanc'd with my
               whole Army, which was now 8 Men, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> my self <hi rend="italic">Generalissimo, Friday</hi>
               my Lieutenant-General, the Captain and his two Men, and the
               three Prisoners of War, who we had trusted with Arms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="317" />We came upon them indeed in the Dark, so that
               they could not see our Number; and I made the Man we had left in the Boat, who was
               now one of us, call to them by Name, to try if I could bring them to a Parley, and so
               might perhaps reduce them to Terms, which fell out just as
               we desir'd: for indeed it was easy to think, as their
               Condition then was, they would be very willing to capitulate; so he calls out as loud
               as he could, to one of them, <hi rend="italic">Tom Smith, Tom Smith; Tom Smith</hi> answered
               immediately, <hi rend="italic">Who's that,</hi> Robinson? for it seems he knew his Voice: T'other
               answered, <hi rend="italic">Ay, ay; for God's Sake,</hi> Tom Smith, <hi rend="italic">throw down your Arms, and
                  yield,</hi> or, <hi rend="italic">you are all dead Men this Moment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Who must we yield to? where are they</hi>? (says <hi rend="italic">Smith</hi> again;) <hi rend="italic">Here
                  they are,</hi> says he, here's our Captain, and fifty Men with him, have been
               hunting you this two Hours; the Boatswain is kill'd, <hi rend="italic">Will Frye</hi> is wounded,
               and I am a Prisoner; and if you do not yield, you are all lost.</p>
            <p>Will they give us Quarter then, (says <hi rend="italic">Tom Smith</hi>) and we will yield? <hi rend="italic">I'll
                  go and ask, if you promise to yield,</hi> says
                  <hi rend="italic">Robinson</hi>; so he ask'd the Captain, and the Captain then calls himself
               out, You <hi rend="italic">Smith,</hi> you know my Voice, if you lay down your Arms immediately,
               and submit, you shall have your Lives all but <hi rend="italic">Will Atkins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this, <hi rend="italic">Will Atkins</hi> cry'd out, <hi rend="italic">For God's Sake, Captain, give me
                  Quarter, what have I done? They have been all as bad as I,</hi> which by the Way
               was not true neither; for it seems this <hi rend="italic">Will Atkins</hi> was the first Man that
               laid hold of the Captain, when they first mutiny'd, and used him barbarously, in
               tying his Hands, and giving him injurious Language. However, the Captain told him he
               must lay down his Arms at Discretion, and trust to the Governour's <pb n="318" /> Mercy, by which he meant me; for
               they all call'd me Governour.</p>
            <p><ref target="army_" corresp="army">In a Word, they all laid down their Arms, and
                  begg'd their Lives; and I sent the Man that had parley'd with them, and two more,
                  who bound them all; and then my great Army of 50 Men</ref><note
                  resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="army" target="army_">Crusoe gets comically

               but eight, came up and seiz'd upon them all, and upon their Boat, only that I kept my
               self and one more out of Sight, for Reasons of State.</p>
            <p>Our next Work was to repair the Boat, and think of seizing the Ship; and as for the
               Captain, now he had Leisure to parley with them: He expostulated with them upon the Villany of their Practices
               with him, and at length upon the farther Wickedness of their Design; and how
               certainly it must bring them to Misery and Distress in the End, and perhaps to the
               Gallows.</p>
            <p>They all appear'd very penitent, and begg'd hard for their Lives; as for that, he
               told them, they were none of his Prisoners, but the Commander of the Island, that
               they thought they had set him on Shore in a barren uninhabitated Island, but it had
               pleased God so to direct them, that the Island was inhabited, and that the Governour
               was an <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Man; that he might hang them all there, if he pleased; but as
               he had given them all Quarter, he supposed he would send them to <hi rend="italic">England</hi> to
               be dealt with there, as Justice requir'd, except <hi rend="italic">Atkins,</hi> who he was commanded by the Governour to advise to prepare for Death;
               for that he would be hang'd in the Morning.</p>
            <p>Though this was all a Fiction of his own, yet it had its desired Effect;
                  <hi rend="italic">Atkins</hi> fell upon his Knees to beg the Captain to interceed with the
                  Governour for his Life; and all the rest beg'd of him <pb
                  n="319" /> for God's Sake, that they might not be sent to
                  <hi rend="italic">England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It now occurr'd to me, that the time of our Deliverance was
               come, and that it would be a most easy thing to bring these Fellows in, to be hearty
               in getting Possession of the Ship; so I retir'd in the Dark from them, that they
               might not see what Kind of a Governour they had, and call'd the Captain to me; when I
               call'd, as at a good Distance, one of the Men was order'd to
               speak again, and say to the Captain, <hi rend="italic">Captain, the Commander calls for you</hi>;
               and presently the Captain reply'd, <hi rend="italic">Tell his Excellency, I am just a coming</hi>:
               This more perfectly amused them; and they all believed that
               the Commander was just by with his fifty Men.</p>
            <p>Upon the Captain's coming to me, I told him my Project for seizing the Ship, which he
               lik'd of wonderfully well, and resolv'd to put it in Execution the next Morning.</p>
            <p>But in Order to execute it with more Art, and secure of Success, I told him, we must
               divide the Prisoners, and that he should go and take <hi rend="italic">Atkins</hi> and two more of
               the worst of them, and send them pinion'd to the Cave where the others lay: This was
               committed to <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> and the two Men who came on Shore with the Captain.</p>
            <p>They convey'd them to the Cave, as to a Prison; and it was
               indeed a dismal Place, especially to Men in their Condition.</p>
            <p>The other I order'd to my <hi rend="italic">Bower,</hi> as I call'd it, of which I have given a
               full Description; and as it was fenc'd in, and they
               pinion'd, the Place was secure enough, considering they were <ref target="behavior_"

                  xml:id="behavior" target="behavior_">'On their best behavior.'</note>. </p>
            <p>To these in the Morning I sent the Captain, who was to enter into a Parley with them,
               in a Word to try them, and tell me, whether he thought they <pb n="320"
                  /> might be trusted or no, to go on Board and surprize
               the Ship. He talk'd to them of the Injury done him, of the Condition they were
               brought to; and that though the Governour had given them Quarter for their Lives, as
               to the present Action, yet that if they were sent to <hi rend="italic">England,</hi> they would all
               be hang'd in Chains, to be sure; but that if they would join in so just an Attempt,
               as to recover the Ship, he would have the Governour's Engagement for their Pardon.</p>
            <p>Any one may guess how readily such a Proposal would be
               accepted by Men in their Condition; they fell down on their Knees to the Captain, and
               promised with the deepest Imprecations, that they would be faithful to him to the
               last Drop, and that they should owe their Lives to him, and would go with him all
               over the World, that they would own him for a Father to them as long as they
               liv'd.</p>
            <p>Well, says the Captain, I must go and tell the Governour what you say, and see what I
               can do to bring him to consent to it: So he brought me an Account of the Temper he
               found them in; and that he verily believ'd they would be faithful.</p>
            <p><ref target="governor_" corresp="governor">However, that we might be very secure, I
                  told him he should go back again, and choose out five of them, and tell them, they

                  hostages is meant to show the captives that he does not lack manpower, since five
                  men are of so little value to him. This enhances the fiction of Crusoe as the
                  powerful "Governour."</note>, that he would take out five of them to be his
               Assistants, and that the Governour would keep the other two, and the three that were

               should be hang'd in Chains alive upon the Shore.</p>
            <p>This look'd severe, and convinc'd them that the Governour was in Earnest; however
               they had no <pb n="321" /> Way left them, but to accept it;
               and it was now the Business of the Prisoners, as much as of the Captain, to perswade
               the other five to do their Duty</p>
            <p>Our Strength was now thus ordered for the Expedition: 1. The
               Captain, his Mate, and Passenger. 2. Then the two Prisoners
               of the first Gang, to whom having their Characters from the Captain, I had given their Liberty, and trusted them with Arms.
               3. The other two who I had kept till now, in my Apartment, pinion'd; but upon the
               Captain's Motion, had now releas'd. 4. The single Man taken in the Boat. 5. These
               five releas'd at last: So that they were thirteen in all,
               besides five we kept Prisoners in the Cave, and the two Hostages.</p>
            <p>I ask'd the Captain, if he was willing to venture with these
               Hands on Board the Ship; for as for me and my Man <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> I did not think it
               was proper for us to stir, having seven Men left behind; and it was Employment enough
               for us to keep them assunder, and supply them with Victuals.</p>
            <p>As to the five in the Cave, I resolv'd to keep them fast, but <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> went in
               twice a Day to them, to supply them with Necessaries; and I made the other two carry
               Provisions to a certain Distance, where <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> was to take it.</p>
            <p>When I shew'd my self to the two Hostages, it was with the Captain, who told them, I
               was the Person the Governour had order'd to look after them, and that it was the
               Governour's Pleasure they should not stir any where, but by my Direction; that if they did, they should be fetch'd into the Castle, and be lay'd in Irons; so that as we never
               suffered them to see me as Governour, so I now appear'd as another Person, and spoke
               of the <pb n="322" /> Governour, the Garrison, the Castle,
               and the like, upon all Occasions.</p>
            <p>The Captain now had no Difficulty before him, but to furnish his two Boats, stop the
               Breach of one, and Man them. He made his Passenger Captain of one, with four other
               Men; and himself, and his Mate, and six more, went in the
                  other: And they contriv'd their Business very well; for
               they came up to the Ship about Midnight: As soon as they came within Call of the

               and the Boat, but that it was a long time before they had found them, and the like;
               holding them in a Chat 'till they came to the Ship's Side; when the Captain and the
               Mate entring first with their Arms, immediately knock'd down the second Mate and
               Carpenter, with the But-end of their Muskets, being very faithfully seconded by their
               Men, they secur'd all the rest that were upon the Main and Quarter Decks, and began
               to fasten the Hatches to keep them down who were below, when the other Boat and their
               Men entring at the fore Chains, secur'd the Fore-Castle of the Ship, and the Scuttle
               which went down into the Cook Room, making three Men they found there, Prisoners.</p>
            <p>When this was done, and all safe upon Deck, the Captain order'd the Mate with three

               lay, and having taken the Alarm, was gotten up, and with two Men and a Boy had gotten
               Fire Arms in their Hands, and when the Mate with a Crow split open the Door, the new
               Captain and his Men fir'd boldly among them, and wounded the Mate with a Musket Ball,
               which broke his Arm, and wounded two more of the Men but kill'd no Body.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="323" />The Mate calling for Help, rush'd however into the Round-House, wounded as he was, and with his Pistol
               shot the new Captain thro' the Head, the Bullet entring at his Mouth, and came out
               again behind one of his Ears; so that he never spoke a Word; upon which the rest
               yielded, and the Ship was taken effectually, without any more Lives lost.</p>
            <p>As soon as the Ship was thus secur'd, the Captain order'd
               seven Guns to be fir'd, which was the Signal agreed upon with me, to give me Notice
               of his Success, which you may be sure I was very glad to hear, having sat watching
               upon the Shore for it till near two of the Clock in the Morning.</p>
            <p>Having thus heard the Signal plainly, I laid me down; and it having been a Day of
               great Fatigue to me, I slept very sound, 'till I was something surpriz'd with the Noise of a Gun; and presently starting up, I
               heard a Man call me by the Name of Governour, Governour, and presently I knew the
               Captain's Voice, when climbing up to the Top of the Hill, there he stood, and
               pointing to the Ship, he embrac'd me in his Arms, <hi rend="italic">My dear Friend and
                  Deliverer,</hi> says he, <hi rend="italic">there's your Ship, for she is all yours, and so are
                  we and all that belong to her.</hi> I cast my Eyes to the Ship, and there she rode
               within little more than half a Mile of the Shore; for they had weighed her Anchor as soon as they were Masters of her; and the
               Weather being fair, had brought her to an Anchor just against the Mouth of the little
               Creek; and the Tide being up, the Captain had brought the Pinnace in near the Place
               where I at first landed my Rafts, and so landed just at my Door.</p>
            <p>I was at first ready to sink down with the Surprize. For I
               saw my Deliverance indeed visibly put into my Hands, all things easy, and a large
               Ship just ready to carry me away whither I pleased <pb
                  n="324" /> to go. At first, for some time, I was not able
               to answer him one Word; but as he had taken me in his Arms, I held fast by him, or I
               should have fallen to the Ground.</p>
            <p>He perceived the Surprize, and immediately pulls a Bottle out of his Pocket, and gave
               me a Dram of Cordial, which he had brought on Purpose for
               me; after I had drank it, I sat down upon the Ground; and
               though it brought me to my self, yet it was a good while before I could speak a Word
               to him.</p>
            <p>All this while the poor Man was in as great an Extasy as I, only not under any
               Surprize, as I was; and he said a thousand kind tender things to me, to compose me
               and bring me to my self; but such was the Flood of Joy in my Breast, that it put all
               my Spirits into Confusion, at last it broke out into Tears, and in a little while
               after, I recovered my Speech.</p>
            <p>Then I took my Turn, and embrac'd him as my Deliverer; and we rejoyc'd together. I
               told him, I look upon him as a Man sent from Heaven to deliver me, and that the whole
               Transaction seemed to be a Chain of Wonders; that such things as these were the
               Testimonies we had of a secret Hand of Providence governing the World, and an
               Evidence, that the Eyes of an infinite Power could search into the remotest Corner of
               the World, and send Help to the Miserable whenever he pleased.</p>
            <p>I forgot not to lift up my Heart in Thankfulness to Heaven,
               and what Heart could forbear to bless him, who had not only in a miraculous Manner provided for once in such a Wilderness, and in such a
               desolate Condition, but from whom every Deliverance must always be acknowledged to
                  proceed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="325" />When we had talk'd a while, the Captain told
               me, he had brought me some little Refreshment, such as the Ship afforded, and such as
               the Wretches that had been so long his Master had not plunder'd him of: Upon this he
               call'd aloud to the Boat, and bid his Men bring the things ashore that were for the
               Governour; and indeed it was a Present, as if I had been one not that was to be
               carry'd away along with them, but as if I had been to dwell upon the Island still,
               and they were to go without me.</p>
            <p>First he had brought me a Case of Bottles full of excellent Cordial Waters, six large
               Bottles of <hi rend="italic">Madera</hi> Wine; the Bottles held two Quarts a-piece; two Pound of
               excellent good Tobacco, twelve good Pieces of the Ship's Beef, and six Pieces of
               Pork, with a Bag of Pease, and about a hundred Weight of Bisket.</p>
            <p>He brought me also a Box of Sugar, a Box of Flower, a Bag full of Lemons, and two
               Bottles of Lime-Juice, and Abundance of other things: But besides these, and what was
               a thousand times more useful to me, he brought me six clean new Shirts, six very good
               Neckcloaths, two Pair of Gloves, one Pair of Shoes, a Hat, and one Pair of Stockings,
               and a very good Suit of Cloaths of his own, which had been worn but very little: In a
               Word, he cloathed me from Head to Foot.</p>
            <p>It was a very kind and agreeable Present, as any one may imagine to one in my
               Circumstances: But never was any thing in the World of that Kind so unpleasant,
               awkard, and uneasy, as it was to me to wear such Cloaths at their first putting
               on.</p>
            <p>After these Ceremonies past, and after all his good things were brought into my
               little Apartment, we began to consult what was to be done
               with the Prisoners we had; for it was worth considering, <pb
                  n="326" /> whether we might venture to take them away with us or no, especially two of them, who we knew to be
               incorrigible and refractory to the last Degree; and the Captain said, he knew they
               were such Rogues, that there was no obliging them, and if he did carry them away, it
               must be in Irons, as Malefactors to be delivered over to Justice at the first <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Colony he could come at; and I found that the
               Captain himself was very anxious about it.</p>
            <p>Upon this, I told him, that if he desir'd it, I durst undertake to bring the two Men
               he spoke of, to make it their own Request that he should leave them upon the Island:
                  <hi rend="italic">I should be very glad of that,</hi> says the Captain, <hi rend="italic">with all my
                  Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, says I, I will send for them up, and talk with them for you; so I caused
                  <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> and the two Hostages, for they were now discharg'd, their Comrades having perform'd their Promise; I say, I caused them to go to the Cave, and bring up the five Men
               pinion'd, as they were, to the Bower, and keep them there 'till I came.</p>
            <p>After some time, I came thither dress'd in my new Habit, and now I was call'd
               Governour again; being all met, and the Captain with me, I caused the Men to be
               brought before me, and I told them, I had had a full Account of their villanous
                  Behaviour to the Captain, and how they had run away with
               the Ship, and were preparing to commit farther Robberies, but that Providence had
                  ensnar'd them in their own Ways, and that they were
               fallen into the Pit which they had digged for others.</p>
            <p>I let them know, that by my Direction the Ship had been seiz'd, that she lay now in
               the Road; and they might see by and by, that their new Captain <pb n="327"
                  /> had receiv'd the Reward of his Villany; for that they
               might see him <ref target="yardarm_" corresp="yardarm">hanging at the

            <p>That as to them, I wanted to know what they had to say, why I should not execute them
               as Pirates taken in the Fact, as by my Commission they could
               not doubt I had Authority to do.</p>
            <p>One of them answer'd in the Name of the rest, That they had nothing to say but this,
               That when they were taken, the Captain promis'd them their Lives, and they humbly
               implor'd my Mercy; But I told them, I knew not what Mercy to shew them; for as for my
               self, I had resolv'd to quit the Island with all my Men, and had taken Passage with
               the Captain to go for <hi rend="italic">England</hi>: And as for the Captain, he could not carry
               them to <hi rend="italic">England,</hi> other than as Prisoners in Irons to be try'd for Mutiny,
               and running away with the Ship; the Consequence of which, they must needs know, would
               be the Gallows; so that I could not tell which was best for them, unless they had a
               Mind to take their Fate in the Island; if they desir'd, that I did not care, as I had
               Liberty to leave it, I had some Inclination to give them their Lives, if they thought
               they could shift on Shore.</p>
            <p>They seem'd very thankful for it, said they would much rather venture to stay there,
               than to be carry'd to <hi rend="italic">England</hi> to be hang'd; so I
               left it on that Issue.</p>
            <p>However, the Captain seem'd to make some Difficulty of it, as if he durst not leave
               them there: Upon this I seem'd a little angry with the Captain, and told him, That
               they were my Prisoners, not his; and that seeing I had
               offered them so much Favour, I would be as good as my Word; and that if he did not
               think fit to consent to it, I would set them at Liberty, as I found them; and <pb
                  n="328" /> if he did not like it, he might take them
               again if he could catch them.</p>
            <p>Upon this they appear'd very thankful, and I accordingly set
               them at Liberty, and bad them retire into the Woods to the
               Place whence they came, and I would leave them some Fire Arms, some Ammunition, and
               some Directions how they should live very well, if they thought fit.</p>
            <p>Upon this I prepar'd to go on Board the Ship, but told the Captain, that I would stay
               that Night to prepare my things, and desir'd him to go on Board in the mean time, and
               keep all right in the Ship, and send the Boat on Shore the next Day for me; ordering
               him in the mean time to cause the new Captain who was kill'd, to be hang'd at the
               Yard-Arm that these Men might see him.</p>
            <p>When the Captain was gone, I sent for the Men up to me to my Apartment, and entred
               seriously into Discourse with them of their Circumstances, I told them, I thought
               they had made a right Choice; that if the Captain carry'd them away, they would
               certainly be hang'd. I shewed them the new Captain, hanging at the Yard-Arm of the
               Ship, and told them they had nothing less to expect.</p>
            <p>When they had all declar'd their Willingness to stay, I then told them, I would let
               them into the Story of my living there, and put them into the Way of making it easy
               to them: Accordingly I gave them the whole History of the Place, and of my coming to
               it; shew'd them my Fortifications, the Way I made my Bread, planted my Corn, cured my Grapes; and in a Word, all that was necessary to make them easy: I told them the Story also of the
               sixteen <hi rend="italic">Spaniards</hi> that were to be expected; for
               whom I left a Letter, and made them promise to treat them in common with
               themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="329" />I left them my Fire Arms, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> Five
               Muskets, three Fowling Pieces, and three Swords. I had above a Barrel and half of
               Powder left; for after the first Year or two, I used but little, and wasted none. I
               gave them a Description of the Way I manag'd the Goats, and Directions to milk and
               fatten them, and to make both Butter and Cheese.</p>
            <p>In a Word, I gave them every Part of my own Story; and I told them, I would prevail
               with the Captain to leave them two Barrels of Gun-Powder more, and some Garden-Seeds,
               which I told them I would have been very glade of; also I gave them the Bag of Pease
               which the Captain had brought me to eat, and bad them be sure to sow and encrease them.</p>

            <p>Having done all this, I left them the next Day, and went on Board the Ship: We
               prepared immediately to sail, but did not weigh that Night:
               The next Morning early, two of the five Men came swiming to the Ship's Side, and
               making a most lamentable Complaint of the other three, begged to be taken into the Ship, for God's Sake, for they should be murthered, and
               begg'd the Captain to take them on Board, tho' he hang'd them immediately.</p>
            <p>Upon this the Captain pretended to have no Power without me; But after some
               Difficulty, and after their solemn Promises of Amendment, they were taken, and were
               some time after soundly whipp'd and pickl'd; after which, they prov'd very honest and
               quiet Fellows.</p>
            <p>Some time after this, the Boat was order'd on Shore, the Tide being up, with the
               things promised to the Men, to which the Captain at my Intercession caused their Chests and Cloaths to be aded, which they took, and were very thankful for; I also
               encourag'd them, by telling them, that if <pb n="330" /> it
               lay in my Way to send any Vessel to take them in, I would not forget them.</p>
            <p>When I took leave of this Island, I carry'd on board for Reliques, the great
               Goat's-Skin-Cap I had made, my Umbrella, and my Parrot; also I forgot not to take the
               Money I formerly mention'd, which had lain by me so long useless, that it was grown
               rusty, or tarnish'd, and could hardly pass for Silver, till it had been a little
               rubb'd, and handled; as also the Money I found in the Wreck of the <hi rend="italic">Spanish</hi>
               Ship.</p>
            <p>And thus I left the Island, the Nineteenth of <hi rend="italic">December,</hi> as I found by the
               Ship's Account, in the Year 1686, after I had been upon it eight and twenty Years,
               two Months, and 19 Days; being deliver'd from this second Captivity, the same Day of
               the Month, that I first made my Escape in the <ref target="barcolongo_"

            </p>
            <p>In this Vessel, after a long Voyage, I arriv'd in <hi rend="italic">England,</hi> the Eleventh of
                  <hi rend="italic">June,</hi> in the Year 1687, having been thirty and five Years absent.</p>
            <p>When I came to <hi rend="italic">England,</hi> I was as perfect a Stranger to all the World, as if
               I had never been known there. My Benefactor and faithful Steward, who I had left in Trust with my Money, was alive; but had had great
               Misfortunes in the World; was become a Widow the second Time, and very low in the
               World: I made her easy as to what she ow'd me, assuring her, I would give her no
               Trouble; but on the contrary, in Gratitude to her former Care and Faithfulness to me,
               I reliev'd her as my little Stock would afford, which at that Time would indeed allow
               me to do but little for her; but I assur'd her, I would never forget her former
               Kindness to me; nor did I forget her, when I had sufficient to help her, as shall be
               observ'd in its Place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="331" />I went down afterwards into
               <hi rend="italic">Yorkshire</hi>; but my Father was dead, and my Mother, and all the Family extinct, except that I found two Sisters, and two of
               the Children of one of my Brothers; and as I had been long ago given over for dead,
               there had been no Provision made for me; so that in a Word, I found nothing to
               relieve, or assist me; and that little Money I had, would not do much for me, as to
               settling in the World.</p>
            <p>I met with one Piece of Gratitude indeed, which I did not expect; and this was, That
               the Master of the Ship, who I had so happily deliver'd, and by the same Means sav'd
               the Ship and Cargo, having given a very handsome Account to
               the Owners, of the Manner how I had sav'd the Lives of the Men, and the Ship, they
               invited me to meet them, and some other Merchants concern'd, and altogether made me a very handsome Compliment upon the
               Subject, and a Present of almost two hundred Pounds Sterling.</p>
            <p>But after making several Reflections upon the Circumstances of my Life, and how
               little way this would go towards settling me in the World, I resolv'd to go to <hi rend="italic">Lisbon,</hi> and see if I might not come
               by some Information of the State of my Plantation in the <hi rend="italic">Brasils,</hi> and of
               what was become of my Partner, who I had reason to suppose had some Years now given
               me over for dead.</p>
            <p>With this View I took Shipping for <hi rend="italic">Lisbon,</hi> where I arriv'd in <hi rend="italic">April</hi>
               following; my Man <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> accompanying me very
               honestly in all these Ramblings, and proving a most faithful Servant upon all Occasions.</p>
            <p>When I came to <hi rend="italic">Lisbon,</hi> I found out by Enquiry, and to my particular
               Satisfaction, my old Friend the Captain of the Ship, who first took me up at Sea, off
               of the Shore of <hi rend="italic">Africk:</hi> He was now <pb n="332" />
               grown old, and had left off the Sea, having put his Son, who was far from a young
               Man, into his Ship; and who still used the <hi rend="italic">Brasil</hi> Trade. The old Man did not
               know me, and indeed, I hardly knew him; but I soon brought him to my Remembrance, and as soon brought my self to his Remembrance, when I told him who I was.</p>
            <p>After some passionate Expressions of the old Acquaintance, I
               enquir'd, you may be sure, after my Plantation and my Partner: The old Man told me he
               had not been in the <hi rend="italic">Brasils</hi> for about nine Years; but that he could assure
               me, that when he came away, my Partner was living, but the Trustees, who I had join'd
               with him to take Cognizance of my Part, were both dead; that however, he believ'd that I would have a very good Account of the
               Improvement of the Plantation; for that upon the general Belief of my being cast
               away, and drown'd, my Trustees had given in the Account of the Produce of my Part of
               the Plantation, to the Procurator Fiscal, who had appropriated it, in Case I never
               came to claim it; one Third to the King, and two Thirds to the Monastery of St.
                     <hi rend="italic">Augustine,</hi> to be expended for the Benefit of
               the Poor, and for the Conversion of the <hi rend="italic">Indians</hi> to the Catholick Faith; but that if I appear'd, or any one for me, to
               claim the Inheritance, it should be restor'd; only that the Improvement, or Annual
               Production, being distributed to charitable Uses, could not be restor'd; but he
               assur'd me, that the Steward of the King's Revenue (from Lands) and the Proviedore, or Steward of the Monastery, had taken great Care all
               along, that the Incumbent, that is to say my Partner, gave every Year a faithful
               Account o, the Produce, of which they receiv'd duly my Moiety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="333" />I ask'd him if he knew to what height of Improvement he had brought the Plantation? And, Whether he
               thought it might be worth looking after? Or, Whether on my
               going thither, I should meet with no Obstruction to my Possessing my just Right in
               the Moiety?</p>
            <p>He told me, he could not tell exactly, to what Degree the Plantation was improv'd;
               but this he knew, that my Partner was grown exceeding Rich upon the enjoying but one
               half of it; and that to the best of his Remembrance, he had heard, that the King's
               Third of my Part, which was it seems granted away to some other Monastery, or
                  Religious House, amounted to above two hundred Moidores a Year; that as to my being restor'd to a quiet
               Possession of it, there was no question to be made of that, my Partner being alive to
               witness my Title, and my Name being also enrolled in the Register of the Country;
               also he told me, That the Survivors of my two Trustees, were very fair honest People,
               and very Wealthy; and he believ'd I would not only have their Assistance for putting
               me in Possession, but would find a very considerable Sum of Money in their Hands, for
               my Account; being the Produce of the Farm while their Fathers held the Trust, and
               before it was given up as above, which as he remember'd, was
               for about twelve Years.</p>
            <p>I shew'd my self a little concern'd, and uneasy at this Account, and enquir'd of the
               old Captain, How it came to pass, that the Trustees should thus dispose my Effects,
               when he knew that I had made my Will, and had made him, the <hi rend="italic">Portuguese</hi> Captain, my universal Heir, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He told me, that was true; but that as there was no Proof of my being dead, he could
               not act as Executor, until some certain Account should <pb n="334"
                  /> come of my Death, and that besides, he was not willing
               to intermeddle with a thing so remote; that it was true he had registred my Will, and
               put in his Claim; and could he have given any Account of my being dead or alive, he
               would have acted by Procuration, and taken Possession of the <hi rend="italic">Ingenio,</hi> so
               they call'd the Sugar-House, and had given his Son, who was now at the
                  <hi rend="italic">Brasils,</hi> Order to do it.</p>
            <p>But, says the old Man, I have one Piece of News to tell you, which perhaps may not be
               so acceptable to you as the rest, and that is, That believing you were lost, and all
               the World believing so also, your Partner and Trustees did
                  offer to accompt to me in your Name, for six or eight of
               the first Years of Profits, which I receiv'd; but there being at the time, says he,
               great Disbursments for encreasing the Works, building an
                  <hi rend="italic">Ingenio,</hi> and buying Slaves, it did not amount to near so much as
               afterwards it produced: However, says the old Man, I shall give you a true Account of
               what I have received in all, and how I have disposed of it.</p>
            <p>After a few Days farther Conference with this ancient Friend, he brought me an
               Account of the six first Years Income of my Plantation, sign'd by my Partner and the
               Merchants Trustees, being always deliver'd in Goods,
                  <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> Tobacco in Roll, and Sugar in Chests, besides Rum, Molossus,
                  <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> which is the Consequence of a Sugar Work; and I found by this
               Account, that every Year the Income considerably encreased;
               but as above, the Disbursement being large, the Sum at first was small: However, the
               old Man let me see, that he was Debtor to me 470 Moidores of Gold, besides 60 Chests
               of Sugar, and 15 double Rolls of Tobacco which were lost in
               his Ship; he having been <pb n="335" /> Ship-wreck'd coming
               Home to <hi rend="italic">Lisbon</hi> about 11 Years after my leaving the Place.</p>
            <p>The good Man then began to complain of his Misfortunes, and how he had been obliged
               to make Use of my Money to recover his Losses, and buy him a Share in a new Ship:
               However, my old Friend, says he, you shall not want a Supply in your Necessity; and
               as soon as my Son returns, you shall be fully satisfy'd.</p>
            <p>Upon this, he pulls out an old Pouch, and gives me 160 <hi rend="italic">Portugal</hi> Moidores in
               Gold; and giving me the Writing of his Title to the Ship, which his Son was gone to
               the <hi rend="italic">Brasils</hi> in, of which he was a Quarter Part Owner, and his Son another, he puts them both into my Hands for Security of the rest.</p>
            <p>I was too much mov'd with the Honesty and Kindness of the poor Man, to be able to
               bear this; and remembring what he had done for me, how he had taken me up at Sea, and
               how generously he had used me on all Occasions, and particularly, how sincere a
               Friend he was now to me, I could hardly refrain Weeping at what he said to me:
               Therefore, first I asked him, if his Circumstances admitted him to spare so much
               Money at that time, and if it would not straiten him? He
               told me, he could not say but it might <ref target="straiten2_" corresp="straiten2"
                  >straiten him a little</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff"
                  xml:id="straiten2" target="straiten2_">To make his financial situation tight.
                  Soure: <hi rend="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</hi></note>; but however it was my Money, and I might
               want it more than he.</p>
            <p>Every thing the good Man said was full of Affection, and I
               could hardly refrain from Tears while he spoke: In short, I took 100 of the Moidores, and call'd for a Pen and Ink to give him a Receipt
               for them; then I returned him the rest, and told him, If ever I had Possession of the
               Plantation, I would return the other to him also, as indeed I afterwards did; and that as to the Bill of Sale of <pb n="336"
                  /> his Part in his Son's Ship, I would not take it by any
               Means; but that if I wanted the Money, I found he was honest enough to pay me; and if
               I did not, but came to receive what he gave me reason to
               expect, I would never have a Penny more from him.</p>
            <p>When this was pass'd, the old Man began to ask me, If he should put me into a Method
               to make my Claim to my Plantation? I told him, I thought to go over to it my self: He
               said, I might do so if I pleas'd; but that if I did not, there were Ways enough to secure my Right, and immediately to appropriate the Profits to my Use; and as there were Ships in
               the River of <hi rend="italic">Lisbon,</hi> just ready to go away to <hi rend="italic">Brasil,</hi> he made me
               enter my Name in a Publick Register, with his Affidavit, affirming upon Oath that I
               was alive, and that I was the same Person who took up the Land for the Planting the
               said Plantation at first.</p>
            <p>This being regularly attested by a Notary, and a Procuration affix'd, he directed me
               to send it with a Letter of his Writing, to a Merchant of his Acquaintance at the
               Place, and then propos'd my staying with him till an Account came of the Return.</p>
            <p>Never any Thing was more honourable, than the Proceedings upon this Procuration; for
               in less than seven Months, I receiv'd a large Packet from the Survivors of my
               Trustees the Merchants, for whose Account I went to Sea, in which were the following
               particular Letters and Papers enclos'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">First,</hi> There was the Account Current of the Produce of my Farm, or
               Plantation, from the Year when their Fathers had ballanc'd with my old <hi rend="italic">Portugal</hi> Captain, being for six Years; the Ballance
               appear'd to be 1174 Moidores in my Favour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="337" />
               <hi rend="italic">Secondly,</hi> There was the Account of four Years more while they kept the
               Effects in their Hands, before the Government claim'd the Administration, as being
               the Effects of a Person not to be found, which they call'd <hi rend="italic">Civil Death</hi>; and
               the Ballance of this, the Value of the Plantation encreasing, amounted to Cruisadoes, which made 3241 Moidores.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Thirdly,</hi> There was the Prior of the <hi rend="italic">Augustin</hi>'s Account, who had
               receiv'd the Profits for above fourteen Years; but not being to account for what was
               dispos'd to the Hospital, very honestly declar'd he had 872
               Moidores not distributed, which he acknowledged to my Account, as to the King's Part,
               that refunded nothing.</p>
            <p>There was a Letter of my Partner's, congratulating me very
               affectionately upon my being alive, giving me an Account how the Estate was improv'd, and what it produced a Year, with a Particular of the Number of Squares or Acres that it contained;
               how planted, how many Slaves there were upon it, and making two and twenty Crosses
               for Blessings, told me he had said so many <hi rend="italic">Ave Marias</hi> to thank the Blessed
               Virgin that I was alive; inviting me very passionately to come over and take
               Possession of my own; and in the mean time to give him Orders to whom he should
                  deliver my Effects, if I did not come my self; concluding with a hearty Tender of his Friendship, and that of
               his Family, and sent me, as a Present, seven fine Leopard's Skins, which he had it
               seems received from <hi rend="italic">Africa,</hi> by some other Ship which he had sent thither,
               and who it seems had made a better Voyage than I: He sent me
               also five Chests of excellent Sweet-meats, and an hundred Pieces of Gold uncoin'd,
               not quite so large as Moidores.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="338" />By the same Fleet, my two Merchant Trustees
               shipp'd me 1200 Chests of Sugar, 800 Rolls of Tobacco, and
               the rest of the whole Accompt in Gold.</p>
            <p>I might well say, now indeed, That the latter End of <hi rend="italic">Job</hi> was better than the
               Beginning. It is impossible to express here the Flutterings of my very Heart, when I
               look'd over these Letters, and especially when I found all my Wealth about me; for as
               the <hi rend="italic">Brasil</hi> Ships come all in Fleets, the same Ships which brought my
               Letters, brought my Goods; and the Effects were safe in the River before the Letters came to my Hand. In a Word, I turned pale, and grew sick;
               and had not the old Man run and fetch'd me a Cordial, I believe the sudden Surprize
               of Joy had overset Nature, and <ref target="would2_" corresp="would2">I
                  had</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="would2" target="would2_"

            <p>Nay after that, I continu'd very ill, and was so some Hours, 'till a Physician being
               sent for, and something of the real Cause of my Illness being known, he order'd me to
               be let Blood; after which, I had Relief, and grew well: But I verily believe, if it
               had not been <ref target="humors_" corresp="humors">eas'd by a Vent given in that

                  to drain the excess humors and restore equilibrium. Source: Wikipedia</note>, I
               should have dy'd.</p>
            <p>I was now Master, all on a Sudden, of above 5000 <hi rend="italic">l. Sterling</hi> in Money, and
               had an Estate, as I might well call it, in the <hi rend="italic">Brasils,</hi> of above a thousand
               Pounds a Year, as sure as an Estate of Lands in <hi rend="italic">England</hi>: And in a Word, I
               was in a Condition which I scarce knew how to understand, or how to compose my self,
               for the Enjoyment of it.</p>
            <p>The first thing I did, was to recompense my original
               Benefactor, my good old Captain, who had been first charitable to me in my Distress,
               kind to me in my Beginning, and honest to me at the End: I shew'd him all that was
               sent me, I <pb n="339" /> told him, that next to the
               Providence of Heaven, which disposes all things, it was owing to him; and that it now
               lay on me to reward him, which I would do a hundred fold: So I first return'd to him
               the hundred Moidores I had receiv'd of him, then I sent for a Notary, and caused him
               to draw up a general Release or Discharge for the 470 Moidores, which he had
               acknowledg'd he ow'd me in the fullest and firmest Manner possible; after which, I caused a Procuration to be drawn, impowering
               him to be my Receiver of the annual Profits of my Plantation, and appointing my
                  Partner to accompt to him, and make the Returns by the
               usual Fleets to him in my Name; and a Clause in the End, being a Grant of 100
               Moidores a Year to him, during his Life, out of the Effects, and 50 Moidores a Year
               to his Son after him, for his Life: And thus I requited my old Man.</p>
            <p>I was now to consider which Way to steer my Course next; and what to do with the
               Estate that Providence had thus put into my Hands; and indeed I had more Care upon my Head now, than I had in my silent State of Life in the
               Island, where I wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing but what I wanted:
               Whereas I had now a great Charge upon me, and my Business was how to secure it. I had
               ne'er a Cave now to hide my Money in, or a Place where it might lye without Lock or
               Key, 'till it grew mouldy and tarnish'd before any Body would meddle with it: On the
               contrary, I knew not where to put it, or who to trust with it. My old Patron, the
                  Captain, indeed was honest, and that was the only Refuge I had.</p>
            <p>In the next Place, my Interest in the <hi rend="italic">Brasils</hi> seem'd to summon me thither,
               but now I could not tell, how to think of going thither, 'till I had <pb n="340"
                  /> settled my Affairs, and left my Effects in some safe
               Hands behind me. At first I thought of my old Friend the Widow, who I knew was
               honest, and would be just to me; but then she was in Years, and but poor, and for
               ought I knew, might be in Debt; so that in a Word, I had no Way but to go back to
                  <hi rend="italic">England</hi> my self, and take my Effects with me.</p>
            <p>It was some Months however before I resolved upon this; and therefore, as I had
               rewarded the old Captain fully, and to his Satisfaction, who had been my former
               Benefactor, so I began to think of my poor Widow, whose Husband had been my first
               Benefactor, and she, while it was in her Power, my faithful Steward and Instructor.
               So the first thing I did, I got a Merchant in <hi rend="italic">Lisbon</hi> to write to his
               Correspondent in <hi rend="italic">London,</hi> not only to pay a Bill, but to go find her out, and
               carry her in Money, an hundred Pounds from me, and to talk
               with her, and comfort her in her Poverty, by telling her she
               should, if I liv'd, have a further Supply: At the same time
               I sent my two Sisters in the Country, each of them an Hundred Pounds, they being,
               though not in Want, yet not in very good Circumstances; one having been marry'd, and
               left a Widow; and the other having a Husband not so kind to
               her as he should be.</p>
            <p>But among all my Relations, or Acquaintances, I could not yet pitch upon one, to whom
               I durst commit the Gross of my Stock, that I might go away
               to the <hi rend="italic">Brasils,</hi> and leave things safe behind me; and this greatly perplex'd

            <p>I had once a Mind to have gone to the <hi rend="italic">Brasils,</hi> and have settled my self
               there; for I was, as it were, naturaliz'd to the Place; but I had some little Scruple, in my Mind about Religion, which insensibly drew me back, of which I shall say <pb n="341"
                  /> more presently. However, it was not Religion that kept
               me from going there for the present; and as I had made no Scruple of being openly of
               the Religion of the Country, all the while I was among them, so neither did I yet;
               only that now and then having of late thought more of it, (than formerly) when I
               began to think of living and dying among them, I began to regret my having profess'd
               my self a <ref target="papist_" corresp="papist">Papist</ref><note

               might not be the best Religion to die with.</p>
            <p>But, as I have said, this was not the main thing that kept me from going to the
                  <hi rend="italic">Brasils,</hi> but that really I did not know with
               whom to leave my Effects behind me; so I resolv'd at last to go to <hi rend="italic">England</hi>
               with it, where, if I arrived, I concluded I should make some Acquaintance, or find
               some Relations that would be faithful to me; and according I prepar'd to go for <hi rend="italic">England</hi> with all my Wealth.</p>
            <p>In order to prepare things for my going Home, I first, the <hi rend="italic">Brasil</hi> Fleet
               being just going away, resolved to give Answers suitable to the just and faithful
                  Account of things I had from thence; and first to the
               Prior of St. <hi rend="italic">Augustine</hi> I wrote a Letter full of Thanks for their just
               Dealings, and the Offer of the 872 Moidores, which was indisposed of, which I desir'd might be given 500 to the Monastery, and 372 to the
               Poor, as the Prior should direct, desiring the good
                  <hi rend="italic">Padres</hi> Prayers for me, and the like.</p>
            <p>I wrote next a Letter of Thanks to my two Trustees, with all the Acknowledgment that
               so much Justice and Honesty call'd for; as for sending them
               any Present, they were far above having any Occasion of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Lastly,</hi> I wrote to my Partner, acknowledging his Industry in the Improving
               the Plantation, and his Integrity in encreasing the Stock of the Works, giving him
               Instructions for his future Government <pb n="342"
                  /> of my Part, according to the Powers I had left with my
               old Patron, to whom I desir'd him to send whatever became due to me, 'till he should
               hear from me more particularly; assuring him that it was my Intention, not only to
               come to him, but to settle my self there for the Remainder of my Life: To this I
               added a very handsom Present of some <hi rend="italic">Italian</hi> Silks for his Wife, and two
               Daughters, for such the Captain's Son inform'd me he had; with two Pieces of fine

            <p>Having thus settled my Affairs, sold my Cargoe, and turn'd
               all my Effects into good Bills of Exchange, my next Difficulty was, which Way to go
               to <hi rend="italic">England</hi>: I had been accustom'd enough to the Sea, and yet I had a strange
               Aversion to going to <hi rend="italic">England</hi> by Sea at that time; and though I could give no
               Reason for it, yet the Difficulty encreas'd upon me so much, that though I had once
               shipp'd my Baggage, in order to go, yet I alter'd my Mind, and that not once, but two
               or three times.</p>
            <p>It is true, I had been very unfortunate by Sea, and this might be some of the Reason:
               But let no Man slight the strong Impulses of his own Thoughts in Cases of such
               Moment: Two of the Ships which I had singl'd out to go in, I mean, more particularly
               singl'd out than any other, that is to say, so as in one of them to put my things on
               Board, and in the other to have agreed with the Captain; I say, two of these Ships

            <p>In a Word, I was so prepossess'd against my goingt by Sea at all, except from
                  <hi rend="italic">Calais</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Dover,</hi> that I resolv'd to travel all the Way by Land;
               which as I was not in Haste, and did not value the Charge, was by much the pleasanter
               Way; and to make it more so, my old Captain brought an <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Gentleman, the Son of a Merchant in <hi rend="italic">Lisbon,</hi> who was willing
               to travel with me: After which, we pick'd up two more <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Merchants
               also, and two young <hi rend="italic">Portuguese</hi> Gentlemen, the last going to <hi rend="italic">Paris</hi>
               only; so that we were in all six of us, and five Servants; the two Merchants and the

               mounted and armed, we made a little Troop, whereof they did me the Honour to call me
               Captain, as well because I was the oldest Man, as because I had two Servants, and indeed was the <ref target="cause_"

            <p>When we came to <hi rend="italic">Madrid,</hi> we being all of us Strangers to <hi rend="italic">Spain,</hi> were

               on.</p>
            <p>When we came to <hi rend="italic">Pampeluna</hi> it self, we found it so indeed; and to me that had
               been always used to a hot Climate, and indeed to Countries where we could scarce bear
               any Cloaths on, the Cold was insufferable; nor indeed was it more painful than it was
               surprising, to come but ten Days before out of the old
               Castile where the Weather was not only warm but very hot, and immediately to feel a
               Wind from the <hi rend="italic">Pyrenean</hi> Mountains, so very keen, so
               severely cold, as to be intollerable, and to endanger benumbing and perishing of our
               Fingers and Toes.</p>
            <p>Poor <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> was really frighted when he saw the Mountains all cover'd with
               Snow, and felt cold Weather, which he had never seen or felt before in his Life.</p>
            <p>To mend the Matter, when we came to <hi rend="italic">Pampeluna,</hi> it
               continued snowing with so much Violence, and so long, that
               the People said, Winter was come before its time, and the Roads which were difficult
               before, were now quite impassable: For in a Word, the Snow lay in some Places too
               thick for us to travel; and being not hard frozen, as <pb n="345"
                  /> is the Case in Northern Countries: There was no going
               without being in Danger of being bury'd alive every Step. We stay'd no less than
               twenty Days at <hi rend="italic">Pampeluna</hi>; when seeing the Winter coming on, and no Likelihood of its being better; for it was the severest Winter all
               over <hi rend="italic">Europe</hi> that had been known in the Memory of Man. I propos'd that we

            <p>We sent for this Guide, who told us, he would undertake to carry us the same Way with
               no Hazard from the Snow, provided we were armed sufficiently
               to protect our selves from wild Beasts; for he said, upon these great Snows, it was
                  frequent for some Wolves to show themselves at the Foot
               of the Mountains, being made ravenous for Want of Food, the Ground being covered with
               Snow: We told him, we were well enough prepar'd for such Creatures as they were, if

            <p>He satisfy'd us there was no Danger of that kind in the Way that we were to go; so we
               readily agreed to follow him, as did also twelve other Gentlemen, <pb n="346" /> with their
               Servants, some <hi rend="italic">French,</hi> some <hi rend="italic">Spanish</hi>; who,
               as I said, had attempted to go, and were oblig'd to come back again.</p>

               Climate again, where the Country was pleasant, and no Snow
               to be seen; but on a sudden, turning to his left, he approach'd the Mountains another
               Way; and though it is true, the Hills and Precipices look'd dreadful, yet he made so

               Mountains, without being much incumbred with the Snow; and all on a sudden, he shew'd
               us the pleasant fruitful Provinces of <hi rend="italic">Languedoc</hi> and
                  <hi rend="italic">Gascoign,</hi> all green and flourishing; tho' indeed it was at a great
               Distance, and we had some rough Way to pass yet.</p>
            <p>We were a little uneasy however, when we found it snow'd one whole Day, and a Night,
               so fast, that we could not travel; but he bid us be easy, we should soon be past it
               all: We found indeed, that we began to descend every Day, and to come more
                  <hi rend="italic">North</hi> than before; and so depending upon our Guide, we went on.</p>
            <p>It was about two Hours before Night, when our Guide being something before us, and
               not just in Sight, out rushed three monstrous Wolves, and after them a Bear, out of a
               hollow Way, adjoyning to a thick Wood; two of the Wolves
               flew upon the Guide, and had he been half a Mile before us,
               he had been devour'd indeed, before we could <pb n="347" />
               have help'd him: One of them fastned upon his Horse, and the other attack'd the Man
               with that Violence, that he had not Time, or not Presence of Mind enough to draw his
               Pistol, but hollow'd and cry'd out to us most lustily; my Man <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> being
               next me, I bid him ride up, and see what was the Matter; as soon as <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi>
               came in Sight of the Man, he hollow'd as loud as t'other, <hi rend="italic">O Master! O Master!</hi> But like a bold Fellow, rode directly up to the poor Man, and with his Pistol shot the Wolf
               that attack'd him into the Head.</p>
            <p>It was happy for the poor Man, that it was my Man <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi>; for he having been
               us'd to that kind of Creature in his Country, had no Fear upon him; but went close up
               to him, and shot him as above; whereas any of us, would have fir'd at a farther
               Distance, and have perhaps either miss'd the Wolf, or endanger'd shooting the
               Man.</p>
            <p>But it was enough to have terrify'd a bolder Man than I, and indeed it alarm'd all
               our Company, when with the Noise of <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi>'s
               Pistol, we heard on both Sides the dismallest Howling of Wolves, and the Noise
               redoubled by the Eccho of the Mountains, that it was to us as if there had been a
               prodigious Multitude of them; and perhaps indeed there was not such a Few, as that we
               had no cause of Apprehensions.</p>
            <p>However, as <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> had kill'd this Wolf, the other
               that had fastned upon the Horse, left him immediately, and
               fled; having happily fastned upon his Head, where the Bosses of the Bridle had stuck
               in his Teeth; so that he had not done him much Hurt: The Man indeed was most Hurt;
               for the raging Creature had bit him twice, once on the Arm, and the other Time a
               little above his Knee; and he was just as it were tumbling down by the <pb n="348"
                  /> Disorder of his Horse, when <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> came up
               and shot the Wolf.</p>
            <p>It is easy to suppose, that at the Noise of <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi>'s Pistol, we all mended our Pace, and rid up as fast as the Way (which was
               very difficult) would give us leave, to see what was the Matter; as soon as we came
               clear of the Trees, which blinded us before, we saw clearly what had been the Case,
               and how <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> had disengag'd the poor Guide; though we did not presently
               discern what kind of Creature it was he had kill'd.</p>

            <p>But never was a Fight manag'd so hardily, and in such a surprizing Manner, as that
               which follow'd between <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> and the Bear, which gave us all (though at
               first we were surpriz'd and afraid for him) the greatest Diversion imaginable: As the
               Bear is a heavy, clumsey Creature, and does not gallop as the Wolf does, who is
               swift, and light; so he has two particular Qualities, which generally are the Rule of
               his Actions; First, As to Men, who are not his proper Prey; I say, not his proper
               Prey; because tho' I cannot say what excessive Hunger might do, which was now their
               Case, the Ground being all cover'd with Snow; but as to Men, he does not usually attempt them, unless they first attack him: On the
               contrary, if you meet him in the Woods, if you don't meddle with him, he won't meddle
               with you; but then you must take Care to be very Civil to him, and give him the Road;
               for he is a very nice Gentleman, he won't go a Step out of his Way for a Prince; nay,
               if you are really afraid, your best way is to look another Way, and keep going on;
               for sometimes if you stop, and stand still, and look steadily at him, he takes it for
               an Affront; but if you throw or toss any Thing at him, and it hits him, though it
               were but a bit of a Stick, as big as your Finger, he takes it for an Affront, and
               sets all <pb n="349" /> his other Business aside to pursue
               his Revenge; for he will have Satisfaction in Point of Honour; that is his first
               Quality: The next is, That if he be once affronted, he will never leave you, Night or
               Day, till he has his Revenge; but follows at a good round rate, till he overtakes
               you.</p>
            <p>My Man <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> had deliver'd our Guide, and when we came up to him, he was
               helping him off from his Horse; for the Man was both hurt and frighted, and indeed,
               the last more than the first; when on the sudden, we spy'd the Bear come out of the
               Wood, and a vast monstrous One it was, the biggest by far that ever I saw: We were
               all a little surpriz'd, when we saw him; but when <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> saw him, it was
               easy to see Joy and Courage in the Fellow's Countenance; <hi rend="italic">O! O! O!</hi> Says
                  <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> three Times, pointing to him; <hi rend="italic">O</hi> Master! <hi rend="italic">You give me
                  te Leave! Me shakee te Hand with him: Me make you good laugh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was surpriz'd to see the Fellow so pleas'd; <hi rend="italic">You Fool you,</hi> says I, <hi rend="italic">he
                  will eat you up! Eatee me up! Eatee me up!</hi> Says <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> twice over
               again; <hi rend="italic">Me eatee him up; me makee you good laugh: You all stay here, me show you
                  good laugh</hi>; so down he sits, and gets his Boots off in a Moment, and put on a
               Pair of Pumps (as we call the flat Shoes they wear) and which he had in his Pocket,
               gives my other Servant his Horse, and with his Gun away he flew swift like the
               Wind.</p>
            <p>The Bear was walking softly on, and offer'd to meddle with no Body, till
                  <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> coming pretty near, calls to him, as if the Bear could understand
               him; <hi rend="italic">Hark ye, hark ye,</hi> says <hi rend="italic">Friday, me speakee wit you:</hi> We follow'd
               at a Distance; for now being come down on the <hi rend="italic">Gascoign</hi> side of the Mountains, we were entred a vast great Forest, where the Country
               was plain, and pretty open, though many Trees in it scatter'd here and there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="350" />
               <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> who had as we say, the Heels of the Bear, came up with him quickly,
               and takes up a great Stone, and throws at him, and hit him just on the Head; but did
               him no more harm, than if he had thrown it against a Wall; but it answer'd
                  <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi>'s End; for the Rogue was so void of Fear, that he did it purely to
               make the Bear follow him, and show us some Laugh as he call'd it.</p>
            <p>As soon as the Bear felt the Stone, and saw him, he turns about, and comes after him,
               taking Devilish long Strides, and shuffling along at a
               strange Rate, so as would have put a Horse to a middling Gallop; away runs <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> and takes his Course, as if he run towards us for
               Help; so we all resolv'd to fire at once upon the Bear, and deliver my Man; though I
               was angry at him heartily, for bringing the Bear back upon us, when he was going
               about his own Business another Way; and especially I was angry that he had turn'd the
               Bear upon us, and then run away; and I call'd out, <hi rend="italic">You Dog,</hi> said I, <hi rend="italic">is
                  this your making us laugh? Come away, and take your Horse, that we may shoot the
                  Creature </hi>; he hears me, and crys out, <hi rend="italic">No shoot, no shoot, stand still,
                  you get much Laugh.</hi> And as the nimble Creature run two Foot for the Beast's
               one, he turn'd on a sudden, on one side of us, and seeing a great Oak-Tree, fit for
               his Purpose, he beckon'd to us to follow, and doubling his
               Pace, he gets nimbly up the Tree, laying his Gun down upon the Ground, at about five
               or six Yards from the Bottom of the Tree.</p>
            <p>The Bear soon came to the Tree, and we follow'd at a
               Distance; the first Thing he did, he stopp'd at the Gun, smelt to it, but let it lye,
               and up he scrambles into the Tree, climbing like a Cat, though so monstrously heavy:
               I was amaz'd at the Folly, as I thought it, of my Man, and could not for my Life see
               any Thing to laugh at yet, till seeing <pb n="351"
                  /> the Bear get up the Tree, we all rod nearer to
               him.</p>
            <p>When we came to the Tree, there was <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> got out to the small End of a
               large Limb of the Tree, and the Bear got about half way to him; as soon as the Bear
               got out to that part where the Limb of the Tree was weaker, <hi rend="italic">Ha,</hi> says he to
               us, <hi rend="italic">now you see me teachee the Bear dance</hi>; so he falls a jumping and shaking
               the Bough, at which the Bear began to totter, but stood still, and begun to look
               behind him, to see how he should get back; then indeed we did laugh heartily: But
                  <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> had not done with him by a great deal; when he sees him stand
               still, he calls out to him again, as if he had suppos'd the Bear could speak
                  <hi rend="italic">English; What you no come farther, pray you come farther</hi>; so he left
                  jumping and shaking the Trees; and the Bear, just as if
               he had understood what he said, did come a little further, then he fell a jumping
               again, and the Bear stopp'd again.</p>
            <p>We thought now was a good time to knock him on the Head, and call'd to
                  <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> to stand still, and we would shoot the Bear; but he cry'd out
               earnestly, <hi rend="italic">O pray! O pray! No shoot, me shoot, by and then</hi>; he would have
               said, <hi rend="italic">By and by</hi>: However, to shorten the Story, <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> danc'd so
               much, and the Bear stood so ticklish, that we had laughing enough indeed, but still
               could not imagine what the Fellow would do; for first we thought he depended upon shaking the Bear off; and we found the Bear was
               too cunning for that too; for he would not go out far enough to be thrown down, but
               clings fast with his great broad Claws and Feet, so that we could not imagine what
               would be the End of it, and where the Jest would be at last.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="352" />But <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> put us out of doubt
               quickly; for seeing the Bear cling fast to the Bough, and that he would not be
               perswaded to come any farther; <hi rend="italic">Well, well,</hi> says <hi rend="italic">Friday, you no come
                  farther, me go, me go; you no come to me, me go come to you</hi>; and upon this,
               he goes out to the smallest End of the Bough, where it would bend with his Weight,
               and gently lets himself down by it, sliding down the Bough, till he came near enough
               to jump down on his Feet, and away he run to his Gun, takes it up, and stands
               still.</p>
            <p>Well, said I to him <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> What will you do now? Why don't you shoot him?
                  <hi rend="italic">No shoot,</hi> says <hi rend="italic">Friday, no yet, me shoot now, me no kill; me stay,
                  give you one more laugh</hi>; and indeed so he did, as you will see presently; for
               when the Bear see his Enemy gone, he comes back from the
               Bough where he stood; but did it mighty leisurely, looking behind him every Step, and
               coming backward till he got into the Body of the Tree; then with the same hinder End
               foremost, he came down the Tree, grasping it with his Claws, and moving one Foot at a
               Time, very leisurely; at this Juncture, and just before he could set his hind Feet
               upon the Ground, <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> stept up close to him, clapt the Muzzle of his Piece
               into his Ear, and shot him dead as a Stone.</p>
            <p>Then the Rogue turn'd about, to see if we did not laugh, and when he saw we were
               pleas'd by our Looks, he falls a laughing himself very loud; <hi rend="italic">so we kill Bear in
                  my Country,</hi> says <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi>; so you kill them, says I, Why you have no
               Guns: <hi rend="italic">No,</hi> says he, <hi rend="italic">no Gun, but shoot, great much long Arrow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was indeed a good Diversion to us; but we were still in a wild Place, and our
               Guide very much hurt, and what to do we hardly knew; the Howling of Wolves run much
               in my Head; and indeed, <pb n="353"
                  /> except the Noise I once heard on the Shore of
                  <hi rend="italic">Africa,</hi> of which I have said something already. I never heard any thing
               that filled me with so much Horrour.</p>
            <p>These things, and the Approach of Night, called us off, or
               else, as <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> would have had us, we should certainly have taken the Skin
               of this monstrous Creature off, which was worth saving; but we had three Leagues to
               go, and our Guide hasten'd us, so we left him, and went forward on our Journey.</p>
            <p>The Ground was still cover'd with Snow, tho' not so deep and dangerous as on the
               Mountains, and the ravenous Creatures, as we heard afterwards, were come down into the Forest and plain Country, press'd by Hunger to seek
               for Food; and had done a great deal of Mischief in the Villages, where they surpriz'd
               the Country People, kill'd a great many of their Sheep and Horses, and some People
               too.</p>
            <p>We had one dangerous Place to pass, which our Guide told us, if there were any more
               Wolves in the Country, we should find them there; and this was in a small Plain,
               surrounded with Woods on every Side, and a long narrow Defile or Lane, which we were
               to pass to get through the Wood, and then we should come to the Village where we were
               to lodge.</p>
            <p>It was within half an Hour of Sun-set when we entred the first Wood; and a little
               after Sun-set, when we came into the Plain, we met with nothing in the first Wood, except, that in a little Plain within the Wood, which was
               not above two Furlongs over, we saw five great Wolves cross the Road, full Speed one
               after another, as if they had been in Chase of some Prey, and had it in View, <pb
                  n="354" /> they took no Notice of us, and were gone, and
               out of our Sight in a few Moments.</p>
            <p>Upon this our Guide, who by the Way was a wretched faint-hearted Fellow, bid us keep
               in a ready Posture; for he believed there were more Wolves a coming.</p>
            <p>We kept our Arms ready, and our Eyes about us, but we saw no more Wolves, 'till we
               came thro' that Wood, which was near half a League, and entred the Plain; as soon as we came into the Plain, we had Occasion enough to look
               about us: The first Object we met with, was a dead Horse; that is to say, a poor
               Horse which the Wolves had kill'd, and at least a Dozen of them at Work; we could not
               say eating of him, but picking of his Bones rather; for they had eaten up all the
               Flesh before.</p>
            <p>We did not think fit to disturb them at their Feast, neither did they take much
               Notice of us: <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> would have let fly at them, but I would not suffer him
               by any Means; for I found we were like to have more Business upon our Hands than we
               were aware of. We were not gone half over the Plain, but we began to hear the Wolves
               howl in the Wood on our Left, in a frightful Manner, and
               presently after we saw about a hundred coming on directly towards us, all in a Body,
               and most of them in a Line, as regularly as an Army drawn up by experienc'd Officers.
               I scarce knew in what Manner to receive them; but found to draw our selves in a close
               Line was the only Way: so we form'd in a Moment: But that we might not have too much
               Interval, I order'd, that only every other Man should fire,
               and that the others who had not fir'd should stand ready to
               give them a second Volley immediately, if they continued to advance upon us, and that
               then <pb n="355" /> those who had fir'd at first, should not
               pretend to load their <ref target="fusee_" corresp="fusee">Fusees</ref><note
                  resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff" xml:id="fusee" target="fusee_">Light muskets or
                  firelocks. Source: <hi rend="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</hi></note> again, but stand ready with
               every one a Pistol; for we were all arm'd with a Fusee, and a Pair of Pistols each
               Man; so we were by this Method able to fire six Volleys, half of us at a Time;
               however, at present we had no Necessity; for upon firing the
               first Volley, the Enemy made a full Stop, being terrify'd as well with the Noise, as
               with the Fire; four of them being shot into the Head, dropp'd, several others were
                  wounded, and went bleeding off, as we could see by the
               Snow: I found they stopp'd, but did not immediately retreat;
               whereupon remembring that I had been told, that the fiercest Creatures were terrify'd at the Voice of a Man, I caus'd all our Company to hollow as loud as we could; and I found the Notion
               not altogether mistaken; for upon our Shout, they began to retire, and turn about;
               then I order'd a second Volley to be fir'd, in their Rear, which put them to the
               Gallop, and away they went to the Woods.</p>
            <p>This gave us leisure to charge our Pieces again, and that we might loose no Time, we
               kept going; but we had but little more than loaded our Fusees, and put our selves
               into a Readiness, when we heard a terrible Noise in the same Wood, on our Left, only
               that it was farther onward the same Way we were to go.</p>
            <p>The Night was coming on, and the Light began to be dusky,
               which made it worse on our Side; but the Noise encreasing, we could easily perceive
               that it was the Howling and Yelling of those hellish
               Creatures; and on a sudden, we perceiv'd 2 or 3 Troops of Wolves, one on our Left,
               one behind us, and one on our Front; so that we seem'd to be surrounded with 'em;
               however, as they did not fall upon us, we kept our Way forward, as fast as <pb
                  n="356" /> we could make our Horses go, which the Way
                  being very rough, was only a good large Trot; and in this
               Manner we came in View of the Entrance of a Wood, through which we were to pass, at
               the farther Side of the Plain; but we were greatly surpriz'd, when coming nearer the Lane, or Pass, we saw a confus'd Number of Wolves
               standing just at the Entrance.</p>
            <p>On a sudden, at another opening of the Wood, we heard the Noise of a Gun; and looking
               that Way, out rush'd a Horse, with a Saddle, and a Bridle on him, flying like the
               Wind, and sixteen or seventeen Wolves after him, full Speed; indeed, the Horse had
               the Heels of them; but as we suppos'd that he could not hold
               it at that rate, we doubted not but they would get up with him at last, and no
               question but they did.</p>
            <p>But here we had a most horrible Sight; for riding up to the
               Entrance where the Horse came out, we found the Carcass of another Horse, and of two
               Men, devour'd by the ravenous Creatures, and one of the Men was no doubt the same who
               we heard fir'd the Gun; for there lay a Gun just by him, fir'd off; but as to the
               Man, his Head, and the upper Part of his Body was eaten up.</p>
            <p>This fill'd us with Horror, and we knew not what Course to take, but the Creatures
               resolv'd us soon; for they gather'd about us presently, in hopes of Prey; and I
               verily believe there were three hundred of them: It happen'd
               very much to our Advantage, that at the Entrance into the

               stand in a Triangle, or three Fronts, enclosing our Horses
               in the Center.</p>
            <p>We did so, and it was well we did; for never was a more furious Charge than the
               Creatures made upon us in the Place; they came on us with a growling kind of a Noise
               (and mounted the Piece of Timber, which as I said, was our Breast Work) as if they
               were only rushing upon their Prey; and this Fury of theirs, it seems, was principally
                  occasion'd by their seeing our Horses behind us, which
               was the Prey they aim'd at: I order'd our Men to fire as before, every other Man; and
               they took their Aim so sure, that indeed they kill'd several of the Wolves at the
               first Volley; but there was a Necessity to keep a continual Firing; for they came on
               like Devils, those behind pushing on those before.</p>
            <p>When we had fir'd our second Volley of our Fusees, we
               thought they stopp'd a little, and I hop'd they would have gone off; but it was but a
                  Moment; for others came forward again; so we fir'd two
               Volleys of our Pistols, and I believe in these four Firings, we had kill'd seventeen
               or eighteen of them, and lam'd twice as many; yet they came on again.</p>
            <p>I was loath to spend our last Shot too hastily; so I call'd my Servant, not my Man
                  <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> for he was better employ'd; for with the greatest Dexterity
               imaginable, he had charg'd my Fusee, and his own, while we were engag'd; but as I
               said, I call'd my other Man, and giving him a Horn of Powder, I bad him lay a Train,
               all along the Piece of Timber, and let it be a large Train;
               he did so, and had but just Time to get away, when the Wolves came up to it, and some
               were got up upon it; when I snapping an uncharg'd Pistol, close to the Powder, <pb n="358" /> set it on fire;
               those that were upon the Timber were scorcht with it, and
               six or seven of them fell, or rather jump'd in among us, with the Force and Fright of
               the Fire, we dispatch'd these in an Instant, and the rest were so frighted with the
               Light, which the Night, for it was now very near Dark, made more terrible, that they
               drew back a little.</p>
            <p>Upon which I order'd our last Pistol to be fir'd off in one Volley, and after that we
               gave a Shout; upon this, the Wolves turn'd Tail, and we sally'd immediately upon near
               twenty lame Ones, who we found struggling on the Ground, and fell a cutting them with our Swords, which answer'd our Expectation;
               for the Crying and Howling they made, was better understood by their Fellows, so that
               they all fled and left us.</p>

               being thus clear'd, we made forward again; for we had still near a League to go. We
               heard the ravenous Creatures houl and yell in the Woods as
               we went, several Times; and sometimes we fancy'd we saw some
               of them, but the Snow dazling our Eyes, we were not certain; so in about an Hour
               more, we came to the Town, where we were to lodge, which we found in a terrible
               Fright, and all in Arms; for it seems, that the Night before, the Wolves and some
               Bears had broke into the Village in the Night, and put them in a terrible Fright, and
               they were oblig'd to keep Guard Night and Day, but especially in the Night, to
               preserve their Cattle, and indeed their People.</p>
            <p>The next Morning our Guide was so ill, and his Limbs swell'd with the rankling of his
               two Wounds, that he could go no farther; so we were oblig'd to <pb n="359"

               where we found a warm Climate, a fruitful pleasant Country,
               and no Snow, no Wolves, or any Thing like them; but when we told our Story at
                  <hi rend="italic">Tholouse,</hi> they told us it was nothing but what was ordinary in the great
               Forest at the Foot of the Mountains, especially when the
               Snow lay on the Ground: But they enquir'd much what kind of a Guide we had gotten, that would venture to bring us that Way in such a

               we were not all devour'd. When we told them how we plac'd our selves, and the Horses
               in the Middle, they blam'd us exceedingly, and told us it was fifty to one but we had
               been all destroy'd; for it was the Sight of the Horses which made the Wolves so furious, seeing their Prey; and that at other Times they are
               really afraid of a Gun; but the being excessive Hungry, and
               raging on that Account, the Eagerness to come at the Horses had made them sensless of
               Danger; and that if we had not by the continu'd Fire, and at last by the Stratagem of
               the Train of Powder, master'd them, it had been great Odds but that we had been torn
               to Pieces; whereas had we been content to have sat still on
                  Horseback, and fir'd as Horsemen, they would not have
               taken the Horses for so much their own, when Men were on their Backs, as otherwise;
               and withal they told us, that at last, if we had stood altogether, and left our Horses, they would have been so eager to have devour'd them,
               that we might have come off safe, especially having our Fire Arms in our Hands, and
               being so many in Number.</p>
            <p>For my Part, I was never so sensible of Danger in my Life; for seeing above three
               hundred Devils come roaring and open mouth'd to devour us, and having nothing to
               shelter us, or retreat to, I gave my self over for lost; and as it was. I believe, I
                  <pb n="360" /> shall never care to cross those Mountains
               again; I think I would much rather go a thousand Leagues by Sea, though I were sure
               to meet with a Storm once a Week.</p>
            <p>I have nothing uncommon to take Notice of, in my Passage through <hi rend="italic">France</hi>;
               nothing but what other Travellers have given an Account of,
               with much more Advantage than I can. I travell'd from <hi rend="italic">Bourdeaux</hi> to
                  <hi rend="italic">Paris,</hi> and without any considerable Stay, came to <hi rend="italic">Callais,</hi> and
               landed safe at <hi rend="italic">Dover,</hi> the fourteenth of <hi rend="italic">January,</hi> after having had a
               severely cold Season to travel in.</p>
            <p>I was now come to the Center of my Travels, and had in a little Time all my new
               discover'd Estate safe about me, the Bills of Exchange which
               I brought with me having been very currently paid.</p>
            <p>My principal Guide, and Privy Councellor, was my good antient Widow, who in Gratitude
               for the Money I had sent her, thought no Pains too much, or Care too great, to employ
               for me; and I trusted her so entirely with every Thing, that I was perfectly easy as to the Security of my Effects; and indeed, I was very happy from my Beginning, and now to the
               End, in the unspotted Integrity of this good Gentlewoman.</p>
            <p>And now I began to think of leaving my Effects with this Woman, and setting out for
                  <hi rend="italic">Lisbon,</hi> and so to the <hi rend="italic">Brasils</hi>; but now another Scruple came in
               my Way, and that was Religion; for as I had entertain'd some
               Doubts about the <hi rend="italic">Roman</hi> Religion, even while I was abroad, especially in my
               State of Solitude; so I knew there was no going to the <ref target="catholicbrazil_"

               unless on the other hand, I resolv'd to be a Sacrifice to my Principles, be a Martyr
               for Religion, and die in the Inquisition; so <pb n="361" />
               I resolv'd to stay at Home, and if I could find. Means for it, to dispose of my
               Plantation.</p>
            <p>To this Purpose I wrote to my old Friend at <hi rend="italic">Lisbon,</hi> who in Return gave me
               Notice, that he could easily dispose of it there: But that if I thought fit to give
               him Leave to offer it in my Name to the two Merchants, the Survivors of my Trustees,
               who liv'd in the <hi rend="italic">Brasils,</hi> who must fully understand the Value of it, who
               liv'd just upon the Spot, and who I knew were very rich; so that he believ'd they
               would be fond of buying it; he did not doubt, but I should make 4 or 5000 Pieces of
               Eight, the more of it.</p>
            <p>Accordingly I agreed, gave him Order to offer it to them, and he did so; and in about
               8 Months more, the Ship being then return'd, he sent me Account, that they had
               accepted the Offer, and had remitted 33000 Pieces of Eight, to a Correspondent of theirs at <hi rend="italic">Lisbon,</hi> to pay for it.</p>
            <p>In Return, I sign'd the Instrument of Sale in the Form which they sent from
                  <hi rend="italic">Lisbon,</hi> and sent it to my old Man, who sent me Bills of Exchange for
               328000 Pieces of Eight to me, for the Estate; reserving the
               Payment of 100 Moidores a Year to him, the old Man, during his Life, and 50 Moidores afterwards to his Son for his Life, which I had
               promised them, which the Plantation was to make good as a Rent-Charge. And thus I
               have given the first Part of a Life of Fortune and Adventure, a Life of Providences Checquer-Work, and of a Variety which the World will
               seldom be able to show the like of: Beginning foolishly, but closing much more
               happily than any Part of it ever gave me Leave so much as to hope for.</p>
            <p>Any one would think, that in this State of complicated good
               Fortune, I was past running any more Hazards; and so indeed I had been, if other <pb
                  n="362" /> Circumstances had concurr'd, but I was inur'd
               to a wandring Life, had no Family, not many Relations, nor
               however rich had I contracted much Acquaintance; and though
               I had sold my Estate in the <hi rend="italic">Brasils,</hi> yet I could not keep the Country out of
               my Head, and had a great Mind to be upon the Wing again, especially I could not
               resist the strong Inclination I had to see my Island, and to know if the poor
                  <hi rend="italic">Spaniards</hi> were in Being there, and how the Rogues I left there had used
               them.</p>
            <p>My true Friend, the Widow, earnestly diswaded me from it,
               and so far prevail'd with me, that for almost seven Years she prevented my running
               Abroad; during which time, I took my two Nephews, the Children of one of my Sisters
                  into my Care: The eldest having something of his own, I
               bred up as a Gentleman, and gave him a Settlement of some Addition to his Estate,
               after my Decease; the other I put out to a Captain of a
               Ship; and after five Years, finding him a sensible bold enterprising young Fellow, I
               put him into a good Ship, and sent him to Sea: And this young Fellow afterwards drew
               me in, as old as I was, to farther Adventures my self.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, I in Part settled my self here; for first of all I marry'd, and
               that not either to my Disadvantage or Dissatisfaction, and had three Children, two
               Sons and one Daughter: But my Wife dying, and my Nephew coming Home with good Success
               from a Voyage to <hi rend="italic">Spain,</hi> my Inclination to go
               Abroad, and his Importunity prevailed and engag'd me to go in his Ship, as a private
               Trader to the <hi rend="italic">East Indies:</hi> This was in the Year 1694.</p>
            <p>In this Voyage I visited my new Collony in the Island, saw my Successors the
                  <hi rend="italic">Spaniards,</hi> had the whole Story of their Lives, and of the Villains I left
               there; how at first they insulted the poor <hi rend="italic">Spaniards,</hi>
               <pb n="363" /> how they afterwards agreed, disagreed, united, separated, and how at last the <hi rend="italic">Spaniards</hi>
               were oblig'd to use Violence with them, how they were subjected to the
                  <hi rend="italic">Spaniards,</hi> how honestly the <hi rend="italic">Spaniards</hi> used them; a History, if
               it were entred into, as full of Variety and wonderful Accidents, as my own Part,
               particularly also as to their Battles with the <hi rend="italic">Carribeans,</hi> who landed
               several times upon the Island, and as to the Improvement they made upon the Island it
               self, and how five of them made an Attempt upon the main Land, and brought away
               eleven Men and five Women Prisoners, by which, at my coming, I found about twenty
               young Children on the Island.</p>
            <p>Here I stay'd about 20 Days, left them Supplies of all
               necessary things, and particularly of Arms, Powder, Shot, Cloaths, Tools, and two
               Workmen, which I brought from <hi rend="italic">England</hi> with me, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> a Carpenter and
               a Smith.</p>
            <p>Besides this, I shar'd the Island into Parts with 'em, reserv'd to my self the
               Property of the whole, but gave them such Parts respectively as they agreed on; and having settled all things with them, and
               engaged them not to leave the Place, I left them there.</p>
            <p>From thence I touch'd at the <hi rend="italic">Brasils,</hi> from whence I sent a Bark, which I
               bought there, with more People to the Island, and in it, besides other Supplies, I sent seven Women, being such as I found proper for
               Service, or for Wives to such as would take them: As to the <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Men, I
               promis'd them to send them some Women from <hi rend="italic">England,</hi> with a good Cargoe of
               Necessaries, if they would apply themselves to Planting, which I afterwards perform'd. And the Fellows prov'd very honest and diligent
               after they were master'd, and had their Properties set apart for them. I sent them
                  <pb n="364" /> also from the <hi rend="italic">Brasils</hi> five Cows,
               three of them being big with Calf, some Sheep, and some
               Hogs, which, when I came again, were considerably encreas'd.</p>
            <p>But all these things, with an Account how 300 <hi rend="italic">Caribbees</hi> came and invaded
               them, and ruin'd their Plantations, and how they fought with that whole Number twice,
               and were at first defeated, and three of them kill'd; but at last a Storm destroying
               their Enemies Cannoes, they famish'd or destroy'd almost all the rest, and renew'd
               and recover'd the Possession of their Plantation, and still liv'd upon the
               Island.</p>
            <p>All these things, with some very surprizing Incidents in
               some new Adventures of my own, for ten Years more, I may perhaps give a farther Account of hereafter.</p>
