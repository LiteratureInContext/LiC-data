            <p><pb n="7" facs="pageImages/7.jpg"/>So of course," wrote Betty Flanders, pressing her heels rather deeper in the sand,
               "there was nothing for it but to leave."</p>
            <p>Slowly welling from the point of her gold nib, pale blue ink dissolved the full stop;
               for there her pen stuck; her eyes fixed, and tears slowly filled them. The entire bay
               quivered; the lighthouse wobbled; and she had the illusion that the mast of Mr.
               Connor's little yacht was bending like a wax candle in the sun. She winked quickly.
               Accidents were awful things. She winked again. The mast was straight; the waves were
               regular; the lighthouse was upright; but the blot had spread. "… nothing for it but
               to leave," she read.</p>
            <p>"Well, if Jacob doesn't want to play" (the shadow of Archer, her eldest son, fell
               across the notepaper and looked blue on the sand, and she felt chilly—it was the
               third of September already), "if Jacob doesn't want to play"—what a horrid blot! It
               must be getting late.</p>
            <p><pb n="8" facs="pageImages/8.jpg"/>"Where is that tiresome little boy?" she said. "I don't see him. Run and find him.
               Tell him to come at once." "… but mercifully," she scribbled, ignoring the full stop,
               "everything seems satisfactorily arranged, packed though we are like herrings in a
               barrel, and forced to stand the perambulator which the landlady quite naturally won't
               allow…."</p>
            <p>Such were Betty Flanders's letters to Captain Barfoot—many-paged, tear-stained.
               <placeName type="tgn" key="7010063">Scarborough</placeName> is seven hundred miles from <placeName type="tgn" key="7008116">Cornwall</placeName>: Captain Barfoot is in <placeName type="tgn" key="7010063">Scarborough</placeName>:
               Seabrook is dead. Tears made all the dahlias in her garden undulate in red waves and
               flashed the glass house in her eyes, and spangled the kitchen with bright knives, and
               made Mrs. Jarvis, the rector's wife, think at church, while the hymn-tune played and
               Mrs. Flanders bent low over her little boys' heads, that marriage is a fortress and
               widows stray solitary in the open fields, picking up stones, gleaning a few golden
               straws, lonely, unprotected, poor creatures. Mrs. Flanders had been a widow for these
               two years.</p>
            <p>"Ja—cob! Ja—cob!" Archer shouted.</p>
            <p>"<placeName type="tgn" key="7010063">Scarborough</placeName>," Mrs. Flanders wrote on the 
               <pb n="9" facs="pageImages/9.jpg"/>envelope, and dashed a bold line beneath;
               it was her native town; the hub of the universe. But a stamp? She ferreted in her
               bag; then held it up mouth downwards; then fumbled in her lap, all so vigorously that
               Charles Steele in the Panama hat suspended his paint-brush.</p>
            <p>Like the antennae of some irritable insect it positively trembled. Here was that
               woman moving—actually going to get up—confound her! He struck the canvas a hasty
               violet-black dab. For the landscape needed it. It was too pale—greys flowing into
               lavenders, and one star or a white gull suspended just so—too pale as usual. The
               critics would say it was too pale, for he was an unknown man exhibiting obscurely, a
               favourite with his landladies' children, wearing a cross on his watch chain, and much
               gratified if his landladies liked his pictures—which they often did.</p>
            <p>"Ja—cob! Ja—cob!" Archer shouted.</p>
            <p>Exasperated by the noise, yet loving children, Steele picked nervously at the dark
               little coils on his palette.</p>
            <p>"I saw your brother—I saw your brother," 
               <pb n="10" facs="pageImages/10.png"/>he said, nodding his head, as Archer lagged
               past him, trailing his spade, and scowling at the old gentleman in spectacles.</p>
            <p>"Over there—by the rock," Steele muttered, with his brush between his teeth,
               squeezing out raw sienna, and keeping his eyes fixed on Betty Flanders's back.</p>
            <p>"Ja—cob! Ja—cob!" shouted Archer, lagging on after a second.</p>
            <p>The voice had an extraordinary sadness. Pure from all body, pure from all passion,
               going out into the world, solitary, unanswered, breaking against rocks—so it
               sounded.</p>
            <p>Steele frowned; but was pleased by the effect of the black—it was just THAT note
               which brought the rest together. "Ah, one may learn to paint at fifty! There's
               Titian…" and so, having found the right tint, up he looked and saw to his horror a
               cloud over the bay.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Flanders rose, slapped her coat this side and that to get the sand off, and
               picked up her black parasol.</p>
            <p>The rock was one of those tremendously solid brown, or rather black, rocks which
               emerge from the sand like something primitive. Rough with 
               <pb n="11" facs="pageImages/11.png"/>crinkled limpet shells and
               sparsely strewn with locks of dry seaweed, a small boy has to stretch his legs far
               apart, and indeed to feel rather heroic, before he gets to the top.</p>
            <p>But there, on the very top, is a hollow full of water, with a sandy bottom; with a
               blob of jelly stuck to the side, and some mussels. A fish darts across. The fringe of
               yellow-brown seaweed flutters, and out pushes an opal-shelled crab—</p>
            <p>"Oh, a huge crab," Jacob murmured—and begins his journey on weakly legs on the sandy
               bottom. Now! Jacob plunged his hand. The crab was cool and very light. But the water
               was thick with sand, and so, scrambling down, Jacob was about to jump, holding his
               bucket in front of him, when he saw, stretched entirely rigid, side by side, their
               faces very red, an enormous man and woman.</p>
            <p>An enormous man and woman (it was early-closing day) were stretched motionless, with
               their heads on pocket-handkerchiefs, side by side, within a few feet of the sea,
               while two or three gulls gracefully skirted the incoming waves, and settled near
               their boots.</p>
            <p>The large red faces lying on the bandanna handkerchiefs stared up at Jacob. Jacob
               stared down at them. Holding his bucket very carefully, Jacob then jumped
               deliberately and trotted away 
               <pb n="12" facs="pageImages/12.png"/>very nonchalantly at first, but faster and faster as
               the waves came creaming up to him and he had to swerve to avoid them, and the gulls
               rose in front of him and floated out and settled again a little farther on. A large
               black woman was sitting on the sand. He ran towards her.</p>
            <p>"Nanny! Nanny!" he cried, sobbing the words out on the crest of each gasping
               breath.</p>
            <p>The waves came round her. She was a rock. She was covered with the seaweed which pops
               when it is pressed. He was lost.</p>
            <p>There he stood. His face composed itself. He was about to roar when, lying among the
               black sticks and straw under the cliff, he saw a whole skull—perhaps a cow's skull, a
               skull, perhaps, with the teeth in it. Sobbing, but absent-mindedly, he ran farther
               and farther away until he held the skull in his arms.</p>
            <p>"There he is!" cried Mrs. Flanders, coming round the rock and covering the whole
               space of the beach in a few seconds. "What has he got hold of? Put it down, Jacob!
               Drop it this moment! Something horrid, I know. Why didn't you stay with us? Naughty
               little boy! Now put it down. Now come along both of you," and she swept round,
               holding Archer by one hand 
               <pb n="13" facs="pageImages/13.png"/>and fumbling for Jacob's arm with the other. But he ducked
               down and picked up the sheep's jaw, which was loose.</p>
            <p>Swinging her bag, clutching her parasol, holding Archer's hand, and telling the story
               of the gunpowder explosion in which poor Mr. Curnow had lost his eye, Mrs. Flanders
               hurried up the steep lane, aware all the time in the depths of her mind of some
               buried discomfort.</p>
            <p>There on the sand not far from the lovers lay the old sheep's skull without its jaw.
               Clean, white, wind-swept, sand-rubbed, a more unpolluted piece of bone existed
               nowhere on the coast of <placeName type="tgn" key="7008116">Cornwall</placeName>. The sea holly would grow through the eye-sockets;
               it would turn to powder, or some golfer, hitting his ball one fine day, would
               disperse a little dust—No, but not in lodgings, thought Mrs. Flanders. It's a great
               experiment coming so far with young children. There's no man to help with the
               perambulator. And Jacob is such a handful; so obstinate already.</p>
            <p>"Throw it away, dear, do," she said, as they got into the road; but Jacob squirmed
               away from her; and the wind rising, she took out her bonnet-pin, looked at the sea,
               and stuck it in afresh. The wind was rising. The waves showed that uneasiness, like
               something alive, 
               <pb n="14" facs="pageImages/14.png"/>restive, expecting the whip, of waves before a storm. The
               fishing-boats were leaning to the water's brim. A pale yellow light shot across the
               purple sea; and shut. The lighthouse was lit. "Come along," said Betty Flanders. The
               sun blazed in their faces and gilded the great blackberries trembling out from the
               hedge which Archer tried to strip as they passed.</p>
            <p>"Don't lag, boys. You've got nothing to change into," said Betty, pulling them along,
               and looking with uneasy emotion at the earth displayed so luridly, with sudden sparks
               of light from greenhouses in gardens, with a sort of yellow and black mutability,
               against this blazing sunset, this astonishing agitation and vitality of colour, which
               stirred Betty Flanders and made her think of responsibility and danger. She gripped
               Archer's hand. On she plodded up the hill.</p>
            <p>"What did I ask you to remember?" she said.</p>
            <p>"I don't know," said Archer.</p>
            <p>"Well, I don't know either," said Betty, humorously and simply, and who shall deny
               that this blankness of mind, when combined with profusion, mother wit, old wives'
               tales, haphazard ways, moments of astonishing daring, humour, and sentimentality—who
               shall deny <pb n="15" facs="pageImages/15.png"/>that in these respects every woman is nicer than any man?</p>
            <p>Well, Betty Flanders, to begin with.</p>
            <p>She had her hand upon the garden gate.</p>
            <p>"The meat!" she exclaimed, striking the latch down.</p>
            <p>She had forgotten the meat.</p>
            <p>There was Rebecca at the window.</p>
            <p>The bareness of Mrs. Pearce's front room was fully displayed at ten o'clock at night
               when a powerful oil lamp stood on the middle of the table. The harsh light fell on
               the garden; cut straight across the lawn; lit up a child's bucket and a purple aster
               and reached the hedge. Mrs. Flanders had left her sewing on the table. There were her
               large reels of white cotton and her steel spectacles; her needle-case; her brown wool
               wound round an old postcard. There were the bulrushes and the Strand magazines; and
               the linoleum sandy from the boys' boots. A daddy-long-legs shot from corner to corner
               and hit the lamp globe. The wind blew straight dashes of rain across the window,
               which flashed silver as they passed through the light. A single leaf <pb n="16" facs="pageImages/16.png"/>tapped
               hurriedly, persistently, upon the glass. There was a hurricane out at sea.</p>
            <p>Archer could not sleep.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Flanders stooped over him. "Think of the fairies," said Betty Flanders. "Think
               of the lovely, lovely birds settling down on their nests. Now shut your eyes and see
               the old mother bird with a worm in her beak. Now turn and shut your eyes," she
               murmured, "and shut your eyes."</p>
            <p>The lodging-house seemed full of gurgling and rushing; the cistern overflowing; water
               bubbling and squeaking and running along the pipes and streaming down the
               windows.</p>
            <p>"What's all that water rushing in?" murmured Archer.</p>
            <p>"It's only the bath water running away," said Mrs. Flanders.</p>
            <p>Something snapped out of doors.</p>
            <p>"I say, won't that steamer sink?" said Archer, opening his eyes.</p>
            <p>"Of course it won't," said Mrs. Flanders. "The Captain's in bed long ago. Shut your
               eyes, and think of the fairies, fast asleep, under the flowers."</p>
            <p><pb n="17" facs="pageImages/17.png"/>"I thought he'd never get off—such a hurricane," she whispered to Rebecca, who was
               bending over a spirit-lamp in the small room next door. The wind rushed outside, but
               the small flame of the spirit-lamp burnt quietly, shaded from the cot by a book stood
               on edge. "Did he take his bottle well?" Mrs. Flanders whispered, and Rebecca nodded
               and went to the cot and turned down the quilt, and Mrs. Flanders bent over and looked
               anxiously at the baby, asleep, but frowning. The window shook, and Rebecca stole like
               a cat and wedged it.</p>
            <p>The two women murmured over the spirit-lamp, plotting the eternal conspiracy of hush
               and clean bottles while the wind raged and gave a sudden wrench at the cheap
               fastenings.</p>
            <p>Both looked round at the cot. Their lips were pursed. Mrs. Flanders crossed over to
               the cot.</p>
            <p>"Asleep?" whispered Rebecca, looking at the cot.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Flanders nodded.</p>
            <p>"Good-night, Rebecca," Mrs. Flanders murmured, and Rebecca called her ma'm, though
               they were conspirators plotting the eternal conspiracy of hush and clean bottles.</p>
            <p><pb n="18" facs="pageImages/18.png"/>Mrs. Flanders had left the lamp burning in the front room. There were her spectacles,
               her sewing; and a letter with the <placeName type="tgn" key="7010063">Scarborough</placeName> postmark. She had not drawn the
               curtains either.</p>
            <p>The light blazed out across the patch of grass; fell on the child's green bucket with
               the gold line round it, and upon the aster which trembled violently beside it. For
               the wind was tearing across the coast, hurling itself at the hills, and leaping, in
               sudden gusts, on top of its own back. How it spread over the town in the hollow! How
               the lights seemed to wink and quiver in its fury, lights in the harbour, lights in
               bedroom windows high up! And rolling dark waves before it, it raced over the
               <placeName type="tgn" key="7014206">Atlantic</placeName>, jerking the stars above the ships this way and that.</p>
            <p>There was a click in the front sitting-room. Mr. Pearce had extinguished the lamp.
               The garden went out. It was but a dark patch. Every inch was rained upon. Every blade
               of grass was bent by rain. Eyelids would have been fastened down by the rain. Lying
               on one's back one would have seen nothing but muddle and confusion—clouds turning and
               turning, and something yellow-tinted and sulphurous in the darkness.</p>
            <p>The little boys in the front bedroom had <pb n="19" facs="pageImages/19.png"/>thrown off their blankets and lay under the
               sheets. It was hot; rather sticky and steamy. Archer lay spread out, with one arm
               striking across the pillow. He was flushed; and when the heavy curtain blew out a
               little he turned and half-opened his eyes. The wind actually stirred the cloth on the
               chest of drawers, and let in a little light, so that the sharp edge of the chest of
               drawers was visible, running straight up, until a white shape bulged out; and a
               silver streak showed in the looking-glass.</p>
            <p>In the other bed by the door Jacob lay asleep, fast asleep, profoundly unconscious.
               The sheep's jaw with the big yellow teeth in it lay at his feet. He had kicked it
               against the iron bed-rail.</p>
            <p>Outside the rain poured down more directly and powerfully as the wind fell in the
               early hours of the morning. The aster was beaten to the earth. The child's bucket was
               half-full of rainwater; and the opal-shelled crab slowly circled round the bottom,
               trying with its weakly legs to climb the steep side; trying again and falling back,
               and trying again and again.</p>

            <head type="sub">II</head>
            <p><pb n="20" facs="pageImages/20.png"/>"MRS. FLANDERS"—"Poor Betty Flanders"—"Dear Betty"—"She's very attractive still"—"Odd
               she don't marry again!" "There's Captain Barfoot to be sure—calls every Wednesday as
               regular as clockwork, and never brings his wife."</p>
            <p>"But that's Ellen Barfoot's fault," the ladies of <placeName type="tgn" key="7010063">Scarborough</placeName> said. "She don't put
               herself out for no one."</p>
            <p>"A man likes to have a son—that we know."</p>
            <p>"Some tumours have to be cut; but the sort my mother had you bear with for years and
               years, and never even have a cup of tea brought up to you in bed."</p>
            <p>(Mrs. Barfoot was an invalid.)</p>
            <p>Elizabeth Flanders, of whom this and much more than this had been said and would be
               said, was, of course, a widow in her prime. She was half-way between forty and fifty.
               Years and <pb n="21" facs="pageImages/21.png"/>sorrow between them; the death of Seabrook, her husband; three boys;
               poverty; a house on the outskirts of <placeName type="tgn" key="7010063">Scarborough</placeName>; her brother, poor Morty's, downfall
               and possible demise—for where was he? what was he? Shading her eyes, she looked along
               the road for Captain Barfoot—yes, there he was, punctual as ever; the attentions of
               the Captain—all ripened Betty Flanders, enlarged her figure, tinged her face with
               jollity, and flooded her eyes for no reason that any one could see perhaps three
               times a day.</p>
            <p>True, there's no harm in crying for one's husband, and the tombstone, though plain,
               was a solid piece of work, and on summer's days when the widow brought her boys to
               stand there one felt kindly towards her. Hats were raised higher than usual; wives
               tugged their husbands' arms. Seabrook lay six foot beneath, dead these many years;
               enclosed in three shells; the crevices sealed with lead, so that, had earth and wood
               been glass, doubtless his very face lay visible beneath, the face of a young man
               whiskered, shapely, who had gone out duck-shooting and refused to change his
               boots.</p>
            <p>"Merchant of this city," the tombstone said; though why Betty Flanders had chosen so
               to call him when, as many still remembered, he had only sat behind an office window
               for three months, <pb n="22" facs="pageImages/22.png"/>and before that had broken horses, ridden to hounds, farmed a few
               fields, and run a little wild—well, she had to call him something. An example for the
               boys.</p>
            <p>Had he, then, been nothing? An unanswerable question, since even if it weren't the
               habit of the undertaker to close the eyes, the light so soon goes out of them. At
               first, part of herself; now one of a company, he had merged in the grass, the sloping
               hillside, the thousand white stones, some slanting, others upright, the decayed
               wreaths, the crosses of green tin, the narrow yellow paths, and the lilacs that
               drooped in April, with a scent like that of an invalid's bedroom, over the churchyard
               wall. Seabrook was now all that; and when, with her skirt hitched up, feeding the
               chickens, she heard the bell for service or funeral, that was Seabrook's voice—the
               voice of the dead.</p>
            <p>The rooster had been known to fly on her shoulder and peck her neck, so that now she
               carried a stick or took one of the children with her when she went to feed the
               fowls.</p>
            <p>"Wouldn't you like my knife, mother?" said Archer.</p>
            <p>Sounding at the same moment as the bell, her son's voice mixed life and death
               inextricably, exhilaratingly.</p>
            <p><pb n="23" facs="pageImages/23.png"/>"What a big knife for a small boy!" she said. She took it to please him. Then the
               rooster flew out of the hen-house, and, shouting to Archer to shut the door into the
               kitchen garden, Mrs. Flanders set her meal down, clucked for the hens, went bustling
               about the orchard, and was seen from over the way by Mrs. Cranch, who, beating her
               mat against the wall, held it for a moment suspended while she observed to Mrs. Page
               next door that Mrs. Flanders was in the orchard with the chickens.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Page, Mrs. Cranch, and Mrs. Garfit could see Mrs. Flanders in the orchard
               because the orchard was a piece of Dods Hill enclosed; and Dods Hill dominated the
               village. No words can exaggerate the importance of Dods Hill. It was the earth; the
               world against the sky; the horizon of how many glances can best be computed by those
               who have lived all their lives in the same village, only leaving it once to fight in
               the Crimea, like old George Garfit, leaning over his garden gate smoking his pipe.
               The progress of the sun was measured by it; the tint of the day laid against it to be
               judged.</p>
            <p>"Now she's going up the hill with little John," said Mrs. Cranch to Mrs. Garfit,
               shaking her mat for the last time, and bustling indoors. Opening the orchard gate,
               Mrs. Flanders <pb n="24" facs="pageImages/24.png"/>walked to the top of Dods Hill, holding John by the hand. Archer and
               Jacob ran in front or lagged behind; but they were in the Roman fortress when she
               came there, and shouting out what ships were to be seen in the bay. For there was a
               magnificent view —moors behind, sea in front, and the whole of <placeName type="tgn" key="7010063">Scarborough</placeName> from one
               end to the other laid out flat like a puzzle. Mrs. Flanders, who was growing stout,
               sat down in the fortress and looked about her.</p>
            <p>The entire gamut of the view's changes should have been known to her; its winter
               aspect, spring, summer and autumn; how storms came up from the sea; how the moors
               shuddered and brightened as the clouds went over; she should have noted the red spot
               where the villas were building; and the criss-cross of lines where the allotments
               were cut; and the diamond flash of little glass houses in the sun. Or, if details
               like these escaped her, she might have let her fancy play upon the gold tint of the
               sea at sunset, and thought how it lapped in coins of gold upon the shingle. Little
               pleasure boats shoved out into it; the black arm of the pier hoarded it up. The whole
               city was pink and gold; domed; mist-wreathed; resonant; strident. Banjoes strummed;
               the parade smelt of tar which stuck to the heels; goats suddenly cantered their
               carriages through crowds. It was <pb n="25" facs="pageImages/25.png"/>observed how well the Corporation had laid out the
               flower-beds. Sometimes a straw hat was blown away. Tulips burnt in the sun. Numbers
               of sponge-bag trousers were stretched in rows. Purple bonnets fringed soft, pink,
               querulous faces on pillows in bath chairs. Triangular hoardings were wheeled along by
               men in white coats. Captain George Boase had caught a monster shark. One side of the
               triangular hoarding said so in red, blue, and yellow letters; and each line ended
               with three differently coloured notes of exclamation.</p>
            <p>So that was a reason for going down into the Aquarium, where the sallow blinds, the
               stale smell of spirits of salt, the bamboo chairs, the tables with ash-trays, the
               revolving fish, the attendant knitting behind six or seven chocolate boxes (often she
               was quite alone with the fish for hours at a time) remained in the mind as part of
               the monster shark, he himself being only a flabby yellow receptacle, like an empty
               Gladstone bag in a tank. No one had ever been cheered by the Aquarium; but the faces
               of those emerging quickly lost their dim, chilled expression when they perceived that
               it was only by standing in a queue that one could be admitted to the pier. Once
               through the turnstiles, every one walked for a yard or two very briskly; some flagged
               at this <pb n="26" facs="pageImages/26.png"/>stall; others at that.</p>
            <p>But it was the band that drew them all to it finally; even the fishermen on the lower
               pier taking up their pitch within its range.</p>
            <p>The band played in the Moorish kiosk. Number nine went up on the board. It was a
               waltz tune. The pale girls, the old widow lady, the three Jews lodging in the same
               boarding-house, the dandy, the major, the horse-dealer, and the gentleman of
               independent means, all wore the same blurred, drugged expression, and through the
               chinks in the planks at their feet they could see the green summer waves, peacefully,
               amiably, swaying round the iron pillars of the pier.</p>
            <p>But there was a time when none of this had any existence (thought the young man
               leaning against the railings). Fix your eyes upon the lady's skirt; the grey one will
               do—above the pink silk stockings. It changes; drapes her ankles—the nineties; then it
               amplifies—the seventies; now it's burnished red and stretched above a crinoline—the
               sixties; a tiny black foot wearing a white cotton stocking peeps out. Still sitting
               there? Yes—she's still on the pier. The silk now is sprigged with roses, but somehow
               one no longer sees so clearly. There's no pier beneath us. The heavy chariot may
               swing along <pb n="27" facs="pageImages/27.png"/>the turnpike road, but there's no pier for it to stop at, and how grey
               and turbulent the sea is in the seventeenth century! Let's to the museum.
               Cannon-balls; arrow-heads; Roman glass and a forceps green with verdigris. The Rev.
               Jaspar Floyd dug them up at his own expense early in the forties in the Roman camp on
               Dods Hill—see the little ticket with the faded writing on it.</p>
            <p>And now, what's the next thing to see in <placeName type="tgn" key="7010063">Scarborough</placeName>?</p>
            <p>Mrs. Flanders sat on the raised circle of the Roman camp, patching Jacob's breeches;
               only looking up as she sucked the end of her cotton, or when some insect dashed at
               her, boomed in her ear, and was gone.</p>
            <p>John kept trotting up and slapping down in her lap grass or dead leaves which he
               called "tea," and she arranged them methodically but absent-mindedly, laying the
               flowery heads of the grasses together, thinking how Archer had been awake again last
               night; the church clock was ten or thirteen minutes fast; she wished she could buy
               Garfit's acre.</p>
            <p><pb n="28" facs="pageImages/28.png"/>"That's an orchid leaf, Johnny. Look at the little brown spots. Come, my dear. We
               must go home. Ar-cher! Ja-cob!"</p>
            <p>"Ar-cher! Ja-cob!" Johnny piped after her, pivoting round on his heel, and strewing
               the grass and leaves in his hands as if he were sowing seed. Archer and Jacob jumped
               up from behind the mound where they had been crouching with the intention of
               springing upon their mother unexpectedly, and they all began to walk slowly home.</p>
            <p>"Who is that?" said Mrs. Flanders, shading her eyes.</p>
            <p>"That old man in the road?" said Archer, looking below.</p>
            <p>"He's not an old man," said Mrs. Flanders. "He's—no, he's not—I thought it was the
               Captain, but it's Mr. Floyd. Come along, boys."</p>
            <p>"Oh, bother Mr. Floyd!" said Jacob, switching off a thistle's head, for he knew
               already that Mr. Floyd was going to teach them Latin, as indeed he did for three
               years in his spare time, out of kindness, for there was no other gentleman in the
               neighbourhood whom Mrs. Flanders could have asked to do such a thing, and the elder
               boys were getting beyond her, and must be got ready for school, and it was more than
               most <pb n="29" facs="pageImages/29.png"/>clergymen would have done, coming round after tea, or having them in his own
               room —as he could fit it in—for the parish was a very large one, and Mr. Floyd, like
               his father before him, visited cottages miles away on the moors, and, like old Mr.
               Floyd, was a great scholar, which made it so unlikely—she had never dreamt of such a
               thing. Ought she to have guessed? But let alone being a scholar he was eight years
               younger than she was. She knew his mother—old Mrs. Floyd. She had tea there. And it
               was that very evening when she came back from having tea with old Mrs. Floyd that she
               found the note in the hall and took it into the kitchen with her when she went to
               give Rebecca the fish, thinking it must be something about the boys.</p>
            <p>"Mr. Floyd brought it himself, did he?—I think the cheese must be in the parcel in
               the hall—oh, in the hall—" for she was reading. No, it was not about the boys.</p>
            <p>"Yes, enough for fish-cakes to-morrow certainly—Perhaps Captain Barfoot—" she had
               come to the word "love." She went into the garden and read, leaning against the
               walnut tree to steady herself. Up and down went her breast. Seabrook came so vividly
               before her. She shook her head and was looking through her tears at <pb n="30" facs="pageImages/30.png"/>the little
               shifting leaves against the yellow sky when three geese, half-running, half-flying,
               scuttled across the lawn with Johnny behind them, brandishing a stick.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Flanders flushed with anger.</p>
            <p>"How many times have I told you?" she cried, and seized him and snatched his stick
               away from him.</p>
            <p>"But they'd escaped!" he cried, struggling to get free.</p>
            <p>"You're a very naughty boy. If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times. I
               won't have you chasing the geese!" she said, and crumpling Mr. Floyd's letter in her
               hand, she held Johnny fast and herded the geese back into the orchard.</p>
            <p>"How could I think of marriage!" she said to herself bitterly, as she fastened the
               gate with a piece of wire. She had always disliked red hair in men, she thought,
               thinking of Mr. Floyd's appearance, that night when the boys had gone to bed. And
               pushing her work-box away, she drew the blotting-paper towards her, and read Mr.
               Floyd's letter again, and her breast went up and down when she came to the word
               "love," but not so fast this time, for she saw Johnny chasing the geese, and knew
               that it was impossible for her to marry any one—let alone Mr. Floyd, who <pb n="31" facs="pageImages/31.png"/>was so much
               younger than she was, but what a nice man—and such a scholar too.</p>
            <p>"Dear Mr. Floyd," she wrote.—"Did I forget about the cheese?" she wondered, laying
               down her pen. No, she had told Rebecca that the cheese was in the hall. "I am much
               surprised…" she wrote.</p>
            <p>But the letter which Mr. Floyd found on the table when he got up early next morning
               did not begin "I am much surprised," and it was such a motherly, respectful,
               inconsequent, regretful letter that he kept it for many years; long after his
               marriage with Miss Wimbush, of Andover; long after he had left the village. For he
               asked for a parish in <placeName type="tgn" key="7019047">Sheffield</placeName>, which was given him; and, sending for Archer, Jacob,
               and John to say good-bye, he told them to choose whatever they liked in his study to
               remember him by. Archer chose a paper-knife, because he did not like to choose
               anything too good; Jacob chose the works of Byron in one volume; John, who was still
               too young to make a proper choice, chose Mr. Floyd's kitten, which his brothers
               thought an absurd choice, but Mr. Floyd upheld him when he said: "It has fur like
               you." Then Mr. Floyd spoke about the King's Navy (to which Archer was going); and
               about Rugby (to which Jacob was going); and next day he <pb n="32" facs="pageImages/32.png"/>received a silver salver and
               went—first to <placeName type="tgn" key="7019047">Sheffield</placeName>, where he met Miss Wimbush, who was on a visit to her uncle,
               then to <placeName type="tgn" key="7018916">Hackney</placeName>—then to Maresfield House, of which he became the principal, and
               finally, becoming editor of a well-known series of Ecclesiastical Biographies, he
               retired to Hampstead with his wife and daughter, and is often to be seen feeding the
               ducks on Leg of Mutton Pond. As for Mrs. Flanders's letter—when he looked for it the
               other day he could not find it, and did not like to ask his wife whether she had put
               it away. Meeting Jacob in Piccadilly lately, he recognized him after three seconds.
               But Jacob had grown such a fine young man that Mr. Floyd did not like to stop him in
               the street.</p>
            <p>"Dear me," said Mrs. Flanders, when she read in the <placeName type="tgn" key="7010063">Scarborough</placeName> and Harrogate Courier
               that the Rev. Andrew Floyd, etc., etc., had been made Principal of Maresfield House,
               "that must be our Mr. Floyd." A slight gloom fell upon the table. Jacob was helping
               himself to jam; the postman was talking to Rebecca in the kitchen; there was a bee
               humming at the yellow flower which nodded <pb n="33" facs="pageImages/33.png"/>at the open window. They were all alive,
               that is to say, while poor Mr. Floyd was becoming Principal of Maresfield House.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Flanders got up and went over to the fender and stroked Topaz on the neck behind
               the ears.</p>
            <p>"Poor Topaz," she said (for Mr. Floyd's kitten was now a very old cat, a little mangy
               behind the ears, and one of these days would have to be killed).</p>
            <p>"Poor old Topaz," said Mrs. Flanders, as he stretched himself out in the sun, and she
               smiled, thinking how she had had him gelded, and how she did not like red hair in
               men. Smiling, she went into the kitchen.</p>
            <p>Jacob drew rather a dirty pocket-handkerchief across his face. He went upstairs to
               his room.</p>
            <p>The stag-beetle dies slowly (it was John who collected the beetles). Even on the
               second day its legs were supple. But the butterflies were dead. A whiff of rotten
               eggs had vanquished the pale clouded yellows which came pelting across the orchard
               and up Dods Hill and away on to the moor, now lost behind a furze bush, then off
               again helter-skelter in a broiling sun. <pb n="34" facs="pageImages/34.png"/>A fritillary basked on a white stone in the
               Roman camp. From the valley came the sound of church bells. They were all eating
               roast beef in <placeName type="tgn" key="7010063">Scarborough</placeName>; for it was Sunday when Jacob caught the pale clouded
               yellows in the clover field, eight miles from home.</p>
            <p>Rebecca had caught the death's-head moth in the kitchen.</p>
            <p>A strong smell of camphor came from the butterfly boxes.</p>
            <p>Mixed with the smell of camphor was the unmistakable smell of seaweed. Tawny ribbons
               hung on the door. The sun beat straight upon them. The upper wings of the moth which
               Jacob held were undoubtedly marked with kidney-shaped spots of a fulvous hue. But
               there was no crescent upon the underwing. The tree had fallen the night he caught it.
               There had been a volley of pistol-shots suddenly in the depths of the wood. And his
               mother had taken him for a burglar when he came home late. The only one of her sons
               who never obeyed her, she said.</p>
            <p>Morris called it "an extremely local insect found in damp or marshy places." But
               Morris is sometimes wrong. Sometimes Jacob, choosing a very fine pen, made a
               correction in the margin.</p>
            <p><pb n="35" facs="pageImages/35.png"/>The tree had fallen, though it was a windless night, and the lantern, stood upon the
               ground, had lit up the still green leaves and the dead beech leaves. It was a dry
               place. A toad was there. And the red underwing had circled round the light and
               flashed and gone. The red underwing had never come back, though Jacob had waited. It
               was after twelve when he crossed the lawn and saw his mother in the bright room,
               playing patience, sitting up.</p>
            <p>"How you frightened me!" she had cried. She thought something dreadful had happened.
               And he woke Rebecca, who had to be up so early.</p>
            <p>There he stood pale, come out of the depths of darkness, in the hot room, blinking at
               the light.</p>
            <p>No, it could not be a straw-bordered underwing.</p>
            <p>The mowing-machine always wanted oiling. Barnet turned it under Jacob's window, and
               it creaked—creaked, and rattled across the lawn and creaked again.</p>
            <p>Now it was clouding over.</p>
            <p>Back came the sun, dazzlingly.</p>
            <p>It fell like an eye upon the stirrups, and then suddenly and yet very gently rested
               upon the bed, upon the alarum clock, and upon the butterfly box stood open. The pale
               clouded yellows <pb n="36" facs="pageImages/36.png"/>had pelted over the moor; they had zigzagged across the purple
               clover. The fritillaries flaunted along the hedgerows. The blues settled on little
               bones lying on the turf with the sun beating on them, and the painted ladies and the
               peacocks feasted upon bloody entrails dropped by a hawk. Miles away from home, in a
               hollow among teasles beneath a ruin, he had found the commas. He had seen a white
               admiral circling higher and higher round an oak tree, but he had never caught it. An
               old cottage woman living alone, high up, had told him of a purple butterfly which
               came every summer to her garden. The fox cubs played in the gorse in the early
               morning, she told him. And if you looked out at dawn you could always see two
               badgers. Sometimes they knocked each other over like two boys fighting, she said.</p>
            <p>"You won't go far this afternoon, Jacob," said his mother, popping her head in at the
               door, "for the Captain's coming to say good-bye." It was the last day of the Easter
               holidays.</p>
            <p>Wednesday was Captain Barfoot's day. He dressed himself very neatly in blue serge,
               took <pb n="37" facs="pageImages/37.png"/>his rubber-shod stick—for he was lame and wanted two fingers on the left hand,
               having served his country—and set out from the house with the flagstaff precisely at
               four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
            <p>At three Mr. Dickens, the bath-chair man, had called for Mrs. Barfoot.</p>
            <p>"Move me," she would say to Mr. Dickens, after sitting on the esplanade for fifteen
               minutes. And again, "That'll do, thank you, Mr. Dickens." At the first command he
               would seek the sun; at the second he would stay the chair there in the bright
               strip.</p>
            <p>An old inhabitant himself, he had much in common with Mrs. Barfoot—James Coppard's
               daughter. The drinking-fountain, where West Street joins Broad Street, is the gift of
               James Coppard, who was mayor at the time of Queen Victoria's jubilee, and Coppard is
               painted upon municipal watering-carts and over shop windows, and upon the zinc blinds
               of solicitors' consulting-room windows. But Ellen Barfoot never visited the Aquarium
               (though she had known Captain Boase who had caught the shark quite well), and when
               the men came by with the posters she eyed them superciliously, for she knew that she
               would never see the Pierrots, or the brothers Zeno, or Daisy Budd and her troupe of
               performing seals. For Ellen Barfoot in her bath-chair on the <pb n="38" facs="pageImages/38.png"/>esplanade was a
               prisoner—civilization's prisoner—all the bars of her cage falling across the
               esplanade on sunny days when the town hall, the drapery stores, the swimming-bath,
               and the memorial hall striped the ground with shadow.</p>
            <p>An old inhabitant himself, Mr. Dickens would stand a little behind her, smoking his
               pipe. She would ask him questions—who people were—who now kept Mr. Jones's shop—then
               about the season—and had Mrs. Dickens tried, whatever it might be—the words issuing
               from her lips like crumbs of dry biscuit.</p>
            <p>She closed her eyes. Mr. Dickens took a turn. The feelings of a man had not
               altogether deserted him, though as you saw him coming towards you, you noticed how
               one knobbed black boot swung tremulously in front of the other; how there was a
               shadow between his waistcoat and his trousers; how he leant forward unsteadily, like
               an old horse who finds himself suddenly out of the shafts drawing no cart. But as Mr.
               Dickens sucked in the smoke and puffed it out again, the feelings of a man were
               perceptible in his eyes. He was thinking how Captain Barfoot was now on his way to
               Mount Pleasant; Captain Barfoot, his master. For at home in the little sitting-room
               above the mews, with the canary in the window, and the <pb n="39" facs="pageImages/39.png"/>girls at the sewing-machine,
               and Mrs. Dickens huddled up with the rheumatics—at home where he was made little of,
               the thought of being in the employ of Captain Barfoot supported him. He liked to
               think that while he chatted with Mrs. Barfoot on the front, he helped the Captain on
               his way to Mrs. Flanders. He, a man, was in charge of Mrs. Barfoot, a woman.</p>
            <p>Turning, he saw that she was chatting with Mrs. Rogers. Turning again, he saw that
               Mrs. Rogers had moved on. So he came back to the bath-chair, and Mrs. Barfoot asked
               him the time, and he took out his great silver watch and told her the time very
               obligingly, as if he knew a great deal more about the time and everything than she
               did. But Mrs. Barfoot knew that Captain Barfoot was on his way to Mrs. Flanders.</p>
            <p>Indeed he was well on his way there, having left the tram, and seeing Dods Hill to
               the south-east, green against a blue sky that was suffused with dust colour on the
               horizon. He was marching up the hill. In spite of his lameness there was something
               military in his approach. Mrs. Jarvis, as she came out of the Rectory gate, saw him
               coming, and her Newfoundland dog, Nero, slowly swept his tail from side to side.</p>
            <p><pb n="40" facs="pageImages/40.png"/>"Oh, Captain Barfoot!" Mrs. Jarvis exclaimed.</p>
            <p>"Good-day, Mrs. Jarvis," said the Captain.</p>
            <p>They walked on together, and when they reached Mrs. Flanders's gate Captain Barfoot
               took off his tweed cap, and said, bowing very courteously:</p>
            <p>"Good-day to you, Mrs. Jarvis."</p>
            <p>And Mrs. Jarvis walked on alone.</p>
            <p>She was going to walk on the moor. Had she again been pacing her lawn late at night?
               Had she again tapped on the study window and cried: "Look at the moon, look at the
               moon, Herbert!"</p>
            <p>And Herbert looked at the moon.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Jarvis walked on the moor when she was unhappy, going as far as a certain
               saucer-shaped hollow, though she always meant to go to a more distant ridge; and
               there she sat down, and took out the little book hidden beneath her cloak and read a
               few lines of poetry, and looked about her. She was not very unhappy, and, seeing that
               she was forty-five, never perhaps would be very unhappy, desperately unhappy that is,
               and leave her husband, and ruin a good man's career, as she sometimes threatened.</p>
            <p>Still there is no need to say what risks a clergyman's wife runs when she walks on
               the moor. <pb n="41" facs="pageImages/41.png"/>Short, dark, with kindling eyes, a pheasant's feather in her hat, Mrs.
               Jarvis was just the sort of woman to lose her faith upon the moors—to confound her
               God with the universal that is—but she did not lose her faith, did not leave her
               husband, never read her poem through, and went on walking the moors, looking at the
               moon behind the elm trees, and feeling as she sat on the grass high above
               <placeName type="tgn" key="7010063">Scarborough</placeName>… Yes, yes, when the lark soars; when the sheep, moving a step or two
               onwards, crop the turf, and at the same time set their bells tinkling; when the
               breeze first blows, then dies down, leaving the cheek kissed; when the ships on the
               sea below seem to cross each other and pass on as if drawn by an invisible hand; when
               there are distant concussions in the air and phantom horsemen galloping, ceasing;
               when the horizon swims blue, green, emotional—then Mrs. Jarvis, heaving a sigh,
               thinks to herself, "If only some one could give me… if I could give some one…." But
               she does not know what she wants to give, nor who could give it her.</p>
            <p>"Mrs. Flanders stepped out only five minutes ago, Captain," said Rebecca. Captain
               Barfoot sat him down in the arm-chair to wait. Resting <pb n="42" facs="pageImages/42.png"/>his elbows on the arms,
               putting one hand over the other, sticking his lame leg straight out, and placing the
               stick with the rubber ferrule beside it, he sat perfectly still. There was something
               rigid about him. Did he think? Probably the same thoughts again and again. But were
               they "nice" thoughts, interesting thoughts? He was a man with a temper; tenacious,
               faithful. Women would have felt, "Here is law. Here is order. Therefore we must
               cherish this man. He is on the Bridge at night," and, handing him his cup, or
               whatever it might be, would run on to visions of shipwreck and disaster, in which all
               the passengers come tumbling from their cabins, and there is the captain, buttoned in
               his pea-jacket, matched with the storm, vanquished by it but by none other. "Yet I
               have a soul," Mrs. Jarvis would bethink her, as Captain Barfoot suddenly blew his
               nose in a great red bandanna handkerchief, "and it's the man's stupidity that's the
               cause of this, and the storm's my storm as well as his"… so Mrs. Jarvis would bethink
               her when the Captain dropped in to see them and found Herbert out, and spent two or
               three hours, almost silent, sitting in the arm-chair. But Betty Flanders thought
               nothing of the kind.</p>
            <p><pb n="43" facs="pageImages/43.png"/>"Oh, Captain," said Mrs. Flanders, bursting into the drawing-room, "I had to run
               after Barker's man… I hope Rebecca… I hope Jacob…"</p>
            <p>She was very much out of breath, yet not at all upset, and as she put down the
               hearth-brush which she had bought of the oil-man, she said it was hot, flung the
               window further open, straightened a cover, picked up a book, as if she were very
               confident, very fond of the Captain, and a great many years younger than he was.
               Indeed, in her blue apron she did not look more than thirty-five. He was well over
               fifty.</p>
            <p>She moved her hands about the table; the Captain moved his head from side to side,
               and made little sounds, as Betty went on chattering, completely at his ease—after
               twenty years.</p>
            <p>"Well," he said at length, "I've heard from Mr. Polegate."</p>
            <p>He had heard from Mr. Polegate that he could advise nothing better than to send a boy
               to one of the universities.</p>
            <p>"Mr. Floyd was at <placeName type="tgn" key="7010874">Cambridge</placeName>… no, at Oxford… well, at one or the other," said Mrs.
               Flanders.</p>
            <p><pb n="44" facs="pageImages/44.png"/>She looked out of the window. Little windows, and the lilac and green of the garden
               were reflected in her eyes.</p>
            <p>"Archer is doing very well," she said. "I have a very nice report from Captain
               Maxwell." "I will leave you the letter to show Jacob," said the Captain, putting it
               clumsily back in its envelope.</p>
            <p>"Jacob is after his butterflies as usual," said Mrs. Flanders irritably, but was
               surprised by a sudden afterthought, "Cricket begins this week, of course."</p>
            <p>"Edward Jenkinson has handed in his resignation," said Captain Barfoot.</p>
            <p>"Then you will stand for the Council?" Mrs. Flanders exclaimed, looking the Captain
               full in the face.</p>
            <p>"Well, about that," Captain Barfoot began, settling himself rather deeper in his
               chair.</p>
            <p>Jacob Flanders, therefore, went up to <placeName type="tgn" key="7010874">Cambridge</placeName> in October, 1906.</p>

            <p><pb n="45" facs="pageImages/45.png"/>"This is not a smoking-carriage," Mrs. Norman protested, nervously but very feebly,
               as the door swung open and a powerfully built young man jumped in. He seemed not to
               hear her. The train did not stop before it reached <placeName type="tgn" key="7010874">Cambridge</placeName>, and here she was shut
               up alone, in a railway carriage, with a young man.</p>
            <p>She touched the spring of her dressing-case, and ascertained that the scent-bottle
               and a novel from Mudie's were both handy (the young man was standing up with his back
               to her, putting his bag in the rack). She would throw the scent-bottle with her right
               hand, she decided, and tug the communication cord with her left. She was fifty years
               of age, and had a son at college. Nevertheless, it is a fact that men are dangerous.
               She read half a column of her newspaper; then stealthily looked over the edge to
               decide the question of safety by the infallible test of appearance…. She would like
               to offer him her <pb n="46" facs="pageImages/46.png"/>paper. But do young men read the Morning Post? She looked to see
               what he was reading—the Daily Telegraph.</p>
            <p>Taking note of socks (loose), of tie (shabby), she once more reached his face. She
               dwelt upon his mouth. The lips were shut. The eyes bent down, since he was reading.
               All was firm, yet youthful, indifferent, unconscious—as for knocking one down! No,
               no, no! She looked out of the window, smiling slightly now, and then came back again,
               for he didn't notice her. Grave, unconscious… now he looked up, past her… he seemed
               so out of place, somehow, alone with an elderly lady… then he fixed his eyes—which
               were blue—on the landscape. He had not realized her presence, she thought. Yet it was
               none of HER fault that this was not a smoking-carriage—if that was what he meant.</p>
            <p>Nobody sees any one as he is, let alone an elderly lady sitting opposite a strange
               young man in a railway carriage. They see a whole—they see all sorts of things—they
               see themselves…. Mrs. Norman now read three pages of one of Mr. Norris's novels.
               Should she say to the young man (and after all he was just the same age as her own
               boy): "If you want to smoke, don't mind me"? No: he seemed <pb n="47" facs="pageImages/47.png"/>absolutely indifferent to
               her presence… she did not wish to interrupt.</p>
            <p>But since, even at her age, she noted his indifference, presumably he was in some way
               or other—to her at least—nice, handsome, interesting, distinguished, well built, like
               her own boy? One must do the best one can with her report. Anyhow, this was Jacob
               Flanders, aged nineteen. It is no use trying to sum people up. One must follow hints,
               not exactly what is said, nor yet entirely what is done—for instance, when the train
               drew into the station, Mr. Flanders burst open the door, and put the lady's
               dressing-case out for her, saying, or rather mumbling: "Let me" very shyly; indeed he
               was rather clumsy about it.</p>
            <p>"Who…" said the lady, meeting her son; but as there was a great crowd on the platform
               and Jacob had already gone, she did not finish her sentence. As this was <placeName type="tgn" key="7010874">Cambridge</placeName>,
               as she was staying there for the week-end, as she saw nothing but young men all day
               long, in streets and round tables, this sight of her fellow-traveller was completely
               lost in her mind, as the crooked pin dropped by a child into the wishing-well twirls
               in the water and disappears for ever.</p>
            <p><pb n="48" facs="pageImages/48.png"/>They say the sky is the same everywhere. Travellers, the shipwrecked, exiles, and the
               dying draw comfort from the thought, and no doubt if you are of a mystical tendency,
               consolation, and even explanation, shower down from the unbroken surface. But above
               <placeName type="tgn" key="7010874">Cambridge</placeName>—anyhow above the roof of King's College Chapel—there is a difference. Out
               at sea a great city will cast a brightness into the night. Is it fanciful to suppose
               the sky, washed into the crevices of King's College Chapel, lighter, thinner, more
               sparkling than the sky elsewhere? Does <placeName type="tgn" key="7010874">Cambridge</placeName> burn not only into the night, but
               into the day?</p>
            <p>Look, as they pass into service, how airily the gowns blow out, as though nothing
               dense and corporeal were within. What sculptured faces, what certainty, authority
               controlled by piety, although great boots march under the gowns. In what orderly
               procession they advance. Thick wax candles stand upright; young men rise in white
               gowns; while the subservient eagle bears up for inspection the great white book.</p>
            <p>An inclined plane of light comes accurately through each window, purple and yellow
               even in its most diffused dust, while, where it breaks upon stone, that stone is
               softly chalked red, yellow, <pb n="49" facs="pageImages/49.png"/>and purple. Neither snow nor greenery, winter nor summer,
               has power over the old stained glass. As the sides of a lantern protect the flame so
               that it burns steady even in the wildest night—burns steady and gravely illumines the
               tree-trunks—so inside the Chapel all was orderly. Gravely sounded the voices; wisely
               the organ replied, as if buttressing human faith with the assent of the elements. The
               white-robed figures crossed from side to side; now mounted steps, now descended, all
               very orderly.</p>
            <p>… If you stand a lantern under a tree every insect in the forest creeps up to it—a
               curious assembly, since though they scramble and swing and knock their heads against
               the glass, they seem to have no purpose—something senseless inspires them. One gets
               tired of watching them, as they amble round the lantern and blindly tap as if for
               admittance, one large toad being the most besotted of any and shouldering his way
               through the rest. Ah, but what's that? A terrifying volley of pistol-shots rings
               out—cracks sharply; ripples spread—silence laps smooth over sound. A tree—a tree has
               fallen, a sort of death in the forest. After that, the wind in the trees sounds
               melancholy.</p>
            <p>But this service in King's College Chapel—why allow women to take part in it? Surely,
               if <pb n="50" facs="pageImages/50.png"/>the mind wanders (and Jacob looked extraordinarily vacant, his head thrown back,
               his hymn-book open at the wrong place), if the mind wanders it is because several hat
               shops and cupboards upon cupboards of coloured dresses are displayed upon
               rush-bottomed chairs. Though heads and bodies may be devout enough, one has a sense
               of individuals—some like blue, others brown; some feathers, others pansies and
               forget-me-nots. No one would think of bringing a dog into church. For though a dog is
               all very well on a gravel path, and shows no disrespect to flowers, the way he
               wanders down an aisle, looking, lifting a paw, and approaching a pillar with a
               purpose that makes the blood run cold with horror (should you be one of a
               congregation—alone, shyness is out of the question), a dog destroys the service
               completely. So do these women—though separately devout, distinguished, and vouched
               for by the theology, mathematics, Latin, and Greek of their husbands. Heaven knows
               why it is. For one thing, thought Jacob, they're as ugly as sin.</p>
            <p>Now there was a scraping and murmuring. He caught Timmy Durrant's eye; looked very
               sternly at him; and then, very solemnly, winked.</p>
            <p><pb n="51" facs="pageImages/51.png"/>"Waverley," the villa on the road to Girton was called, not that Mr. Plumer admired
               Scott or would have chosen any name at all, but names are useful when you have to
               entertain undergraduates, and as they sat waiting for the fourth undergraduate, on
               Sunday at lunch-time, there was talk of names upon gates.</p>
            <p>"How tiresome," Mrs. Plumer interrupted impulsively. "Does anybody know Mr.
               Flanders?" Mr. Durrant knew him; and therefore blushed slightly, and said, awkwardly,
               something about being sure—looking at Mr. Plumer and hitching the right leg of his
               trouser as he spoke. Mr. Plumer got up and stood in front of the fireplace. Mrs.
               Plumer laughed like a straightforward friendly fellow. In short, anything more
               horrible than the scene, the setting, the prospect, even the May garden being
               afflicted with chill sterility and a cloud choosing that moment to cross the sun,
               cannot be imagined. There was the garden, of course. Every one at the same moment
               looked at it. Owing to the cloud, the leaves ruffled grey, and the sparrows—there
               were two sparrows.</p>
            <p>"I think," said Mrs. Plumer, taking advantage <pb n="52" facs="pageImages/52.png"/>of the momentary respite, while the
               young men stared at the garden, to look at her husband, and he, not accepting full
               responsibility for the act, nevertheless touched the bell.</p>
            <p>There can be no excuse for this outrage upon one hour of human life, save the
               reflection which occurred to Mr. Plumer as he carved the mutton, that if no don ever
               gave a luncheon party, if Sunday after Sunday passed, if men went down, became
               lawyers, doctors, members of Parliament, business men—if no don ever gave a luncheon
               party—</p>
            <p>"Now, does lamb make the mint sauce, or mint sauce make the lamb?" he asked the young
               man next him, to break a silence which had already lasted five minutes and a
               half.</p>
            <p>"I don't know, sir," said the young man, blushing very vividly.</p>
            <p>At this moment in came Mr. Flanders. He had mistaken the time.</p>
            <p>Now, though they had finished their meat, Mrs. Plumer took a second helping of
               cabbage. Jacob determined, of course, that he would eat his meat in the time it took
               her to finish her cabbage, looking once or twice to measure his speed—only he was
               infernally hungry. Seeing this, Mrs. Plumer said that she was sure Mr. Flanders would
               not mind—and the tart was <pb n="53" facs="pageImages/53.png"/>brought in. Nodding in a peculiar way, she directed the
               maid to give Mr. Flanders a second helping of mutton. She glanced at the mutton. Not
               much of the leg would be left for luncheon.</p>
            <p>It was none of her fault—since how could she control her father begetting her forty
               years ago in the suburbs of <placeName type="tgn" key="7010477">Manchester</placeName>? and once begotten, how could she do other
               than grow up cheese-paring, ambitious, with an instinctively accurate notion of the
               rungs of the ladder and an ant-like assiduity in pushing George Plumer ahead of her
               to the top of the ladder? What was at the top of the ladder? A sense that all the
               rungs were beneath one apparently; since by the time that George Plumer became
               Professor of Physics, or whatever it might be, Mrs. Plumer could only be in a
               condition to cling tight to her eminence, peer down at the ground, and goad her two
               plain daughters to climb the rungs of the ladder.</p>
            <p>"I was down at the races yesterday," she said, "with my two little girls."</p>
            <p>It was none of THEIR fault either. In they came to the drawing-room, in white frocks
               and blue sashes. They handed the cigarettes. Rhoda had inherited her father's cold
               grey eyes. Cold grey eyes George Plumer had, but in them was an abstract light. He
               could talk about Persia <pb n="54" facs="pageImages/54.png"/>and the Trade winds, the Reform Bill and the cycle of the
               harvests. Books were on his shelves by Wells and Shaw; on the table serious six-penny
               weeklies written by pale men in muddy boots—the weekly creak and screech of brains
               rinsed in cold water and wrung dry—melancholy papers.</p>
            <p>"I don't feel that I know the truth about anything till I've read them both!" said
               Mrs. Plumer brightly, tapping the table of contents with her bare red hand, upon
               which the ring looked so incongruous.</p>
            <p>"Oh God, oh God, oh God!" exclaimed Jacob, as the four undergraduates left the house.
               "Oh, my God!"</p>
            <p>"Bloody beastly!" he said, scanning the street for lilac or bicycle—anything to
               restore his sense of freedom.</p>
            <p>"Bloody beastly," he said to Timmy Durrant, summing up his discomfort at the world
               shown him at lunch-time, a world capable of existing—there was no doubt about
               that—but so unnecessary, such a thing to believe in—Shaw and Wells and the serious
               sixpenny weeklies! What were they after, scrubbing and demolishing, <pb n="55" facs="pageImages/55.png"/>these elderly
               people? Had they never read Homer, Shakespeare, the Elizabethans? He saw it clearly
               outlined against the feelings he drew from youth and natural inclination. The poor
               devils had rigged up this meagre object. Yet something of pity was in him. Those
               wretched little girls—</p>
            <p>The extent to which he was disturbed proves that he was already agog. Insolent he was
               and inexperienced, but sure enough the cities which the elderly of the race have
               built upon the skyline showed like brick suburbs, barracks, and places of discipline
               against a red and yellow flame. He was impressionable; but the word is contradicted
               by the composure with which he hollowed his hand to screen a match. He was a young
               man of substance.</p>
            <p>Anyhow, whether undergraduate or shop boy, man or woman, it must come as a shock
               about the age of twenty—the world of the elderly—thrown up in such black outline upon
               what we are; upon the reality; the moors and Byron; the sea and the lighthouse; the
               sheep's jaw with the yellow teeth in it; upon the obstinate irrepressible conviction
               which makes youth so intolerably disagreeable—"I am what I am, and intend to be it,"
               for which there will be no form in the world unless Jacob makes one for himself. The
               <pb n="56" facs="pageImages/56.png"/>Plumers will try to prevent him from making it. Wells and Shaw and the serious
               sixpenny weeklies will sit on its head. Every time he lunches out on Sunday—at dinner
               parties and tea parties—there will be this same shock—horror—discomfort—then
               pleasure, for he draws into him at every step as he walks by the river such steady
               certainty, such reassurance from all sides, the trees bowing, the grey spires soft in
               the blue, voices blowing and seeming suspended in the air, the springy air of May,
               the elastic air with its particles—chestnut bloom, pollen, whatever it is that gives
               the May air its potency, blurring the trees, gumming the buds, daubing the green. And
               the river too runs past, not at flood, nor swiftly, but cloying the oar that dips in
               it and drops white drops from the blade, swimming green and deep over the bowed
               rushes, as if lavishly caressing them.</p>
            <p>Where they moored their boat the trees showered down, so that their topmost leaves
               trailed in the ripples and the green wedge that lay in the water being made of leaves
               shifted in leaf-breadths as the real leaves shifted. Now there was a shiver of
               wind—instantly an edge of sky; and as Durrant ate cherries he dropped the stunted
               yellow cherries through the green wedge of leaves, their stalks twinkling as they
               <pb n="57" facs="pageImages/57.png"/>wriggled in and out, and sometimes one half-bitten cherry would go down red into the
               green. The meadow was on a level with Jacob's eyes as he lay back; gilt with
               buttercups, but the grass did not run like the thin green water of the graveyard
               grass about to overflow the tombstones, but stood juicy and thick. Looking up,
               backwards, he saw the legs of children deep in the grass, and the legs of cows.
               Munch, munch, he heard; then a short step through the grass; then again munch, munch,
               munch, as they tore the grass short at the roots. In front of him two white
               butterflies circled higher and higher round the elm tree.</p>
            <p>"Jacob's off," thought Durrant looking up from his novel. He kept reading a few pages
               and then looking up in a curiously methodical manner, and each time he looked up he
               took a few cherries out of the bag and ate them abstractedly. Other boats passed
               them, crossing the backwater from side to side to avoid each other, for many were now
               moored, and there were now white dresses and a flaw in the column of air between two
               trees, round which curled a thread of blue—Lady Miller's picnic party. Still more
               boats kept coming, and Durrant, without getting up, shoved their boat closer to the
               bank.</p>
            <p>"Oh-h-h-h," groaned Jacob, as the boat <pb n="58" facs="pageImages/58.png"/>rocked, and the trees rocked, and the white
               dresses and the white flannel trousers drew out long and wavering up the bank.</p>
            <p>"Oh-h-h-h!" He sat up, and felt as if a piece of elastic had snapped in his face.</p>
            <p>"They're friends of my mother's," said Durrant. "So old Bow took no end of trouble
               about the boat."</p>
            <p>And this boat had gone from <placeName type="tgn" key="7011359">Falmouth</placeName> to <placeName type="tgn" key="1113719">St. Ives Bay</placeName>, all round the coast. A larger
               boat, a ten-ton yacht, about the twentieth of June, properly fitted out, Durrant
               said…</p>
            <p>"There's the cash difficulty," said Jacob.</p>
            <p>"My people'll see to that," said Durrant (the son of a banker, deceased).</p>
            <p>"I intend to preserve my economic independence," said Jacob stiffly. (He was getting
               excited.)</p>
            <p>"My mother said something about going to Harrogate," he said with a little annoyance,
               feeling the pocket where he kept his letters.</p>
            <p>"Was that true about your uncle becoming a Mohammedan?" asked Timmy Durrant. Jacob
               had told the story of his Uncle Morty in Durrant's room the night before.</p>
            <p>"I expect he's feeding the sharks, if the truth <pb n="59" facs="pageImages/59.png"/>were known," said Jacob. "I say,
               Durrant, there's none left!" he exclaimed, crumpling the bag which had held the
               cherries, and throwing it into the river. He saw Lady Miller's picnic party on the
               island as he threw the bag into the river. A sort of awkwardness, grumpiness, gloom
               came into his eyes.</p>
            <p>"Shall we move on… this beastly crowd…" he said.</p>
            <p>So up they went, past the island.</p>
            <p>The feathery white moon never let the sky grow dark; all night the chestnut blossoms
               were white in the green; dim was the cow-parsley in the meadows.</p>
            <p>The waiters at Trinity must have been shuffling china plates like cards, from the
               clatter that could be heard in the Great Court. Jacob's rooms, however, were in
               Neville's Court; at the top; so that reaching his door one went in a little out of
               breath; but he wasn't there. Dining in Hall, presumably. It will be quite dark in
               Neville's Court long before midnight, only the pillars opposite will always be white,
               and the fountains. A curious effect the gate has, like lace upon <pb n="60" facs="pageImages/60.png"/>pale green. Even in
               the window you hear the plates; a hum of talk, too, from the diners; the Hall lit up,
               and the swing-doors opening and shutting with a soft thud. Some are late.</p>
            <p>Jacob's room had a round table and two low chairs. There were yellow flags in a jar
               on the mantelpiece; a photograph of his mother; cards from societies with little
               raised crescents, coats of arms, and initials; notes and pipes; on the table lay
               paper ruled with a red margin—an essay, no doubt—"Does History consist of the
               Biographies of Great Men?" There were books enough; very few French books; but then
               any one who's worth anything reads just what he likes, as the mood takes him, with
               extravagant enthusiasm. Lives of the Duke of Wellington, for example; Spinoza; the
               works of Dickens; the Faery Queen; a Greek dictionary with the petals of poppies
               pressed to silk between the pages; all the Elizabethans. His slippers were incredibly
               shabby, like boats burnt to the water's rim. Then there were photographs from the
               Greeks, and a mezzotint from Sir Joshua—all very English. The works of Jane Austen,
               too, in deference, perhaps, to some one else's standard. Carlyle was a prize. There
               were books upon the Italian painters of the Renaissance, a Manual of the Diseases of
               the Horse, and all the usual <pb n="61" facs="pageImages/61.png"/>text-books. Listless is the air in an empty room, just
               swelling the curtain; the flowers in the jar shift. One fibre in the wicker arm-chair
               creaks, though no one sits there.</p>
            <p>Coming down the steps a little sideways [Jacob sat on the window-seat talking to
               Durrant; he smoked, and Durrant looked at the map], the old man, with his hands
               locked behind him, his gown floating black, lurched, unsteadily, near the wall; then,
               upstairs he went into his room. Then another, who raised his hand and praised the
               columns, the gate, the sky; another, tripping and smug. Each went up a staircase;
               three lights were lit in the dark windows.</p>
            <p>If any light burns above <placeName type="tgn" key="7010874">Cambridge</placeName>, it must be from three such rooms; Greek burns
               here; science there; philosophy on the ground floor. Poor old Huxtable can't walk
               straight;—Sopwith, too, has praised the sky any night these twenty years; and Cowan
               still chuckles at the same stories. It is not simple, or pure, or wholly splendid,
               the lamp of learning, since if you see them there under its light (whether Rossetti's
               on the wall, or Van Gogh reproduced, whether <pb n="62" facs="pageImages/62.png"/>there are lilacs in the bowl or rusty
               pipes), how priestly they look! How like a suburb where you go to see a view and eat
               a special cake! "We are the sole purveyors of this cake." Back you go to <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName>; for
               the treat is over.</p>
            <p>Old Professor Huxtable, performing with the method of a clock his change of dress,
               let himself down into his chair; filled his pipe; chose his paper; crossed his feet;
               and extracted his glasses. The whole flesh of his face then fell into folds as if
               props were removed. Yet strip a whole seat of an underground railway carriage of its
               heads and old Huxtable's head will hold them all. Now, as his eye goes down the
               print, what a procession tramps through the corridors of his brain, orderly,
               quick-stepping, and reinforced, as the march goes on, by fresh runnels, till the
               whole hall, dome, whatever one calls it, is populous with ideas. Such a muster takes
               place in no other brain. Yet sometimes there he'll sit for hours together, gripping
               the arm of the chair, like a man holding fast because stranded, and then, just
               because his corn twinges, or it may be the gout, what execrations, and, dear me, to
               hear him talk of money, taking out his leather purse and grudging even the smallest
               silver coin, secretive and suspicious as an old peasant woman with all her lies.
               Strange paralysis and constriction—<pb n="63" facs="pageImages/63.png"/>marvellous illumination. Serene over it all rides
               the great full brow, and sometimes asleep or in the quiet spaces of the night you
               might fancy that on a pillow of stone he lay triumphant.</p>
            <p>Sopwith, meanwhile, advancing with a curious trip from the fire-place, cut the
               chocolate cake into segments. Until midnight or later there would be undergraduates
               in his room, sometimes as many as twelve, sometimes three or four; but nobody got up
               when they went or when they came; Sopwith went on talking. Talking, talking,
               talking—as if everything could be talked—the soul itself slipped through the lips in
               thin silver disks which dissolve in young men's minds like silver, like moonlight.
               Oh, far away they'd remember it, and deep in dulness gaze back on it, and come to
               refresh themselves again.</p>
            <p>"Well, I never. That's old Chucky. My dear boy, how's the world treating you?" And in
               came poor little Chucky, the unsuccessful provincial, Stenhouse his real name, but of
               course Sopwith brought back by using the other everything, everything, "all I could
               never be"—yes, though next day, buying his newspaper and catching the early train, it
               all seemed to him childish, absurd; the chocolate cake, the young <pb n="64" facs="pageImages/64.png"/>men; Sopwith
               summing things up; no, not all; he would send his son there. He would save every
               penny to send his son there.</p>
            <p>Sopwith went on talking; twining stiff fibres of awkward speech—things young men
               blurted out—plaiting them round his own smooth garland, making the bright side show,
               the vivid greens, the sharp thorns, manliness. He loved it. Indeed to Sopwith a man
               could say anything, until perhaps he'd grown old, or gone under, gone deep, when the
               silver disks would tinkle hollow, and the inscription read a little too simple, and
               the old stamp look too pure, and the impress always the same—a Greek boy's head. But
               he would respect still. A woman, divining the priest, would, involuntarily,
               despise.</p>
            <p>Cowan, Erasmus Cowan, sipped his port alone, or with one rosy little man, whose
               memory held precisely the same span of time; sipped his port, and told his stories,
               and without book before him intoned Latin, Virgil and Catullus, as if language were
               wine upon his lips. Only—sometimes it will come over one—what if the poet strode in?
               "THIS my image?" he might ask, pointing to the chubby man, whose brain is, after all,
               Virgil's representative among us, though the body gluttonize, and as for arms, bees,
               or even the <pb n="65" facs="pageImages/65.png"/>plough, Cowan takes his trips abroad with a French novel in his pocket, a
               rug about his knees, and is thankful to be home again in his place, in his line,
               holding up in his snug little mirror the image of Virgil, all rayed round with good
               stories of the dons of Trinity and red beams of port. But language is wine upon his
               lips. Nowhere else would Virgil hear the like. And though, as she goes sauntering
               along the Backs, old Miss Umphelby sings him melodiously enough, accurately too, she
               is always brought up by this question as she reaches Clare Bridge: "But if I met him,
               what should I wear?"—and then, taking her way up the avenue towards Newnham, she lets
               her fancy play upon other details of men's meeting with women which have never got
               into print. Her lectures, therefore, are not half so well attended as those of Cowan,
               and the thing she might have said in elucidation of the text for ever left out. In
               short, face a teacher with the image of the taught and the mirror breaks. But Cowan
               sipped his port, his exaltation over, no longer the representative of Virgil. No, the
               builder, assessor, surveyor, rather; ruling lines between names, hanging lists above
               doors. Such is the fabric through which the light must shine, if shine it can—the
               light of all these languages, Chinese and Russian, Persian and Arabic, of <pb n="66" facs="pageImages/66.png"/>symbols and
               figures, of history, of things that are known and things that are about to be known.
               So that if at night, far out at sea over the tumbling waves, one saw a haze on the
               waters, a city illuminated, a whiteness even in the sky, such as that now over the
               Hall of Trinity where they're still dining, or washing up plates, that would be the
               light burning there—the light of <placeName type="tgn" key="7010874">Cambridge</placeName>.</p>
            <p>"Let's go round to Simeon's room," said Jacob, and they rolled up the map, having got
               the whole thing settled.</p>
            <p>All the lights were coming out round the court, and falling on the cobbles, picking
               out dark patches of grass and single daisies. The young men were now back in their
               rooms. Heaven knows what they were doing. What was it that could DROP like that? And
               leaning down over a foaming window-box, one stopped another hurrying past, and
               upstairs they went and down they went, until a sort of fulness settled on the court,
               the hive full of bees, the bees home thick with gold, drowsy, humming, suddenly
               vocal; the Moonlight Sonata answered by a waltz.</p>
            <p><pb n="67" facs="pageImages/67.png"/>The Moonlight Sonata tinkled away; the waltz crashed. Although young men still went
               in and out, they walked as if keeping engagements. Now and then there was a thud, as
               if some heavy piece of furniture had fallen, unexpectedly, of its own accord, not in
               the general stir of life after dinner. One supposed that young men raised their eyes
               from their books as the furniture fell. Were they reading? Certainly there was a
               sense of concentration in the air. Behind the grey walls sat so many young men, some
               undoubtedly reading, magazines, shilling shockers, no doubt; legs, perhaps, over the
               arms of chairs; smoking; sprawling over tables, and writing while their heads went
               round in a circle as the pen moved—simple young men, these, who would—but there is no
               need to think of them grown old; others eating sweets; here they boxed; and, well,
               Mr. Hawkins must have been mad suddenly to throw up his window and bawl: "Jo—seph!
               Jo—seph!" and then he ran as hard as ever he could across the court, while an elderly
               man, in a green apron, carrying an immense pile of tin covers, hesitated, balanced,
               and then went on. But this was a diversion. There were young men who read, lying in
               shallow arm-chairs, holding their books as if they had hold in <pb n="68" facs="pageImages/68.png"/>their hands of
               something that would see them through; they being all in a torment, coming from
               midland towns, clergymen's sons. Others read Keats. And those long histories in many
               volumes—surely some one was now beginning at the beginning in order to understand the
               Holy Roman Empire, as one must. That was part of the concentration, though it would
               be dangerous on a hot spring night—dangerous, perhaps, to concentrate too much upon
               single books, actual chapters, when at any moment the door opened and Jacob appeared;
               or Richard Bonamy, reading Keats no longer, began making long pink spills from an old
               newspaper, bending forward, and looking eager and contented no more, but almost
               fierce. Why? Only perhaps that Keats died young—one wants to write poetry too and to
               love—oh, the brutes! It's damnably difficult. But, after all, not so difficult if on
               the next staircase, in the large room, there are two, three, five young men all
               convinced of this—of brutality, that is, and the clear division between right and
               wrong. There was a sofa, chairs, a square table, and the window being open, one could
               see how they sat—legs issuing here, one there crumpled in a corner of the sofa; and,
               presumably, for you could not see him, somebody stood by the fender, talking. Anyhow,
               Jacob, who sat astride <pb n="69" facs="pageImages/69.png"/>a chair and ate dates from a long box, burst out laughing. The
               answer came from the sofa corner; for his pipe was held in the air, then replaced.
               Jacob wheeled round. He had something to say to THAT, though the sturdy red-haired
               boy at the table seemed to deny it, wagging his head slowly from side to side; and
               then, taking out his penknife, he dug the point of it again and again into a knot in
               the table, as if affirming that the voice from the fender spoke the truth—which Jacob
               could not deny. Possibly, when he had done arranging the date-stones, he might find
               something to say to it—indeed his lips opened—only then there broke out a roar of
               laughter.</p>
            <p>The laughter died in the air. The sound of it could scarcely have reached any one
               standing by the Chapel, which stretched along the opposite side of the court. The
               laughter died out, and only gestures of arms, movements of bodies, could be seen
               shaping something in the room. Was it an argument? A bet on the boat races? Was it
               nothing of the sort? What was shaped by the arms and bodies moving in the twilight
               room?</p>
            <p>A step or two beyond the window there was nothing at all, except the enclosing
               buildings—chimneys upright, roofs horizontal; too much brick and building for a May
               night, perhaps. <pb n="70" facs="pageImages/70.png"/>And then before one's eyes would come the bare hills of Turkey—sharp
               lines, dry earth, coloured flowers, and colour on the shoulders of the women,
               standing naked-legged in the stream to beat linen on the stones. The stream made
               loops of water round their ankles. But none of that could show clearly through the
               swaddlings and blanketings of the <placeName type="tgn" key="7010874">Cambridge</placeName> night. The stroke of the clock even was
               muffled; as if intoned by somebody reverent from a pulpit; as if generations of
               learned men heard the last hour go rolling through their ranks and issued it, already
               smooth and time-worn, with their blessing, for the use of the living.</p>
            <p>Was it to receive this gift from the past that the young man came to the window and
               stood there, looking out across the court? It was Jacob. He stood smoking his pipe
               while the last stroke of the clock purred softly round him. Perhaps there had been an
               argument. He looked satisfied; indeed masterly; which expression changed slightly as
               he stood there, the sound of the clock conveying to him (it may be) a sense of old
               buildings and time; and himself the inheritor; and then to-morrow; and friends; at
               the thought of whom, in sheer confidence and pleasure, it seemed, he yawned and
               stretched himself.</p>
            <p><pb n="71" facs="pageImages/71.png"/>Meanwhile behind him the shape they had made, whether by argument or not, the
               spiritual shape, hard yet ephemeral, as of glass compared with the dark stone of the
               Chapel, was dashed to splinters, young men rising from chairs and sofa corners,
               buzzing and barging about the room, one driving another against the bedroom door,
               which giving way, in they fell. Then Jacob was left there, in the shallow arm-chair,
               alone with Masham? Anderson? Simeon? Oh, it was Simeon. The others had all gone.</p>
            <p>"… Julian the Apostate…." Which of them said that and the other words murmured round
               it? But about midnight there sometimes rises, like a veiled figure suddenly woken, a
               heavy wind; and this now flapping through Trinity lifted unseen leaves and blurred
               everything. "Julian the Apostate"—and then the wind. Up go the elm branches, out blow
               the sails, the old schooners rear and plunge, the grey waves in the hot Indian Ocean
               tumble sultrily, and then all falls flat again.</p>
            <p>So, if the veiled lady stepped through the Courts of Trinity, she now drowsed once
               more, all her draperies about her, her head against a pillar.</p>
            <p>"Somehow it seems to matter."</p>
            <p><pb n="72" facs="pageImages/72.png"/>The low voice was Simeon's.</p>
            <p>The voice was even lower that answered him. The sharp tap of a pipe on the
               mantelpiece cancelled the words. And perhaps Jacob only said "hum," or said nothing
               at all. True, the words were inaudible. It was the intimacy, a sort of spiritual
               suppleness, when mind prints upon mind indelibly.</p>
            <p>"Well, you seem to have studied the subject," said Jacob, rising and standing over
               Simeon's chair. He balanced himself; he swayed a little. He appeared extraordinarily
               happy, as if his pleasure would brim and spill down the sides if Simeon spoke.</p>
            <p>Simeon said nothing. Jacob remained standing. But intimacy—the room was full of it,
               still, deep, like a pool. Without need of movement or speech it rose softly and
               washed over everything, mollifying, kindling, and coating the mind with the lustre of
               pearl, so that if you talk of a light, of <placeName type="tgn" key="7010874">Cambridge</placeName> burning, it's not languages only.
               It's Julian the Apostate.</p>
            <p>But Jacob moved. He murmured good-night. He went out into the court. He buttoned his
               jacket across his chest. He went back to his rooms, and being the only man who walked
               at that moment back to his rooms, his footsteps rang out, his figure loomed large.
               Back from <pb n="73" facs="pageImages/73.png"/>the Chapel, back from the Hall, back from the Library, came the sound of
               his footsteps, as if the old stone echoed with magisterial authority: "The young
               man—the young man—the young man-back to his rooms."</p>

            <p><pb n="74" facs="pageImages/74.png"/>What's the use of trying to read Shakespeare, especially in one of those little thin
               paper editions whose pages get ruffled, or stuck together with sea-water? Although
               the plays of Shakespeare had frequently been praised, even quoted, and placed higher
               than the Greek, never since they started had Jacob managed to read one through. Yet
               what an opportunity!</p>
            <p>For the <placeName type="tgn" key="7011368">Scilly Isles</placeName> had been sighted by Timmy Durrant lying like mountain-tops
               almost a-wash in precisely the right place. His calculations had worked perfectly,
               and really the sight of him sitting there, with his hand on the tiller, rosy gilled,
               with a sprout of beard, looking sternly at the stars, then at a compass, spelling out
               quite correctly his page of the eternal lesson-book, would have moved a woman. Jacob,
               of course, was not a woman. The sight of Timmy Durrant was no sight for him, nothing
               to set against the sky and worship; far from it. They had <pb n="75" facs="pageImages/75.png"/>quarrelled. Why the right
               way to open a tin of beef, with Shakespeare on board, under conditions of such
               splendour, should have turned them to sulky schoolboys, none can tell. Tinned beef is
               cold eating, though; and salt water spoils biscuits; and the waves tumble and lollop
               much the same hour after hour—tumble and lollop all across the horizon. Now a spray
               of seaweed floats past-now a log of wood. Ships have been wrecked here. One or two go
               past, keeping their own side of the road. Timmy knew where they were bound, what
               their cargoes were, and, by looking through his glass, could tell the name of the
               line, and even guess what dividends it paid its shareholders. Yet that was no reason
               for Jacob to turn sulky.</p>
            <p>The <placeName type="tgn" key="7011368">Scilly Isles</placeName> had the look of mountain-tops almost a-wash…. Unfortunately, Jacob
               broke the pin of the Primus stove. The <placeName type="tgn" key="7011368">Scilly Isles</placeName> might well be obliterated by a
               roller sweeping straight across.</p>
            <p>But one must give young men the credit of admitting that, though breakfast eaten
               under these circumstances is grim, it is sincere enough. No need to make
               conversation. They got out their pipes.</p>
            <p>Timmy wrote up some scientific observations; and—what was the question that broke the
               silence—the exact time or the day of the month? <pb n="76" facs="pageImages/76.png"/>anyhow, it was spoken without the
               least awkwardness; in the most matter-of-fact way in the world; and then Jacob began
               to unbutton his clothes and sat naked, save for his shirt, intending, apparently, to
               bathe.</p>
            <p>The <placeName type="tgn" key="7011368">Scilly Isles</placeName> were turning bluish; and suddenly blue, purple, and green flushed
               the sea; left it grey; struck a stripe which vanished; but when Jacob had got his
               shirt over his head the whole floor of the waves was blue and white, rippling and
               crisp, though now and again a broad purple mark appeared, like a bruise; or there
               floated an entire emerald tinged with yellow. He plunged. He gulped in water, spat it
               out, struck with his right arm, struck with his left, was towed by a rope, gasped,
               splashed, and was hauled on board.</p>
            <p>The seat in the boat was positively hot, and the sun warmed his back as he sat naked
               with a towel in his hand, looking at the <placeName type="tgn" key="7011368">Scilly Isles</placeName> which—confound it! the sail
               flapped. Shakespeare was knocked overboard. There you could see him floating merrily
               away, with all his pages ruffling innumerably; and then he went under.</p>
            <p>Strangely enough, you could smell violets, or if violets were impossible in July,
               they must grow something very pungent on the mainland then. The mainland, not so very
               far off—you could see clefts in the cliffs, white cottages, smoke going <pb n="77" facs="pageImages/77.png"/>up—wore an
               extraordinary look of calm, of sunny peace, as if wisdom and piety had descended upon
               the dwellers there. Now a cry sounded, as of a man calling pilchards in a main
               street. It wore an extraordinary look of piety and peace, as if old men smoked by the
               door, and girls stood, hands on hips, at the well, and horses stood; as if the end of
               the world had come, and cabbage fields and stone walls, and coast-guard stations,
               and, above all, the white sand bays with the waves breaking unseen by any one, rose
               to heaven in a kind of ecstasy.</p>
            <p>But imperceptibly the cottage smoke droops, has the look of a mourning emblem, a flag
               floating its caress over a grave. The gulls, making their broad flight and then
               riding at peace, seem to mark the grave.</p>
            <p>No doubt if this were <placeName type="tgn" key="1000080">Italy</placeName>, <placeName type="tgn" key="1000074">Greece</placeName>, or even the shores of <placeName type="tgn" key="1000095">Spain</placeName>, sadness would be
               routed by strangeness and excitement and the nudge of a classical education. But the
               Cornish hills have stark chimneys standing on them; and, somehow or other, loveliness
               is infernally sad. Yes, the chimneys and the coast-guard stations and the little bays
               with the waves breaking unseen by any one make one remember the overpowering sorrow.
               And what can this sorrow be?</p>
            <p><pb n="78" facs="pageImages/78.png"/>It is brewed by the earth itself. It comes from the houses on the coast. We start
               transparent, and then the cloud thickens. All history backs our pane of glass. To
               escape is vain.</p>
            <p>But whether this is the right interpretation of Jacob's gloom as he sat naked, in the
               sun, looking at the Land's End, it is impossible to say; for he never spoke a word.
               Timmy sometimes wondered (only for a second) whether his people bothered him…. No
               matter. There are things that can't be said. Let's shake it off. Let's dry ourselves,
               and take up the first thing that comes handy…. Timmy Durrant's notebook of scientific
               observations.</p>
            <p>"Now…" said Jacob.</p>
            <p>It is a tremendous argument.</p>
            <p>Some people can follow every step of the way, and even take a little one, six inches
               long, by themselves at the end; others remain observant of the external signs.</p>
            <p>The eyes fix themselves upon the poker; the right hand takes the poker and lifts it;
               turns it slowly round, and then, very accurately, replaces it. The left hand, which
               lies on the knee, plays some stately but intermittent piece of march music. A deep
               breath is taken; but allowed to evaporate unused. The cat marches across the
               hearth-rug. No one observes her.</p>
            <p><pb n="79" facs="pageImages/79.png"/>"That's about as near as I can get to it," Durrant wound up.</p>
            <p>The next minute is quiet as the grave.</p>
            <p>"It follows…" said Jacob.</p>
            <p>Only half a sentence followed; but these half-sentences are like flags set on tops of
               buildings to the observer of external sights down below. What was the coast of
               <placeName type="tgn" key="7008116">Cornwall</placeName>, with its violet scents, and mourning emblems, and tranquil piety, but a
               screen happening to hang straight behind as his mind marched up?</p>
            <p>"It follows…" said Jacob.</p>
            <p>"Yes," said Timmy, after reflection. "That is so."</p>
            <p>Now Jacob began plunging about, half to stretch himself, half in a kind of jollity,
               no doubt, for the strangest sound issued from his lips as he furled the sail, rubbed
               the plates—gruff, tuneless—a sort of pasan, for having grasped the argument, for
               being master of the situation, sunburnt, unshaven, capable into the bargain of
               sailing round the world in a ten-ton yacht, which, very likely, he would do one of
               these days instead of settling down in a lawyer's office, and wearing spats.</p>
            <p>"Our friend Masham," said Timmy Durrant, "would rather not be seen in our company as
               we are now." His buttons had come off.</p>
            <p><pb n="80" facs="pageImages/80.png"/>"D'you know Masham's aunt?" said Jacob.</p>
            <p>"Never knew he had one," said Timmy.</p>
            <p>"Masham has millions of aunts," said Jacob.</p>
            <p>"Masham is mentioned in Domesday Book," said Timmy.</p>
            <p>"So are his aunts," said Jacob.</p>
            <p>"His sister," said Timmy, "is a very pretty girl."</p>
            <p>"That's what'll happen to you, Timmy," said Jacob.</p>
            <p>"It'll happen to you first," said Timmy.</p>
            <p>"But this woman I was telling you about—Masham's aunt—"</p>
            <p>"Oh, do get on," said Timmy, for Jacob was laughing so much that he could not
               speak.</p>
            <p>"Masham's aunt…"</p>
            <p>Timmy laughed so much that he could not speak.</p>
            <p>"Masham's aunt…"</p>
            <p>"What is there about Masham that makes one laugh?" said Timmy.</p>
            <p>"Hang it all—a man who swallows his tie-pin," said Jacob.</p>
            <p>"Lord Chancellor before he's fifty," said Timmy.</p>
            <p>"He's a gentleman," said Jacob.</p>
            <p><pb n="81" facs="pageImages/81.png"/>"The Duke of Wellington was a gentleman," said Timmy.</p>
            <p>"Keats wasn't."</p>
            <p>"Lord Salisbury was."</p>
            <p>"And what about God?" said Jacob.</p>
            <p>The <placeName type="tgn" key="7011368">Scilly Isles</placeName> now appeared as if directly pointed at by a golden finger issuing
               from a cloud; and everybody knows how portentous that sight is, and how these broad
               rays, whether they light upon the <placeName type="tgn" key="7011368">Scilly Isles</placeName> or upon the tombs of crusaders in
               cathedrals, always shake the very foundations of scepticism and lead to jokes about
               God.</p>
            <p>/* "Abide with me: Fast falls the eventide; The shadows deepen; Lord, with me abide,"
               */ sang Timmy Durrant.</p>
            <p>"At my place we used to have a hymn which began</p>
            <p>/* Great God, what do I see and hear?" */</p>
            <p>said Jacob.</p>
            <p>Gulls rode gently swaying in little companies of two or three quite near the boat;
               the cormorant, as if following his long strained neck in eternal pursuit, skimmed an
               inch above the water to the next rock; and the drone of the tide in the caves came
               across the water, low, monotonous, <pb n="82" facs="pageImages/82.png"/>like the voice of some one talking to himself.</p>
            <p>/* "Rock of Ages, cleft for me, Let me hide myself in thee," */ sang Jacob.</p>
            <p>Like the blunt tooth of some monster, a rock broke the surface; brown; overflown with
               perpetual waterfalls.</p>
            <p>/* "Rock of Ages," */</p>
            <p>Jacob sang, lying on his back, looking up into the sky at midday, from which every
               shred of cloud had been withdrawn, so that it was like something permanently
               displayed with the cover off.</p>
            <p>By six o'clock a breeze blew in off an icefield; and by seven the water was more
               purple than blue; and by half-past seven there was a patch of rough gold-beater's
               skin round the <placeName type="tgn" key="7011368">Scilly Isles</placeName>, and Durrant's face, as he sat steering, was of the
               colour of a red lacquer box polished for generations. By nine all the fire and
               confusion had gone out of the sky, leaving wedges of apple-green and plates of pale
               yellow; and by ten the lanterns on the boat were making twisted colours upon the
               waves, elongated or squat, as the waves stretched or humped themselves. The beam from
               the lighthouse strode rapidly across the <pb n="83" facs="pageImages/83.png"/>water. Infinite millions of miles away
               powdered stars twinkled; but the waves slapped the boat, and crashed, with regular
               and appalling solemnity, against the rocks.</p>
            <p>Although it would be possible to knock at the cottage door and ask for a glass of
               milk, it is only thirst that would compel the intrusion. Yet perhaps Mrs. Pascoe
               would welcome it. The summer's day may be wearing heavy. Washing in her little
               scullery, she may hear the cheap clock on the mantelpiece tick, tick, tick … tick,
               tick, tick. She is alone in the house. Her husband is out helping Farmer Hosken; her
               daughter married and gone to America. Her elder son is married too, but she does not
               agree with his wife. The Wesleyan minister came along and took the younger boy. She
               is alone in the house. A steamer, probably bound for <placeName type="tgn" key="7008742">Cardiff</placeName>, now crosses the
               horizon, while near at hand one bell of a foxglove swings to and fro with a
               bumble-bee for clapper. These white Cornish cottages are built on the edge of the
               cliff; the garden grows gorse more readily than cabbages; and for hedge, some
               <pb n="84" facs="pageImages/84.png"/>primeval man has piled granite boulders. In one of these, to hold, an historian
               conjectures, the victim's blood, a basin has been hollowed, but in our time it serves
               more tamely to seat those tourists who wish for an uninterrupted view of the
               <placeName type="tgn" key="7450282">Gurnard's Head</placeName>. Not that any one objects to a blue print dress and a white apron in a
               cottage garden.</p>
            <p>"Look—she has to draw her water from a well in the garden."</p>
            <p>"Very lonely it must be in winter, with the wind sweeping over those hills, and the
               waves dashing on the rocks."</p>
            <p>Even on a summer's day you hear them murmuring.</p>
            <p>Having drawn her water, Mrs. Pascoe went in. The tourists regretted that they had
               brought no glasses, so that they might have read the name of the tramp steamer.
               Indeed, it was such a fine day that there was no saying what a pair of field-glasses
               might not have fetched into view. Two fishing luggers, presumably from <placeName type="tgn" key="1113719">St. Ives Bay</placeName>,
               were now sailing in an opposite direction from the steamer, and the floor of the sea
               became alternately clear and opaque. As for the bee, having sucked its fill of honey,
               it visited the teasle and thence made a straight line to Mrs. Pascoe's patch, once
               more directing the tourists' <pb n="85" facs="pageImages/85.png"/>gaze to the old woman's print dress and white apron, for
               she had come to the door of the cottage and was standing there.</p>
            <p>There she stood, shading her eyes and looking out to sea.</p>
            <p>For the millionth time, perhaps, she looked at the sea. A peacock butterfly now
               spread himself upon the teasle, fresh and newly emerged, as the blue and chocolate
               down on his wings testified. Mrs. Pascoe went indoors, fetched a cream pan, came out,
               and stood scouring it. Her face was assuredly not soft, sensual, or lecherous, but
               hard, wise, wholesome rather, signifying in a room full of sophisticated people the
               flesh and blood of life. She would tell a lie, though, as soon as the truth. Behind
               her on the wall hung a large dried skate. Shut up in the parlour she prized mats,
               china mugs, and photographs, though the mouldy little room was saved from the salt
               breeze only by the depth of a brick, and between lace curtains you saw the gannet
               drop like a stone, and on stormy days the gulls came shuddering through the air, and
               the steamers' lights were now high, now deep. Melancholy were the sounds on a
               winter's night.</p>
            <p>The picture papers were delivered punctually on Sunday, and she pored long over Lady
               Cynthia's wedding at the Abbey. She, too, <pb n="86" facs="pageImages/86.png"/>would have liked to ride in a carriage with
               springs. The soft, swift syllables of educated speech often shamed her few rude ones.
               And then all night to hear the grinding of the <placeName type="tgn" key="7014206">Atlantic</placeName> upon the rocks instead of
               hansom cabs and footmen whistling for motor cars…. So she may have dreamed, scouring
               her cream pan. But the talkative, nimble-witted people have taken themselves to
               towns. Like a miser, she has hoarded her feelings within her own breast. Not a penny
               piece has she changed all these years, and, watching her enviously, it seems as if
               all within must be pure gold.</p>
            <p>The wise old woman, having fixed her eyes upon the sea, once more withdrew. The
               tourists decided that it was time to move on to the <placeName type="tgn" key="7450282">Gurnard's Head</placeName>.</p>
            <p>Three seconds later Mrs. Durrant rapped upon the door.</p>
            <p>"Mrs. Pascoe?" she said.</p>
            <p>Rather haughtily, she watched the tourists cross the field path. She came of a
               Highland race, famous for its chieftains.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Pascoe appeared.</p>
            <p><pb n="87" facs="pageImages/87.png"/>"I envy you that bush, Mrs. Pascoe," said Mrs. Durrant, pointing the parasol with
               which she had rapped on the door at the fine clump of St. John's wort that grew
               beside it. Mrs. Pascoe looked at the bush deprecatingly.</p>
            <p>"I expect my son in a day or two," said Mrs. Durrant. "Sailing from <placeName type="tgn" key="7011359">Falmouth</placeName> with a
               friend in a little boat…. Any news of Lizzie yet, Mrs. Pascoe?" Her long-tailed
               ponies stood twitching their ears on the road twenty yards away. The boy, Curnow,
               flicked flies off them occasionally. He saw his mistress go into the cottage; come
               out again; and pass, talking energetically to judge by the movements of her hands,
               round the vegetable plot in front of the cottage. Mrs. Pascoe was his aunt. Both
               women surveyed a bush. Mrs. Durrant stooped and picked a sprig from it. Next she
               pointed (her movements were peremptory; she held herself very upright) at the
               potatoes. They had the blight. All potatoes that year had the blight. Mrs. Durrant
               showed Mrs. Pascoe how bad the blight was on her potatoes. Mrs. Durrant talked
               energetically; Mrs. Pascoe listened submissively. The boy Curnow knew that Mrs.
               Durrant was saying that it is perfectly simple; you mix the powder in a gallon of
               water; "I have done it with my <pb n="88" facs="pageImages/88.png"/>own hands in my own garden," Mrs. Durrant was
               saying.</p>
            <p>"You won't have a potato left—you won't have a potato left," Mrs. Durrant was saying
               in her emphatic voice as they reached the gate. The boy Curnow became as immobile as
               stone.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Durrant took the reins in her hands and settled herself on the driver's
               seat.</p>
            <p>"Take care of that leg, or I shall send the doctor to you," she called back over her
               shoulder; touched the ponies; and the carriage started forward. The boy Curnow had
               only just time to swing himself up by the toe of his boot. The boy Curnow, sitting in
               the middle of the back seat, looked at his aunt.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Pascoe stood at the gate looking after them; stood at the gate till the trap was
               round the corner; stood at the gate, looking now to the right, now to the left; then
               went back to her cottage.</p>
            <p>Soon the ponies attacked the swelling moor road with striving forelegs. Mrs. Durrant
               let the reins fall slackly, and leant backwards. Her vivacity had left her. Her hawk
               nose was thin as a bleached bone through which you almost see the light. Her hands,
               lying on the reins in her lap, were firm even in repose. The upper lip was cut so
               short that it raised itself almost in a <pb n="89" facs="pageImages/89.png"/>sneer from the front teeth. Her mind skimmed
               leagues where Mrs. Pascoe's mind adhered to its solitary patch. Her mind skimmed
               leagues as the ponies climbed the hill road. Forwards and backwards she cast her
               mind, as if the roofless cottages, mounds of slag, and cottage gardens overgrown with
               foxglove and bramble cast shade upon her mind. Arrived at the summit, she stopped the
               carriage. The pale hills were round her, each scattered with ancient stones; beneath
               was the sea, variable as a southern sea; she herself sat there looking from hill to
               sea, upright, aquiline, equally poised between gloom and laughter. Suddenly she
               flicked the ponies so that the boy Curnow had to swing himself up by the toe of his
               boot.</p>
            <p>The rooks settled; the rooks rose. The trees which they touched so capriciously
               seemed insufficient to lodge their numbers. The tree-tops sang with the breeze in
               them; the branches creaked audibly and dropped now and then, though the season was
               midsummer, husks or twigs. Up went the rooks and down again, rising in lesser numbers
               each time as the sager <pb n="90" facs="pageImages/90.png"/>birds made ready to settle, for the evening was already spent
               enough to make the air inside the wood almost dark. The moss was soft; the
               tree-trunks spectral. Beyond them lay a silvery meadow. The pampas grass raised its
               feathery spears from mounds of green at the end of the meadow. A breadth of water
               gleamed. Already the convolvulus moth was spinning over the flowers. Orange and
               purple, nasturtium and cherry pie, were washed into the twilight, but the tobacco
               plant and the passion flower, over which the great moth spun, were white as china.
               The rooks creaked their wings together on the tree-tops, and were settling down for
               sleep when, far off, a familiar sound shook and trembled—increased —fairly dinned in
               their ears—scared sleepy wings into the air again—the dinner bell at the house.</p>
            <p>After six days of salt wind, rain, and sun, Jacob Flanders had put on a dinner
               jacket. The discreet black object had made its appearance now and then in the boat
               among tins, pickles, preserved meats, and as the voyage went on had become more and
               more irrelevant, hardly to be <pb n="91" facs="pageImages/91.png"/>believed in. And now, the world being stable, lit by
               candle-light, the dinner jacket alone preserved him. He could not be sufficiently
               thankful. Even so his neck, wrists, and face were exposed without cover, and his
               whole person, whether exposed or not, tingled and glowed so as to make even black
               cloth an imperfect screen. He drew back the great red hand that lay on the
               table-cloth. Surreptitiously it closed upon slim glasses and curved silver forks. The
               bones of the cutlets were decorated with pink frills-and yesterday he had gnawn ham
               from the bone! Opposite him were hazy, semi-transparent shapes of yellow and blue.
               Behind them, again, was the grey-green garden, and among the pear-shaped leaves of
               the escallonia fishing-boats seemed caught and suspended. A sailing ship slowly drew
               past the women's backs. Two or three figures crossed the terrace hastily in the dusk.
               The door opened and shut. Nothing settled or stayed unbroken. Like oars rowing now
               this side, now that, were the sentences that came now here, now there, from either
               side of the table.</p>
            <p>"Oh, Clara, Clara!" exclaimed Mrs. Durrant, and Timothy Durrant adding, "Clara,
               Clara," Jacob named the shape in yellow gauze Timothy's sister, Clara. The girl sat
               smiling and flushed. <pb n="92" facs="pageImages/92.png"/>With her brother's dark eyes, she was vaguer and softer than he
               was. When the laugh died down she said: "But, mother, it was true. He said so, didn't
               he? Miss Eliot agreed with us…."</p>
            <p>But Miss Eliot, tall, grey-headed, was making room beside her for the old man who had
               come in from the terrace. The dinner would never end, Jacob thought, and he did not
               wish it to end, though the ship had sailed from one corner of the window-frame to the
               other, and a light marked the end of the pier. He saw Mrs. Durrant gaze at the light.
               She turned to him.</p>
            <p>"Did you take command, or Timothy?" she said. "Forgive me if I call you Jacob. I've
               heard so much of you." Then her eyes went back to the sea. Her eyes glazed as she
               looked at the view. "A little village once," she said, "and now grown…." She rose,
               taking her napkin with her, and stood by the window.</p>
            <p>"Did you quarrel with Timothy?" Clara asked shyly. "I should have."</p>
            <p>Mrs. Durrant came back from the window.</p>
            <p>"It gets later and later," she said, sitting upright, and looking down the table.
               "You ought to be ashamed—all of you. Mr. Clutterbuck, <pb n="93" facs="pageImages/93.png"/>you ought to be ashamed." She
               raised her voice, for Mr. Clutterbuck was deaf.</p>
            <p>"We ARE ashamed," said a girl. But the old man with the beard went on eating plum
               tart. Mrs. Durrant laughed and leant back in her chair, as if indulging him.</p>
            <p>"We put it to you, Mrs. Durrant," said a young man with thick spectacles and a fiery
               moustache. "I say the conditions were fulfilled. She owes me a sovereign."</p>
            <p>"Not BEFORE the fish—with it, Mrs. Durrant," said Charlotte Wilding.</p>
            <p>"That was the bet; with the fish," said Clara seriously. "Begonias, mother. To eat
               them with his fish."</p>
            <p>"Oh dear," said Mrs. Durrant.</p>
            <p>"Charlotte won't pay you," said Timothy.</p>
            <p>"How dare you …" said Charlotte.</p>
            <p>"That privilege will be mine," said the courtly Mr. Wortley, producing a silver case
               primed with sovereigns and slipping one coin on to the table. Then Mrs. Durrant got
               up and passed down the room, holding herself very straight, and the girls in yellow
               and blue and silver gauze followed her, and elderly Miss Eliot in her velvet; and a
               little rosy woman, hesitating at the door, clean, scrupulous, probably a governess.
               All passed out at the open door.</p>
            <p><pb n="94" facs="pageImages/94.png"/>"When you are as old as I am, Charlotte," said Mrs. Durrant, drawing the girl's arm
               within hers as they paced up and down the terrace.</p>
            <p>"Why are you so sad?" Charlotte asked impulsively.</p>
            <p>"Do I seem to you sad? I hope not," said Mrs. Durrant.</p>
            <p>"Well, just now. You're NOT old."</p>
            <p>"Old enough to be Timothy's mother." They stopped.</p>
            <p>Miss Eliot was looking through Mr. Clutterbuck's telescope at the edge of the
               terrace. The deaf old man stood beside her, fondling his beard, and reciting the
               names of the constellations: "Andromeda, Bootes, Sidonia, Cassiopeia…."</p>
            <p>"Andromeda," murmured Miss Eliot, shifting the telescope slightly.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Durrant and Charlotte looked along the barrel of the instrument pointed at the
               skies.</p>
            <p>"There are MILLIONS of stars," said Charlotte with conviction. Miss Eliot turned away
               from the telescope. The young men laughed suddenly in the dining-room.</p>
            <p>"Let ME look," said Charlotte eagerly.</p>
            <p>"The stars bore me," said Mrs. Durrant, walking down the terrace with Julia Eliot. "I
               <pb n="95" facs="pageImages/95.png"/>read a book once about the stars…. What are they saying?" She stopped in front of the
               dining-room window. "Timothy," she noted.</p>
            <p>"The silent young man," said Miss Eliot.</p>
            <p>"Yes, Jacob Flanders," said Mrs. Durrant.</p>
            <p>"Oh, mother! I didn't recognize you!" exclaimed Clara Durrant, coming from the
               opposite direction with Elsbeth. "How delicious," she breathed, crushing a verbena
               leaf.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Durrant turned and walked away by herself.</p>
            <p>"Clara!" she called. Clara went to her.</p>
            <p>"How unlike they are!" said Miss Eliot.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wortley passed them, smoking a cigar.</p>
            <p>"Every day I live I find myself agreeing …" he said as he passed them.</p>
            <p>"It's so interesting to guess …" murmured Julia Eliot.</p>
            <p>"When first we came out we could see the flowers in that bed," said Elsbeth. "We see
               very little now," said Miss Eliot.</p>
            <p>"She must have been so beautiful, and everybody loved her, of course," said
               Charlotte. "I suppose Mr. Wortley …" she paused.</p>
            <p>"Edward's death was a tragedy," said Miss Eliot decidedly.</p>
            <p>Here Mr. Erskine joined them.</p>
            <p>"There's no such thing as silence," he said <pb n="96" facs="pageImages/96.png"/>positively. "I can hear twenty different
               sounds on a night like this without counting your voices."</p>
            <p>"Make a bet of it?" said Charlotte.</p>
            <p>"Done," said Mr. Erskine. "One, the sea; two, the wind; three, a dog; four …"</p>
            <p>The others passed on.</p>
            <p>"Poor Timothy," said Elsbeth.</p>
            <p>"A very fine night," shouted Miss Eliot into Mr. Clutterbuck's ear.</p>
            <p>"Like to look at the stars?" said the old man, turning the telescope towards
               Elsbeth.</p>
            <p>"Doesn't it make you melancholy—looking at the stars?" shouted Miss Eliot. "Dear me
               no, dear me no," Mr. Clutterbuck chuckled when he understood her. "Why should it make
               me melancholy? Not for a moment—dear me no."</p>
            <p>"Thank you, Timothy, but I'm coming in," said Miss Eliot. "Elsbeth, here's a
               shawl."</p>
            <p>"I'm coming in," Elsbeth murmured with her eye to the telescope. "Cassiopeia," she
               murmured. "Where are you all?" she asked, taking her eye away from the telescope.
               "How dark it is!"</p>
            <p>Mrs. Durrant sat in the drawing-room by a lamp winding a ball of wool. Mr.
               Clutterbuck <pb n="97" facs="pageImages/97.png"/>read the Times. In the distance stood a second lamp, and round it sat the
               young ladies, flashing scissors over silver-spangled stuff for private theatricals.
               Mr. Wortley read a book.</p>
            <p>"Yes; he is perfectly right," said Mrs. Durrant, drawing herself up and ceasing to
               wind her wool. And while Mr. Clutterbuck read the rest of Lord Lansdowne's speech she
               sat upright, without touching her ball.</p>
            <p>"Ah, Mr. Flanders," she said, speaking proudly, as if to Lord Lansdowne himself. Then
               she sighed and began to wind her wool again.</p>
            <p>"Sit THERE," she said.</p>
            <p>Jacob came out from the dark place by the window where he had hovered. The light
               poured over him, illuminating every cranny of his skin; but not a muscle of his face
               moved as he sat looking out into the garden.</p>
            <p>"I want to hear about your voyage," said Mrs. Durrant.</p>
            <p>"Yes," he said.</p>
            <p>"Twenty years ago we did the same thing."</p>
            <p>"Yes," he said. She looked at him sharply.</p>
            <p>"He is extraordinarily awkward," she thought, noticing how he fingered his socks.
               "Yet so distinguished-looking."</p>
            <p>"In those days …" she resumed, and told him how they had sailed … "my husband, <pb n="98" facs="pageImages/98.png"/>who
               knew a good deal about sailing, for he kept a yacht before we married" … and then how
               rashly they had defied the fishermen, "almost paid for it with our lives, but so
               proud of ourselves!" She flung the hand out that held the ball of wool.</p>
            <p>"Shall I hold your wool?" Jacob asked stiffly.</p>
            <p>"You do that for your mother," said Mrs. Durrant, looking at him again keenly, as she
               transferred the skein. "Yes, it goes much better."</p>
            <p>He smiled; but said nothing.</p>
            <p>Elsbeth Siddons hovered behind them with something silver on her arm.</p>
            <p>"We want," she said…. "I've come …" she paused.</p>
            <p>"Poor Jacob," said Mrs. Durrant, quietly, as if she had known him all his life.
               "They're going to make you act in their play."</p>
            <p>"How I love you!" said Elsbeth, kneeling beside Mrs. Durrant's chair.</p>
            <p>"Give me the wool," said Mrs. Durrant.</p>
            <p>"He's come—he's come!" cried Charlotte Wilding. "I've won my bet!"</p>
            <p><pb n="99" facs="pageImages/99.png"/>"There's another bunch higher up," murmured Clara Durrant, mounting another step of
               the ladder. Jacob held the ladder as she stretched out to reach the grapes high up on
               the vine.</p>
            <p>"There!" she said, cutting through the stalk. She looked semi-transparent, pale,
               wonderfully beautiful up there among the vine leaves and the yellow and purple
               bunches, the lights swimming over her in coloured islands. Geraniums and begonias
               stood in pots along planks; tomatoes climbed the walls.</p>
            <p>"The leaves really want thinning," she considered, and one green one, spread like the
               palm of a hand, circled down past Jacob's head.</p>
            <p>"I have more than I can eat already," he said, looking up.</p>
            <p>"It does seem absurd …" Clara began, "going back to <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName>…."</p>
            <p>"Ridiculous," said Jacob, firmly.</p>
            <p>"Then …" said Clara, "you must come next year, properly," she said, snipping another
               vine leaf, rather at random.</p>
            <p>"If … if …"</p>
            <p>A child ran past the greenhouse shouting. Clara slowly descended the ladder with her
               basket of grapes.</p>
            <p><pb n="100" facs="pageImages/100.png"/>"One bunch of white, and two of purple," she said, and she placed two great leaves
               over them where they lay curled warm in the basket.</p>
            <p>"I have enjoyed myself," said Jacob, looking down the greenhouse.</p>
            <p>"Yes, it's been delightful," she said vaguely.</p>
            <p>"Oh, Miss Durrant," he said, taking the basket of grapes; but she walked past him
               towards the door of the greenhouse.</p>
            <p>"You're too good—too good," she thought, thinking of Jacob, thinking that he must not
               say that he loved her. No, no, no.</p>
            <p>The children were whirling past the door, throwing things high into the air.</p>
            <p>"Little demons!" she cried. "What have they got?" she asked Jacob.</p>
            <p>"Onions, I think," said Jacob. He looked at them without moving.</p>
            <p>"Next August, remember, Jacob," said Mrs. Durrant, shaking hands with him on the
               terrace where the fuchsia hung, like a scarlet ear-ring, behind her head. Mr. Wortley
               came out of the window in yellow slippers, trailing the Times and holding out his
               hand very cordially.</p>
            <p><pb n="101" facs="pageImages/101.png"/>"Good-bye," said Jacob. "Good-bye," he repeated. "Good-bye," he said once more.
               Charlotte Wilding flung up her bedroom window and cried out: "Good-bye, Mr.
               Jacob!"</p>
            <p>"Mr. Flanders!" cried Mr. Clutterbuck, trying to extricate himself from his beehive
               chair. "Jacob Flanders!"</p>
            <p>"Too late, Joseph," said Mrs. Durrant.</p>
            <p>"Not to sit for me," said Miss Eliot, planting her tripod upon the lawn.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="chapter" n="5">
            <head type="sub">V</head>
            <p><pb n="102" facs="pageImages/102.png"/>"I rather think," said Jacob, taking his pipe from his mouth, "it's in Virgil," and
               pushing back his chair, he went to the window. The rashest drivers in the world are,
               certainly, the drivers of post-office vans. Swinging down Lamb's Conduit Street, the
               scarlet van rounded the corner by the pillar box in such a way as to graze the kerb
               and make the little girl who was standing on tiptoe to post a letter look up, half
               frightened, half curious. She paused with her hand in the mouth of the box; then
               dropped her letter and ran away. It is seldom only that we see a child on tiptoe with
               pity—more often a dim discomfort, a grain of sand in the shoe which it's scarcely
               worth while to remove—that's our feeling, and so—Jacob turned to the bookcase.</p>
            <p>Long ago great people lived here, and coming back from Court past midnight stood,
               huddling their satin skirts, under the carved door-posts while the footman roused
               himself from his mattress <pb n="103" facs="pageImages/103.png"/>on the floor, hurriedly fastened the lower buttons of his
               waistcoat, and let them in. The bitter eighteenth-century rain rushed down the
               kennel. Southampton Row, however, is chiefly remarkable nowadays for the fact that
               you will always find a man there trying to sell a tortoise to a tailor. "Showing off
               the tweed, sir; what the gentry wants is something singular to catch the eye, sir—and
               clean in their habits, sir!" So they display their tortoises.</p>
            <p>At Mudie's corner in Oxford Street all the red and blue beads had run together on the
               string. The motor omnibuses were locked. Mr. Spalding going to the city looked at Mr.
               Charles Budgeon bound for <placeName type="tgn" key="4012707">Shepherd's Bush</placeName>. The proximity of the omnibuses gave the
               outside passengers an opportunity to stare into each other's faces. Yet few took
               advantage of it. Each had his own business to think of. Each had his past shut in him
               like the leaves of a book known to him by heart; and his friends could only read the
               title, James Spalding, or Charles Budgeon, and the passengers going the opposite way
               could read nothing at all—save "a man with a red moustache," "a young man in grey
               smoking a pipe." The October sunlight rested upon all these men and women sitting
               immobile; and little Johnnie Sturgeon took the chance to swing <pb n="104" facs="pageImages/104.png"/>down the staircase,
               carrying his large mysterious parcel, and so dodging a zigzag course between the
               wheels he reached the pavement, started to whistle a tune and was soon out of
               sight—for ever. The omnibuses jerked on, and every single person felt relief at being
               a little nearer to his journey's end, though some cajoled themselves past the
               immediate engagement by promise of indulgence beyond—steak and kidney pudding, drink
               or a game of dominoes in the smoky corner of a city restaurant. Oh yes, human life is
               very tolerable on the top of an omnibus in Holborn, when the policeman holds up his
               arm and the sun beats on your back, and if there is such a thing as a shell secreted
               by man to fit man himself here we find it, on the banks of the <placeName type="tgn" key="7011913">Thames</placeName>, where the
               great streets join and <placeName type="tgn" key="1100093">St. Paul's Cathedral</placeName>, like the volute on the top of the snail
               shell, finishes it off. Jacob, getting off his omnibus, loitered up the steps,
               consulted his watch, and finally made up his mind to go in…. Does it need an effort?
               Yes. These changes of mood wear us out.</p>
            <p>Dim it is, haunted by ghosts of white marble, to whom the organ for ever chaunts. If
               a boot creaks, it's awful; then the order; the discipline. The verger with his rod
               has life ironed out beneath him. Sweet and holy are the angelic choristers. And for
               ever round the marble shoulders, in and <pb n="105" facs="pageImages/105.png"/>out of the folded fingers, go the thin high
               sounds of voice and organ. For ever requiem—repose. Tired with scrubbing the steps of
               the Prudential Society's office, which she did year in year out, Mrs. Lidgett took
               her seat beneath the great Duke's tomb, folded her hands, and half closed her eyes. A
               magnificent place for an old woman to rest in, by the very side of the great Duke's
               bones, whose victories mean nothing to her, whose name she knows not, though she
               never fails to greet the little angels opposite, as she passes out, wishing the like
               on her own tomb, for the leathern curtain of the heart has flapped wide, and out
               steal on tiptoe thoughts of rest, sweet melodies…. Old Spicer, jute merchant, thought
               nothing of the kind though. Strangely enough he'd never been in St. Paul's these
               fifty years, though his office windows looked on the churchyard. "So that's all?
               Well, a gloomy old place…. Where's Nelson's tomb? No time now—come again—a coin to
               leave in the box…. Rain or fine is it? Well, if it would only make up its mind!" Idly
               the children stray in—the verger dissuades them—and another and another … man, woman,
               man, woman, boy … casting their eyes up, pursing their lips, the same shadow brushing
               the same faces; the leathern curtain of the heart flaps wide.</p>
            <p><pb n="106" facs="pageImages/106.png"/>Nothing could appear more certain from the steps of St. Paul's than that each person
               is miraculously provided with coat, skirt, and boots; an income; an object. Only
               Jacob, carrying in his hand Finlay's Byzantine Empire, which he had bought in Ludgate
               Hill, looked a little different; for in his hand he carried a book, which book he
               would at nine-thirty precisely, by his own fireside, open and study, as no one else
               of all these multitudes would do. They have no houses. The streets belong to them;
               the shops; the churches; theirs the innumerable desks; the stretched office lights;
               the vans are theirs, and the railway slung high above the street. If you look closer
               you will see that three elderly men at a little distance from each other run spiders
               along the pavement as if the street were their parlour, and here, against the wall, a
               woman stares at nothing, boot-laces extended, which she does not ask you to buy. The
               posters are theirs too; and the news on them. A town destroyed; a race won. A
               homeless people, circling beneath the sky whose blue or white is held off by a
               ceiling cloth of steel filings and horse dung shredded to dust.</p>
            <p>There, under the green shade, with his head bent over white paper, Mr. Sibley
               transferred figures to folios, and upon each desk you observe, <pb n="107" facs="pageImages/107.png"/>like provender, a
               bunch of papers, the day's nutriment, slowly consumed by the industrious pen.
               Innumerable overcoats of the quality prescribed hung empty all day in the corridors,
               but as the clock struck six each was exactly filled, and the little figures, split
               apart into trousers or moulded into a single thickness, jerked rapidly with angular
               forward motion along the pavement; then dropped into darkness. Beneath the pavement,
               sunk in the earth, hollow drains lined with yellow light for ever conveyed them this
               way and that, and large letters upon enamel plates represented in the underworld the
               parks, squares, and circuses of the upper. "Marble Arch—<placeName type="tgn" key="4012707">Shepherd's Bush</placeName>"—to the
               majority the Arch and the Bush are eternally white letters upon a blue ground. Only
               at one point—it may be Acton, Holloway, Kensal Rise, Caledonian Road—does the name
               mean shops where you buy things, and houses, in one of which, down to the right,
               where the pollard trees grow out of the paving stones, there is a square curtained
               window, and a bedroom.</p>
            <p>Long past sunset an old blind woman sat on a camp-stool with her back to the stone
               wall of the Union of <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName> and Smith's Bank, clasping a brown mongrel tight in her
               arms and singing out loud, not for coppers, no, from the depths <pb n="108" facs="pageImages/108.png"/>of her gay wild
               heart—her sinful, tanned heart—for the child who fetches her is the fruit of sin, and
               should have been in bed, curtained, asleep, instead of hearing in the lamplight her
               mother's wild song, where she sits against the Bank, singing not for coppers, with
               her dog against her breast.</p>
            <p>Home they went. The grey church spires received them; the hoary city, old, sinful,
               and majestic. One behind another, round or pointed, piercing the sky or massing
               themselves, like sailing ships, like granite cliffs, spires and offices, wharves and
               factories crowd the bank; eternally the pilgrims trudge; barges rest in mid stream
               heavy laden; as some believe, the city loves her prostitutes.</p>
            <p>But few, it seems, are admitted to that degree. Of all the carriages that leave the
               arch of the Opera House, not one turns eastward, and when the little thief is caught
               in the empty market-place no one in black-and-white or rose-coloured evening dress
               blocks the way by pausing with a hand upon the carriage door to help or
               condemn—though Lady Charles, to do her justice, sighs sadly as she ascends her
               staircase, takes down Thomas a Kempis, and does not sleep till her mind has lost
               itself tunnelling into the complexity of things. "Why? Why? Why?" she sighs. <pb n="109" facs="pageImages/109.png"/>On the
               whole it's best to walk back from the Opera House. Fatigue is the safest sleeping
               draught.</p>
            <p>The autumn season was in full swing. Tristan was twitching his rug up under his
               armpits twice a week; Isolde waved her scarf in miraculous sympathy with the
               conductor's baton. In all parts of the house were to be found pink faces and
               glittering breasts. When a Royal hand attached to an invisible body slipped out and
               withdrew the red and white bouquet reposing on the scarlet ledge, the Queen of
               England seemed a name worth dying for. Beauty, in its hothouse variety (which is none
               of the worst), flowered in box after box; and though nothing was said of profound
               importance, and though it is generally agreed that wit deserted beautiful lips about
               the time that Walpole died—at any rate when Victoria in her nightgown descended to
               meet her ministers, the lips (through an opera glass) remained red, adorable. Bald
               distinguished men with gold-headed canes strolled down the crimson avenues between
               the stalls, and only broke from intercourse with the boxes when the lights went down,
               and the conductor, first bowing to the Queen, next to the bald-headed men, swept
               round on his feet and raised his wand.</p>
            <p><pb n="110" facs="pageImages/110.png"/>Then two thousand hearts in the semi-darkness remembered, anticipated, travelled dark
               labyrinths; and Clara Durrant said farewell to Jacob Flanders, and tasted the
               sweetness of death in effigy; and Mrs. Durrant, sitting behind her in the dark of the
               box, sighed her sharp sigh; and Mr. Wortley, shifting his position behind the Italian
               Ambassador's wife, thought that Brangaena was a trifle hoarse; and suspended in the
               gallery many feet above their heads, Edward Whittaker surreptitiously held a torch to
               his miniature score; and … and …</p>
            <p>In short, the observer is choked with observations. Only to prevent us from being
               submerged by chaos, nature and society between them have arranged a system of
               classification which is simplicity itself; stalls, boxes, amphitheatre, gallery. The
               moulds are filled nightly. There is no need to distinguish details. But the
               difficulty remains—one has to choose. For though I have no wish to be Queen of
               England or only for a moment—I would willingly sit beside her; I would hear the Prime
               Minister's gossip; the countess whisper, and share her memories of halls and gardens;
               the massive fronts of the respectable conceal after all their secret code; or why so
               impermeable? And then, doffing one's own headpiece, how strange <pb n="111" facs="pageImages/111.png"/>to assume for a
               moment some one's—any one's—to be a man of valour who has ruled the Empire; to refer
               while Brangaena sings to the fragments of Sophocles, or see in a flash, as the
               shepherd pipes his tune, bridges and aqueducts. But no—we must choose. Never was
               there a harsher necessity! or one which entails greater pain, more certain disaster;
               for wherever I seat myself, I die in exile: Whittaker in his lodging-house; Lady
               Charles at the Manor.</p>
            <p>A young man with a Wellington nose, who had occupied a seven-and-sixpenny seat, made
               his way down the stone stairs when the opera ended, as if he were still set a little
               apart from his fellows by the influence of the music.</p>
            <p>At midnight Jacob Flanders heard a rap on his door.</p>
            <p>"By Jove!" he exclaimed. "You're the very man I want!" and without more ado they
               discovered the lines which he had been seeking all day; only they come not in Virgil,
               but in Lucretius.</p>
            <p><pb n="112" facs="pageImages/112.png"/>"Yes; that should make him sit up," said Bonamy, as Jacob stopped reading. Jacob was
               excited. It was the first time he had read his essay aloud.</p>
            <p>"Damned swine!" he said, rather too extravagantly; but the praise had gone to his
               head. Professor Bulteel, of Leeds, had issued an edition of Wycherley without stating
               that he had left out, disembowelled, or indicated only by asterisks, several indecent
               words and some indecent phrases. An outrage, Jacob said; a breach of faith; sheer
               prudery; token of a lewd mind and a disgusting nature. Aristophanes and Shakespeare
               were cited. Modern life was repudiated. Great play was made with the professional
               title, and Leeds as a seat of learning was laughed to scorn. And the extraordinary
               thing was that these young men were perfectly right—extraordinary, because, even as
               Jacob copied his pages, he knew that no one would ever print them; and sure enough
               back they came from the Fortnightly, the Contemporary, the Nineteenth Century—when
               Jacob threw them into the black wooden box where he kept his mother's letters, his
               old flannel trousers, and a note or two with the Cornish postmark. The lid shut upon
               the truth.</p>
            <p><pb n="113" facs="pageImages/113.png"/>This black wooden box, upon which his name was still legible in white paint, stood
               between the long windows of the sitting-room. The street ran beneath. No doubt the
               bedroom was behind. The furniture—three wicker chairs and a gate-legged table—came
               from <placeName type="tgn" key="7010874">Cambridge</placeName>. These houses (Mrs. Garfit's daughter, Mrs. Whitehorn, was the
               landlady of this one) were built, say, a hundred and fifty years ago. The rooms are
               shapely, the ceilings high; over the doorway a rose, or a ram's skull, is carved in
               the wood. The eighteenth century has its distinction. Even the panels, painted in
               raspberry-coloured paint, have their distinction….</p>
            <p>"Distinction"—Mrs. Durrant said that Jacob Flanders was "distinguished-looking."
               "Extremely awkward," she said, "but so distinguished-looking." Seeing him for the
               first time that no doubt is the word for him. Lying back in his chair, taking his
               pipe from his lips, and saying to Bonamy: "About this opera now" (for they had done
               with indecency). "This fellow Wagner" … distinction was one of the words to use
               naturally, though, from looking at him, one would have found it difficult to say
               which seat in the opera house was his, stalls, gallery, or dress circle. A writer? He
               lacked self-consciousness. A painter? There was <pb n="114" facs="pageImages/114.png"/>something in the shape of his hands
               (he was descended on his mother's side from a family of the greatest antiquity and
               deepest obscurity) which indicated taste. Then his mouth—but surely, of all futile
               occupations this of cataloguing features is the worst. One word is sufficient. But if
               one cannot find it?</p>
            <p>"I like Jacob Flanders," wrote Clara Durrant in her diary. "He is so unworldly. He
               gives himself no airs, and one can say what one likes to him, though he's frightening
               because …" But Mr. Letts allows little space in his shilling diaries. Clara was not
               the one to encroach upon Wednesday. Humblest, most candid of women! "No, no, no," she
               sighed, standing at the greenhouse door, "don't break—don't spoil"—what? Something
               infinitely wonderful.</p>
            <p>But then, this is only a young woman's language, one, too, who loves, or refrains
               from loving. She wished the moment to continue for ever precisely as it was that July
               morning. And moments don't. Now, for instance, Jacob was telling a story about some
               walking tour he'd taken, and the inn was called "The Foaming Pot," which, considering
               the landlady's name<pb n="115" facs="pageImages/115.png"/> … They shouted with laughter. The joke was indecent.</p>
            <p>Then Julia Eliot said "the silent young man," and as she dined with Prime Ministers,
               no doubt she meant: "If he is going to get on in the world, he will have to find his
               tongue."</p>
            <p>Timothy Durrant never made any comment at all.</p>
            <p>The housemaid found herself very liberally rewarded.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sopwith's opinion was as sentimental as Clara's, though far more skilfully
               expressed.</p>
            <p>Betty Flanders was romantic about Archer and tender about John; she was unreasonably
               irritated by Jacob's clumsiness in the house.</p>
            <p>Captain Barfoot liked him best of the boys; but as for saying why …</p>
            <p>It seems then that men and women are equally at fault. It seems that a profound,
               impartial, and absolutely just opinion of our fellow-creatures is utterly unknown.
               Either we are men, or we are women. Either we are cold, or we are sentimental. Either
               we are young, or growing old. In any case life is but a procession of shadows, and
               God knows why it is that we embrace them so eagerly, and see them depart with such
               anguish, being shadows. And why, if this—and much more than this is true, why are we
               <pb n="116" facs="pageImages/116.png"/>yet surprised in the window corner by a sudden vision that the young man in the chair
               is of all things in the world the most real, the most solid, the best known to us—why
               indeed? For the moment after we know nothing about him.</p>
            <p>Such is the manner of our seeing. Such the conditions of our love.</p>
            <p>("I'm twenty-two. It's nearly the end of October. Life is thoroughly pleasant,
               although unfortunately there are a great number of fools about. One must apply
               oneself to something or other—God knows what. Everything is really very jolly—except
               getting up in the morning and wearing a tail coat.")</p>
            <p>"I say, Bonamy, what about Beethoven?"</p>
            <p>("Bonamy is an amazing fellow. He knows practically everything—not more about English
               literature than I do—but then he's read all those Frenchmen.")</p>
            <p>"I rather suspect you're talking rot, Bonamy. In spite of what you say, poor old
               Tennyson…."</p>
            <p>("The truth is one ought to have been taught French. Now, I suppose, old Barfoot is
               talking to my mother. That's an odd affair to be sure. <pb n="117" facs="pageImages/117.png"/>But I can't see Bonamy down
               there. Damn <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName>!") for the market carts were lumbering down the street.</p>
            <p>"What about a walk on Saturday?"</p>
            <p>("What's happening on Saturday?")</p>
            <p>Then, taking out his pocket-book, he assured himself that the night of the Durrants'
               party came next week.</p>
            <p>But though all this may very well be true—so Jacob thought and spoke—so he crossed
               his legs—filled his pipe—sipped his whisky, and once looked at his pocket-book,
               rumpling his hair as he did so, there remains over something which can never be
               conveyed to a second person save by Jacob himself. Moreover, part of this is not
               Jacob but Richard Bonamy—the room; the market carts; the hour; the very moment of
               history. Then consider the effect of sex—how between man and woman it hangs wavy,
               tremulous, so that here's a valley, there's a peak, when in truth, perhaps, all's as
               flat as my hand. Even the exact words get the wrong accent on them. But something is
               always impelling one to hum vibrating, like the hawk moth, at the mouth of the cavern
               of mystery, endowing Jacob Flanders with all sorts of qualities he had not at all—for
               though, certainly, he sat talking to Bonamy, half of what he said was too dull to
               repeat; much <pb n="118" facs="pageImages/118.png"/>unintelligible (about unknown people and Parliament); what remains is
               mostly a matter of guess work. Yet over him we hang vibrating.</p>
            <p>"Yes," said Captain Barfoot, knocking out his pipe on Betty Flanders's hob, and
               buttoning his coat. "It doubles the work, but I don't mind that."</p>
            <p>He was now town councillor. They looked at the night, which was the same as the
               <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName> night, only a good deal more transparent. Church bells down in the town were
               striking eleven o'clock. The wind was off the sea. And all the bedroom windows were
               dark—the Pages were asleep; the Garfits were asleep; the Cranches were asleep—whereas
               in <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName> at this hour they were burning Guy Fawkes on Parliament Hill.</p>

            <head type="sub">VI</head>
            <p><pb n="119" facs="pageImages/119.png"/>The flames had fairly caught.</p>
            <p>"There's St. Paul's!" some one cried.</p>
            <p>As the wood caught the city of <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName> was lit up for a second; on other sides of the
               fire there were trees. Of the faces which came out fresh and vivid as though painted
               in yellow and red, the most prominent was a girl's face. By a trick of the firelight
               she seemed to have no body. The oval of the face and hair hung beside the fire with a
               dark vacuum for background. As if dazed by the glare, her green-blue eyes stared at
               the flames. Every muscle of her face was taut. There was something tragic in her thus
               staring—her age between twenty and twenty-five.</p>
            <p>A hand descending from the chequered darkness thrust on her head the conical white
               hat of a pierrot. Shaking her head, she still stared. A whiskered face appeared above
               her. They dropped two legs of a table upon the fire and a <pb n="120" facs="pageImages/120.png"/>scattering of twigs and
               leaves. All this blazed up and showed faces far back, round, pale, smooth, bearded,
               some with billycock hats on; all intent; showed too St. Paul's floating on the uneven
               white mist, and two or three narrow, paper-white, extinguisher-shaped spires.</p>
            <p>The flames were struggling through the wood and roaring up when, goodness knows where
               from, pails flung water in beautiful hollow shapes, as of polished tortoiseshell;
               flung again and again; until the hiss was like a swarm of bees; and all the faces
               went out.</p>
            <p>"Oh Jacob," said the girl, as they pounded up the hill in the dark, "I'm so
               frightfully unhappy!"</p>
            <p>Shouts of laughter came from the others—high, low; some before, others after.</p>
            <p>The hotel dining-room was brightly lit. A stag's head in plaster was at one end of
               the table; at the other some Roman bust blackened and reddened to represent Guy
               Fawkes, whose night it was. The diners were linked together by lengths of paper
               roses, so that when it came to singing "Auld Lang Syne" with their hands crossed a
               pink and yellow line rose and fell the entire length of the table. There was an
               enormous tapping of green wine-glasses. A young man stood up, and Florinda, taking
               one of the purplish <pb n="121" facs="pageImages/121.png"/>globes that lay on the table, flung it straight at his head. It
               crushed to powder.</p>
            <p>"I'm so frightfully unhappy!" she said, turning to Jacob, who sat beside her.</p>
            <p>The table ran, as if on invisible legs, to the side of the room, and a barrel organ
               decorated with a red cloth and two pots of paper flowers reeled out waltz music.</p>
            <p>Jacob could not dance. He stood against the wall smoking a pipe.</p>
            <p>"We think," said two of the dancers, breaking off from the rest, and bowing
               profoundly before him, "that you are the most beautiful man we have ever seen."</p>
            <p>So they wreathed his head with paper flowers. Then somebody brought out a white and
               gilt chair and made him sit on it. As they passed, people hung glass grapes on his
               shoulders, until he looked like the figure-head of a wrecked ship. Then Florinda got
               upon his knee and hid her face in his waistcoat. With one hand he held her; with the
               other, his pipe.</p>
            <p>"Now let us talk," said Jacob, as he walked down Haverstock Hill between four and
               five <pb n="122" facs="pageImages/122.png"/>o'clock in the morning of November the sixth arm-in-arm with Timmy Durrant,
               "about something sensible."</p>
            <p>The Greeks—yes, that was what they talked about—how when all's said and done, when
               one's rinsed one's mouth with every literature in the world, including Chinese and
               Russian (but these Slavs aren't civilized), it's the flavour of Greek that remains.
               Durrant quoted Aeschylus—Jacob Sophocles. It is true that no Greek could have
               understood or professor refrained from pointing out—Never mind; what is Greek for if
               not to be shouted on Haverstock Hill in the dawn? Moreover, Durrant never listened to
               Sophocles, nor Jacob to Aeschylus. They were boastful, triumphant; it seemed to both
               that they had read every book in the world; known every sin, passion, and joy.
               Civilizations stood round them like flowers ready for picking. Ages lapped at their
               feet like waves fit for sailing. And surveying all this, looming through the fog, the
               lamplight, the shades of <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName>, the two young men decided in favour of <placeName type="tgn" key="1000074">Greece</placeName>.</p>
            <p>"Probably," said Jacob, "we are the only people in the world who know what the Greeks
               meant."</p>
            <p><pb n="123" facs="pageImages/123.png"/>They drank coffee at a stall where the urns were burnished and little lamps burnt
               along the counter.</p>
            <p>Taking Jacob for a military gentleman, the stall-keeper told him about his boy at
               Gibraltar, and Jacob cursed the British army and praised the Duke of Wellington. So
               on again they went down the hill talking about the Greeks.</p>
            <p>A strange thing—when you come to think of it—this love of Greek, flourishing in such
               obscurity, distorted, discouraged, yet leaping out, all of a sudden, especially on
               leaving crowded rooms, or after a surfeit of print, or when the moon floats among the
               waves of the hills, or in hollow, sallow, fruitless <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName> days, like a specific; a
               clean blade; always a miracle. Jacob knew no more Greek than served him to stumble
               through a play. Of ancient history he knew nothing. However, as he tramped into
               <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName> it seemed to him that they were making the flagstones ring on the road to the
               <placeName type="tgn" key="8712059">Acropolis</placeName>, and that if Socrates saw them coming he would bestir himself and say "my
               fine fellows," for the whole sentiment of <placeName type="tgn" key="7001393">Athens</placeName> was entirely after his heart; free,
               venturesome, high-spirited…. <pb n="124" facs="pageImages/124.png"/>She had called him Jacob without asking his leave. She
               had sat upon his knee. Thus did all good women in the days of the Greeks.</p>
            <p>At this moment there shook out into the air a wavering, quavering, doleful
               lamentation which seemed to lack strength to unfold itself, and yet flagged on; at
               the sound of which doors in back streets burst sullenly open; workmen stumped
               forth.</p>
            <p>Florinda was sick.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Durrant, sleepless as usual, scored a mark by the side of certain lines in the
               Inferno.</p>
            <p>Clara slept buried in her pillows; on her dressing-table dishevelled roses and a pair
               of long white gloves.</p>
            <p>Still wearing the conical white hat of a pierrot, Florinda was sick.</p>
            <p>The bedroom seemed fit for these catastrophes—cheap, mustard-coloured, half attic,
               half studio, curiously ornamented with silver paper stars, Welshwomen's hats, and
               rosaries pendent from <pb n="125" facs="pageImages/125.png"/>the gas brackets. As for Florinda's story, her name had been
               bestowed upon her by a painter who had wished it to signify that the flower of her
               maidenhood was still unplucked. Be that as it may, she was without a surname, and for
               parents had only the photograph of a tombstone beneath which, she said, her father
               lay buried. Sometimes she would dwell upon the size of it, and rumour had it that
               Florinda's father had died from the growth of his bones which nothing could stop;
               just as her mother enjoyed the confidence of a Royal master, and now and again
               Florinda herself was a Princess, but chiefly when drunk. Thus deserted, pretty into
               the bargain, with tragic eyes and the lips of a child, she talked more about
               virginity than women mostly do; and had lost it only the night before, or cherished
               it beyond the heart in her breast, according to the man she talked to. But did she
               always talk to men? No, she had her confidante: Mother Stuart. Stuart, as the lady
               would point out, is the name of a Royal house; but what that signified, and what her
               business way, no one knew; only that Mrs. Stuart got postal orders every Monday
               morning, kept a parrot, believed in the transmigration of souls, and could read the
               future in tea leaves. Dirty lodging-house wallpaper she was behind the chastity of
               Florinda.</p>
            <p><pb n="126" facs="pageImages/126.png"/>Now Florinda wept, and spent the day wandering the streets; stood at Chelsea watching
               the river swim past; trailed along the shopping streets; opened her bag and powdered
               her cheeks in omnibuses; read love letters, propping them against the milk pot in the
               A.B.C. shop; detected glass in the sugar bowl; accused the waitress of wishing to
               poison her; declared that young men stared at her; and found herself towards evening
               slowly sauntering down Jacob's street, when it struck her that she liked that man
               Jacob better than dirty Jews, and sitting at his table (he was copying his essay upon
               the Ethics of Indecency), drew off her gloves and told him how Mother Stuart had
               banged her on the head with the tea-cosy.</p>
            <p>Jacob took her word for it that she was chaste. She prattled, sitting by the
               fireside, of famous painters. The tomb of her father was mentioned. Wild and frail
               and beautiful she looked, and thus the women of the Greeks were, Jacob thought; and
               this was life; and himself a man and Florinda chaste. She left with one of Shelley's
               poems beneath her arm. Mrs. Stuart, she said, often talked of him.</p>
            <p>Marvellous are the innocent. To believe that the girl herself transcends all lies
               (for Jacob <pb n="127" facs="pageImages/127.png"/>was not such a fool as to believe implicitly), to wonder enviously at the
               unanchored life—his own seeming petted and even cloistered in comparison—to have at
               hand as sovereign specifics for all disorders of the soul Adonais and the plays of
               Shakespeare; to figure out a comradeship all spirited on her side, protective on his,
               yet equal on both, for women, thought Jacob, are just the same as men—innocence such
               as this is marvellous enough, and perhaps not so foolish after all.</p>
            <p>For when Florinda got home that night she first washed her head; then ate chocolate
               creams; then opened Shelley. True, she was horribly bored. What on earth was it
               ABOUT? She had to wager with herself that she would turn the page before she ate
               another. In fact she slept. But then her day had been a long one, Mother Stuart had
               thrown the tea-cosy;—there are formidable sights in the streets, and though Florinda
               was ignorant as an owl, and would never learn to read even her love letters
               correctly, still she had her feelings, liked some men better than others, and was
               entirely at the beck and call of life. Whether or not she was a virgin seems a matter
               of no importance whatever. Unless, indeed, it is the only thing of any importance at
               all.</p>
            <p>Jacob was restless when she left him.</p>
            <p>All night men and women seethed up and down <pb n="128" facs="pageImages/128.png"/>the well-known beats. Late home-comers
               could see shadows against the blinds even in the most respectable suburbs. Not a
               square in snow or fog lacked its amorous couple. All plays turned on the same
               subject. Bullets went through heads in hotel bedrooms almost nightly on that account.
               When the body escaped mutilation, seldom did the heart go to the grave unscarred.
               Little else was talked of in theatres and popular novels. Yet we say it is a matter
               of no importance at all.</p>
            <p>What with Shakespeare and Adonais, Mozart and Bishop Berkeley—choose whom you
               like—the fact is concealed and the evenings for most of us pass reputably, or with
               only the sort of tremor that a snake makes sliding through the grass. But then
               concealment by itself distracts the mind from the print and the sound. If Florinda
               had had a mind, she might have read with clearer eyes than we can. She and her sort
               have solved the question by turning it to a trifle of washing the hands nightly
               before going to bed, the only difficulty being whether you prefer your water hot or
               cold, which being settled, the mind can go about its business unassailed.</p>
            <p>But it did occur to Jacob, half-way through dinner, to wonder whether she had a
               mind.</p>
            <p><pb n="129" facs="pageImages/129.png"/>They sat at a little table in the restaurant.</p>
            <p>Florinda leant the points of her elbows on the table and held her chin in the cup of
               her hands. Her cloak had slipped behind her. Gold and white with bright beads on her
               she emerged, her face flowering from her body, innocent, scarcely tinted, the eyes
               gazing frankly about her, or slowly settling on Jacob and resting there. She
               talked:</p>
            <p>"You know that big black box the Australian left in my room ever so long ago? … I do
               think furs make a woman look old…. That's Bechstein come in now…. I was wondering
               what you looked like when you were a little boy, Jacob." She nibbled her roll and
               looked at him.</p>
            <p>"Jacob. You're like one of those statues…. I think there are lovely things in the
               <placeName type="tgn" key="1100764">British Museum</placeName>, don't you? Lots of lovely things …" she spoke dreamily. The room was
               filling; the heat increasing. Talk in a restaurant is dazed sleep-walkers' talk, so
               many things to look at—so much noise—other people talking. Can one overhear? Oh, but
               they mustn't overhear US.</p>
            <p>"That's like Ellen Nagle—that girl …" and so on.</p>
            <p><pb n="130" facs="pageImages/130.png"/>"I'm awfully happy since I've known you, Jacob. You're such a GOOD man."</p>
            <p>The room got fuller and fuller; talk louder; knives more clattering.</p>
            <p>"Well, you see what makes her say things like that is …"</p>
            <p>She stopped. So did every one.</p>
            <p>"To-morrow … Sunday … a beastly … you tell me … go then!" Crash! And out she swept.
               It was at the table next them that the voice spun higher and higher. Suddenly the
               woman dashed the plates to the floor. The man was left there. Everybody stared.
               Then—"Well, poor chap, we mustn't sit staring. What a go! Did you hear what she said?
               By God, he looks a fool! Didn't come up to the scratch, I suppose. All the mustard on
               the tablecloth. The waiters laughing."</p>
            <p>Jacob observed Florinda. In her face there seemed to him something horribly
               brainless—as she sat staring.</p>
            <p>Out she swept, the black woman with the dancing feather in her hat.</p>
            <p><pb n="131" facs="pageImages/131.png"/>Yet she had to go somewhere. The night is not a tumultuous black ocean in which you
               sink or sail as a star. As a matter of fact it was a wet November night. The lamps of
               Soho made large greasy spots of light upon the pavement. The by-streets were dark
               enough to shelter man or woman leaning against the doorways. One detached herself as
               Jacob and Florinda approached.</p>
            <p>"She's dropped her glove," said Florinda.</p>
            <p>Jacob, pressing forward, gave it her.</p>
            <p>Effusively she thanked him; retraced her steps; dropped her glove again. But why? For
               whom? Meanwhile, where had the other woman got to? And the man?</p>
            <p>The street lamps do not carry far enough to tell us. The voices, angry, lustful,
               despairing, passionate, were scarcely more than the voices of caged beasts at night.
               Only they are not caged, nor beasts. Stop a man; ask him the way; he'll tell it you;
               but one's afraid to ask him the way. What does one fear?—the human eye. At once the
               pavement narrows, the chasm deepens. There! They've melted into it—both man and
               woman. Further on, blatantly advertising its meritorious solidity, a boarding-house
               exhibits behind uncurtained windows its testimony to the <pb n="132" facs="pageImages/132.png"/>soundness of <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName>. There
               they sit, plainly illuminated, dressed like ladies and gentlemen, in bamboo chairs.
               The widows of business men prove laboriously that they are related to judges. The
               wives of coal merchants instantly retort that their fathers kept coachmen. A servant
               brings coffee, and the crochet basket has to be moved. And so on again into the dark,
               passing a girl here for sale, or there an old woman with only matches to offer,
               passing the crowd from the Tube station, the women with veiled hair, passing at
               length no one but shut doors, carved door-posts, and a solitary policeman, Jacob,
               with Florinda on his arm, reached his room and, lighting the lamp, said nothing at
               all.</p>
            <p>"I don't like you when you look like that," said Florinda.</p>
            <p>The problem is insoluble. The body is harnessed to a brain. Beauty goes hand in hand
               with stupidity. There she sat staring at the fire as she had stared at the broken
               mustard-pot. In spite of defending indecency, Jacob doubted whether he liked it in
               the raw. He had a violent reversion towards male society, cloistered rooms, and the
               works of the classics; and was ready to <pb n="133" facs="pageImages/133.png"/>turn with wrath upon whoever it was who had
               fashioned life thus.</p>
            <p>Then Florinda laid her hand upon his knee.</p>
            <p>After all, it was none of her fault. But the thought saddened him. It's not
               catastrophes, murders, deaths, diseases, that age and kill us; it's the way people
               look and laugh, and run up the steps of omnibuses.</p>
            <p>Any excuse, though, serves a stupid woman. He told her his head ached.</p>
            <p>But when she looked at him, dumbly, half-guessing, half-understanding, apologizing
               perhaps, anyhow saying as he had said, "It's none of my fault," straight and
               beautiful in body, her face like a shell within its cap, then he knew that cloisters
               and classics are no use whatever. The problem is insoluble.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="chapter" n="7">
            <head type="sub">VII</head>
            <p><pb n="134" facs="pageImages/134.png"/> SEVEN About this time a firm of merchants having dealings with the East put on the
               market little paper flowers which opened on touching water. As it was the custom also
               to use finger-bowls at the end of dinner, the new discovery was found of excellent
               service. In these sheltered lakes the little coloured flowers swam and slid;
               surmounted smooth slippery waves, and sometimes foundered and lay like pebbles on the
               glass floor. Their fortunes were watched by eyes intent and lovely. It is surely a
               great discovery that leads to the union of hearts and foundation of homes. The paper
               flowers did no less.</p>
            <p>It must not be thought, though, that they ousted the flowers of nature. Roses,
               lilies, carnations in particular, looked over the rims of vases and surveyed the
               bright lives and swift dooms of their artificial relations. Mr. Stuart Ormond made
               this very observation; and charming it was thought; and Kitty Craster married him <pb n="135" facs="pageImages/135.png"/>on
               the strength of it six months later. But real flowers can never be dispensed with. If
               they could, human life would be a different affair altogether. For flowers fade;
               chrysanthemums are the worst; perfect over night; yellow and jaded next morning—not
               fit to be seen. On the whole, though the price is sinful, carnations pay best;—it's a
               question, however, whether it's wise to have them wired. Some shops advise it.
               Certainly it's the only way to keep them at a dance; but whether it is necessary at
               dinner parties, unless the rooms are very hot, remains in dispute. Old Mrs. Temple
               used to recommend an ivy leaf—just one—dropped into the bowl. She said it kept the
               water pure for days and days. But there is some reason to think that old Mrs. Temple
               was mistaken.</p>
            <p>The little cards, however, with names engraved on them, are a more serious problem
               than the flowers. More horses' legs have been worn out, more coachmen's lives
               consumed, more hours of sound afternoon time vainly lavished than served to win us
               the battle of <placeName type="tgn" key="7008022">Waterloo</placeName>, and pay for it into the bargain. The little demons are the
               source of as many reprieves, calamities, and anxieties as the battle itself.
               Sometimes Mrs. Bonham has just gone out; at others she is at <pb n="136" facs="pageImages/136.png"/>home. But, even if the
               cards should be superseded, which seems unlikely, there are unruly powers blowing
               life into storms, disordering sedulous mornings, and uprooting the stability of the
               afternoon—dressmakers, that is to say, and confectioners' shops. Six yards of silk
               will cover one body; but if you have to devise six hundred shapes for it, and twice
               as many colours?—in the middle of which there is the urgent question of the pudding
               with tufts of green cream and battlements of almond paste. It has not arrived.</p>
            <p>The flamingo hours fluttered softly through the sky. But regularly they dipped their
               wings in pitch black; <placeName type="tgn" key="4012682">Notting Hill</placeName>, for instance, or the purlieus of <placeName type="tgn" key="8716278">Clerkenwell</placeName>. No
               wonder that Italian remained a hidden art, and the piano always played the same
               sonata. In order to buy one pair of elastic stockings for Mrs. Page, widow, aged
               sixty-three, in receipt of five shillings out-door relief, and help from her only son
               employed in Messrs. Mackie's dye-works, suffering in winter with his chest, letters
               must be written, columns filled up in the same round, simple hand that wrote in Mr.
               Letts's diary how the weather was fine, the children demons, and Jacob Flanders
               unworldly. Clara Durrant procured the stockings, played the sonata, filled the vases,
               fetched the pudding, left the cards, and when the great invention <pb n="137" facs="pageImages/137.png"/>of paper flowers to
               swim in finger-bowls was discovered, was one of those who most marvelled at their
               brief lives.</p>
            <p>Nor were there wanting poets to celebrate the theme. Edwin Mallett, for example,
               wrote his verses ending:</p>
            <p>/* And read their doom in Chloe's eyes, */</p>
            <p>which caused Clara to blush at the first reading, and to laugh at the second, saying
               that it was just like him to call her Chloe when her name was Clara. Ridiculous young
               man! But when, between ten and eleven on a rainy morning, Edwin Mallett laid his life
               at her feet she ran out of the room and hid herself in her bedroom, and Timothy below
               could not get on with his work all that morning on account of her sobs.</p>
            <p>"Which is the result of enjoying yourself," said Mrs. Durrant severely, surveying the
               dance programme all scored with the same initials, or rather they were different ones
               this time—R.B. instead of E.M.; Richard Bonamy it was now, the young man with the
               Wellington nose.</p>
            <p>"But I could never marry a man with a nose like that," said Clara.</p>
            <p>"Nonsense," said Mrs. Durrant.</p>
            <p>"But I am too severe," she thought to herself. <pb n="138" facs="pageImages/138.png"/>For Clara, losing all vivacity, tore
               up her dance programme and threw it in the fender.</p>
            <p>Such were the very serious consequences of the invention of paper flowers to swim in
               bowls.</p>
            <p>"Please," said Julia Eliot, taking up her position by the curtain almost opposite the
               door, "don't introduce me. I like to look on. The amusing thing," she went on,
               addressing Mr. Salvin, who, owing to his lameness, was accommodated with a chair,
               "the amusing thing about a party is to watch the people—coming and going, coming and
               going."</p>
            <p>"Last time we met," said Mr. Salvin, "was at the Farquhars. Poor lady! She has much
               to put up with." "Doesn't she look charming?" exclaimed Miss Eliot, as Clara Durrant
               passed them.</p>
            <p>"And which of them…?" asked Mr. Salvin, dropping his voice and speaking in quizzical
               tones.</p>
            <p>"There are so many …" Miss Eliot replied. Three young men stood at the doorway
               looking about for their hostess.</p>
            <p>"You don't remember Elizabeth as I do," <pb n="139" facs="pageImages/139.png"/>said Mr. Salvin, "dancing Highland reels at
               Banchorie. Clara lacks her mother's spirit. Clara is a little pale."</p>
            <p>"What different people one sees here!" said Miss Eliot.</p>
            <p>"Happily we are not governed by the evening papers," said Mr. Salvin.</p>
            <p>"I never read them," said Miss Eliot. "I know nothing about politics," she added.</p>
            <p>"The piano is in tune," said Clara, passing them, "but we may have to ask some one to
               move it for us."</p>
            <p>"Are they going to dance?" asked Mr. Salvin.</p>
            <p>"Nobody shall disturb you," said Mrs. Durrant peremptorily as she passed.</p>
            <p>"Julia Eliot. It IS Julia Eliot!" said old Lady Hibbert, holding out both her hands.
               "And Mr. Salvin. What is going to happen to us, Mr. Salvin? With all my experience of
               English politics—My dear, I was thinking of your father last night—one of my oldest
               friends, Mr. Salvin. Never tell me that girls often are incapable of love! I had all
               Shakespeare by heart before I was in my teens, Mr. Salvin!"</p>
            <p>"You don't say so," said Mr. Salvin.</p>
            <p>"But I do," said Lady Hibbert.</p>
            <p><pb n="140" facs="pageImages/140.png"/>"Oh, Mr. Salvin, I'm so sorry…."</p>
            <p>"I will remove myself if you'll kindly lend me a hand," said Mr. Salvin.</p>
            <p>"You shall sit by my mother," said Clara. "Everybody seems to come in here…. Mr.
               Calthorp, let me introduce you to Miss Edwards."</p>
            <p>"Are you going away for Christmas?" said Mr. Calthorp.</p>
            <p>"If my brother gets his leave," said Miss Edwards.</p>
            <p>"What regiment is he in?" said Mr. Calthorp.</p>
            <p>"The Twentieth Hussars," said Miss Edwards.</p>
            <p>"Perhaps he knows my brother?" said Mr. Calthorp.</p>
            <p>"I am afraid I did not catch your name," said Miss Edwards.</p>
            <p>"Calthorp," said Mr. Calthorp.</p>
            <p>"But what proof was there that the marriage service was actually performed?" said Mr.
               Crosby.</p>
            <p><pb n="141" facs="pageImages/141.png"/>"There is no reason to doubt that Charles James Fox …" Mr. Burley began; but here
               Mrs. Stretton told him that she knew his sister well; had stayed with her not six
               weeks ago; and thought the house charming, but bleak in winter.</p>
            <p>"Going about as girls do nowadays—" said Mrs. Forster.</p>
            <p>Mr. Bowley looked round him, and catching sight of Rose Shaw moved towards her, threw
               out his hands, and exclaimed: "Well!"</p>
            <p>"Nothing!" she replied. "Nothing at all—though I left them alone the entire afternoon
               on purpose."</p>
            <p>"Dear me, dear me," said Mr. Bowley. "I will ask Jimmy to breakfast."</p>
            <p>"But who could resist her?" cried Rose Shaw. "Dearest Clara—I know we mustn't try to
               stop you…"</p>
            <p>"You and Mr. Bowley are talking dreadful gossip, I know," said Clara.</p>
            <p>"Life is wicked—life is detestable!" cried Rose Shaw.</p>
            <p><pb n="142" facs="pageImages/142.png"/>"There's not much to be said for this sort of thing, is there?" said Timothy Durrant
               to Jacob. "Women like it."</p>
            <p>"Like what?" said Charlotte Wilding, coming up to them.</p>
            <p>"Where have you come from?" said Timothy. "Dining somewhere, I suppose."</p>
            <p>"I don't see why not," said Charlotte.</p>
            <p>"People must go downstairs," said Clara, passing. "Take Charlotte, Timothy. How d'you
               do, Mr. Flanders." "How d'you do, Mr. Flanders," said Julia Eliot, holding out her
               hand. "What's been happening to you?" /* "Who is Silvia? what is she? That all our
               swains commend her?" */ sang Elsbeth Siddons.</p>
            <p>Every one stood where they were, or sat down if a chair was empty.</p>
            <p>"Ah," sighed Clara, who stood beside Jacob, half-way through.</p>
            <p>/* "Then to Silvia let us sing, That Silvia is excelling; She excels each mortal
               thing Upon the dull earth dwelling. To her let us garlands bring," */ sang Elsbeth
               Siddons.</p>
            <p><pb n="143" facs="pageImages/143.png"/>"Ah!" Clara exclaimed out loud, and clapped her gloved hands; and Jacob clapped his
               bare ones; and then she moved forward and directed people to come in from the
               doorway.</p>
            <p>"You are living in <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName>?" asked Miss Julia Eliot.</p>
            <p>"Yes," said Jacob.</p>
            <p>"In rooms?"</p>
            <p>"Yes."</p>
            <p>"There is Mr. Clutterbuck. You always see Mr. Clutterbuck here. He is not very happy
               at home, I am afraid. They say that Mrs. Clutterbuck …" she dropped her voice.
               "That's why he stays with the Durrants. Were you there when they acted Mr. Wortley's
               play? Oh, no, of course not—at the last moment, did you hear—you had to go to join
               your mother, I remember, at Harrogate—At the last moment, as I was saying, just as
               everything was ready, the clothes finished and everything—Now Elsbeth is going to
               sing again. Clara is playing her accompaniment or turning over for Mr. Carter, I
               think. No, Mr. Carter is playing by himself—This is BACH," she whispered, as Mr.
               Carter played the first bars.</p>
            <p>"Are you fond of music?" said Mr. Durrant.</p>
            <p><pb n="144" facs="pageImages/144.png"/>"Yes. I like hearing it," said Jacob. "I know nothing about it."</p>
            <p>"Very few people do that," said Mrs. Durrant. "I daresay you were never taught. Why
               is that, Sir Jasper?—Sir Jasper Bigham—Mr. Flanders. Why is nobody taught anything
               that they ought to know, Sir Jasper?" She left them standing against the wall.</p>
            <p>Neither of the gentlemen said anything for three minutes, though Jacob shifted
               perhaps five inches to the left, and then as many to the right. Then Jacob grunted,
               and suddenly crossed the room.</p>
            <p>"Will you come and have something to eat?" he said to Clara Durrant.</p>
            <p>"Yes, an ice. Quickly. Now," she said.</p>
            <p>Downstairs they went.</p>
            <p>But half-way down they met Mr. and Mrs. Gresham, Herbert Turner, Sylvia Rashleigh,
               and a friend, whom they had dared to bring, from America, "knowing that Mrs.
               Durrant—wishing to show Mr. Pilcher.—Mr. Pilcher from New York—This is Miss
               Durrant."</p>
            <p>"Whom I have heard so much of," said Mr. Pilcher, bowing low.</p>
            <p>So Clara left him.</p>

         <div type="chapter" n="8">
            <head type="sub">VIII</head>
            <p><pb n="145" facs="pageImages/145.png"/>About half-past nine Jacob left the house, his door slamming, other doors slamming,
               buying his paper, mounting his omnibus, or, weather permitting, walking his road as
               other people do. Head bent down, a desk, a telephone, books bound in green leather,
               electric light…. "Fresh coals, sir?" … "Your tea, sir."… Talk about football, the
               Hotspurs, the Harlequins; six-thirty Star brought in by the office boy; the rooks of
               Gray's Inn passing overhead; branches in the fog thin and brittle; and through the
               roar of traffic now and again a voice shouting: "Verdict—verdict—winner—winner,"
               while letters accumulate in a basket, Jacob signs them, and each evening finds him,
               as he takes his coat down, with some muscle of the brain new stretched.</p>
            <p>Then, sometimes a game of chess; or pictures in Bond Street, or a long way home to
               take the air with Bonamy on his arm, meditatively marching, head thrown back, the
               world a spectacle, <pb n="146" facs="pageImages/146.png"/>the early moon above the steeples coming in for praise, the
               sea-gulls flying high, Nelson on his column surveying the horizon, and the world our
               ship.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, poor Betty Flanders's letter, having caught the second post, lay on the
               hall table—poor Betty Flanders writing her son's name, Jacob Alan Flanders, Esq., as
               mothers do, and the ink pale, profuse, suggesting how mothers down at <placeName type="tgn" key="7010063">Scarborough</placeName>
               scribble over the fire with their feet on the fender, when tea's cleared away, and
               can never, never say, whatever it may be—probably this—Don't go with bad women, do be
               a good boy; wear your thick shirts; and come back, come back, come back to me.</p>
            <p>But she said nothing of the kind. "Do you remember old Miss Wargrave, who used to be
               so kind when you had the whooping-cough?" she wrote; "she's dead at last, poor thing.
               They would like it if you wrote. Ellen came over and we spent a nice day shopping.
               Old Mouse gets very stiff, and we have to walk him up the smallest hill. Rebecca, at
               last, after I don't know how long, went into Mr. Adamson's. Three teeth, he says,
               must come out. Such mild weather for the time of year, the little buds actually on
               the pear trees. And Mrs. Jarvis tells me—"Mrs. Flanders liked Mrs. Jarvis, <pb n="147" facs="pageImages/147.png"/>always
               said of her that she was too good for such a quiet place, and, though she never
               listened to her discontent and told her at the end of it (looking up, sucking her
               thread, or taking off her spectacles) that a little peat wrapped round the iris roots
               keeps them from the frost, and Parrot's great white sale is Tuesday next, "do
               remember,"—Mrs. Flanders knew precisely how Mrs. Jarvis felt; and how interesting her
               letters were, about Mrs. Jarvis, could one read them year in, year out—the
               unpublished works of women, written by the fireside in pale profusion, dried by the
               flame, for the blotting-paper's worn to holes and the nib cleft and clotted. Then
               Captain Barfoot. Him she called "the Captain," spoke of frankly, yet never without
               reserve. The Captain was enquiring for her about Garfit's acre; advised chickens;
               could promise profit; or had the sciatica; or Mrs. Barfoot had been indoors for
               weeks; or the Captain says things look bad, politics that is, for as Jacob knew, the
               Captain would sometimes talk, as the evening waned, about <placeName type="tgn" key="1000078">Ireland</placeName> or India; and then
               Mrs. Flanders would fall musing about Morty, her brother, lost all these years—had
               the natives got him, was his ship sunk—would the Admiralty tell her?—the Captain
               knocking his pipe out, as Jacob knew, rising to <pb n="148" facs="pageImages/148.png"/>go, stiffly stretching to pick up
               Mrs. Flanders's wool which had rolled beneath the chair. Talk of the chicken farm
               came back and back, the women, even at fifty, impulsive at heart, sketching on the
               cloudy future flocks of Leghorns, Cochin Chinas, Orpingtons; like Jacob in the blur
               of her outline; but powerful as he was; fresh and vigorous, running about the house,
               scolding Rebecca.</p>
            <p>The letter lay upon the hall table; Florinda coming in that night took it up with
               her, put it on the table as she kissed Jacob, and Jacob seeing the hand, left it
               there under the lamp, between the biscuit-tin and the tobacco-box. They shut the
               bedroom door behind them.</p>
            <p>The sitting-room neither knew nor cared. The door was shut; and to suppose that wood,
               when it creaks, transmits anything save that rats are busy and wood dry is childish.
               These old houses are only brick and wood, soaked in human sweat, grained with human
               dirt. But if the pale blue envelope lying by the biscuit-box had the feelings of a
               mother, the heart was torn by the little creak, the sudden stir. Behind the door was
               the obscene thing, the alarming presence, and terror would come over her as at death,
               or the birth of a child. Better, perhaps, burst in and face it than sit in the
               antechamber listening <pb n="149" facs="pageImages/149.png"/>to the little creak, the sudden stir, for her heart was
               swollen, and pain threaded it. My son, my son—such would be her cry, uttered to hide
               her vision of him stretched with Florinda, inexcusable, irrational, in a woman with
               three children living at <placeName type="tgn" key="7010063">Scarborough</placeName>. And the fault lay with Florinda. Indeed, when
               the door opened and the couple came out, Mrs. Flanders would have flounced upon
               her—only it was Jacob who came first, in his dressing-gown, amiable, authoritative,
               beautifully healthy, like a baby after an airing, with an eye clear as running water.
               Florinda followed, lazily stretching; yawning a little; arranging her hair at the
               looking-glass—while Jacob read his mother's letter.</p>
            <p>Let us consider letters—how they come at breakfast, and at night, with their yellow
               stamps and their green stamps, immortalized by the postmark—for to see one's own
               envelope on another's table is to realize how soon deeds sever and become alien. Then
               at last the power of the mind to quit the body is manifest, and perhaps we fear or
               hate or wish annihilated this phantom of ourselves, lying on the table. Still, there
               are <pb n="150" facs="pageImages/150.png"/>letters that merely say how dinner's at seven; others ordering coal; making
               appointments. The hand in them is scarcely perceptible, let alone the voice or the
               scowl. Ah, but when the post knocks and the letter comes always the miracle seems
               repeated—speech attempted. Venerable are letters, infinitely brave, forlorn, and
               lost.</p>
            <p>Life would split asunder without them. "Come to tea, come to dinner, what's the truth
               of the story? have you heard the news? life in the capital is gay; the Russian
               dancers…." These are our stays and props. These lace our days together and make of
               life a perfect globe. And yet, and yet … when we go to dinner, when pressing
               finger-tips we hope to meet somewhere soon, a doubt insinuates itself; is this the
               way to spend our days? the rare, the limited, so soon dealt out to us—drinking tea?
               dining out? And the notes accumulate. And the telephones ring. And everywhere we go
               wires and tubes surround us to carry the voices that try to penetrate before the last
               card is dealt and the days are over. "Try to penetrate," for as we lift the cup,
               shake the hand, express the hope, something whispers, Is this all? Can I never know,
               share, be certain? Am I doomed all my days to write letters, send voices, which fall
               upon the tea-table, fade upon the passage, making <pb n="151" facs="pageImages/151.png"/>appointments, while life dwindles,
               to come and dine? Yet letters are venerable; and the telephone valiant, for the
               journey is a lonely one, and if bound together by notes and telephones we went in
               company, perhaps—who knows?—we might talk by the way.</p>
            <p>Well, people have tried. Byron wrote letters. So did Cowper. For centuries the
               writing-desk has contained sheets fit precisely for the communications of friends.
               Masters of language, poets of long ages, have turned from the sheet that endures to
               the sheet that perishes, pushing aside the tea-tray, drawing close to the fire (for
               letters are written when the dark presses round a bright red cave), and addressed
               themselves to the task of reaching, touching, penetrating the individual heart. Were
               it possible! But words have been used too often; touched and turned, and left exposed
               to the dust of the street. The words we seek hang close to the tree. We come at dawn
               and find them sweet beneath the leaf.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Flanders wrote letters; Mrs. Jarvis wrote them; Mrs. Durrant too; Mother Stuart
               actually scented her pages, thereby adding a flavour which the English language fails
               to provide; Jacob had written in his day long letters about art, morality, and
               politics to young men at college. Clara Durrant's letters were those <pb n="152" facs="pageImages/152.png"/>of a child.
               Florinda—the impediment between Florinda and her pen was something impassable. Fancy
               a butterfly, gnat, or other winged insect, attached to a twig which, clogged with
               mud, it rolls across a page. Her spelling was abominable. Her sentiments infantile.
               And for some reason when she wrote she declared her belief in God. Then there were
               crosses—tear stains; and the hand itself rambling and redeemed only by the fact—which
               always did redeem Florinda—by the fact that she cared. Yes, whether it was for
               chocolate creams, hot baths, the shape of her face in the looking-glass, Florinda
               could no more pretend a feeling than swallow whisky. Incontinent was her rejection.
               Great men are truthful, and these little prostitutes, staring in the fire, taking out
               a powder-puff, decorating lips at an inch of looking-glass, have (so Jacob thought)
               an inviolable fidelity.</p>
            <p>Then he saw her turning up Greek Street upon another man's arm.</p>
            <p>The light from the arc lamp drenched him from head to toe. He stood for a minute
               motionless beneath it. Shadows chequered the street. <pb n="153" facs="pageImages/153.png"/>Other figures, single and
               together, poured out, wavered across, and obliterated Florinda and the man.</p>
            <p>The light drenched Jacob from head to toe. You could see the pattern on his trousers;
               the old thorns on his stick; his shoe laces; bare hands; and face.</p>
            <p>It was as if a stone were ground to dust; as if white sparks flew from a livid
               whetstone, which was his spine; as if the switchback railway, having swooped to the
               depths, fell, fell, fell. This was in his face.</p>
            <p>Whether we know what was in his mind is another question. Granted ten years'
               seniority and a difference of sex, fear of him comes first; this is swallowed up by a
               desire to help—overwhelming sense, reason, and the time of night; anger would follow
               close on that—with Florinda, with destiny; and then up would bubble an irresponsible
               optimism. "Surely there's enough light in the street at this moment to drown all our
               cares in gold!" Ah, what's the use of saying it? Even while you speak and look over
               your shoulder towards Shaftesbury Avenue, destiny is chipping a dent in him. He has
               turned to go. As for following him back to his rooms, no—that we won't do.</p>
            <p>Yet that, of course, is precisely what one <pb n="154" facs="pageImages/154.png"/>does. He let himself in and shut the door,
               though it was only striking ten on one of the city clocks. No one can go to bed at
               ten. Nobody was thinking of going to bed. It was January and dismal, but Mrs. Wagg
               stood on her doorstep, as if expecting something to happen. A barrel-organ played
               like an obscene nightingale beneath wet leaves. Children ran across the road. Here
               and there one could see brown panelling inside the hall door…. The march that the
               mind keeps beneath the windows of others is queer enough. Now distracted by brown
               panelling; now by a fern in a pot; here improvising a few phrases to dance with the
               barrel-organ; again snatching a detached gaiety from a drunken man; then altogether
               absorbed by words the poor shout across the street at each other (so outright, so
               lusty)—yet all the while having for centre, for magnet, a young man alone in his
               room.</p>
            <p>"Life is wicked—life is detestable," cried Rose Shaw.</p>
            <p>The strange thing about life is that though the nature of it must have been apparent
               to <pb n="155" facs="pageImages/155.png"/>every one for hundreds of years, no one has left any adequate account of it. The
               streets of <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName> have their map; but our passions are uncharted. What are you going
               to meet if you turn this corner?</p>
            <p>"Holborn straight ahead of you," says the policeman. Ah, but where are you going if
               instead of brushing past the old man with the white beard, the silver medal, and the
               cheap violin, you let him go on with his story, which ends in an invitation to step
               somewhere, to his room, presumably, off Queen's Square, and there he shows you a
               collection of birds' eggs and a letter from the Prince of Wales's secretary, and this
               (skipping the intermediate stages) brings you one winter's day to the <placeName type="tgn" key="7008131">Essex</placeName> coast,
               where the little boat makes off to the ship, and the ship sails and you behold on the
               skyline the Azores; and the flamingoes rise; and there you sit on the verge of the
               marsh drinking rum-punch, an outcast from civilization, for you have committed a
               crime, are infected with yellow fever as likely as not, and—fill in the sketch as you
               like. As frequent as street corners in Holborn are these chasms in the continuity of
               our ways. Yet we keep straight on.</p>
            <p><pb n="156" facs="pageImages/156.png"/>Rose Shaw, talking in rather an emotional manner to Mr. Bowley at Mrs. Durrant's
               evening party a few nights back, said that life was wicked because a man called Jimmy
               refused to marry a woman called (if memory serves) Helen Aitken.</p>
            <p>Both were beautiful. Both were inanimate. The oval tea-table invariably separated
               them, and the plate of biscuits was all he ever gave her. He bowed; she inclined her
               head. They danced. He danced divinely. They sat in the alcove; never a word was said.
               Her pillow was wet with tears. Kind Mr. Bowley and dear Rose Shaw marvelled and
               deplored. Bowley had rooms in the Albany. Rose was re-born every evening precisely as
               the clock struck eight. All four were civilization's triumphs, and if you persist
               that a command of the English language is part of our inheritance, one can only reply
               that beauty is almost always dumb. Male beauty in association with female beauty
               breeds in the onlooker a sense of fear. Often have I seen them—Helen and Jimmy—and
               likened them to ships adrift, and feared for my own little craft. Or again, have you
               ever watched fine collie dogs couchant at twenty yards' distance? As she passed him
               his cup there was that quiver in her <pb n="157" facs="pageImages/157.png"/>flanks. Bowley saw what was up-asked Jimmy to
               breakfast. Helen must have confided in Rose. For my own part, I find it exceedingly
               difficult to interpret songs without words. And now Jimmy feeds crows in Flanders and
               Helen visits hospitals. Oh, life is damnable, life is wicked, as Rose Shaw said.</p>
            <p>The lamps of <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName> uphold the dark as upon the points of burning bayonets. The
               yellow canopy sinks and swells over the great four-poster. Passengers in the
               mail-coaches running into <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName> in the eighteenth century looked through leafless
               branches and saw it flaring beneath them. The light burns behind yellow blinds and
               pink blinds, and above fanlights, and down in basement windows. The street market in
               Soho is fierce with light. Raw meat, china mugs, and silk stockings blaze in it. Raw
               voices wrap themselves round the flaring gas-jets. Arms akimbo, they stand on the
               pavement bawling—Messrs. Kettle and Wilkinson; their wives sit in the shop, furs
               wrapped round their necks, arms folded, eyes contemptuous. Such faces as one sees.
               The little man fingering the <pb n="158" facs="pageImages/158.png"/>meat must have squatted before the fire in innumerable
               lodging-houses, and heard and seen and known so much that it seems to utter itself
               even volubly from dark eyes, loose lips, as he fingers the meat silently, his face
               sad as a poet's, and never a song sung. Shawled women carry babies with purple
               eyelids; boys stand at street corners; girls look across the road—rude illustrations,
               pictures in a book whose pages we turn over and over as if we should at last find
               what we look for. Every face, every shop, bedroom window, public-house, and dark
               square is a picture feverishly turned—in search of what? It is the same with books.
               What do we seek through millions of pages? Still hopefully turning the pages—oh, here
               is Jacob's room.</p>
            <p>He sat at the table reading the Globe. The pinkish sheet was spread flat before him.
               He propped his face in his hand, so that the skin of his cheek was wrinkled in deep
               folds. Terribly severe he looked, set, and defiant. (What people go through in half
               an hour! But nothing could save him. These events are features of our landscape. A
               foreigner coming to <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName> could <pb n="159" facs="pageImages/159.png"/>scarcely miss seeing St. Paul's.) He judged life.
               These pinkish and greenish newspapers are thin sheets of gelatine pressed nightly
               over the brain and heart of the world. They take the impression of the whole. Jacob
               cast his eye over it. A strike, a murder, football, bodies found; vociferation from
               all parts of England simultaneously. How miserable it is that the Globe newspaper
               offers nothing better to Jacob Flanders! When a child begins to read history one
               marvels, sorrowfully, to hear him spell out in his new voice the ancient words.</p>
            <p>The Prime Minister's speech was reported in something over five columns. Feeling in
               his pocket, Jacob took out a pipe and proceeded to fill it. Five minutes, ten
               minutes, fifteen minutes passed. Jacob took the paper over to the fire. The Prime
               Minister proposed a measure for giving Home Rule to <placeName type="tgn" key="1000078">Ireland</placeName>. Jacob knocked out his
               pipe. He was certainly thinking about Home Rule in <placeName type="tgn" key="1000078">Ireland</placeName>—a very difficult matter. A
               very cold night.</p>
            <p>The snow, which had been falling all night, lay at three o'clock in the afternoon
               over the fields <pb n="160" facs="pageImages/160.png"/>and the hill. Clumps of withered grass stood out upon the hill-top;
               the furze bushes were black, and now and then a black shiver crossed the snow as the
               wind drove flurries of frozen particles before it. The sound was that of a broom
               sweeping—sweeping.</p>
            <p>The stream crept along by the road unseen by any one. Sticks and leaves caught in the
               frozen grass. The sky was sullen grey and the trees of black iron. Uncompromising was
               the severity of the country. At four o'clock the snow was again falling. The day had
               gone out.</p>
            <p>A window tinged yellow about two feet across alone combated the white fields and the
               black trees …. At six o'clock a man's figure carrying a lantern crossed the field ….
               A raft of twig stayed upon a stone, suddenly detached itself, and floated towards the
               culvert …. A load of snow slipped and fell from a fir branch …. Later there was a
               mournful cry …. A motor car came along the road shoving the dark before it …. The
               dark shut down behind it….</p>
            <p>Spaces of complete immobility separated each of these movements. The land seemed to
               lie dead …. Then the old shepherd returned stiffly across the field. Stiffly and
               painfully the frozen earth was trodden under and gave beneath pressure like a
               treadmill. The worn voices of <pb n="161" facs="pageImages/161.png"/>clocks repeated the fact of the hour all night
               long.</p>
            <p>Jacob, too, heard them, and raked out the fire. He rose. He stretched himself. He
               went to bed.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="chapter" n="9">
            <head type="sub">IX</head>
            <p><pb n="162" facs="pageImages/162.png"/>The Countess of Rocksbier sat at the head of the table alone with Jacob. Fed upon
               champagne and spices for at least two centuries (four, if you count the female line),
               the Countess Lucy looked well fed. A discriminating nose she had for scents,
               prolonged, as if in quest of them; her underlip protruded a narrow red shelf; her
               eyes were small, with sandy tufts for eyebrows, and her jowl was heavy. Behind her
               (the window looked on Grosvenor Square) stood Moll Pratt on the pavement, offering
               violets for sale; and Mrs. Hilda Thomas, lifting her skirts, preparing to cross the
               road. One was from Walworth; the other from <placeName type="tgn" key="7012091">Putney</placeName>. Both wore black stockings, but
               Mrs. Thomas was coiled in furs. The comparison was much in Lady Rocksbier's favour.
               Moll had more humour, but was violent; stupid too. Hilda Thomas was mealy-mouthed,
               all her silver frames aslant; egg-cups in the drawing-room; and the windows shrouded.
               Lady Rocksbier, <pb n="163" facs="pageImages/163.png"/>whatever the deficiencies of her profile, had been a great rider to
               hounds. She used her knife with authority, tore her chicken bones, asking Jacob's
               pardon, with her own hands.</p>
            <p>"Who is that driving by?" she asked Boxall, the butler.</p>
            <p>"Lady Firtlemere's carriage, my lady," which reminded her to send a card to ask after
               his lordship's health. A rude old lady, Jacob thought. The wine was excellent. She
               called herself "an old woman"—"so kind to lunch with an old woman"—which flattered
               him. She talked of Joseph Chamberlain, whom she had known. She said that Jacob must
               come and meet—one of our celebrities. And the Lady Alice came in with three dogs on a
               leash, and Jackie, who ran to kiss his grandmother, while Boxall brought in a
               telegram, and Jacob was given a good cigar.</p>
            <p>A few moments before a horse jumps it slows, sidles, gathers itself together, goes up
               like a monster wave, and pitches down on the further side. Hedges and sky swoop in a
               semicircle. Then as if your own body ran into the horse's <pb n="164" facs="pageImages/164.png"/>body and it was your own
               forelegs grown with his that sprang, rushing through the air you go, the ground
               resilient, bodies a mass of muscles, yet you have command too, upright stillness,
               eyes accurately judging. Then the curves cease, changing to downright hammer strokes,
               which jar; and you draw up with a jolt; sitting back a little, sparkling, tingling,
               glazed with ice over pounding arteries, gasping: "Ah! ho! Hah!" the steam going up
               from the horses as they jostle together at the cross-roads, where the signpost is,
               and the woman in the apron stands and stares at the doorway. The man raises himself
               from the cabbages to stare too.</p>
            <p>So Jacob galloped over the fields of <placeName type="tgn" key="7008131">Essex</placeName>, flopped in the mud, lost the hunt, and
               rode by himself eating sandwiches, looking over the hedges, noticing the colours as
               if new scraped, cursing his luck.</p>
            <p>He had tea at the Inn; and there they all were, slapping, stamping, saying, "After
               you," clipped, curt, jocose, red as the wattles of turkeys, using free speech until
               Mrs. Horsefield and her friend Miss Dudding appeared at the doorway with their skirts
               hitched up, and hair looping down. Then Tom Dudding rapped at the window with his
               whip. A motor car throbbed in the courtyard. Gentlemen, feeling for matches, <pb n="165" facs="pageImages/165.png"/>moved
               out, and Jacob went into the bar with Brandy Jones to smoke with the rustics. There
               was old Jevons with one eye gone, and his clothes the colour of mud, his bag over his
               back, and his brains laid feet down in earth among the violet roots and the nettle
               roots; Mary Sanders with her box of wood; and Tom sent for beer, the half-witted son
               of the sexton—all this within thirty miles of <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName>.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Papworth, of Endell Street, <placeName type="tgn" key="4012717">Covent Garden</placeName>, did for Mr. Bonamy in New Square,
               <placeName type="tgn" key="3000854">Lincoln's Inn</placeName>, and as she washed up the dinner things in the scullery she heard the
               young gentlemen talking in the room next door. Mr. Sanders was there again; Flanders
               she meant; and where an inquisitive old woman gets a name wrong, what chance is there
               that she will faithfully report an argument? As she held the plates under water and
               then dealt them on the pile beneath the hissing gas, she listened: heard Sanders
               speaking in a loud rather overbearing tone of voice: "good," he said, and "absolute"
               and "justice" and "punishment," and "the will of the majority." Then her gentleman
               piped up; <pb n="166" facs="pageImages/166.png"/>she backed him for argument against Sanders. Yet Sanders was a fine young
               fellow (here all the scraps went swirling round the sink, scoured after by her
               purple, almost nailless hands). "Women"—she thought, and wondered what Sanders and
               her gentleman did in THAT line, one eyelid sinking perceptibly as she mused, for she
               was the mother of nine—three still-born and one deaf and dumb from birth. Putting the
               plates in the rack she heard once more Sanders at it again ("He don't give Bonamy a
               chance," she thought). "Objective something," said Bonamy; and "common ground" and
               something else—all very long words, she noted. "Book learning does it," she thought
               to herself, and, as she thrust her arms into her jacket, heard something—might be the
               little table by the fire—fall; and then stamp, stamp, stamp—as if they were having at
               each other—round the room, making the plates dance.</p>
            <p>"To-morrow's breakfast, sir," she said, opening the door; and there were Sanders and
               Bonamy like two bulls of Bashan driving each other up and down, making such a racket,
               and all them chairs in the way. They never noticed her. She felt motherly towards
               them. "Your breakfast, sir," she said, as they came near. And Bonamy, all his hair
               touzled and his tie flying, broke off, <pb n="167" facs="pageImages/167.png"/>and pushed Sanders into the arm-chair, and
               said Mr. Sanders had smashed the coffee-pot and he was teaching Mr. Sanders—</p>
            <p>Sure enough, the coffee-pot lay broken on the hearthrug.</p>
            <p>"Any day this week except Thursday," wrote Miss Perry, and this was not the first
               invitation by any means. Were all Miss Perry's weeks blank with the exception of
               Thursday, and was her only desire to see her old friend's son? Time is issued to
               spinster ladies of wealth in long white ribbons. These they wind round and round,
               round and round, assisted by five female servants, a butler, a fine Mexican parrot,
               regular meals, Mudie's library, and friends dropping in. A little hurt she was
               already that Jacob had not called.</p>
            <p>"Your mother," she said, "is one of my oldest friends."</p>
            <p>Miss Rosseter, who was sitting by the fire, holding the Spectator between her cheek
               and the blaze, refused to have a fire screen, but finally accepted one. The weather
               was then discussed, for in deference to Parkes, who was opening little tables, graver
               matters were postponed. Miss <pb n="168" facs="pageImages/168.png"/>Rosseter drew Jacob's attention to the beauty of the
               cabinet.</p>
            <p>"So wonderfully clever in picking things up," she said. Miss Perry had found it in
               Yorkshire. The North of England was discussed. When Jacob spoke they both listened.
               Miss Perry was bethinking her of something suitable and manly to say when the door
               opened and Mr. Benson was announced. Now there were four people sitting in that room.
               Miss Perry aged 66; Miss Rosseter 42; Mr. Benson 38; and Jacob 25.</p>
            <p>"My old friend looks as well as ever," said Mr. Benson, tapping the bars of the
               parrot's cage; Miss Rosseter simultaneously praised the tea; Jacob handed the wrong
               plates; and Miss Perry signified her desire to approach more closely. "Your
               brothers," she began vaguely.</p>
            <p>"Archer and John," Jacob supplied her. Then to her pleasure she recovered Rebecca's
               name; and how one day "when you were all little boys, playing in the
               drawing-room—"</p>
            <p>"But Miss Perry has the kettle-holder," said Miss Rosseter, and indeed Miss Perry was
               clasping it to her breast. (Had she, then, loved Jacob's father?)</p>
            <p>"So clever"—"not so good as usual"—"I thought it most unfair," said Mr. Benson and
               <pb n="169" facs="pageImages/169.png"/>Miss Rosseter, discussing the Saturday Westminster. Did they not compete regularly
               for prizes? Had not Mr. Benson three times won a guinea, and Miss Rosseter once ten
               and sixpence? Of course Everard Benson had a weak heart, but still, to win prizes,
               remember parrots, toady Miss Perry, despise Miss Rosseter, give tea-parties in his
               rooms (which were in the style of Whistler, with pretty books on tables), all this,
               so Jacob felt without knowing him, made him a contemptible ass. As for Miss Rosseter,
               she had nursed cancer, and now painted water-colours.</p>
            <p>"Running away so soon?" said Miss Perry vaguely. "At home every afternoon, if you've
               nothing better to do—except Thursdays."</p>
            <p>"I've never known you desert your old ladies once," Miss Rosseter was saying, and Mr.
               Benson was stooping over the parrot's cage, and Miss Perry was moving towards the
               bell….</p>
            <p>The fire burnt clear between two pillars of greenish marble, and on the mantelpiece
               there was a green clock guarded by Britannia leaning on her spear. As for pictures—a
               maiden in a large hat offered roses over the garden gate to a <pb n="170" facs="pageImages/170.png"/>gentleman in
               eighteenth-century costume. A mastiff lay extended against a battered door. The lower
               panes of the windows were of ground glass, and the curtains, accurately looped, were
               of plush and green too.</p>
            <p>Laurette and Jacob sat with their toes in the fender side by side, in two large
               chairs covered in green plush. Laurette's skirts were short, her legs long, thin, and
               transparently covered. Her fingers stroked her ankles.</p>
            <p>"It's not exactly that I don't understand them," she was saying thoughtfully. "I must
               go and try again."</p>
            <p>"What time will you be there?" said Jacob.</p>
            <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>
            <p>"To-morrow?"</p>
            <p>No, not to-morrow.</p>
            <p>"This weather makes me long for the country," she said, looking over her shoulder at
               the back view of tall houses through the window.</p>
            <p>"I wish you'd been with me on Saturday," said Jacob.</p>
            <p>"I used to ride," she said. She got up gracefully, calmly. Jacob got up. She smiled
               at him. As she shut the door he put so many shillings on the mantelpiece.</p>
            <p>Altogether a most reasonable conversation; a most respectable room; an intelligent
               girl. <pb n="171" facs="pageImages/171.png"/>Only Madame herself seeing Jacob out had about her that leer, that lewdness,
               that quake of the surface (visible in the eyes chiefly), which threatens to spill the
               whole bag of ordure, with difficulty held together, over the pavement. In short,
               something was wrong.</p>
            <p>Not so very long ago the workmen had gilt the final "y" in Lord Macaulay's name, and
               the names stretched in unbroken file round the dome of the <placeName type="tgn" key="1100764">British Museum</placeName>. At a
               considerable depth beneath, many hundreds of the living sat at the spokes of a
               cart-wheel copying from printed books into manuscript books; now and then rising to
               consult the catalogue; regaining their places stealthily, while from time to time a
               silent man replenished their compartments.</p>
            <p>There was a little catastrophe. Miss Marchmont's pile overbalanced and fell into
               Jacob's compartment. Such things happened to Miss Marchmont. What was she seeking
               through millions of pages, in her old plush dress, and her wig of claret-coloured
               hair, with her gems and her chilblains? Sometimes one thing, sometimes another, to
               confirm her philosophy that <pb n="172" facs="pageImages/172.png"/>colour is sound—or, perhaps, it has something to do with
               music. She could never quite say, though it was not for lack of trying. And she could
               not ask you back to her room, for it was "not very clean, I'm afraid," so she must
               catch you in the passage, or take a chair in <placeName type="tgn" key="1102873">Hyde Park</placeName> to explain her philosophy. The
               rhythm of the soul depends on it—("how rude the little boys are!" she would say), and
               Mr. Asquith's Irish policy, and Shakespeare comes in, "and Queen Alexandra most
               graciously once acknowledged a copy of my pamphlet," she would say, waving the little
               boys magnificently away. But she needs funds to publish her book, for "publishers are
               capitalists—publishers are cowards." And so, digging her elbow into her pile of books
               it fell over.</p>
            <p>Jacob remained quite unmoved.</p>
            <p>But Fraser, the atheist, on the other side, detesting plush, more than once accosted
               with leaflets, shifted irritably. He abhorred vagueness—the Christian religion, for
               example, and old Dean Parker's pronouncements. Dean Parker wrote books and Fraser
               utterly destroyed them by force of logic and left his children unbaptized—his wife
               did it secretly in the washing basin—but Fraser ignored her, and went on supporting
               blasphemers, distributing leaflets, getting up his facts in the <placeName type="tgn" key="1100764">British Museum</placeName>,
               always in the same <pb n="173" facs="pageImages/173.png"/>check suit and fiery tie, but pale, spotted, irritable. Indeed,
               what a work—to destroy religion!</p>
            <p>Jacob transcribed a whole passage from Marlowe.</p>
            <p>Miss Julia Hedge, the feminist, waited for her books. They did not come. She wetted
               her pen. She looked about her. Her eye was caught by the final letters in Lord
               Macaulay's name. And she read them all round the dome—the names of great men which
               remind us—"Oh damn," said Julia Hedge, "why didn't they leave room for an Eliot or a
               Bronte?"</p>
            <p>Unfortunate Julia! wetting her pen in bitterness, and leaving her shoe laces untied.
               When her books came she applied herself to her gigantic labours, but perceived
               through one of the nerves of her exasperated sensibility how composedly,
               unconcernedly, and with every consideration the male readers applied themselves to
               theirs. That young man for example. What had he got to do except copy out poetry? And
               she must study statistics. There are more women than men. Yes; but if you let women
               work as men work, they'll die off much quicker. They'll become extinct. That was her
               argument. Death and gall and bitter dust were on her pen-tip; and as the afternoon
               wore on, red had worked into her cheek-bones and a light was in her eyes.</p>
            <p><pb n="174" facs="pageImages/174.png"/>But what brought Jacob Flanders to read Marlowe in the <placeName type="tgn" key="1100764">British Museum</placeName>? Youth,
               youth—something savage—something pedantic. For example, there is Mr. Masefield, there
               is Mr. Bennett. Stuff them into the flame of Marlowe and burn them to cinders. Let
               not a shred remain. Don't palter with the second rate. Detest your own age. Build a
               better one. And to set that on foot read incredibly dull essays upon Marlowe to your
               friends. For which purpose one most collate editions in the <placeName type="tgn" key="1100764">British Museum</placeName>. One must
               do the thing oneself. Useless to trust to the Victorians, who disembowel, or to the
               living, who are mere publicists. The flesh and blood of the future depends entirely
               upon six young men. And as Jacob was one of them, no doubt he looked a little regal
               and pompous as he turned his page, and Julia Hedge disliked him naturally enough.</p>
            <p>But then a pudding-faced man pushed a note towards Jacob, and Jacob, leaning back in
               his chair, began an uneasy murmured conversation, and they went off together (Julia
               Hedge watched them), and laughed aloud (she thought) directly they were in the
               hall.</p>
            <p>Nobody laughed in the reading-room. There were shirtings, murmurings, apologetic
               sneezes, <pb n="175" facs="pageImages/175.png"/>and sudden unashamed devastating coughs. The lesson hour was almost over.
               Ushers were collecting exercises. Lazy children wanted to stretch. Good ones
               scribbled assiduously—ah, another day over and so little done! And now and then was
               to be heard from the whole collection of human beings a heavy sigh, after which the
               humiliating old man would cough shamelessly, and Miss Marchmont hinnied like a
               horse.</p>
            <p>Jacob came back only in time to return his books.</p>
            <p>The books were now replaced. A few letters of the alphabet were sprinkled round the
               dome. Closely stood together in a ring round the dome were Plato, Aristotle,
               Sophocles, and Shakespeare; the literature of Rome, <placeName type="tgn" key="1000074">Greece</placeName>, China, India, Persia. One
               leaf of poetry was pressed flat against another leaf, one burnished letter laid
               smooth against another in a density of meaning, a conglomeration of loveliness.</p>
            <p>"One does want one's tea," said Miss Marchmont, reclaiming her shabby umbrella.</p>
            <p>Miss Marchmont wanted her tea, but could never resist a last look at the Elgin
               Marbles. She looked at them sideways, waving her hand and muttering a word or two of
               salutation which made Jacob and the other man turn round. She smiled at them amiably.
               It all came into her philosophy—that colour is sound, or perhaps it <pb n="176" facs="pageImages/176.png"/>has something to
               do with music. And having done her service, she hobbled off to tea. It was closing
               time. The public collected in the hall to receive their umbrellas.</p>
            <p>For the most part the students wait their turn very patiently. To stand and wait
               while some one examines white discs is soothing. The umbrella will certainly be
               found. But the fact leads you on all day through Macaulay, Hobbes, Gibbon; through
               octavos, quartos, folios; sinks deeper and deeper through ivory pages and <placeName type="tgn" key="1000179">Morocco</placeName>
               bindings into this density of thought, this conglomeration of knowledge.</p>
            <p>Jacob's walking-stick was like all the others; they had muddled the pigeon-holes
               perhaps.</p>
            <p>There is in the <placeName type="tgn" key="1100764">British Museum</placeName> an enormous mind. Consider that Plato is there cheek
               by jowl with Aristotle; and Shakespeare with Marlowe. This great mind is hoarded
               beyond the power of any single mind to possess it. Nevertheless (as they take so long
               finding one's walking-stick) one can't help thinking how one might come with a
               notebook, sit at a desk, and read it all through. A learned man is the most venerable
               of all—a man like Huxtable of Trinity, who writes all his letters in Greek, they say,
               and could have kept his end up with Bentley. And then there is science, pictures,
               architecture,—an enormous mind.</p>
            <p><pb n="177" facs="pageImages/177.png"/>They pushed the walking-stick across the counter. Jacob stood beneath the porch of
               the <placeName type="tgn" key="1100764">British Museum</placeName>. It was raining. Great Russell Street was glazed and shining—here
               yellow, here, outside the chemist's, red and pale blue. People scuttled quickly close
               to the wall; carriages rattled rather helter-skelter down the streets. Well, but a
               little rain hurts nobody. Jacob walked off much as if he had been in the country; and
               late that night there he was sitting at his table with his pipe and his book.</p>
            <p>The rain poured down. The <placeName type="tgn" key="1100764">British Museum</placeName> stood in one solid immense mound, very pale,
               very sleek in the rain, not a quarter of a mile from him. The vast mind was sheeted
               with stone; and each compartment in the depths of it was safe and dry. The
               night-watchmen, flashing their lanterns over the backs of Plato and Shakespeare, saw
               that on the twenty-second of February neither flame, rat, nor burglar was going to
               violate these treasures—poor, highly respectable men, with wives and families at
               Kentish Town, do their best for twenty years to protect Plato and Shakespeare, and
               then are buried at Highgate.</p>
            <p>Stone lies solid over the <placeName type="tgn" key="1100764">British Museum</placeName>, as bone lies cool over the visions and heat
               of the brain. Only here the brain is Plato's brain <pb n="178" facs="pageImages/178.png"/>and Shakespeare's; the brain has
               made pots and statues, great bulls and little jewels, and crossed the river of death
               this way and that incessantly, seeking some landing, now wrapping the body well for
               its long sleep; now laying a penny piece on the eyes; now turning the toes
               scrupulously to the East. Meanwhile, Plato continues his dialogue; in spite of the
               rain; in spite of the cab whistles; in spite of the woman in the mews behind Great
               Ormond Street who has come home drunk and cries all night long, "Let me in! Let me
               in!"</p>
            <p>In the street below Jacob's room voices were raised.</p>
            <p>But he read on. For after all Plato continues imperturbably. And Hamlet utters his
               soliloquy. And there the Elgin Marbles lie, all night long, old Jones's lantern
               sometimes recalling Ulysses, or a horse's head; or sometimes a flash of gold, or a
               mummy's sunk yellow cheek. Plato and Shakespeare continue; and Jacob, who was reading
               the Phaedrus, heard people vociferating round the lamp-post, and the woman battering
               at the door and crying, "Let me in!" as if a coal had dropped from the fire, or a
               fly, falling from the ceiling, had lain on its back, too weak to turn over.</p>
            <p>The Phaedrus is very difficult. And so, when <pb n="179" facs="pageImages/179.png"/>at length one reads straight ahead,
               falling into step, marching on, becoming (so it seems) momentarily part of this
               rolling, imperturbable energy, which has driven darkness before it since Plato walked
               the <placeName type="tgn" key="8712059">Acropolis</placeName>, it is impossible to see to the fire.</p>
            <p>The dialogue draws to its close. Plato's argument is done. Plato's argument is stowed
               away in Jacob's mind, and for five minutes Jacob's mind continues alone, onwards,
               into the darkness. Then, getting up, he parted the curtains, and saw, with
               astonishing clearness, how the Springetts opposite had gone to bed; how it rained;
               how the Jews and the foreign woman, at the end of the street, stood by the
               pillar-box, arguing.</p>
            <p>Every time the door opened and fresh people came in, those already in the room
               shifted slightly; those who were standing looked over their shoulders; those who were
               sitting stopped in the middle of sentences. What with the light, the wine, the
               strumming of a guitar, something exciting happened each time the door opened. Who was
               coming in?</p>
            <p>"That's Gibson."</p>
            <p><pb n="180" facs="pageImages/180.png"/>"The painter?"</p>
            <p>"But go on with what you were saying."</p>
            <p>They were saying something that was far, far too intimate to be said outright. But
               the noise of the voices served like a clapper in little Mrs. Withers's mind, scaring
               into the air blocks of small birds, and then they'd settle, and then she'd feel
               afraid, put one hand to her hair, bind both round her knees, and look up at Oliver
               Skelton nervously, and say:</p>
            <p>"Promise, PROMISE, you'll tell no one." … so considerate he was, so tender. It was
               her husband's character that she discussed. He was cold, she said.</p>
            <p>Down upon them came the splendid Magdalen, brown, warm, voluminous, scarcely brushing
               the grass with her sandalled feet. Her hair flew; pins seemed scarcely to attach the
               flying silks. An actress of course, a line of light perpetually beneath her. It was
               only "My dear" that she said, but her voice went jodelling between Alpine passes. And
               down she tumbled on the floor, and sang, since there was nothing to be said, round
               ah's and oh's. Mangin, the poet, coming up to her, stood looking down at her, drawing
               at his pipe. The dancing began.</p>
            <p>Grey-haired Mrs. Keymer asked Dick Graves to tell her who Mangin was, and said that
               she <pb n="181" facs="pageImages/181.png"/>had seen too much of this sort of thing in Paris (Magdalen had got upon his
               knees; now his pipe was in her mouth) to be shocked. "Who is that?" she said, staying
               her glasses when they came to Jacob, for indeed he looked quiet, not indifferent, but
               like some one on a beach, watching.</p>
            <p>"Oh, my dear, let me lean on you," gasped Helen Askew, hopping on one foot, for the
               silver cord round her ankle had worked loose. Mrs. Keymer turned and looked at the
               picture on the wall.</p>
            <p>"Look at Jacob," said Helen (they were binding his eyes for some game).</p>
            <p>And Dick Graves, being a little drunk, very faithful, and very simple-minded, told
               her that he thought Jacob the greatest man he had ever known. And down they sat
               cross-legged upon cushions and talked about Jacob, and Helen's voice trembled, for
               they both seemed heroes to her, and the friendship between them so much more
               beautiful than women's friendships. Anthony Pollett now asked her to dance, and as
               she danced she looked at them, over her shoulder, standing at the table, drinking
               together.</p>
            <p><pb n="182" facs="pageImages/182.png"/>The magnificent world—the live, sane, vigorous world …. These words refer to the
               stretch of wood pavement between Hammersmith and Holborn in January between two and
               three in the morning. That was the ground beneath Jacob's feet. It was healthy and
               magnificent because one room, above a mews, somewhere near the river, contained fifty
               excited, talkative, friendly people. And then to stride over the pavement (there was
               scarcely a cab or policeman in sight) is of itself exhilarating. The long loop of
               Piccadilly, diamond-stitched, shows to best advantage when it is empty. A young man
               has nothing to fear. On the contrary, though he may not have said anything brilliant,
               he feels pretty confident he can hold his own. He was pleased to have met Mangin; he
               admired the young woman on the floor; he liked them all; he liked that sort of thing.
               In short, all the drums and trumpets were sounding. The street scavengers were the
               only people about at the moment. It is scarcely necessary to say how well-disposed
               Jacob felt towards them; how it pleased him to let himself in with his latch-key at
               his own door; how he seemed to bring back with him into the empty room ten or eleven
               people whom he had not known when he set out; how he looked about for something to
               <pb n="183" facs="pageImages/183.png"/>read, and found it, and never read it, and fell asleep.</p>
            <p>Indeed, drums and trumpets is no phrase. Indeed, Piccadilly and Holborn, and the
               empty sitting-room and the sitting-room with fifty people in it are liable at any
               moment to blow music into the air. Women perhaps are more excitable than men. It is
               seldom that any one says anything about it, and to see the hordes crossing Waterloo
               Bridge to catch the non-stop to <placeName type="tgn" key="1005687">Surbiton</placeName> one might think that reason impelled them.
               No, no. It is the drums and trumpets. Only, should you turn aside into one of those
               little bays on Waterloo Bridge to think the matter over, it will probably seem to you
               all a muddle—all a mystery.</p>
            <p>They cross the Bridge incessantly. Sometimes in the midst of carts and omnibuses a
               lorry will appear with great forest trees chained to it. Then, perhaps, a mason's van
               with newly lettered tombstones recording how some one loved some one who is buried at
               <placeName type="tgn" key="7012091">Putney</placeName>. Then the motor car in front jerks forward, and the tombstones pass too quick
               for you to read more. All the time the stream of people never ceases passing <pb n="184" facs="pageImages/184.png"/>from the
               Surrey side to the Strand; from the Strand to the Surrey side. It seems as if the
               poor had gone raiding the town, and now trapesed back to their own quarters, like
               beetles scurrying to their holes, for that old woman fairly hobbles towards Waterloo,
               grasping a shiny bag, as if she had been out into the light and now made off with
               some scraped chicken bones to her hovel underground. On the other hand, though the
               wind is rough and blowing in their faces, those girls there, striding hand in hand,
               shouting out a song, seem to feel neither cold nor shame. They are hatless. They
               triumph.</p>
            <p>The wind has blown up the waves. The river races beneath us, and the men standing on
               the barges have to lean all their weight on the tiller. A black tarpaulin is tied
               down over a swelling load of gold. Avalanches of coal glitter blackly. As usual,
               painters are slung on planks across the great riverside hotels, and the hotel windows
               have already points of light in them. On the other side the city is white as if with
               age; St. Paul's swells white above the fretted, pointed, or oblong buildings beside
               it. The cross alone shines rosy-gilt. But what century have we reached? Has this
               procession from the Surrey side to the Strand gone on for ever? That old man has been
               crossing the <pb n="185" facs="pageImages/185.png"/>Bridge these six hundred years, with the rabble of little boys at his
               heels, for he is drunk, or blind with misery, and tied round with old clouts of
               clothing such as pilgrims might have worn. He shuffles on. No one stands still. It
               seems as if we marched to the sound of music; perhaps the wind and the river; perhaps
               these same drums and trumpets—the ecstasy and hubbub of the soul. Why, even the
               unhappy laugh, and the policeman, far from judging the drunk man, surveys him
               humorously, and the little boys scamper back again, and the clerk from Somerset House
               has nothing but tolerance for him, and the man who is reading half a page of Lothair
               at the bookstall muses charitably, with his eyes off the print, and the girl
               hesitates at the crossing and turns on him the bright yet vague glance of the
               young.</p>
            <p>Bright yet vague. She is perhaps twenty-two. She is shabby. She crosses the road and
               looks at the daffodils and the red tulips in the florist's window. She hesitates, and
               makes off in the direction of Temple Bar. She walks fast, and yet anything distracts
               her. Now she seems to see, and now to notice nothing.</p>

            <p><pb n="186" facs="pageImages/186.png"/>Through the disused graveyard in the parish of <placeName type="tgn" key="1005504">St. Pancras</placeName>, Fanny Elmer strayed
               between the white tombs which lean against the wall, crossing the grass to read a
               name, hurrying on when the grave-keeper approached, hurrying into the street, pausing
               now by a window with blue china, now quickly making up for lost time, abruptly
               entering a baker's shop, buying rolls, adding cakes, going on again so that any one
               wishing to follow must fairly trot. She was not drably shabby, though. She wore silk
               stockings, and silver-buckled shoes, only the red feather in her hat drooped, and the
               clasp of her bag was weak, for out fell a copy of Madame Tussaud's programme as she
               walked. She had the ankles of a stag. Her face was hidden. Of course, in this dusk,
               rapid movements, quick glances, and soaring hopes come naturally enough. She passed
               right beneath Jacob's window.</p>
            <p>The house was flat, dark, and silent. Jacob <pb n="187" facs="pageImages/187.png"/>was at home engaged upon a chess problem,
               the board being on a stool between his knees. One hand was fingering the hair at the
               back of his head. He slowly brought it forward and raised the white queen from her
               square; then put her down again on the same spot. He filled his pipe; ruminated;
               moved two pawns; advanced the white knight; then ruminated with one finger upon the
               bishop. Now Fanny Elmer passed beneath the window.</p>
            <p>She was on her way to sit to Nick Bramham the painter.</p>
            <p>She sat in a flowered Spanish shawl, holding in her hand a yellow novel.</p>
            <p>"A little lower, a little looser, so—better, that's right," Bramham mumbled, who was
               drawing her, and smoking at the same time, and was naturally speechless. His head
               might have been the work of a sculptor, who had squared the forehead, stretched the
               mouth, and left marks of his thumbs and streaks from his fingers in the clay. But the
               eyes had never been shut. They were rather prominent, and rather bloodshot, as if
               from staring and staring, and when he spoke they looked for a second disturbed, but
               went on staring. An unshaded electric light hung above her head.</p>
            <p><pb n="188" facs="pageImages/188.png"/>As for the beauty of women, it is like the light on the sea, never constant to a
               single wave. They all have it; they all lose it. Now she is dull and thick as bacon;
               now transparent as a hanging glass. The fixed faces are the dull ones. Here comes
               Lady Venice displayed like a monument for admiration, but carved in alabaster, to be
               set on the mantelpiece and never dusted. A dapper brunette complete from head to foot
               serves only as an illustration to lie upon the drawing-room table. The women in the
               streets have the faces of playing cards; the outlines accurately filled in with pink
               or yellow, and the line drawn tightly round them. Then, at a top-floor window,
               leaning out, looking down, you see beauty itself; or in the corner of an omnibus; or
               squatted in a ditch—beauty glowing, suddenly expressive, withdrawn the moment after.
               No one can count on it or seize it or have it wrapped in paper. Nothing is to be won
               from the shops, and Heaven knows it would be better to sit at home than haunt the
               plate-glass windows in the hope of lifting the shining green, the glowing ruby, out
               of them alive. Sea glass in a saucer loses its lustre no sooner than silks do. Thus
               if you talk of a beautiful woman you mean only something flying fast which for a
               second uses the eyes, lips, or <pb n="189" facs="pageImages/189.png"/>cheeks of Fanny Elmer, for example, to glow
               through.</p>
            <p>She was not beautiful, as she sat stiffly; her underlip too prominent; her nose too
               large; her eyes too near together. She was a thin girl, with brilliant cheeks and
               dark hair, sulky just now, or stiff with sitting. When Bramham snapped his stick of
               charcoal she started. Bramham was out of temper. He squatted before the gas fire
               warming his hands. Meanwhile she looked at his drawing. He grunted. Fanny threw on a
               dressing-gown and boiled a kettle.</p>
            <p>"By God, it's bad," said Bramham.</p>
            <p>Fanny dropped on to the floor, clasped her hands round her knees, and looked at him,
               her beautiful eyes—yes, beauty, flying through the room, shone there for a second.
               Fanny's eyes seemed to question, to commiserate, to be, for a second, love itself.
               But she exaggerated. Bramham noticed nothing. And when the kettle boiled, up she
               scrambled, more like a colt or a puppy than a loving woman.</p>
            <p>Now Jacob walked over to the window and <pb n="190" facs="pageImages/190.png"/>stood with his hands in his pockets. Mr.
               Springett opposite came out, looked at his shop window, and went in again. The
               children drifted past, eyeing the pink sticks of sweetstuff. Pickford's van swung
               down the street. A small boy twirled from a rope. Jacob turned away. Two minutes
               later he opened the front door, and walked off in the direction of Holborn.</p>
            <p>Fanny Elmer took down her cloak from the hook. Nick Bramham unpinned his drawing and
               rolled it under his arm. They turned out the lights and set off down the street,
               holding on their way through all the people, motor cars, omnibuses, carts, until they
               reached Leicester Square, five minutes before Jacob reached it, for his way was
               slightly longer, and he had been stopped by a block in Holborn waiting to see the
               King drive by, so that Nick and Fanny were already leaning over the barrier in the
               promenade at the Empire when Jacob pushed through the swing doors and took his place
               beside them.</p>
            <p>"Hullo, never noticed you," said Nick, five minutes later.</p>
            <p>"Bloody rot," said Jacob.</p>
            <p><pb n="191" facs="pageImages/191.png"/>"Miss Elmer," said Nick.</p>
            <p>Jacob took his pipe out of his mouth very awkwardly.</p>
            <p>Very awkward he was. And when they sat upon a plush sofa and let the smoke go up
               between them and the stage, and heard far off the high-pitched voices and the jolly
               orchestra breaking in opportunely he was still awkward, only Fanny thought: "What a
               beautiful voice!" She thought how little he said yet how firm it was. She thought how
               young men are dignified and aloof, and how unconscious they are, and how quietly one
               might sit beside Jacob and look at him. And how childlike he would be, come in tired
               of an evening, she thought, and how majestic; a little overbearing perhaps; "But I
               wouldn't give way," she thought. He got up and leant over the barrier. The smoke hung
               about him.</p>
            <p>And for ever the beauty of young men seems to be set in smoke, however lustily they
               chase footballs, or drive cricket balls, dance, run, or stride along roads. Possibly
               they are soon to lose it. Possibly they look into the eyes of faraway heroes, and
               take their station among us half contemptuously, she thought (vibrating like a
               fiddle-string, to be played on and snapped). Anyhow, they love silence, and speak
               beautifully, each word falling like a disc new cut, not a hubble-bubble <pb n="192" facs="pageImages/192.png"/>of small
               smooth coins such as girls use; and they move decidedly, as if they knew how long to
               stay and when to go—oh, but Mr. Flanders was only gone to get a programme.</p>
            <p>"The dancers come right at the end," he said, coming back to them.</p>
            <p>And isn't it pleasant, Fanny went on thinking, how young men bring out lots of silver
               coins from their trouser pockets, and look at them, instead of having just so many in
               a purse?</p>
            <p>Then there she was herself, whirling across the stage in white flounces, and the
               music was the dance and fling of her own soul, and the whole machinery, rock and gear
               of the world was spun smoothly into those swift eddies and falls, she felt, as she
               stood rigid leaning over the barrier two feet from Jacob Flanders.</p>
            <p>Her screwed-up black glove dropped to the floor. When Jacob gave it her, she started
               angrily. For never was there a more irrational passion. And Jacob was afraid of her
               for a moment—so violent, so dangerous is it when young women stand rigid; grasp the
               barrier; fall in love.</p>
            <p><pb n="193" facs="pageImages/193.png"/>It was the middle of February. The roofs of <placeName type="tgn" key="4012696">Hampstead Garden Suburb</placeName> lay in a
               tremulous haze. It was too hot to walk. A dog barked, barked, barked down in the
               hollow. The liquid shadows went over the plain.</p>
            <p>The body after long illness is languid, passive, receptive of sweetness, but too weak
               to contain it. The tears well and fall as the dog barks in the hollow, the children
               skim after hoops, the country darkens and brightens. Beyond a veil it seems. Ah, but
               draw the veil thicker lest I faint with sweetness, Fanny Elmer sighed, as she sat on
               a bench in Judges Walk looking at <placeName type="tgn" key="4012696">Hampstead Garden Suburb</placeName>. But the dog went on
               barking. The motor cars hooted on the road. She heard a far-away rush and humming.
               Agitation was at her heart. Up she got and walked. The grass was freshly green; the
               sun hot. All round the pond children were stooping to launch little boats; or were
               drawn back screaming by their nurses.</p>
            <p>At mid-day young women walk out into the air. All the men are busy in the town. They
               stand by the edge of the blue pond. The fresh wind scatters the children's voices all
               about. My children, thought Fanny Elmer. The women stand round the pond, beating off
               great prancing shaggy dogs. Gently the baby is <pb n="194" facs="pageImages/194.png"/>rocked in the perambulator. The eyes
               of all the nurses, mothers, and wandering women are a little glazed, absorbed. They
               gently nod instead of answering when the little boys tug at their skirts, begging
               them to move on.</p>
            <p>And Fanny moved, hearing some cry—a workman's whistle perhaps—high in mid-air. Now,
               among the trees, it was the thrush trilling out into the warm air a flutter of
               jubilation, but fear seemed to spur him, Fanny thought; as if he too were anxious
               with such joy at his heart—as if he were watched as he sang, and pressed by tumult to
               sing. There! Restless, he flew to the next tree. She heard his song more faintly.
               Beyond it was the humming of the wheels and the wind rushing.</p>
            <p>She spent tenpence on lunch.</p>
            <p>"Dear, miss, she's left her umbrella," grumbled the mottled woman in the glass box
               near the door at the Express Dairy Company's shop.</p>
            <p>"Perhaps I'll catch her," answered Milly Edwards, the waitress with the pale plaits
               of hair; and she dashed through the door.</p>
            <p>"No good," she said, coming back a moment later with Fanny's cheap umbrella. She put
               her hand to her plaits.</p>
            <p><pb n="195" facs="pageImages/195.png"/>"Oh, that door!" grumbled the cashier.</p>
            <p>Her hands were cased in black mittens, and the finger-tips that drew in the paper
               slips were swollen as sausages.</p>
            <p>"Pie and greens for one. Large coffee and crumpets. Eggs on toast. Two fruit
               cakes."</p>
            <p>Thus the sharp voices of the waitresses snapped. The lunchers heard their orders
               repeated with approval; saw the next table served with anticipation. Their own eggs
               on toast were at last delivered. Their eyes strayed no more.</p>
            <p>Damp cubes of pastry fell into mouths opened like triangular bags.</p>
            <p>Nelly Jenkinson, the typist, crumbled her cake indifferently enough. Every time the
               door opened she looked up. What did she expect to see? The coal merchant read the
               Telegraph without stopping, missed the saucer, and, feeling abstractedly, put the cup
               down on the table-cloth.</p>
            <p>"Did you ever hear the like of that for impertinence?" Mrs. Parsons wound up,
               brushing the crumbs from her furs.</p>
            <p>"Hot milk and scone for one. Pot of tea. Roll and butter," cried the waitresses.</p>
            <p>The door opened and shut.</p>
            <p><pb n="196" facs="pageImages/196.png"/>Such is the life of the elderly.</p>
            <p>It is curious, lying in a boat, to watch the waves. Here are three coming regularly
               one after another, all much of a size. Then, hurrying after them comes a fourth, very
               large and menacing; it lifts the boat; on it goes; somehow merges without
               accomplishing anything; flattens itself out with the rest.</p>
            <p>What can be more violent than the fling of boughs in a gale, the tree yielding itself
               all up the trunk, to the very tip of the branch, streaming and shuddering the way the
               wind blows, yet never flying in dishevelment away? The corn squirms and abases itself
               as if preparing to tug itself free from the roots, and yet is tied down.</p>
            <p>Why, from the very windows, even in the dusk, you see a swelling run through the
               street, an aspiration, as with arms outstretched, eyes desiring, mouths agape. And
               then we peaceably subside. For if the exaltation lasted we should be blown like foam
               into the air. The stars would shine through us. We should go down the gale in salt
               drops—as sometimes happens. For the impetuous spirits will have none of this
               cradling. Never any swaying or aimlessly lolling <pb n="197" facs="pageImages/197.png"/>for them. Never any making believe,
               or lying cosily, or genially supposing that one is much like another, fire warm, wine
               pleasant, extravagance a sin.</p>
            <p>"People are so nice, once you know them."</p>
            <p>"I couldn't think ill of her. One must remember—" But Nick perhaps, or Fanny Elmer,
               believing implicitly in the truth of the moment, fling off, sting the cheek, are gone
               like sharp hail.</p>
            <p>"Oh," said Fanny, bursting into the studio three-quarters of an hour late because she
               had been hanging about the neighbourhood of the Foundling Hospital merely for the
               chance of seeing Jacob walk down the street, take out his latch-key, and open the
               door, "I'm afraid I'm late"; upon which Nick said nothing and Fanny grew defiant.</p>
            <p>"I'll never come again!" she cried at length.</p>
            <p>"Don't, then," Nick replied, and off she ran without so much as good-night.</p>
            <p>How exquisite it was—that dress in Evelina's shop off Shaftesbury Avenue! It was four
               o'clock on a fine day early in April, and was <pb n="198" facs="pageImages/198.png"/>Fanny the one to spend four o'clock on
               a fine day indoors? Other girls in that very street sat over ledgers, or drew long
               threads wearily between silk and gauze; or, festooned with ribbons in Swan and
               Edgars, rapidly added up pence and farthings on the back of the bill and twisted the
               yard and three-quarters in tissue paper and asked "Your pleasure?" of the next
               comer.</p>
            <p>In Evelina's shop off Shaftesbury Avenue the parts of a woman were shown separate. In
               the left hand was her skirt. Twining round a pole in the middle was a feather boa.
               Ranged like the heads of malefactors on Temple Bar were hats—emerald and white,
               lightly wreathed or drooping beneath deep-dyed feathers. And on the carpet were her
               feet—pointed gold, or patent leather slashed with scarlet.</p>
            <p>Feasted upon by the eyes of women, the clothes by four o'clock were flyblown like
               sugar cakes in a baker's window. Fanny eyed them too. But coming along Gerrard Street
               was a tall man in a shabby coat. A shadow fell across Evelina's window—Jacob's
               shadow, though it was not Jacob. And Fanny turned and walked along Gerrard Street and
               wished that she had read books. Nick never read books, never talked of <placeName type="tgn" key="1000078">Ireland</placeName>, or
               the House of Lords; and as for his finger-nails! She would learn Latin and <pb n="199" facs="pageImages/199.png"/>read
               Virgil. She had been a great reader. She had read Scott; she had read Dumas. At the
               Slade no one read. But no one knew Fanny at the Slade, or guessed how empty it seemed
               to her; the passion for ear-rings, for dances, for Tonks and Steer—when it was only
               the French who could paint, Jacob said. For the moderns were futile; painting the
               least respectable of the arts; and why read anything but Marlowe and Shakespeare,
               Jacob said, and Fielding if you must read novels?</p>
            <p>"Fielding," said Fanny, when the man in Charing Cross Road asked her what book she
               wanted.</p>
            <p>She bought Tom Jones.</p>
            <p>At ten o'clock in the morning, in a room which she shared with a school teacher,
               Fanny Elmer read Tom Jones—that mystic book. For this dull stuff (Fanny thought)
               about people with odd names is what Jacob likes. Good people like it. Dowdy women who
               don't mind how they cross their legs read Tom Jones—a mystic book; for there is
               something, Fanny thought, about books which if I had been educated I could have
               liked—much better than ear-rings and flowers, she sighed, thinking of the corridors
               at the Slade and the fancy-dress dance next week. She had nothing to wear.</p>
            <p><pb n="200" facs="pageImages/200.png"/>They are real, thought Fanny Elmer, setting her feet on the mantelpiece. Some people
               are. Nick perhaps, only he was so stupid. And women never—except Miss Sargent, but
               she went off at lunch-time and gave herself airs. There they sat quietly of a night
               reading, she thought. Not going to music-halls; not looking in at shop windows; not
               wearing each other's clothes, like Robertson who had worn her shawl, and she had worn
               his waistcoat, which Jacob could only do very awkwardly; for he liked Tom Jones.</p>
            <p>There it lay on her lap, in double columns, price three and sixpence; the mystic book
               in which Henry Fielding ever so many years ago rebuked Fanny Elmer for feasting on
               scarlet, in perfect prose, Jacob said. For he never read modern novels. He liked Tom
               Jones.</p>
            <p>"I do like Tom Jones," said Fanny, at five-thirty that same day early in April when
               Jacob took out his pipe in the arm-chair opposite. Alas, women lie! But not Clara
               Durrant. A flawless mind; a candid nature; a virgin chained to a rock (somewhere off
               Lowndes Square) eternally pouring out tea for old men in white waistcoats, blue-eyed,
               looking you straight in the face, playing Bach. Of all women, Jacob honoured her
               most. But to sit at a table with bread and <pb n="201" facs="pageImages/201.png"/>butter, with dowagers in velvet, and never
               say more to Clara Durrant than Benson said to the parrot when old Miss Perry poured
               out tea, was an insufferable outrage upon the liberties and decencies of human
               nature—or words to that effect. For Jacob said nothing. Only he glared at the fire.
               Fanny laid down Tom Jones.</p>
            <p>She stitched or knitted.</p>
            <p>"What's that?" asked Jacob.</p>
            <p>"For the dance at the Slade."</p>
            <p>And she fetched her head-dress; her trousers; her shoes with red tassels. What should
               she wear?</p>
            <p>"I shall be in Paris," said Jacob.</p>
            <p>And what is the point of fancy-dress dances? thought Fanny. You meet the same people;
               you wear the same clothes; Mangin gets drunk; Florinda sits on his knee. She flirts
               outrageously—with Nick Bramham just now.</p>
            <p>"In Paris?" said Fanny.</p>
            <p>"On my way to <placeName type="tgn" key="1000074">Greece</placeName>," he replied.</p>
            <p>For, he said, there is nothing so detestable as <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName> in May.</p>
            <p>He would forget her.</p>
            <p>A sparrow flew past the window trailing a straw—a straw from a stack stood by a barn
               in a farmyard. The old brown spaniel snuffs at the base for a rat. Already the upper
               branches <pb n="202" facs="pageImages/202.png"/>of the elm trees are blotted with nests. The chestnuts have flirted their
               fans. And the butterflies are flaunting across the rides in the Forest. Perhaps the
               Purple Emperor is feasting, as Morris says, upon a mass of putrid carrion at the base
               of an oak tree.</p>
            <p>Fanny thought it all came from Tom Jones. He could go alone with a book in his pocket
               and watch the badgers. He would take a train at eight-thirty and walk all night. He
               saw fire-flies, and brought back glow-worms in pill-boxes. He would hunt with the New
               Forest Staghounds. It all came from Tom Jones; and he would go to <placeName type="tgn" key="1000074">Greece</placeName> with a book
               in his pocket and forget her.</p>
            <p>She fetched her hand-glass. There was her face. And suppose one wreathed Jacob in a
               turban? There was his face. She lit the lamp. But as the daylight came through the
               window only half was lit up by the lamp. And though he looked terrible and
               magnificent and would chuck the Forest, he said, and come to the Slade, and be a
               Turkish knight or a Roman emperor (and he let her blacken his lips and clenched his
               teeth and scowled in the glass), still—there lay Tom Jones.</p>

            <p><pb n="203" facs="pageImages/203.png"/>"Archer," said Mrs. Flanders with that tenderness which mothers so often display
               towards their eldest sons, "will be at Gibraltar to-morrow."</p>
            <p>The post for which she was waiting (strolling up Dods Hill while the random church
               bells swung a hymn tune about her head, the clock striking four straight through the
               circling notes; the glass purpling under a storm-cloud; and the two dozen houses of
               the village cowering, infinitely humble, in company under a leaf of shadow), the
               post, with all its variety of messages, envelopes addressed in bold hands, in
               slanting hands, stamped now with English stamps, again with Colonial stamps, or
               sometimes hastily dabbed with a yellow bar, the post was about to scatter a myriad
               messages over the world. Whether we gain or not by this habit of profuse
               communication it is not for us to say. But that letter-writing is practised
               mendaciously nowadays, particularly by young men travelling in foreign parts, seems
               likely enough.</p>
            <p><pb n="204" facs="pageImages/204.png"/>For example, take this scene.</p>
            <p>Here was Jacob Flanders gone abroad and staying to break his journey in Paris. (Old
               Miss Birkbeck, his mother's cousin, had died last June and left him a hundred
               pounds.)</p>
            <p>"You needn't repeat the whole damned thing over again, Cruttendon," said Mallinson,
               the little bald painter who was sitting at a marble table, splashed with coffee and
               ringed with wine, talking very fast, and undoubtedly more than a little drunk.</p>
            <p>"Well, Flanders, finished writing to your lady?" said Cruttendon, as Jacob came and
               took his seat beside them, holding in his hand an envelope addressed to Mrs.
               Flanders, near <placeName type="tgn" key="7010063">Scarborough</placeName>, England.</p>
            <p>"Do you uphold Velasquez?" said Cruttendon.</p>
            <p>"By God, he does," said Mallinson.</p>
            <p>"He always gets like this," said Cruttendon irritably.</p>
            <p>Jacob looked at Mallinson with excessive composure.</p>
            <p>"I'll tell you the three greatest things that were ever written in the whole of
               literature," <pb n="205" facs="pageImages/205.png"/>Cruttendon burst out. "'Hang there like fruit my soul.'" he began….</p>
            <p>"Don't listen to a man who don't like Velasquez," said Mallinson.</p>
            <p>"Adolphe, don't give Mr. Mallinson any more wine," said Cruttendon.</p>
            <p>"Fair play, fair play," said Jacob judicially. "Let a man get drunk if he likes.
               That's Shakespeare, Cruttendon. I'm with you there. Shakespeare had more guts than
               all these damned frogs put together. 'Hang there like fruit my soul,'" he began
               quoting, in a musical rhetorical voice, flourishing his wine-glass. "The devil damn
               you black, you cream-faced loon!" he exclaimed as the wine washed over the rim.</p>
            <p>"'Hang there like fruit my soul,'" Cruttendon and Jacob both began again at the same
               moment, and both burst out laughing.</p>
            <p>"Curse these flies," said Mallinson, flicking at his bald head. "What do they take me
               for?"</p>
            <p>"Something sweet-smelling," said Cruttendon.</p>
            <p>"Shut up, Cruttendon," said Jacob. "The fellow has no manners," he explained to
               Mallinson very politely. "Wants to cut people off their drink. Look here. I want
               grilled bone. What's the French for grilled bone? Grilled bone, Adolphe. Now you
               juggins, don't you understand?"</p>
            <p><pb n="206" facs="pageImages/206.png"/>"And I'll tell you, Flanders, the second most beautiful thing in the whole of
               literature," said Cruttendon, bringing his feet down on to the floor, and leaning
               right across the table, so that his face almost touched Jacob's face.</p>
            <p>"'Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle,'" Mallinson interrupted, strumming his
               fingers on the table. "The most ex-qui-sitely beautiful thing in the whole of
               literature…. Cruttendon is a very good fellow," he remarked confidentially. "But he's
               a bit of a fool." And he jerked his head forward.</p>
            <p>Well, not a word of this was ever told to Mrs. Flanders; nor what happened when they
               paid the bill and left the restaurant, and walked along the Boulevard Raspaille.</p>
            <p>Then here is another scrap of conversation; the time about eleven in the morning; the
               scene a studio; and the day Sunday.</p>
            <p>"I tell you, Flanders," said Cruttendon, "I'd as soon have one of Mallinson's little
               <pb n="207" facs="pageImages/207.png"/>pictures as a Chardin. And when I say that …" he squeezed the tail of an emaciated
               tube … "Chardin was a great swell…. He sells 'em to pay his dinner now. But wait till
               the dealers get hold of him. A great swell—oh, a very great swell."</p>
            <p>"It's an awfully pleasant life," said Jacob, "messing away up here. Still, it's a
               stupid art, Cruttendon." He wandered off across the room. "There's this man, Pierre
               Louys now." He took up a book. "Now my good sir, are you going to settle down?" said
               Cruttendon.</p>
            <p>"That's a solid piece of work," said Jacob, standing a canvas on a chair.</p>
            <p>"Oh, that I did ages ago," said Cruttendon, looking over his shoulder.</p>
            <p>"You're a pretty competent painter in my opinion," said Jacob after a time.</p>
            <p>"Now if you'd like to see what I'm after at the present moment," said Cruttendon,
               putting a canvas before Jacob. "There. That's it. That's more like it. That's …" he
               squirmed his thumb in a circle round a lamp globe painted white.</p>
            <p>"A pretty solid piece of work," said Jacob, straddling his legs in front of it. "But
               what I wish you'd explain …"</p>
            <p><pb n="208" facs="pageImages/208.png"/>Miss Jinny Carslake, pale, freckled, morbid, came into the room.</p>
            <p>"Oh Jinny, here's a friend. Flanders. An Englishman. Wealthy. Highly connected. Go
               on, Flanders…."</p>
            <p>Jacob said nothing.</p>
            <p>"It's THAT—that's not right," said Jinny Carslake.</p>
            <p>"No," said Cruttendon decidedly. "Can't be done."</p>
            <p>He took the canvas off the chair and stood it on the floor with its back to them.</p>
            <p>"Sit down, ladies and gentlemen. Miss Carslake comes from your part of the world,
               Flanders. From <placeName type="tgn" key="7012077">Devonshire</placeName>. Oh, I thought you said <placeName type="tgn" key="7012077">Devonshire</placeName>. Very well. She's a
               daughter of the church too. The black sheep of the family. Her mother writes her such
               letters. I say—have you one about you? It's generally Sundays they come. Sort of
               church-bell effect, you know."</p>
            <p>"Have you met all the painter men?" said Jinny. "Was Mallinson drunk? If you go to
               his studio he'll give you one of his pictures. I say, Teddy…."</p>
            <p>"Half a jiff," said Cruttendon. "What's the season of the year?" He looked out of the
               window.</p>
            <p><pb n="209" facs="pageImages/209.png"/>"We take a day off on Sundays, Flanders."</p>
            <p>"Will he …" said Jinny, looking at Jacob. "You …"</p>
            <p>"Yes, he'll come with us," said Cruttendon.</p>
            <p>And then, here is Versailles. Jinny stood on the stone rim and leant over the pond,
               clasped by Cruttendon's arms or she would have fallen in. "There! There!" she cried.
               "Right up to the top!" Some sluggish, sloping-shouldered fish had floated up from the
               depths to nip her crumbs. "You look," she said, jumping down. And then the dazzling
               white water, rough and throttled, shot up into the air. The fountain spread itself.
               Through it came the sound of military music far away. All the water was puckered with
               drops. A blue air-ball gently bumped the surface. How all the nurses and children and
               old men and young crowded to the edge, leant over and waved their sticks! The little
               girl ran stretching her arms towards her air-ball, but it sank beneath the
               fountain.</p>
            <p><pb n="210" facs="pageImages/210.png"/>Edward Cruttendon, Jinny Carslake, and Jacob Flanders walked in a row along the
               yellow gravel path; got on to the grass; so passed under the trees; and came out at
               the summer-house where Marie Antoinette used to drink chocolate. In went Edward and
               Jinny, but Jacob waited outside, sitting on the handle of his walking-stick. Out they
               came again.</p>
            <p>"Well?" said Cruttendon, smiling at Jacob.</p>
            <p>Jinny waited; Edward waited; and both looked at Jacob.</p>
            <p>"Well?" said Jacob, smiling and pressing both hands on his stick.</p>
            <p>"Come along," he decided; and started off. The others followed him, smiling.</p>
            <p>And then they went to the little cafe in the by-street where people sit drinking
               coffee, watching the soldiers, meditatively knocking ashes into trays.</p>
            <p>"But he's quite different," said Jinny, folding her hands over the top of her glass.
               "I don't suppose you know what Ted means when he says a thing like that," she said,
               looking at Jacob. <pb n="211" facs="pageImages/211.png"/>"But I do. Sometimes I could kill myself. Sometimes he lies in bed
               all day long—just lies there…. I don't want you right on the table"; she waved her
               hands. Swollen iridescent pigeons were waddling round their feet.</p>
            <p>"Look at that woman's hat," said Cruttendon. "How do they come to think of it? … No,
               Flanders, I don't think I could live like you. When one walks down that street
               opposite the <placeName type="tgn" key="1100764">British Museum</placeName>—what's it called?—that's what I mean. It's all like that.
               Those fat women—and the man standing in the middle of the road as if he were going to
               have a fit …"</p>
            <p>"Everybody feeds them," said Jinny, waving the pigeons away. "They're stupid old
               things."</p>
            <p>"Well, I don't know," said Jacob, smoking his cigarette. "There's St. Paul's." "I
               mean going to an office," said Cruttendon.</p>
            <p>"Hang it all," Jacob expostulated.</p>
            <p>"But you don't count," said Jinny, looking at Cruttendon. "You're mad. I mean, you
               just think of painting."</p>
            <p>"Yes, I know. I can't help it. I say, will King George give way about the peers?"</p>
            <p>"He'll jolly well have to," said Jacob.</p>
            <p>"There!" said Jinny. "He really knows."</p>
            <p>"You see, I would if I could," said Cruttendon, "but I simply can't."</p>
            <p><pb n="212" facs="pageImages/212.png"/>"I THINK I could," said Jinny. "Only, it's all the people one dislikes who do it. At
               home, I mean. They talk of nothing else. Even people like my mother."</p>
            <p>"Now if I came and lived here—-" said Jacob. "What's my share, Cruttendon? Oh, very
               well. Have it your own way. Those silly birds, directly one wants them—they've flown
               away."</p>
            <p>And finally under the arc lamps in the <placeName type="tgn" key="7002980">Gare des Invalides</placeName>, with one of those queer
               movements which are so slight yet so definite, which may wound or pass unnoticed but
               generally inflict a good deal of discomfort, Jinny and Cruttendon drew together;
               Jacob stood apart. They had to separate. Something must be said. Nothing was said. A
               man wheeled a trolley past Jacob's legs so near that he almost grazed them. When
               Jacob recovered his balance the other two were turning away, though Jinny looked over
               her shoulder, and Cruttendon, waving his hand, disappeared like the very great genius
               that he was.</p>
            <p>No—Mrs. Flanders was told none of this, <pb n="213" facs="pageImages/213.png"/>though Jacob felt, it is safe to say, that
               nothing in the world was of greater importance; and as for Cruttendon and Jinny, he
               thought them the most remarkable people he had ever met—being of course unable to
               foresee how it fell out in the course of time that Cruttendon took to painting
               orchards; had therefore to live in Kent; and must, one would think, see through apple
               blossom by this time, since his wife, for whose sake he did it, eloped with a
               novelist; but no; Cruttendon still paints orchards, savagely, in solitude. Then Jinny
               Carslake, after her affair with Lefanu the American painter, frequented Indian
               philosophers, and now you find her in pensions in <placeName type="tgn" key="1000080">Italy</placeName> cherishing a little
               jeweller's box containing ordinary pebbles picked off the road. But if you look at
               them steadily, she says, multiplicity becomes unity, which is somehow the secret of
               life, though it does not prevent her from following the macaroni as it goes round the
               table, and sometimes, on spring nights, she makes the strangest confidences to shy
               young Englishmen.</p>
            <p>Jacob had nothing to hide from his mother. It was only that he could make no sense
               himself of his extraordinary excitement, and as for writing it down—-</p>
            <p><pb n="214" facs="pageImages/214.png"/>"Jacob's letters are so like him," said Mrs. Jarvis, folding the sheet.</p>
            <p>"Indeed he seems to be having …" said Mrs. Flanders, and paused, for she was cutting
               out a dress and had to straighten the pattern, "… a very gay time."</p>
            <p>Mrs. Jarvis thought of Paris. At her back the window was open, for it was a mild
               night; a calm night; when the moon seemed muffled and the apple trees stood perfectly
               still.</p>
            <p>"I never pity the dead," said Mrs. Jarvis, shifting the cushion at her back, and
               clasping her hands behind her head. Betty Flanders did not hear, for her scissors
               made so much noise on the table.</p>
            <p>"They are at rest," said Mrs. Jarvis. "And we spend our days doing foolish
               unnecessary things without knowing why."</p>
            <p>Mrs. Jarvis was not liked in the village.</p>
            <p>"You never walk at this time of night?" she asked Mrs. Flanders.</p>
            <p>"It is certainly wonderfully mild," said Mrs. Flanders.</p>
            <p>Yet it was years since she had opened the orchard gate and gone out on Dods Hill
               after dinner. <pb n="215" facs="pageImages/215.png"/>"It is perfectly dry," said Mrs. Jarvis, as they shut the orchard door
               and stepped on to the turf.</p>
            <p>"I shan't go far," said Betty Flanders. "Yes, Jacob will leave Paris on Wednesday."
               "Jacob was always my friend of the three," said Mrs. Jarvis.</p>
            <p>"Now, my dear, I am going no further," said Mrs. Flanders. They had climbed the dark
               hill and reached the Roman camp.</p>
            <p>The rampart rose at their feet—the smooth circle surrounding the camp or the grave.
               How many needles Betty Flanders had lost there; and her garnet brooch.</p>
            <p>"It is much clearer than this sometimes," said Mrs. Jarvis, standing upon the ridge.
               There were no clouds, and yet there was a haze over the sea, and over the moors. The
               lights of <placeName type="tgn" key="7010063">Scarborough</placeName> flashed, as if a woman wearing a diamond necklace turned her
               head this way and that.</p>
            <p>"How quiet it is!" said Mrs. Jarvis.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Flanders rubbed the turf with her toe, thinking of her garnet brooch.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Jarvis found it difficult to think of herself to-night. It was so calm. There
               was no wind; nothing racing, flying, escaping. Black shadows stood still over the
               silver moors. The furze bushes stood perfectly still. Neither did Mrs. <pb n="216" facs="pageImages/216.png"/>Jarvis think
               of God. There was a church behind them, of course. The church clock struck ten. Did
               the strokes reach the furze bush, or did the thorn tree hear them?</p>
            <p>Mrs. Flanders was stooping down to pick up a pebble. Sometimes people do find things,
               Mrs. Jarvis thought, and yet in this hazy moonlight it was impossible to see
               anything, except bones, and little pieces of chalk.</p>
            <p>"Jacob bought it with his own money, and then I brought Mr. Parker up to see the
               view, and it must have dropped—" Mrs. Flanders murmured.</p>
            <p>Did the bones stir, or the rusty swords? Was Mrs. Flanders's twopenny-halfpenny
               brooch for ever part of the rich accumulation? and if all the ghosts flocked thick
               and rubbed shoulders with Mrs. Flanders in the circle, would she not have seemed
               perfectly in her place, a live English matron, growing stout?</p>
            <p>The clock struck the quarter.</p>
            <p>The frail waves of sound broke among the stiff gorse and the hawthorn twigs as the
               church clock divided time into quarters.</p>
            <p>Motionless and broad-backed the moors received the statement "It is fifteen minutes
               past the hour," but made no answer, unless a bramble stirred.</p>
            <p><pb n="217" facs="pageImages/217.png"/>Yet even in this light the legends on the tombstones could be read, brief voices
               saying, "I am Bertha Ruck," "I am Tom Gage." And they say which day of the year they
               died, and the New Testament says something for them, very proud, very emphatic, or
               consoling.</p>
            <p>The moors accept all that too.</p>
            <p>The moonlight falls like a pale page upon the church wall, and illumines the kneeling
               family in the niche, and the tablet set up in 1780 to the Squire of the parish who
               relieved the poor, and believed in God—so the measured voice goes on down the marble
               scroll, as though it could impose itself upon time and the open air.</p>
            <p>Now a fox steals out from behind the gorse bushes.</p>
            <p>Often, even at night, the church seems full of people. The pews are worn and greasy,
               and the cassocks in place, and the hymn-books on the ledges. It is a ship with all
               its crew aboard. The timbers strain to hold the dead and the living, the ploughmen,
               the carpenters, the fox-hunting gentlemen and the farmers smelling of mud and brandy.
               Their tongues join together in syllabling the sharp-cut words, which for ever slice
               asunder time and the broad-backed moors. Plaint and belief and elegy, despair and
               triumph, but for the most part good sense and jolly <pb n="218" facs="pageImages/218.png"/>indifference, go trampling out of
               the windows any time these five hundred years.</p>
            <p>Still, as Mrs. Jarvis said, stepping out on to the moors, "How quiet it is!" Quiet at
               midday, except when the hunt scatters across it; quiet in the afternoon, save for the
               drifting sheep; at night the moor is perfectly quiet.</p>
            <p>A garnet brooch has dropped into its grass. A fox pads stealthily. A leaf turns on
               its edge. Mrs. Jarvis, who is fifty years of age, reposes in the camp in the hazy
               moonlight.</p>
            <p>"… and," said Mrs. Flanders, straightening her back, "I never cared for Mr.
               Parker."</p>
            <p>"Neither did I," said Mrs. Jarvis. They began to walk home.</p>
            <p>But their voices floated for a little above the camp. The moonlight destroyed
               nothing. The moor accepted everything. Tom Gage cries aloud so long as his tombstone
               endures. The Roman skeletons are in safe keeping. Betty Flanders's darning needles
               are safe too and her garnet brooch. And sometimes at midday, in the sunshine, the
               moor seems to hoard these little treasures, like a nurse. But at midnight when no one
               speaks or gallops, and the thorn tree is perfectly still, it would be foolish to vex
               the moor with questions—what? and why?</p>
            <p>The church clock, however, strikes twelve.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="chapter" n="12">
            <head type="sub">XII</head>
            <p><pb n="219" facs="pageImages/219.png"/>The water fell off a ledge like lead—like a chain with thick white links. The train
               ran out into a steep green meadow, and Jacob saw striped tulips growing and heard a
               bird singing, in <placeName type="tgn" key="1000080">Italy</placeName>.</p>
            <p>A motor car full of Italian officers ran along the flat road and kept up with the
               train, raising dust behind it. There were trees laced together with vines—as Virgil
               said. Here was a station; and a tremendous leave-taking going on, with women in high
               yellow boots and odd pale boys in ringed socks. Virgil's bees had gone about the
               plains of <placeName type="tgn" key="7003237">Lombardy</placeName>. It was the custom of the ancients to train vines between elms.
               Then at <placeName type="tgn" key="7005903">Milan</placeName> there were sharp-winged hawks, of a bright brown, cutting figures over
               the roofs.</p>
            <p>These Italian carriages get damnably hot with the afternoon sun on them, and the
               chances are that before the engine has pulled to the top of the gorge the clanking
               chain will have broken. Up, up, up, it goes, like a train on a scenic railway. <pb n="220" facs="pageImages/220.png"/>Every
               peak is covered with sharp trees, and amazing white villages are crowded on ledges.
               There is always a white tower on the very summit, flat red-frilled roofs, and a sheer
               drop beneath. It is not a country in which one walks after tea. For one thing there
               is no grass. A whole hillside will be ruled with olive trees. Already in April the
               earth is clotted into dry dust between them. And there are neither stiles nor
               footpaths, nor lanes chequered with the shadows of leaves nor eighteenth-century inns
               with bow-windows, where one eats ham and eggs. Oh no, <placeName type="tgn" key="1000080">Italy</placeName> is all fierceness,
               bareness, exposure, and black priests shuffling along the roads. It is strange, too,
               how you never get away from villas.</p>
            <p>Still, to be travelling on one's own with a hundred pounds to spend is a fine affair.
               And if his money gave out, as it probably would, he would go on foot. He could live
               on bread and wine—the wine in straw bottles—for after doing <placeName type="tgn" key="1000074">Greece</placeName> he was going to
               knock off Rome. The Roman civilization was a very inferior affair, no doubt. But
               Bonamy talked a lot of rot, all the same. "You ought to have been in <placeName type="tgn" key="7001393">Athens</placeName>," he
               would say to Bonamy when he got back. "Standing on the <placeName type="tgn" key="8713152">Parthenon</placeName>," he would say, or
               "The ruins of the <placeName type="tgn" key="1100548">Coliseum</placeName> suggest some fairly sublime reflections," which he would
               write out <pb n="221" facs="pageImages/221.png"/>at length in letters. It might turn to an essay upon civilization. A
               comparison between the ancients and moderns, with some pretty sharp hits at Mr.
               Asquith—something in the style of Gibbon.</p>
            <p>A stout gentleman laboriously hauled himself in, dusty, baggy, slung with gold
               chains, and Jacob, regretting that he did not come of the Latin race, looked out of
               the window.</p>
            <p>It is a strange reflection that by travelling two days and nights you are in the
               heart of <placeName type="tgn" key="1000080">Italy</placeName>. Accidental villas among olive trees appear; and men-servants watering
               the cactuses. Black victorias drive in between pompous pillars with plaster shields
               stuck to them. It is at once momentary and astonishingly intimate—to be displayed
               before the eyes of a foreigner. And there is a lonely hill-top where no one ever
               comes, and yet it is seen by me who was lately driving down Piccadilly on an omnibus.
               And what I should like would be to get out among the fields, sit down and hear the
               grasshoppers, and take up a handful of earth—Italian earth, as this is Italian dust
               upon my shoes.</p>
            <p>Jacob heard them crying strange names at railway stations through the night. The
               train stopped and he heard frogs croaking close by, and he wrinkled back the blind
               cautiously and <pb n="222" facs="pageImages/222.png"/>saw a vast strange marsh all white in the moonlight. The carriage was
               thick with cigar smoke, which floated round the globe with the green shade on it. The
               Italian gentleman lay snoring with his boots off and his waistcoat unbuttoned…. And
               all this business of going to <placeName type="tgn" key="1000074">Greece</placeName> seemed to Jacob an intolerable weariness—sitting
               in hotels by oneself and looking at monuments—he'd have done better to go to <placeName type="tgn" key="7008116">Cornwall</placeName>
               with Timmy Durrant…. "O—h," Jacob protested, as the darkness began breaking in front
               of him and the light showed through, but the man was reaching across him to get
               something—the fat Italian man in his dicky, unshaven, crumpled, obese, was opening
               the door and going off to have a wash.</p>
            <p>So Jacob sat up, and saw a lean Italian sportsman with a gun walking down the road in
               the early morning light, and the whole idea of the <placeName type="tgn" key="8713152">Parthenon</placeName> came upon him in a
               clap.</p>
            <p>"By Jove!" he thought, "we must be nearly there!" and he stuck his head out of the
               window and got the air full in his face.</p>
            <p>It is highly exasperating that twenty-five people <pb n="223" facs="pageImages/223.png"/>of your acquaintance should be able
               to say straight off something very much to the point about being in <placeName type="tgn" key="1000074">Greece</placeName>, while for
               yourself there is a stopper upon all emotions whatsoever. For after washing at the
               hotel at Patras, Jacob had followed the tram lines a mile or so out; and followed
               them a mile or so back; he had met several droves of turkeys; several strings of
               donkeys; had got lost in back streets; had read advertisements of corsets and of
               Maggi's consomme; children had trodden on his toes; the place smelt of bad cheese;
               and he was glad to find himself suddenly come out opposite his hotel. There was an
               old copy of the Daily Mail lying among coffee-cups; which he read. But what could he
               do after dinner?</p>
            <p>No doubt we should be, on the whole, much worse off than we are without our
               astonishing gift for illusion. At the age of twelve or so, having given up dolls and
               broken our steam engines, <placeName type="tgn" key="1000070">France</placeName>, but much more probably <placeName type="tgn" key="1000080">Italy</placeName>, and India almost for
               a certainty, draws the superfluous imagination. One's aunts have been to Rome; and
               every one has an uncle who was last heard of—poor man—in <placeName type="tgn" key="1100548">Rangoon</placeName>. He will never come
               back any more. But it is the governesses who start the Greek myth. Look at that for a
               head (they say)—nose, you see, <pb n="224" facs="pageImages/224.png"/>straight as a dart, curls, eyebrows—everything
               appropriate to manly beauty; while his legs and arms have lines on them which
               indicate a perfect degree of development—the Greeks caring for the body as much as
               for the face. And the Greeks could paint fruit so that birds pecked at it. First you
               read Xenophon; then Euripides. One day—that was an occasion, by God—what people have
               said appears to have sense in it; "the Greek spirit"; the Greek this, that, and the
               other; though it is absurd, by the way, to say that any Greek comes near Shakespeare.
               The point is, however, that we have been brought up in an illusion.</p>
            <p>Jacob, no doubt, thought something in this fashion, the Daily Mail crumpled in his
               hand; his legs extended; the very picture of boredom.</p>
            <p>"But it's the way we're brought up," he went on.</p>
            <p>And it all seemed to him very distasteful. Something ought to be done about it. And
               from being moderately depressed he became like a man about to be executed. Clara
               Durrant had left him at a party to talk to an American called Pilchard. And he had
               come all the way to <placeName type="tgn" key="1000074">Greece</placeName> and left her. They wore evening-dresses, and talked
               nonsense—what damned nonsense—and he put out his hand for the Globe Trotter, an
               <pb n="225" facs="pageImages/225.png"/>international magazine which is supplied free of charge to the proprietors of
               hotels.</p>
            <p>In spite of its ramshackle condition modern <placeName type="tgn" key="1000074">Greece</placeName> is highly advanced in the electric
               tramway system, so that while Jacob sat in the hotel sitting-room the trams clanked,
               chimed, rang, rang, rang imperiously to get the donkeys out of the way, and one old
               woman who refused to budge, beneath the windows. The whole of civilization was being
               condemned.</p>
            <p>The waiter was quite indifferent to that too. Aristotle, a dirty man, carnivorously
               interested in the body of the only guest now occupying the only arm-chair, came into
               the room ostentatiously, put something down, put something straight, and saw that
               Jacob was still there.</p>
            <p>"I shall want to be called early to-morrow," said Jacob, over his shoulder. "I am
               going to <placeName type="tgn" key="7235450">Olympia</placeName>."</p>
            <p>This gloom, this surrender to the dark waters which lap us about, is a modern
               invention. Perhaps, as Cruttendon said, we do not believe enough. Our fathers at any
               rate had something to demolish. So have we for the matter of that, thought Jacob,
               crumpling the Daily Mail in his hand. He would go into Parliament and make fine
               speeches—but what use are fine speeches and Parliament, once you surrender an inch to
               <pb n="226" facs="pageImages/226.png"/>the black waters? Indeed there has never been any explanation of the ebb and flow in
               our veins—of happiness and unhappiness. That respectability and evening parties where
               one has to dress, and wretched slums at the back of Gray's Inn—something solid,
               immovable, and grotesque—is at the back of it, Jacob thought probable. But then there
               was the British Empire which was beginning to puzzle him; nor was he altogether in
               favour of giving Home Rule to <placeName type="tgn" key="1000078">Ireland</placeName>. What did the Daily Mail say about that?</p>
            <p>For he had grown to be a man, and was about to be immersed in things—as indeed the
               chambermaid, emptying his basin upstairs, fingering keys, studs, pencils, and bottles
               of tabloids strewn on the dressing-table, was aware.</p>
            <p>That he had grown to be a man was a fact that Florinda knew, as she knew everything,
               by instinct.</p>
            <p>And Betty Flanders even now suspected it, as she read his letter, posted at <placeName type="tgn" key="7005903">Milan</placeName>,
               "Telling me," she complained to Mrs. Jarvis, "really nothing that I want to know";
               but she brooded over it.</p>
            <p>Fanny Elmer felt it to desperation. For he <pb n="227" facs="pageImages/227.png"/>would take his stick and his hat and would
               walk to the window, and look perfectly absent-minded and very stern too, she
               thought.</p>
            <p>"I am going," he would say, "to cadge a meal of Bonamy."</p>
            <p>"Anyhow, I can drown myself in the <placeName type="tgn" key="7011913">Thames</placeName>," Fanny cried, as she hurried past the
               Foundling Hospital.</p>
            <p>"But the Daily Mail isn't to be trusted," Jacob said to himself, looking about for
               something else to read. And he sighed again, being indeed so profoundly gloomy that
               gloom must have been lodged in him to cloud him at any moment, which was odd in a man
               who enjoyed things so, was not much given to analysis, but was horribly romantic, of
               course, Bonamy thought, in his rooms in <placeName type="tgn" key="3000854">Lincoln's Inn</placeName>.</p>
            <p>"He will fall in love," thought Bonamy. "Some Greek woman with a straight nose."</p>
            <p>It was to Bonamy that Jacob wrote from Patras—to Bonamy who couldn't love a woman and
               never read a foolish book.</p>
            <p>There are very few good books after all, for we can't count profuse histories,
               travels in mule <pb n="228" facs="pageImages/228.png"/>carts to discover the sources of the <placeName type="tgn" key="1127805">Nile</placeName>, or the volubility of
               fiction.</p>
            <p>I like books whose virtue is all drawn together in a page or two. I like sentences
               that don't budge though armies cross them. I like words to be hard—such were Bonamy's
               views, and they won him the hostility of those whose taste is all for the fresh
               growths of the morning, who throw up the window, and find the poppies spread in the
               sun, and can't forbear a shout of jubilation at the astonishing fertility of English
               literature. That was not Bonamy's way at all. That his taste in literature affected
               his friendships, and made him silent, secretive, fastidious, and only quite at his
               ease with one or two young men of his own way of thinking, was the charge against
               him.</p>
            <p>But then Jacob Flanders was not at all of his own way of thinking—far from it, Bonamy
               sighed, laying the thin sheets of notepaper on the table and falling into thought
               about Jacob's character, not for the first time.</p>
            <p>The trouble was this romantic vein in him. "But mixed with the stupidity which leads
               him into these absurd predicaments," thought Bonamy, "there is
               something—something"—he sighed, for he was fonder of Jacob than of any one in the
               world.</p>
            <p><pb n="229" facs="pageImages/229.png"/>Jacob went to the window and stood with his hands in his pockets. There he saw three
               Greeks in kilts; the masts of ships; idle or busy people of the lower classes
               strolling or stepping out briskly, or falling into groups and gesticulating with
               their hands. Their lack of concern for him was not the cause of his gloom; but some
               more profound conviction—it was not that he himself happened to be lonely, but that
               all people are.</p>
            <p>Yet next day, as the train slowly rounded a hill on the way to <placeName type="tgn" key="7235450">Olympia</placeName>, the Greek
               peasant women were out among the vines; the old Greek men were sitting at the
               stations, sipping sweet wine. And though Jacob remained gloomy he had never suspected
               how tremendously pleasant it is to be alone; out of England; on one's own; cut off
               from the whole thing. There are very sharp bare hills on the way to <placeName type="tgn" key="7235450">Olympia</placeName>; and
               between them blue sea in triangular spaces. A little like the Cornish coast. Well
               now, to go walking by oneself all day—to get on to that track and follow it up
               between the bushes—or are they small trees?—to the top of that mountain from which
               one can see half the nations of antiquity—</p>
            <p><pb n="230" facs="pageImages/230.png"/>"Yes," said Jacob, for his carriage was empty, "let's look at the map." Blame it or
               praise it, there is no denying the wild horse in us. To gallop intemperately; fall on
               the sand tired out; to feel the earth spin; to have—positively—a rush of friendship
               for stones and grasses, as if humanity were over, and as for men and women, let them
               go hang—there is no getting over the fact that this desire seizes us pretty
               often.</p>
            <p>The evening air slightly moved the dirty curtains in the hotel window at <placeName type="tgn" key="7235450">Olympia</placeName>. "I
               am full of love for every one," thought Mrs. Wentworth Williams, "—for the poor most
               of all—for the peasants coming back in the evening with their burdens. And everything
               is soft and vague and very sad. It is sad, it is sad. But everything has meaning,"
               thought Sandra Wentworth Williams, raising her head a little and looking very
               beautiful, tragic, and exalted. "One must love everything."</p>
            <p>She held in her hand a little book convenient for travelling—stories by Tchekov—as
               she stood, veiled, in white, in the window of the hotel at <pb n="231" facs="pageImages/231.png"/><placeName type="tgn" key="7235450">Olympia</placeName>. How beautiful the
               evening was! and her beauty was its beauty. The tragedy of <placeName type="tgn" key="1000074">Greece</placeName> was the tragedy of
               all high souls. The inevitable compromise. She seemed to have grasped something. She
               would write it down. And moving to the table where her husband sat reading she leant
               her chin in her hands and thought of the peasants, of suffering, of her own beauty,
               of the inevitable compromise, and of how she would write it down. Nor did Evan
               Williams say anything brutal, banal, or foolish when he shut his book and put it away
               to make room for the plates of soup which were now being placed before them. Only his
               drooping bloodhound eyes and his heavy sallow cheeks expressed his melancholy
               tolerance, his conviction that though forced to live with circumspection and
               deliberation he could never possibly achieve any of those objects which, as he knew,
               are the only ones worth pursuing. His consideration was flawless; his silence
               unbroken.</p>
            <p>"Everything seems to mean so much," said Sandra. But with the sound of her own voice
               the spell was broken. She forgot the peasants. Only there remained with her a sense
               of her own beauty, and in front, luckily, there was a looking-glass.</p>
            <p>"I am very beautiful," she thought.</p>
            <p><pb n="232" facs="pageImages/232.png"/>She shifted her hat slightly. Her husband saw her looking in the glass; and agreed
               that beauty is important; it is an inheritance; one cannot ignore it. But it is a
               barrier; it is in fact rather a bore. So he drank his soup; and kept his eyes fixed
               upon the window.</p>
            <p>"Quails," said Mrs. Wentworth Williams languidly. "And then goat, I suppose; and
               then…"</p>
            <p>"Caramel custard presumably," said her husband in the same cadence, with his
               toothpick out already.</p>
            <p>She laid her spoon upon her plate, and her soup was taken away half finished. Never
               did she do anything without dignity; for hers was the English type which is so Greek,
               save that villagers have touched their hats to it, the vicarage reveres it; and
               upper-gardeners and under-gardeners respectfully straighten their backs as she comes
               down the broad terrace on Sunday morning, dallying at the stone urns with the Prime
               Minister to pick a rose—which, perhaps, she was trying to forget, as her eye wandered
               round the dining-room of the inn at <placeName type="tgn" key="7235450">Olympia</placeName>, seeking the window where her book lay,
               where a few minutes ago she had discovered something—something very profound it had
               been, about love and sadness and the peasants.</p>
            <p><pb n="233" facs="pageImages/233.png"/>But it was Evan who sighed; not in despair nor indeed in rebellion. But, being the
               most ambitious of men and temperamentally the most sluggish, he had accomplished
               nothing; had the political history of England at his finger-ends, and living much in
               company with Chatham, Pitt, Burke, and Charles James Fox could not help contrasting
               himself and his age with them and theirs. "Yet there never was a time when great men
               are more needed," he was in the habit of saying to himself, with a sigh. Here he was
               picking his teeth in an inn at <placeName type="tgn" key="7235450">Olympia</placeName>. He had done. But Sandra's eyes wandered.</p>
            <p>"Those pink melons are sure to be dangerous," he said gloomily. And as he spoke the
               door opened and in came a young man in a grey check suit.</p>
            <p>"Beautiful but dangerous," said Sandra, immediately talking to her husband in the
               presence of a third person. ("Ah, an English boy on tour," she thought to
               herself.)</p>
            <p>And Evan knew all that too.</p>
            <p>Yes, he knew all that; and he admired her. Very pleasant, he thought, to have
               affairs. But for himself, what with his height (Napoleon was five feet four, he
               remembered), his bulk, his inability to impose his own personality (and yet great men
               are needed more than ever now, he <pb n="234" facs="pageImages/234.png"/>sighed), it was useless. He threw away his cigar,
               went up to Jacob and asked him, with a simple sort of sincerity which Jacob liked,
               whether he had come straight out from England.</p>
            <p>"How very English!" Sandra laughed when the waiter told them next morning that the
               young gentleman had left at five to climb the mountain. "I am sure he asked you for a
               bath?" at which the waiter shook his head, and said that he would ask the
               manager.</p>
            <p>"You do not understand," laughed Sandra. "Never mind."</p>
            <p>Stretched on the top of the mountain, quite alone, Jacob enjoyed himself immensely.
               Probably he had never been so happy in the whole of his life.</p>
            <p>But at dinner that night Mr. Williams asked him whether he would like to see the
               paper; then Mrs. Williams asked him (as they strolled on the terrace smoking—and how
               could he refuse that man's cigar?) whether he'd seen the theatre <pb n="235" facs="pageImages/235.png"/>by moonlight;
               whether he knew Everard Sherborn; whether he read Greek and whether (Evan rose
               silently and went in) if he had to sacrifice one it would be the French literature or
               the Russian?</p>
            <p>"And now," wrote Jacob in his letter to Bonamy, "I shall have to read her cursed
               book"—her Tchekov, he meant, for she had lent it him.</p>
            <p>Though the opinion is unpopular it seems likely enough that bare places, fields too
               thick with stones to be ploughed, tossing sea-meadows half-way between England and
               America, suit us better than cities.</p>
            <p>There is something absolute in us which despises qualification. It is this which is
               teased and twisted in society. People come together in a room. "So delighted," says
               somebody, "to meet you," and that is a lie. And then: "I enjoy the spring more than
               the autumn now. One does, I think, as one gets older." For women are always, always,
               always talking about what one feels, and if they say "as one gets older," they mean
               you to reply with something quite off the point.</p>
            <p><pb n="236" facs="pageImages/236.png"/>Jacob sat himself down in the quarry where the Greeks had cut marble for the theatre.
               It is hot work walking up Greek hills at midday. The wild red cyclamen was out; he
               had seen the little tortoises hobbling from clump to clump; the air smelt strong and
               suddenly sweet, and the sun, striking on jagged splinters of marble, was very
               dazzling to the eyes. Composed, commanding, contemptuous, a little melancholy, and
               bored with an august kind of boredom, there he sat smoking his pipe.</p>
            <p>Bonamy would have said that this was the sort of thing that made him uneasy—when
               Jacob got into the doldrums, looked like a Margate fisherman out of a job, or a
               British Admiral. You couldn't make him understand a thing when he was in a mood like
               that. One had better leave him alone. He was dull. He was apt to be grumpy.</p>
            <p>He was up very early, looking at the statues with his Baedeker.</p>
            <p>Sandra Wentworth Williams, ranging the world before breakfast in quest of adventure
               or a point of view, all in white, not so very tall perhaps, but uncommonly
               upright—Sandra Williams got Jacob's head exactly on a level with the head of the
               Hermes of Praxiteles. The comparison was all in his favour. But before <pb n="237" facs="pageImages/237.png"/>she could say
               a single word he had gone out of the Museum and left her.</p>
            <p>Still, a lady of fashion travels with more than one dress, and if white suits the
               morning hour, perhaps sandy yellow with purple spots on it, a black hat, and a volume
               of Balzac, suit the evening. Thus she was arranged on the terrace when Jacob came in.
               Very beautiful she looked. With her hands folded she mused, seemed to listen to her
               husband, seemed to watch the peasants coming down with brushwood on their backs,
               seemed to notice how the hill changed from blue to black, seemed to discriminate
               between truth and falsehood, Jacob thought, and crossed his legs suddenly, observing
               the extreme shabbiness of his trousers.</p>
            <p>"But he is very distinguished looking," Sandra decided.</p>
            <p>And Evan Williams, lying back in his chair with the paper on his knees, envied them.
               The best thing he could do would be to publish, with Macmillans, his monograph upon
               the foreign policy of Chatham. But confound this tumid, queasy feeling—this
               restlessness, swelling, and heat—it was jealousy! jealousy! jealousy! which he had
               sworn never to feel again.</p>
            <p>"Come with us to <placeName type="tgn" key="7010734">Corinth</placeName>, Flanders," he said with more than his usual energy,
               stopping <pb n="238" facs="pageImages/238.png"/>by Jacob's chair. He was relieved by Jacob's reply, or rather by the solid,
               direct, if shy manner in which he said that he would like very much to come with them
               to <placeName type="tgn" key="7010734">Corinth</placeName>.</p>
            <p>"Here is a fellow," thought Evan Williams, "who might do very well in politics."</p>
            <p>"I intend to come to <placeName type="tgn" key="1000074">Greece</placeName> every year so long as I live," Jacob wrote to Bonamy. "It
               is the only chance I can see of protecting oneself from civilization."</p>
            <p>"Goodness knows what he means by that," Bonamy sighed. For as he never said a clumsy
               thing himself, these dark sayings of Jacob's made him feel apprehensive, yet somehow
               impressed, his own turn being all for the definite, the concrete, and the
               rational.</p>
            <p>Nothing could be much simpler than what Sandra said as she descended the
               <placeName type="tgn" key="1099683">Acro-Corinth</placeName>, keeping to the little path, while Jacob strode over rougher ground by
               her side. She had been left motherless at the age of four; and the Park was vast.</p>
            <p>"One never seemed able to get out of it," she laughed. Of course there was the
               library, <pb n="239" facs="pageImages/239.png"/>and dear Mr. Jones, and notions about things. "I used to stray into the
               kitchen and sit upon the butler's knees," she laughed, sadly though.</p>
            <p>Jacob thought that if he had been there he would have saved her; for she had been
               exposed to great dangers, he felt, and, he thought to himself, "People wouldn't
               understand a woman talking as she talks."</p>
            <p>She made little of the roughness of the hill; and wore breeches, he saw, under her
               short skirts.</p>
            <p>"Women like Fanny Elmer don't," he thought. "What's-her-name Carslake didn't; yet
               they pretend…"</p>
            <p>Mrs. Williams said things straight out. He was surprised by his own knowledge of the
               rules of behaviour; how much more can be said than one thought; how open one can be
               with a woman; and how little he had known himself before.</p>
            <p>Evan joined them on the road; and as they drove along up hill and down hill (for
               <placeName type="tgn" key="1000074">Greece</placeName> is in a state of effervescence, yet astonishingly clean-cut, a treeless land,
               where you see the ground between the blades, each hill cut and shaped and outlined as
               often as not against sparkling deep blue waters, islands white as sand floating on
               the horizon, occasional groves of palm trees standing in the valleys, which are
               <pb n="240" facs="pageImages/240.png"/>scattered with black goats, spotted with little olive trees and sometimes have white
               hollows, rayed and criss-crossed, in their flanks), as they drove up hill and down he
               scowled in the corner of the carriage, with his paw so tightly closed that the skin
               was stretched between the knuckles and the little hairs stood upright. Sandra rode
               opposite, dominant, like a Victory prepared to fling into the air.</p>
            <p>"Heartless!" thought Evan (which was untrue).</p>
            <p>"Brainless!" he suspected (and that was not true either). "Still…!" He envied
               her.</p>
            <p>When bedtime came the difficulty was to write to Bonamy, Jacob found. Yet he had seen
               Salamis, and Marathon in the distance. Poor old Bonamy! No; there was something queer
               about it. He could not write to Bonamy. "I shall go to <placeName type="tgn" key="7001393">Athens</placeName> all the same," he
               resolved, looking very set, with this hook dragging in his side.</p>
            <p>The Williamses had already been to <placeName type="tgn" key="7001393">Athens</placeName>.</p>
            <p><pb n="241" facs="pageImages/241.png"/><placeName type="tgn" key="7001393">Athens</placeName> is still quite capable of striking a young man as the oddest combination, the
               most incongruous assortment. Now it is suburban; now immortal. Now cheap continental
               jewellery is laid upon plush trays. Now the stately woman stands naked, save for a
               wave of drapery above the knee. No form can he set on his sensations as he strolls,
               one blazing afternoon, along the Parisian boulevard and skips out of the way of the
               royal landau which, looking indescribably ramshackle, rattles along the pitted
               roadway, saluted by citizens of both sexes cheaply dressed in bowler hats and
               continental costumes; though a shepherd in kilt, cap, and gaiters very nearly drives
               his herd of goats between the royal wheels; and all the time the <placeName type="tgn" key="8712059">Acropolis</placeName> surges
               into the air, raises itself above the town, like a large immobile wave with the
               yellow columns of the <placeName type="tgn" key="8713152">Parthenon</placeName> firmly planted upon it.</p>
            <p>The yellow columns of the <placeName type="tgn" key="8713152">Parthenon</placeName> are to be seen at all hours of the day firmly
               planted upon the <placeName type="tgn" key="8712059">Acropolis</placeName>; though at sunset, when the ships in the Piraeus fire
               their guns, a bell rings, a man in uniform (the waistcoat unbuttoned) appears; and
               the women roll up the black <pb n="242" facs="pageImages/242.png"/>stockings which they are knitting in the shadow of the
               columns, call to the children, and troop off down the hill back to their houses.</p>
            <p>There they are again, the pillars, the pediment, the Temple of Victory and the
               Erechtheum, set on a tawny rock cleft with shadows, directly you unlatch your
               shutters in the morning and, leaning out, hear the clatter, the clamour, the whip
               cracking in the street below. There they are.</p>
            <p>The extreme definiteness with which they stand, now a brilliant white, again yellow,
               and in some lights red, imposes ideas of durability, of the emergence through the
               earth of some spiritual energy elsewhere dissipated in elegant trifles. But this
               durability exists quite independently of our admiration. Although the beauty is
               sufficiently humane to weaken us, to stir the deep deposit of mud—memories,
               abandonments, regrets, sentimental devotions—the <placeName type="tgn" key="8713152">Parthenon</placeName> is separate from all that;
               and if you consider how it has stood out all night, for centuries, you begin to
               connect the blaze (at midday the glare is dazzling and the frieze almost invisible)
               with the idea that perhaps it is beauty alone that is immortal.</p>
            <p>Added to this, compared with the blistered stucco, the new love songs rasped out to
               the strum of guitar and gramophone, and the mobile <pb n="243" facs="pageImages/243.png"/>yet insignificant faces of the
               street, the <placeName type="tgn" key="8713152">Parthenon</placeName> is really astonishing in its silent composure; which is so
               vigorous that, far from being decayed, the <placeName type="tgn" key="8713152">Parthenon</placeName> appears, on the contrary, likely
               to outlast the entire world.</p>
            <p>"And the Greeks, like sensible men, never bothered to finish the backs of their
               statues," said Jacob, shading his eyes and observing that the side of the figure
               which is turned away from view is left in the rough.</p>
            <p>He noted the slight irregularity in the line of the steps which "the artistic sense
               of the Greeks preferred to mathematical accuracy," he read in his guide-book.</p>
            <p>He stood on the exact spot where the great statue of Athena used to stand, and
               identified the more famous landmarks of the scene beneath.</p>
            <p>In short he was accurate and diligent; but profoundly morose. Moreover he was
               pestered by guides. This was on Monday.</p>
            <p>But on Wednesday he wrote a telegram to Bonamy, telling him to come at once. And then
               he crumpled it in his hand and threw it in the gutter.</p>
            <p><pb n="244" facs="pageImages/244.png"/>"For one thing he wouldn't come," he thought. "And then I daresay this sort of thing
               wears off." "This sort of thing" being that uneasy, painful feeling, something like
               selfishness—one wishes almost that the thing would stop—it is getting more and more
               beyond what is possible—"If it goes on much longer I shan't be able to cope with
               it—but if some one else were seeing it at the same time—Bonamy is stuffed in his room
               in <placeName type="tgn" key="3000854">Lincoln's Inn</placeName>—oh, I say, damn it all, I say,"—the sight of Hymettus, Pentelicus,
               Lycabettus on one side, and the sea on the other, as one stands in the <placeName type="tgn" key="8713152">Parthenon</placeName> at
               sunset, the sky pink feathered, the plain all colours, the marble tawny in one's
               eyes, is thus oppressive. Luckily Jacob had little sense of personal association; he
               seldom thought of Plato or Socrates in the flesh; on the other hand his feeling for
               architecture was very strong; he preferred statues to pictures; and he was beginning
               to think a great deal about the problems of civilization, which were solved, of
               course, so very remarkably by the ancient Greeks, though their solution is no help to
               us. Then the hook gave a great tug in his side as he lay in bed on Wednesday night;
               and he turned over with a desperate sort of tumble, remembering Sandra Wentworth
               Williams with whom he was in love.</p>
            <p><pb n="245" facs="pageImages/245.png"/>Next day he climbed Pentelicus.</p>
            <p>The day after he went up to the <placeName type="tgn" key="8712059">Acropolis</placeName>. The hour was early; the place almost
               deserted; and possibly there was thunder in the air. But the sun struck full upon the
               <placeName type="tgn" key="8712059">Acropolis</placeName>.</p>
            <p>Jacob's intention was to sit down and read, and, finding a drum of marble
               conveniently placed, from which Marathon could be seen, and yet it was in the shade,
               while the Erechtheum blazed white in front of him, there he sat. And after reading a
               page he put his thumb in his book. Why not rule countries in the way they should be
               ruled? And he read again.</p>
            <p>No doubt his position there overlooking Marathon somehow raised his spirits. Or it
               may have been that a slow capacious brain has these moments of flowering. Or he had,
               insensibly, while he was abroad, got into the way of thinking about politics.</p>
            <p>And then looking up and seeing the sharp outline, his meditations were given an
               extraordinary edge; <placeName type="tgn" key="1000074">Greece</placeName> was over; the <placeName type="tgn" key="8713152">Parthenon</placeName> in ruins; yet there he was.</p>
            <p>(Ladies with green and white umbrellas passed through the courtyard—French ladies on
               their way to join their husbands in <placeName type="tgn" key="7002473">Constantinople</placeName>.)</p>
            <p>Jacob read on again. And laying the book on the ground he began, as if inspired by
               what he <pb n="246" facs="pageImages/246.png"/>had read, to write a note upon the importance of history—upon democracy—one
               of those scribbles upon which the work of a lifetime may be based; or again, it falls
               out of a book twenty years later, and one can't remember a word of it. It is a little
               painful. It had better be burnt.</p>
            <p>Jacob wrote; began to draw a straight nose; when all the French ladies opening and
               shutting their umbrellas just beneath him exclaimed, looking at the sky, that one did
               not know what to expect—rain or fine weather?</p>
            <p>Jacob got up and strolled across to the Erechtheum. There are still several women
               standing there holding the roof on their heads. Jacob straightened himself slightly;
               for stability and balance affect the body first. These statues annulled things so! He
               stared at them, then turned, and there was Madame Lucien Grave perched on a block of
               marble with her kodak pointed at his head. Of course she jumped down, in spite of her
               age, her figure, and her tight boots—having, now that her daughter was married,
               lapsed with a luxurious abandonment, grand enough in its way, into the fleshy
               grotesque; she jumped down, but not before Jacob had seen her.</p>
            <p>"Damn these women—damn these women!" he thought. And he went to fetch his book <pb n="247" facs="pageImages/247.png"/>which
               he had left lying on the ground in the <placeName type="tgn" key="8713152">Parthenon</placeName>.</p>
            <p>"How they spoil things," he murmured, leaning against one of the pillars, pressing
               his book tight between his arm and his side. (As for the weather, no doubt the storm
               would break soon; <placeName type="tgn" key="7001393">Athens</placeName> was under cloud.)</p>
            <p>"It is those damned women," said Jacob, without any trace of bitterness, but rather
               with sadness and disappointment that what might have been should never be.</p>
            <p>(This violent disillusionment is generally to be expected in young men in the prime
               of life, sound of wind and limb, who will soon become fathers of families and
               directors of banks.)</p>
            <p>Then, making sure that the Frenchwomen had gone, and looking cautiously round him,
               Jacob strolled over to the Erechtheum and looked rather furtively at the goddess on
               the left-hand side holding the roof on her head. She reminded him of Sandra Wentworth
               Williams. He looked at her, then looked away. He looked at her, then looked away. He
               was extraordinarily moved, and with the battered Greek nose in his head, with Sandra
               in his head, with all sorts of things in his head, off he started to walk right up to
               the top of Mount Hymettus, alone, in the heat.</p>
            <p><pb n="248" facs="pageImages/248.png"/>That very afternoon Bonamy went expressly to talk about Jacob to tea with Clara
               Durrant in the square behind Sloane Street where, on hot spring days, there are
               striped blinds over the front windows, single horses pawing the macadam outside the
               doors, and elderly gentlemen in yellow waistcoats ringing bells and stepping in very
               politely when the maid demurely replies that Mrs. Durrant is at home.</p>
            <p>Bonamy sat with Clara in the sunny front room with the barrel organ piping sweetly
               outside; the water-cart going slowly along spraying the pavement; the carriages
               jingling, and all the silver and chintz, brown and blue rugs and vases filled with
               green boughs, striped with trembling yellow bars.</p>
            <p>The insipidity of what was said needs no illustration—Bonamy kept on gently returning
               quiet answers and accumulating amazement at an existence squeezed and emasculated
               within a white satin shoe (Mrs. Durrant meanwhile enunciating strident politics with
               Sir Somebody in the back room) until the virginity of Clara's soul appeared to him
               candid; the depths unknown; and he would have brought out Jacob's <pb n="249" facs="pageImages/249.png"/>name had he not
               begun to feel positively certain that Clara loved him—and could do nothing
               whatever.</p>
            <p>"Nothing whatever!" he exclaimed, as the door shut, and, for a man of his
               temperament, got a very queer feeling, as he walked through the park, of carriages
               irresistibly driven; of flower beds uncompromisingly geometrical; of force rushing
               round geometrical patterns in the most senseless way in the world. "Was Clara," he
               thought, pausing to watch the boys bathing in the Serpentine, "the silent
               woman?—would Jacob marry her?"</p>
            <p>But in <placeName type="tgn" key="7001393">Athens</placeName> in the sunshine, in <placeName type="tgn" key="7001393">Athens</placeName>, where it is almost impossible to get
               afternoon tea, and elderly gentlemen who talk politics talk them all the other way
               round, in <placeName type="tgn" key="7001393">Athens</placeName> sat Sandra Wentworth Williams, veiled, in white, her legs stretched
               in front of her, one elbow on the arm of the bamboo chair, blue clouds wavering and
               drifting from her cigarette.</p>
            <p>The orange trees which flourish in the Square of the Constitution, the band, the
               dragging of feet, the sky, the houses, lemon and rose coloured<pb n="250" facs="pageImages/250.png"/>—all this became so
               significant to Mrs. Wentworth Williams after her second cup of coffee that she began
               dramatizing the story of the noble and impulsive Englishwoman who had offered a seat
               in her carriage to the old American lady at Mycenae (Mrs. Duggan)—not altogether a
               false story, though it said nothing of Evan, standing first on one foot, then on the
               other, waiting for the women to stop chattering.</p>
            <p>"I am putting the life of Father Damien into verse," Mrs. Duggan had said, for she
               had lost everything—everything in the world, husband and child and everything, but
               faith remained.</p>
            <p>Sandra, floating from the particular to the universal, lay back in a trance.</p>
            <p>The flight of time which hurries us so tragically along; the eternal drudge and
               drone, now bursting into fiery flame like those brief balls of yellow among green
               leaves (she was looking at orange trees); kisses on lips that are to die; the world
               turning, turning in mazes of heat and sound—though to be sure there is the quiet
               evening with its lovely pallor, "For I am sensitive to every side of it," Sandra
               thought, "and Mrs. Duggan will write to me for ever, and I shall answer her letters."
               Now the royal band marching by with the national flag stirred wider rings of emotion,
               and life became something that the <pb n="251" facs="pageImages/251.png"/>courageous mount and ride out to sea on—the hair
               blown back (so she envisaged it, and the breeze stirred slightly among the orange
               trees) and she herself was emerging from silver spray—when she saw Jacob. He was
               standing in the Square with a book under his arm looking vacantly about him. That he
               was heavily built and might become stout in time was a fact.</p>
            <p>But she suspected him of being a mere bumpkin.</p>
            <p>"There is that young man," she said, peevishly, throwing away her cigarette, "that
               Mr. Flanders."</p>
            <p>"Where?" said Evan. "I don't see him."</p>
            <p>"Oh, walking away—behind the trees now. No, you can't see him. But we are sure to run
               into him," which, of course, they did.</p>
            <p>But how far was he a mere bumpkin? How far was Jacob Flanders at the age of
               twenty-six a stupid fellow? It is no use trying to sum people up. One must follow
               hints, not exactly what is said, nor yet entirely what is done. Some, it is true,
               take ineffaceable impressions of character at once. Others dally, loiter, and get
               <pb n="252" facs="pageImages/252.png"/>blown this way and that. Kind old ladies assure us that cats are often the best
               judges of character. A cat will always go to a good man, they say; but then, Mrs.
               Whitehorn, Jacob's landlady, loathed cats.</p>
            <p>There is also the highly respectable opinion that character-mongering is much
               overdone nowadays. After all, what does it matter—that Fanny Elmer was all sentiment
               and sensation, and Mrs. Durrant hard as iron? that Clara, owing (so the
               character-mongers said) largely to her mother's influence, never yet had the chance
               to do anything off her own bat, and only to very observant eyes displayed deeps of
               feeling which were positively alarming; and would certainly throw herself away upon
               some one unworthy of her one of these days unless, so the character-mongers said, she
               had a spark of her mother's spirit in her—was somehow heroic. But what a term to
               apply to Clara Durrant! Simple to a degree, others thought her. And that is the very
               reason, so they said, why she attracts Dick Bonamy—the young man with the Wellington
               nose. Now HE'S a dark horse if you like. And there these gossips would suddenly
               pause. Obviously they meant to hint at his peculiar disposition—long rumoured among
               them.</p>
            <p>"But sometimes it is precisely a woman like <pb n="253" facs="pageImages/253.png"/>Clara that men of that temperament need…"
               Miss Julia Eliot would hint.</p>
            <p>"Well," Mr. Bowley would reply, "it may be so."</p>
            <p>For however long these gossips sit, and however they stuff out their victims'
               characters till they are swollen and tender as the livers of geese exposed to a hot
               fire, they never come to a decision.</p>
            <p>"That young man, Jacob Flanders," they would say, "so distinguished looking—and yet
               so awkward." Then they would apply themselves to Jacob and vacillate eternally
               between the two extremes. He rode to hounds—after a fashion, for he hadn't a
               penny.</p>
            <p>"Did you ever hear who his father was?" asked Julia Eliot.</p>
            <p>"His mother, they say, is somehow connected with the Rocksbiers," replied Mr.
               Bowley.</p>
            <p>"He doesn't overwork himself anyhow."</p>
            <p>"His friends are very fond of him."</p>
            <p>"Dick Bonamy, you mean?"</p>
            <p>"No, I didn't mean that. It's evidently the other way with Jacob. He is precisely the
               young man to fall headlong in love and repent it for the rest of his life."</p>
            <p>"Oh, Mr. Bowley," said Mrs. Durrant, sweeping down upon them in her imperious <pb n="254" facs="pageImages/254.png"/>manner,
               "you remember Mrs. Adams? Well, that is her niece." And Mr. Bowley, getting up, bowed
               politely and fetched strawberries.</p>
            <p>So we are driven back to see what the other side means—the men in clubs and
               Cabinets—when they say that character-drawing is a frivolous fireside art, a matter
               of pins and needles, exquisite outlines enclosing vacancy, flourishes, and mere
               scrawls.</p>
            <p>The battleships ray out over the North Sea, keeping their stations accurately apart.
               At a given signal all the guns are trained on a target which (the master gunner
               counts the seconds, watch in hand—at the sixth he looks up) flames into splinters.
               With equal nonchalance a dozen young men in the prime of life descend with composed
               faces into the depths of the sea; and there impassively (though with perfect mastery
               of machinery) suffocate uncomplainingly together. Like blocks of tin soldiers the
               army covers the cornfield, moves up the hillside, stops, reels slightly this way and
               that, and falls flat, save that, through field glasses, it can be seen that one or
               two pieces still agitate up and down like fragments of broken match-stick.</p>
            <p>These actions, together with the incessant commerce of banks, laboratories,
               chancellories, and houses of business, are the strokes which <pb n="255" facs="pageImages/255.png"/>oar the world forward,
               they say. And they are dealt by men as smoothly sculptured as the impassive policeman
               at Ludgate Circus. But you will observe that far from being padded to rotundity his
               face is stiff from force of will, and lean from the efforts of keeping it so. When
               his right arm rises, all the force in his veins flows straight from shoulder to
               finger-tips; not an ounce is diverted into sudden impulses, sentimental regrets,
               wire-drawn distinctions. The buses punctually stop.</p>
            <p>It is thus that we live, they say, driven by an unseizable force. They say that the
               novelists never catch it; that it goes hurtling through their nets and leaves them
               torn to ribbons. This, they say, is what we live by—this unseizable force.</p>
            <p>"Where are the men?" said old General Gibbons, looking round the drawing-room, full
               as usual on Sunday afternoons of well-dressed people. "Where are the guns?"</p>
            <p>Mrs. Durrant looked too.</p>
            <p>Clara, thinking that her mother wanted her, came in; then went out again.</p>
            <p>They were talking about Germany at the Durrants, and Jacob (driven by this unseizable
               <pb n="256" facs="pageImages/256.png"/>force) walked rapidly down Hermes Street and ran straight into the Williamses.</p>
            <p>"Oh!" cried Sandra, with a cordiality which she suddenly felt. And Evan added, "What
               luck!"</p>
            <p>The dinner which they gave him in the hotel which looks on to the Square of the
               Constitution was excellent. Plated baskets contained fresh rolls. There was real
               butter. And the meat scarcely needed the disguise of innumerable little red and green
               vegetables glazed in sauce.</p>
            <p>It was strange, though. There were the little tables set out at intervals on the
               scarlet floor with the Greek King's monogram wrought in yellow. Sandra dined in her
               hat, veiled as usual. Evan looked this way and that over his shoulder; imperturbable
               yet supple; and sometimes sighed. It was strange. For they were English people come
               together in <placeName type="tgn" key="7001393">Athens</placeName> on a May evening. Jacob, helping himself to this and that,
               answered intelligently, yet with a ring in his voice.</p>
            <p>The Williamses were going to <placeName type="tgn" key="7002473">Constantinople</placeName> early next morning, they said.</p>
            <p>"Before you are up," said Sandra.</p>
            <p><pb n="257" facs="pageImages/257.png"/>They would leave Jacob alone, then. Turning very slightly, Evan ordered something—a
               bottle of wine—from which he helped Jacob, with a kind of solicitude, with a kind of
               paternal solicitude, if that were possible. To be left alone—that was good for a
               young fellow. Never was there a time when the country had more need of men. He
               sighed.</p>
            <p>"And you have been to the <placeName type="tgn" key="8712059">Acropolis</placeName>?" asked Sandra.</p>
            <p>"Yes," said Jacob. And they moved off to the window together, while Evan spoke to the
               head waiter about calling them early.</p>
            <p>"It is astonishing," said Jacob, in a gruff voice.</p>
            <p>Sandra opened her eyes very slightly. Possibly her nostrils expanded a little
               too.</p>
            <p>"At half-past six then," said Evan, coming towards them, looking as if he faced
               something in facing his wife and Jacob standing with their backs to the window.</p>
            <p>Sandra smiled at him.</p>
            <p>And, as he went to the window and had nothing to say she added, in broken
               half-sentences:</p>
            <p>"Well, but how lovely—wouldn't it be? The <placeName type="tgn" key="8712059">Acropolis</placeName>, Evan—or are you too tired?"</p>
            <p>At that Evan looked at them, or, since Jacob <pb n="258" facs="pageImages/258.png"/>was staring ahead of him, at his wife,
               surlily, sullenly, yet with a kind of distress—not that she would pity him. Nor would
               the implacable spirit of love, for anything he could do, cease its tortures.</p>
            <p>They left him and he sat in the smoking-room, which looks out on to the Square of the
               Constitution. "Evan is happier alone," said Sandra. "We have been separated from the
               newspapers. Well, it is better that people should have what they want…. You have seen
               all these wonderful things since we met…. What impression … I think that you are
               changed."</p>
            <p>"You want to go to the <placeName type="tgn" key="8712059">Acropolis</placeName>," said Jacob. "Up here then."</p>
            <p>"One will remember it all one's life," said Sandra.</p>
            <p>"Yes," said Jacob. "I wish you could have come in the day-time."</p>
            <p>"This is more wonderful," said Sandra, waving her hand.</p>
            <p>Jacob looked vaguely.</p>
            <p>"But you should see the <placeName type="tgn" key="8713152">Parthenon</placeName> in the <pb n="259" facs="pageImages/259.png"/>day-time," he said. "You couldn't come
               to-morrow—it would be too early?"</p>
            <p>"You have sat there for hours and hours by yourself?"</p>
            <p>"There were some awful women this morning," said Jacob.</p>
            <p>"Awful women?" Sandra echoed.</p>
            <p>"Frenchwomen."</p>
            <p>"But something very wonderful has happened," said Sandra. Ten minutes, fifteen
               minutes, half an hour—that was all the time before her.</p>
            <p>"Yes," he said.</p>
            <p>"When one is your age—when one is young. What will you do? You will fall in love—oh
               yes! But don't be in too great a hurry. I am so much older."</p>
            <p>She was brushed off the pavement by parading men.</p>
            <p>"Shall we go on?" Jacob asked.</p>
            <p>"Let us go on," she insisted.</p>
            <p>For she could not stop until she had told him—or heard him say—or was it some action
               on his part that she required? Far away on the horizon she discerned it and could not
               rest.</p>
            <p>"You'd never get English people to sit out like this," he said.</p>
            <p>"Never—no. When you get back to England <pb n="260" facs="pageImages/260.png"/>you won't forget this—or come with us to
               <placeName type="tgn" key="7002473">Constantinople</placeName>!" she cried suddenly.</p>
            <p>"But then…"</p>
            <p>Sandra sighed.</p>
            <p>"You must go to Delphi, of course," she said. "But," she asked herself, "what do I
               want from him? Perhaps it is something that I have missed…."</p>
            <p>"You will get there about six in the evening," she said. "You will see the
               eagles."</p>
            <p>Jacob looked set and even desperate by the light at the street corner and yet
               composed. He was suffering, perhaps. He was credulous. Yet there was something
               caustic about him. He had in him the seeds of extreme disillusionment, which would
               come to him from women in middle life. Perhaps if one strove hard enough to reach the
               top of the hill it need not come to him—this disillusionment from women in middle
               life.</p>
            <p>"The hotel is awful," she said. "The last visitors had left their basins full of
               dirty water. There is always that," she laughed.</p>
            <p>"The people one meets ARE beastly," Jacob said.</p>
            <p>His excitement was clear enough.</p>
            <p>"Write and tell me about it," she said. "And tell me what you feel and what you
               think. Tell me everything."</p>
            <p><pb n="261" facs="pageImages/261.png"/>The night was dark. The <placeName type="tgn" key="8712059">Acropolis</placeName> was a jagged mound.</p>
            <p>"I should like to, awfully," he said.</p>
            <p>"When we get back to <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName>, we shall meet…"</p>
            <p>"Yes."</p>
            <p>"I suppose they leave the gates open?" he asked.</p>
            <p>"We could climb them!" she answered wildly.</p>
            <p>Obscuring the moon and altogether darkening the <placeName type="tgn" key="8712059">Acropolis</placeName> the clouds passed from east
               to west. The clouds solidified; the vapours thickened; the trailing veils stayed and
               accumulated.</p>
            <p>It was dark now over <placeName type="tgn" key="7001393">Athens</placeName>, except for gauzy red streaks where the streets ran; and
               the front of the Palace was cadaverous from electric light. At sea the piers stood
               out, marked by separate dots; the waves being invisible, and promontories and islands
               were dark humps with a few lights.</p>
            <p>"I'd love to bring my brother, if I may," Jacob murmured.</p>
            <p>"And then when your mother comes to <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName>—," said Sandra.</p>
            <p>The mainland of <placeName type="tgn" key="1000074">Greece</placeName> was dark; and somewhere off Euboea a cloud must have touched
               the waves and spattered them—the dolphins circling deeper and deeper into the sea.
               Violent was the <pb n="262" facs="pageImages/262.png"/>wind now rushing down the Sea of Marmara between <placeName type="tgn" key="1000074">Greece</placeName> and the
               plains of Troy.</p>
            <p>In <placeName type="tgn" key="1000074">Greece</placeName> and the uplands of <placeName type="tgn" key="7006417">Albania</placeName> and Turkey, the wind scours the sand and the
               dust, and sows itself thick with dry particles. And then it pelts the smooth domes of
               the mosques, and makes the cypresses, standing stiff by the turbaned tombstones of
               Mohammedans, creak and bristle.</p>
            <p>Sandra's veils were swirled about her.</p>
            <p>"I will give you my copy," said Jacob. "Here. Will you keep it?"</p>
            <p>(The book was the poems of Donne.)</p>
            <p>Now the agitation of the air uncovered a racing star. Now it was dark. Now one after
               another lights were extinguished. Now great towns—Paris—<placeName type="tgn" key="7002473">Constantinople</placeName>—<placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName>—were
               black as strewn rocks. Waterways might be distinguished. In England the trees were
               heavy in leaf. Here perhaps in some southern wood an old man lit dry ferns and the
               birds were startled. The sheep coughed; one flower bent slightly towards another. The
               English sky is softer, milkier than the Eastern. Something gentle has passed into it
               from the grass-rounded hills, something damp. The salt gale blew in at Betty
               Flanders's bedroom window, and the widow lady, raising herself slightly on her elbow,
               sighed like one who <pb n="263" facs="pageImages/263.png"/>realizes, but would fain ward off a little longer—oh, a little
               longer!—the oppression of eternity.</p>
            <p>But to return to Jacob and Sandra.</p>
            <p>They had vanished. There was the <placeName type="tgn" key="8712059">Acropolis</placeName>; but had they reached it? The columns and
               the Temple remain; the emotion of the living breaks fresh on them year after year;
               and of that what remains?</p>
            <p>As for reaching the <placeName type="tgn" key="8712059">Acropolis</placeName> who shall say that we ever do it, or that when Jacob
               woke next morning he found anything hard and durable to keep for ever? Still, he went
               with them to <placeName type="tgn" key="7002473">Constantinople</placeName>.</p>
            <p>Sandra Wentworth Williams certainly woke to find a copy of Donne's poems upon her
               dressing-table. And the book would be stood on the shelf in the English country house
               where Sally Duggan's Life of Father Damien in verse would join it one of these days.
               There were ten or twelve little volumes already. Strolling in at dusk, Sandra would
               open the books and her eyes would brighten (but not at the print), and subsiding into
               the arm-chair she would suck back again the soul of the moment; or, for sometimes she
               was restless, would pull out book after book and swing across the whole space of her
               life like an acrobat from bar to bar. She had had her moments. Meanwhile, the great
               clock on the <pb n="264" facs="pageImages/264.png"/>landing ticked and Sandra would hear time accumulating, and ask herself,
               "What for? What for?"</p>
            <p>"What for? What for?" Sandra would say, putting the book back, and strolling to the
               looking-glass and pressing her hair. And Miss Edwards would be startled at dinner, as
               she opened her mouth to admit roast mutton, by Sandra's sudden solicitude: "Are you
               happy, Miss Edwards?"—a thing Cissy Edwards hadn't thought of for years.</p>
            <p>"What for? What for?" Jacob never asked himself any such questions, to judge by the
               way he laced his boots; shaved himself; to judge by the depth of his sleep that
               night, with the wind fidgeting at the shutters, and half-a-dozen mosquitoes singing
               in his ears. He was young—a man. And then Sandra was right when she judged him to be
               credulous as yet. At forty it might be a different matter. Already he had marked the
               things he liked in Donne, and they were savage enough. However, you might place
               beside them passages of the purest poetry in Shakespeare.</p>
            <p>But the wind was rolling the darkness through the streets of <placeName type="tgn" key="7001393">Athens</placeName>, rolling it, one
               might suppose, with a sort of trampling energy of mood which forbids too close an
               analysis of the feelings of any single person, or inspection of features. All
               <pb n="265" facs="pageImages/265.png"/>faces—Greek, Levantine, Turkish, English—would have looked much the same in that
               darkness. At length the columns and the Temples whiten, yellow, turn rose; and the
               Pyramids and St. Peter's arise, and at last sluggish St. Paul's looms up.</p>
            <p>The Christians have the right to rouse most cities with their interpretation of the
               day's meaning. Then, less melodiously, dissenters of different sects issue a
               cantankerous emendation. The steamers, resounding like gigantic tuning-forks, state
               the old old fact—how there is a sea coldly, greenly, swaying outside. But nowadays it
               is the thin voice of duty, piping in a white thread from the top of a funnel, that
               collects the largest multitudes, and night is nothing but a long-drawn sigh between
               hammer-strokes, a deep breath—you can hear it from an open window even in the heart
               of <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName>.</p>
            <p>But who, save the nerve-worn and sleepless, or thinkers standing with hands to the
               eyes on some crag above the multitude, see things thus in skeleton outline, bare of
               flesh? In <placeName type="tgn" key="1005687">Surbiton</placeName> the skeleton is wrapped in flesh.</p>
            <p>"The kettle never boils so well on a sunny morning," says Mrs. Grandage, glancing at
               the clock on the mantelpiece. Then the grey Persian cat stretches itself on the
               window-seat, and buffets <pb n="266" facs="pageImages/266.png"/>a moth with soft round paws. And before breakfast is half
               over (they were late today), a baby is deposited in her lap, and she must guard the
               sugar basin while Tom Grandage reads the golfing article in the "Times," sips his
               coffee, wipes his moustaches, and is off to the office, where he is the greatest
               authority upon the foreign exchanges and marked for promotion. The skeleton is well
               wrapped in flesh. Even this dark night when the wind rolls the darkness through
               Lombard Street and Fetter Lane and Bedford Square it stirs (since it is summer-time
               and the height of the season), plane trees spangled with electric light, and curtains
               still preserving the room from the dawn. People still murmur over the last word said
               on the staircase, or strain, all through their dreams, for the voice of the alarum
               clock. So when the wind roams through a forest innumerable twigs stir; hives are
               brushed; insects sway on grass blades; the spider runs rapidly up a crease in the
               bark; and the whole air is tremulous with breathing; elastic with filaments.</p>
            <p>Only here—in Lombard Street and Fetter Lane and Bedford Square—each insect carries a
               globe of the world in his head, and the webs of the forest are schemes evolved for
               the smooth conduct of business; and honey is treasure of <pb n="267" facs="pageImages/267.png"/>one sort and another; and
               the stir in the air is the indescribable agitation of life.</p>
            <p>But colour returns; runs up the stalks of the grass; blows out into tulips and
               crocuses; solidly stripes the tree trunks; and fills the gauze of the air and the
               grasses and pools.</p>
            <p>The Bank of England emerges; and the Monument with its bristling head of golden hair;
               the dray horses crossing <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName> Bridge show grey and strawberry and iron-coloured.
               There is a whir of wings as the suburban trains rush into the terminus. And the light
               mounts over the faces of all the tall blind houses, slides through a chink and paints
               the lustrous bellying crimson curtains; the green wine-glasses; the coffee-cups; and
               the chairs standing askew.</p>
            <p>Sunlight strikes in upon shaving-glasses; and gleaming brass cans; upon all the jolly
               trappings of the day; the bright, inquisitive, armoured, resplendent, summer's day,
               which has long since vanquished chaos; which has dried the melancholy mediaeval
               mists; drained the swamp and stood glass and stone upon it; and equipped our brains
               and bodies with such an armoury of weapons that merely to see the flash and thrust of
               limbs engaged in the conduct of daily life is better than the old pageant of armies
               drawn out in battle array upon the plain.</p>

            <p><pb n="268" facs="pageImages/268.png"/>"The Height of the season," said Bonamy.</p>
            <p>The sun had already blistered the paint on the backs of the green chairs in Hyde
               Park; peeled the bark off the plane trees; and turned the earth to powder and to
               smooth yellow pebbles. <placeName type="tgn" key="1102873">Hyde Park</placeName> was circled, incessantly, by turning wheels.</p>
            <p>"The height of the season," said Bonamy sarcastically.</p>
            <p>He was sarcastic because of Clara Durrant; because Jacob had come back from <placeName type="tgn" key="1000074">Greece</placeName>
               very brown and lean, with his pockets full of Greek notes, which he pulled out when
               the chair man came for pence; because Jacob was silent.</p>
            <p>"He has not said a word to show that he is glad to see me," thought Bonamy bitterly.
               The motor cars passed incessantly over the bridge of the Serpentine; the upper
               classes walked upright, or bent themselves gracefully over the palings; the lower
               classes lay with <pb n="269" facs="pageImages/269.png"/>their knees cocked up, flat on their backs; the sheep grazed on
               pointed wooden legs; small children ran down the sloping grass, stretched their arms,
               and fell.</p>
            <p>"Very urbane," Jacob brought out.</p>
            <p>"Urbane" on the lips of Jacob had mysteriously all the shapeliness of a character
               which Bonamy thought daily more sublime, devastating, terrific than ever, though he
               was still, and perhaps would be for ever, barbaric, obscure.</p>
            <p>What superlatives! What adjectives! How acquit Bonamy of sentimentality of the
               grossest sort; of being tossed like a cork on the waves; of having no steady insight
               into character; of being unsupported by reason, and of drawing no comfort whatever
               from the works of the classics?</p>
            <p>"The height of civilization," said Jacob.</p>
            <p>He was fond of using Latin words.</p>
            <p>Magnanimity, virtue—such words when Jacob used them in talk with Bonamy meant that he
               took control of the situation; that Bonamy would play round him like an affectionate
               spaniel; and that (as likely as not) they would end by rolling on the floor.</p>
            <p>"And <placeName type="tgn" key="1000074">Greece</placeName>?" said Bonamy. "The <placeName type="tgn" key="8713152">Parthenon</placeName> and all that?"</p>
            <p>"There's none of this European mysticism," said Jacob.</p>
            <p><pb n="270" facs="pageImages/270.png"/>"It's the atmosphere. I suppose," said Bonamy. "And you went to <placeName type="tgn" key="7002473">Constantinople</placeName>?"
               "Yes," said Jacob.</p>
            <p>Bonamy paused, moved a pebble; then darted in with the rapidity and certainty of a
               lizard's tongue.</p>
            <p>"You are in love!" he exclaimed.</p>
            <p>Jacob blushed.</p>
            <p>The sharpest of knives never cut so deep.</p>
            <p>As for responding, or taking the least account of it, Jacob stared straight ahead of
               him, fixed, monolithic—oh, very beautiful!—like a British Admiral, exclaimed Bonamy
               in a rage, rising from his seat and walking off; waiting for some sound; none came;
               too proud to look back; walking quicker and quicker until he found himself gazing
               into motor cars and cursing women. Where was the pretty woman's face?
               Clara's—Fanny's—Florinda's? Who was the pretty little creature?</p>
            <p>Not Clara Durrant.</p>
            <p>The Aberdeen terrier must be exercised, and as Mr. Bowley was going that very
               moment—would like nothing better than a walk—they went <pb n="271" facs="pageImages/271.png"/>together, Clara and kind
               little Bowley—Bowley who had rooms in the Albany, Bowley who wrote letters to the
               "Times" in a jocular vein about foreign hotels and the Aurora Borealis—Bowley who
               liked young people and walked down Piccadilly with his right arm resting on the boss
               of his back.</p>
            <p>"Little demon!" cried Clara, and attached Troy to his chain.</p>
            <p>Bowley anticipated—hoped for—a confidence. Devoted to her mother, Clara sometimes
               felt her a little, well, her mother was so sure of herself that she could not
               understand other people being—being—"as ludicrous as I am," Clara jerked out (the dog
               tugging her forwards). And Bowley thought she looked like a huntress and turned over
               in his mind which it should be—some pale virgin with a slip of the moon in her hair,
               which was a flight for Bowley.</p>
            <p>The colour was in her cheeks. To have spoken outright about her mother—still, it was
               only to Mr. Bowley, who loved her, as everybody must; but to speak was unnatural to
               her, yet it was awful to feel, as she had done all day, that she MUST tell some
               one.</p>
            <p>"Wait till we cross the road," she said to the dog, bending down.</p>
            <p>Happily she had recovered by that time.</p>
            <p><pb n="272" facs="pageImages/272.png"/>"She thinks so much about England," she said. "She is so anxious—-"</p>
            <p>Bowley was defrauded as usual. Clara never confided in any one.</p>
            <p>"Why don't the young people settle it, eh?" he wanted to ask. "What's all this about
               England?"—a question poor Clara could not have answered, since, as Mrs. Durrant
               discussed with Sir Edgar the policy of Sir Edward Grey, Clara only wondered why the
               cabinet looked dusty, and Jacob had never come. Oh, here was Mrs. Cowley Johnson…</p>
            <p>And Clara would hand the pretty china teacups, and smile at the compliment—that no
               one in <placeName type="tgn" key="7011781">London</placeName> made tea so well as she did.</p>
            <p>"We get it at Brocklebank's," she said, "in Cursitor Street."</p>
            <p>Ought she not to be grateful? Ought she not to be happy?</p>
            <p>Especially since her mother looked so well and enjoyed so much talking to Sir Edgar
               about <placeName type="tgn" key="1000179">Morocco</placeName>, <placeName type="tgn" key="1000059">Venezuela</placeName>, or some such place.</p>
            <p>"Jacob! Jacob!" thought Clara; and kind Mr. Bowley, who was ever so good with old
               ladies, looked; stopped; wondered whether Elizabeth wasn't too harsh with her
               daughter; wondered about Bonamy, Jacob—which young fellow was it?—and jumped up
               directly Clara said she must exercise Troy.</p>
            <p><pb n="273" facs="pageImages/273.png"/>They had reached the site of the old Exhibition. They looked at the tulips. Stiff and
               curled, the little rods of waxy smoothness rose from the earth, nourished yet
               contained, suffused with scarlet and coral pink. Each had its shadow; each grew
               trimly in the diamond-shaped wedge as the gardener had planned it.</p>
            <p>"Barnes never gets them to grow like that," Clara mused; she sighed.</p>
            <p>"You are neglecting your friends," said Bowley, as some one, going the other way,
               lifted his hat. She started; acknowledged Mr. Lionel Parry's bow; wasted on him what
               had sprung for Jacob.</p>
            <p>("Jacob! Jacob!" she thought.)</p>
            <p>"But you'll get run over if I let you go," she said to the dog.</p>
            <p>"England seems all right," said Mr. Bowley.</p>
            <p>The loop of the railing beneath the statue of Achilles was full of parasols and
               waistcoats; chains and bangles; of ladies and gentlemen, lounging elegantly, lightly
               observant.</p>
            <p>"'This statue was erected by the women of England…'" Clara read out with a foolish
               <pb n="274" facs="pageImages/274.png"/>little laugh. "Oh, Mr. Bowley! Oh!" Gallop—gallop—gallop—a horse galloped past
               without a rider. The stirrups swung; the pebbles spurted.</p>
            <p>"Oh, stop! Stop it, Mr. Bowley!" she cried, white, trembling, gripping his arm,
               utterly unconscious, the tears coming.</p>
            <p>"Tut-tut!" said Mr. Bowley in his dressing-room an hour later. "Tut-tut!"—a comment
               that was profound enough, though inarticulately expressed, since his valet was
               handing his shirt studs.</p>
            <p>Julia Eliot, too, had seen the horse run away, and had risen from her seat to watch
               the end of the incident, which, since she came of a sporting family, seemed to her
               slightly ridiculous. Sure enough the little man came pounding behind with his
               breeches dusty; looked thoroughly annoyed; and was being helped to mount by a
               policeman when Julia Eliot, with a sardonic <pb n="275" facs="pageImages/275.png"/>smile, turned towards the Marble Arch on
               her errand of mercy. It was only to visit a sick old lady who had known her mother
               and perhaps the Duke of Wellington; for Julia shared the love of her sex for the
               distressed; liked to visit death-beds; threw slippers at weddings; received
               confidences by the dozen; knew more pedigrees than a scholar knows dates, and was one
               of the kindliest, most generous, least continent of women.</p>
            <p>Yet five minutes after she had passed the statue of Achilles she had the rapt look of
               one brushing through crowds on a summer's afternoon, when the trees are rustling, the
               wheels churning yellow, and the tumult of the present seems like an elegy for past
               youth and past summers, and there rose in her mind a curious sadness, as if time and
               eternity showed through skirts and waistcoasts, and she saw people passing tragically
               to destruction. Yet, Heaven knows, Julia was no fool. A sharper woman at a bargain
               did not exist. She was always punctual. The watch on her wrist gave her twelve
               minutes and a half in which to reach Bruton Street. Lady Congreve expected her at
               five.</p>
            <p><pb n="276" facs="pageImages/276.png"/>The gilt clock at Verrey's was striking five.</p>
            <p>Florinda looked at it with a dull expression, like an animal. She looked at the
               clock; looked at the door; looked at the long glass opposite; disposed her cloak;
               drew closer to the table, for she was pregnant—no doubt about it, Mother Stuart said,
               recommending remedies, consulting friends; sunk, caught by the heel, as she tripped
               so lightly over the surface.</p>
            <p>Her tumbler of pinkish sweet stuff was set down by the waiter; and she sucked,
               through a straw, her eyes on the looking-glass, on the door, now soothed by the sweet
               taste. When Nick Bramham came in it was plain, even to the young Swiss waiter, that
               there was a bargain between them. Nick hitched his clothes together clumsily; ran his
               fingers through his hair; sat down, to an ordeal, nervously. She looked at him; and
               set off laughing; laughed—laughed—laughed. The young Swiss waiter, standing with
               crossed legs by the pillar, laughed too.</p>
            <p>The door opened; in came the roar of Regent Street, the roar of traffic, impersonal,
               unpitying; and sunshine grained with dirt. The Swiss waiter must see to the
               newcomers. Bramham lifted his glass.</p>
            <p>"He's like Jacob," said Florinda, looking at the newcomer.</p>
            <p><pb n="277" facs="pageImages/277.png"/>"The way he stares." She stopped laughing.</p>
            <p>Jacob, leaning forward, drew a plan of the <placeName type="tgn" key="8713152">Parthenon</placeName> in the dust in <placeName type="tgn" key="1102873">Hyde Park</placeName>, a
               network of strokes at least, which may have been the <placeName type="tgn" key="8713152">Parthenon</placeName>, or again a
               mathematical diagram. And why was the pebble so emphatically ground in at the corner?
               It was not to count his notes that he took out a wad of papers and read a long
               flowing letter which Sandra had written two days ago at Milton Dower House with his
               book before her and in her mind the memory of something said or attempted, some
               moment in the dark on the road to the <placeName type="tgn" key="8712059">Acropolis</placeName> which (such was her creed) mattered
               for ever.</p>
            <p>"He is," she mused, "like that man in Moliere."</p>
            <p>She meant Alceste. She meant that he was severe. She meant that she could deceive
               him.</p>
            <p>"Or could I not?" she thought, putting the poems of Donne back in the bookcase.
               "Jacob," she went on, going to the window and looking over the spotted flower-beds
               across the grass where the piebald cows grazed under beech trees, "Jacob would be
               shocked."</p>
            <p><pb n="278" facs="pageImages/278.png"/>The perambulator was going through the little gate in the railing. She kissed her
               hand; directed by the nurse, Jimmy waved his.</p>
            <p>"HE'S a small boy," she said, thinking of Jacob.</p>
            <p>And yet—Alceste?</p>
            <p>"What a nuisance you are!" Jacob grumbled, stretching out first one leg and then the
               other and feeling in each trouser-pocket for his chair ticket.</p>
            <p>"I expect the sheep have eaten it," he said. "Why do you keep sheep?"</p>
            <p>"Sorry to disturb you, sir," said the ticket-collector, his hand deep in the enormous
               pouch of pence.</p>
            <p>"Well, I hope they pay you for it," said Jacob. "There you are. No. You can stick to
               it. Go and get drunk."</p>
            <p>He had parted with half-a-crown, tolerantly, compassionately, with considerable
               contempt for his species.</p>
            <p><pb n="279" facs="pageImages/279.png"/>Even now poor Fanny Elmer was dealing, as she walked along the Strand, in her
               incompetent way with this very careless, indifferent, sublime manner he had of
               talking to railway guards or porters; or Mrs. Whitehorn, when she consulted him about
               her little boy who was beaten by the schoolmaster.</p>
            <p>Sustained entirely upon picture post cards for the past two months, Fanny's idea of
               Jacob was more statuesque, noble, and eyeless than ever. To reinforce her vision she
               had taken to visiting the <placeName type="tgn" key="1100764">British Museum</placeName>, where, keeping her eyes downcast until she
               was alongside of the battered Ulysses, she opened them and got a fresh shock of
               Jacob's presence, enough to last her half a day. But this was wearing thin. And she
               wrote now—poems, letters that were never posted, saw his face in advertisements on
               hoardings, and would cross the road to let the barrel-organ turn her musings to
               rhapsody. But at breakfast (she shared rooms with a teacher), when the butter was
               smeared about the plate, and the prongs of the forks were clotted with old egg yolk,
               she revised these visions violently; was, in truth, very cross; was losing her
               complexion, as Margery Jackson told her, bringing the whole thing down (as she laced
               her stout boots) to a level of mother-wit, <pb n="280" facs="pageImages/280.png"/>vulgarity, and sentiment, for she had
               loved too; and been a fool.</p>
            <p>"One's godmothers ought to have told one," said Fanny, looking in at the window of
               Bacon, the mapseller, in the Strand—told one that it is no use making a fuss; this is
               life, they should have said, as Fanny said it now, looking at the large yellow globe
               marked with steamship lines.</p>
            <p>"This is life. This is life," said Fanny.</p>
            <p>"A very hard face," thought Miss Barrett, on the other side of the glass, buying maps
               of the Syrian desert and waiting impatiently to be served. "Girls look old so soon
               nowadays."</p>
            <p>The equator swam behind tears.</p>
            <p>"Piccadilly?" Fanny asked the conductor of the omnibus, and climbed to the top. After
               all, he would, he must, come back to her.</p>
            <p>But Jacob might have been thinking of Rome; of architecture; of jurisprudence; as he
               sat under the plane tree in <placeName type="tgn" key="1102873">Hyde Park</placeName>.</p>
            <p>The omnibus stopped outside Charing Cross; and behind it were clogged omnibuses,
               vans, motor-cars, for a procession with banners was passing down <placeName type="tgn" key="7011807">Whitehall</placeName>, and
               elderly people were <pb n="281" facs="pageImages/281.png"/>stiffly descending from between the paws of the slippery lions,
               where they had been testifying to their faith, singing lustily, raising their eyes
               from their music to look into the sky, and still their eyes were on the sky as they
               marched behind the gold letters of their creed.</p>
            <p>The traffic stopped, and the sun, no longer sprayed out by the breeze, became almost
               too hot. But the procession passed; the banners glittered —far away down <placeName type="tgn" key="7011807">Whitehall</placeName>;
               the traffic was released; lurched on; spun to a smooth continuous uproar; swerving
               round the curve of Cockspur Street; and sweeping past Government offices and
               equestrian statues down <placeName type="tgn" key="7011807">Whitehall</placeName> to the prickly spires, the tethered grey fleet of
               masonry, and the large white clock of Westminster.</p>
            <p>Five strokes Big Ben intoned; Nelson received the salute. The wires of the Admiralty
               shivered with some far-away communication. A voice kept remarking that Prime
               Ministers and Viceroys spoke in the Reichstag; entered <placeName type="tgn" key="7914224">Lahore</placeName>; said that the Emperor
               travelled; in <placeName type="tgn" key="7005903">Milan</placeName> they rioted; said there were rumours in <placeName type="tgn" key="7003321">Vienna</placeName>; said that the
               Ambassador at <placeName type="tgn" key="7002473">Constantinople</placeName> had audience with the Sultan; the fleet was at
               Gibraltar. The voice continued, imprinting on the faces of the clerks in <placeName type="tgn" key="7011807">Whitehall</placeName>
               (Timothy <pb n="282" facs="pageImages/282.png"/>Durrant was one of them) something of its own inexorable gravity, as they
               listened, deciphered, wrote down. Papers accumulated, inscribed with the utterances
               of Kaisers, the statistics of ricefields, the growling of hundreds of work-people,
               plotting sedition in back streets, or gathering in the <placeName type="tgn" key="7030776">Calcutta</placeName> bazaars, or mustering
               their forces in the uplands of <placeName type="tgn" key="7006417">Albania</placeName>, where the hills are sand-coloured, and bones
               lie unburied.</p>
            <p>The voice spoke plainly in the square quiet room with heavy tables, where one elderly
               man made notes on the margin of typewritten sheets, his silver-topped umbrella
               leaning against the bookcase.</p>
            <p>His head—bald, red-veined, hollow-looking—represented all the heads in the building.
               His head, with the amiable pale eyes, carried the burden of knowledge across the
               street; laid it before his colleagues, who came equally burdened; and then the
               sixteen gentlemen, lifting their pens or turning perhaps rather wearily in their
               chairs, decreed that the course of history should shape itself this way or that way,
               being manfully determined, as their faces showed, to impose some coherency upon
               Rajahs and Kaisers and the muttering in bazaars, the secret gatherings, plainly
               visible in <placeName type="tgn" key="7011807">Whitehall</placeName>, of kilted peasants in <placeName type="tgn" key="7006417">Albania</placeName>n uplands; to control the course
               of events.</p>
            <p><pb n="283" facs="pageImages/283.png"/>Pitt and Chatham, Burke and Gladstone looked from side to side with fixed marble eyes
               and an air of immortal quiescence which perhaps the living may have envied, the air
               being full of whistling and concussions, as the procession with its banners passed
               down <placeName type="tgn" key="7011807">Whitehall</placeName>. Moreover, some were troubled with dyspepsia; one had at that very
               moment cracked the glass of his spectacles; another spoke in Glasgow to-morrow;
               altogether they looked too red, fat, pale or lean, to be dealing, as the marble heads
               had dealt, with the course of history.</p>
            <p>Timmy Durrant in his little room in the Admiralty, going to consult a Blue book,
               stopped for a moment by the window and observed the placard tied round the
               lamp-post.</p>
            <p>Miss Thomas, one of the typists, said to her friend that if the Cabinet was going to
               sit much longer she should miss her boy outside the Gaiety.</p>
            <p>Timmy Durrant, returning with his Blue book under his arm, noticed a little knot of
               people at the street corner; conglomerated as though one of them knew something; and
               the others, pressing <pb n="284" facs="pageImages/284.png"/>round him, looked up, looked down, looked along the street. What
               was it that he knew?</p>
            <p>Timothy, placing the Blue book before him, studied a paper sent round by the Treasury
               for information. Mr. Crawley, his fellow-clerk, impaled a letter on a skewer.</p>
            <p>Jacob rose from his chair in <placeName type="tgn" key="1102873">Hyde Park</placeName>, tore his ticket to pieces, and walked
               away.</p>
            <p>"Such a sunset," wrote Mrs. Flanders in her letter to Archer at Singapore. "One
               couldn't make up one's mind to come indoors," she wrote. "It seemed wicked to waste
               even a moment." The long windows of Kensington Palace flushed fiery rose as Jacob
               walked away; a flock of wild duck flew over the Serpentine; and the trees were stood
               against the sky, blackly, magnificently.</p>
            <p>"Jacob," wrote Mrs. Flanders, with the red light on her page, "is hard at work after
               his delightful journey…"</p>
            <p>"The Kaiser," the far-away voice remarked in <placeName type="tgn" key="7011807">Whitehall</placeName>, "received me in
               audience."</p>
            <p>"Now I know that face—" said the Reverend <pb n="285" facs="pageImages/285.png"/>Andrew Floyd, coming out of Carter's shop
               in Piccadilly, "but who the dickens—?" and he watched Jacob, turned round to look at
               him, but could not be sure— "Oh, Jacob Flanders!" he remembered in a flash.</p>
            <p>But he was so tall; so unconscious; such a fine young fellow.</p>
            <p>"I gave him Byron's works," Andrew Floyd mused, and started forward, as Jacob crossed
               the road; but hesitated, and let the moment pass, and lost the opportunity.</p>
            <p>Another procession, without banners, was blocking Long Acre. Carriages, with dowagers
               in amethyst and gentlemen spotted with carnations, intercepted cabs and motor-cars
               turned in the opposite direction, in which jaded men in white waistcoats lolled, on
               their way home to shrubberies and billiard-rooms in <placeName type="tgn" key="7012091">Putney</placeName> and <placeName type="tgn" key="1005936">Wimbledon</placeName>.</p>
            <p>Two barrel-organs played by the kerb, and horses coming out of Aldridge's with white
               labels on their buttocks straddled across the road and were smartly jerked back.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Durrant, sitting with Mr. Wortley in a motor-car, was impatient lest they should
               miss the overture.</p>
            <p>But Mr. Wortley, always urbane, always in <pb n="286" facs="pageImages/286.png"/>time for the overture, buttoned his gloves,
               and admired Miss Clara.</p>
            <p>"A shame to spend such a night in the theatre!" said Mrs. Durrant, seeing all the
               windows of the coachmakers in Long Acre ablaze.</p>
            <p>"Think of your moors!" said Mr. Wortley to Clara.</p>
            <p>"Ah! but Clara likes this better," Mrs. Durrant laughed.</p>
            <p>"I don't know—really," said Clara, looking at the blazing windows. She started.</p>
            <p>She saw Jacob.</p>
            <p>"Who?" asked Mrs. Durrant sharply, leaning forward.</p>
            <p>But she saw no one.</p>
            <p>Under the arch of the Opera House large faces and lean ones, the powdered and the
               hairy, all alike were red in the sunset; and, quickened by the great hanging lamps
               with their repressed primrose lights, by the tramp, and the scarlet, and the pompous
               ceremony, some ladies looked for a moment into steaming bedrooms near by, where women
               with loose hair leaned out of windows, where girls—where children—(the long mirrors
               held the ladies suspended) but one must follow; one must not block the way.</p>
            <p><pb n="287" facs="pageImages/287.png"/>Clara's moors were fine enough. The Phoenicians slept under their piled grey rocks;
               the chimneys of the old mines pointed starkly; early moths blurred the heather-bells;
               cartwheels could be heard grinding on the road far beneath; and the suck and sighing
               of the waves sounded gently, persistently, for ever.</p>
            <p>Shading her eyes with her hand Mrs. Pascoe stood in her cabbage-garden looking out to
               sea. Two steamers and a sailing-ship crossed each other; passed each other; and in
               the bay the gulls kept alighting on a log, rising high, returning again to the log,
               while some rode in upon the waves and stood on the rim of the water until the moon
               blanched all to whiteness.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Pascoe had gone indoors long ago.</p>
            <p>But the red light was on the columns of the <placeName type="tgn" key="8713152">Parthenon</placeName>, and the Greek women who were
               knitting their stockings and sometimes crying to a child to come and have the insects
               picked from its head were as jolly as sand-martins in the heat, quarrelling,
               scolding, suckling their babies, until the ships in the Piraeus fired their guns.</p>
            <p>The sound spread itself flat, and then went tunnelling its way with fitful explosions
               among the channels of the islands.</p>
            <p><pb n="288" facs="pageImages/288.png"/>Darkness drops like a knife over <placeName type="tgn" key="1000074">Greece</placeName>.</p>
            <p>"The guns?" said Betty Flanders, half asleep, getting out of bed and going to the
               window, which was decorated with a fringe of dark leaves.</p>
            <p>"Not at this distance," she thought. "It is the sea."</p>
            <p>Again, far away, she heard the dull sound, as if nocturnal women were beating great
               carpets. There was Morty lost, and Seabrook dead; her sons fighting for their
               country. But were the chickens safe? Was that some one moving downstairs? Rebecca
               with the toothache? No. The nocturnal women were beating great carpets. Her hens
               shifted slightly on their perches.</p>

            <p><pb n="289" facs="pageImages/289.png"/>"He left everything just as it was," Bonamy marvelled. "Nothing arranged. All his
               letters strewn about for any one to read. What did he expect? Did he think he would
               come back?" he mused, standing in the middle of Jacob's room.</p>
            <p>The eighteenth century has its distinction. These houses were built, say, a hundred
               and fifty years ago. The rooms are shapely, the ceilings high; over the doorways a
               rose or a ram's skull is carved in the wood. Even the panels, painted in
               raspberry-coloured paint, have their distinction.</p>
            <p>Bonamy took up a bill for a hunting-crop.</p>
            <p>"That seems to be paid," he said.</p>
            <p>There were Sandra's letters.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Durrant was taking a party to Greenwich.</p>
            <p>Lady Rocksbier hoped for the pleasure….</p>
            <p>Listless is the air in an empty room, just swelling the curtain; the flowers in the
               jar shift. <pb n="290" facs="pageImages/290.png"/>One fibre in the wicker arm-chair creaks, though no one sits there.</p>
            <p>Bonamy crossed to the window. Pickford's van swung down the street. The omnibuses
               were locked together at Mudie's corner. Engines throbbed, and carters, jamming the
               brakes down, pulled their horses sharp up. A harsh and unhappy voice cried something
               unintelligible. And then suddenly all the leaves seemed to raise themselves.</p>
            <p>"Jacob! Jacob!" cried Bonamy, standing by the window. The leaves sank down again.</p>
            <p>"Such confusion everywhere!" exclaimed Betty Flanders, bursting open the bedroom
               door.</p>
            <p>Bonamy turned away from the window.</p>
            <p>"What am I to do with these, Mr. Bonamy?"</p>
            <p>She held out a pair of Jacob's old shoes.</p>
