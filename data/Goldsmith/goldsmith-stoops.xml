<opener>
<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
</opener>
<p>
BY inscribing this slight performance to you, I do not mean so much to compliment you as myself. It may do me some honour to inform the public, that I have lived many years in intimacy with you. It may serve the interests of mankind also to inform them, that the greatest wit may be found in a character, without impairing the most unaffected piety.
</p>
<p>
I have, particularly, reason to thank you for your partiality to this performance. The undertaking a comedy, not merely sentimental, was very dangerous; and Mr. Colman, who saw this piece in its various stages, always thought it so. However I ventured to trust it to the public; and though it was necessarily delayed till late in the season, I have every reason to be grateful.

<head>PROLOGUE</head>
    <p> By <hi rend="small-caps">DAVID GARRICK</hi>, Esq.</p>
    <stage><hi rend="italic">Enter</hi> Mr.
<hi rend="small-caps">WOODWARD,</hi>
        <hi rend="italic">Dressed in Black, and holding a Handkerchief to his Eyes.</hi></stage>
<lg>
<l>EXCUSE <hi rend="italic">me, Sirs, I pray—I can't yet speak—</hi>
</l>
<l><hi rend="italic">I'm crying now—and have been all the week!</hi></l>
<l>
'Tis not alone this mourning suit,
<hi rend="italic"></hi>good masters;
</l>
<l>
<hi>I've that within—</hi>
for which there are no plaisters!
</l>
<l>Pray wou'd you know the reason why I'm crying?</l>
<l>The Comic muse, long sick, is now a dying!</l>
<l>And if she goes, my tears will never stop;</l>
<l>For as a play'r, I can't squeeze out one drop:</l>
<l>I am undone, that's all—shall lose my bread—</l>
<l>I'd rather, but that's nothing—lose my head.</l>
<l>When the sweet maid is laid upon the bier,</l>
<l>
<hi>Shuter</hi>
and
<hi>I</hi>
shall be chief mourners here.
</l>
<l>
To her a mawkish drab of spurious breed,
</l>
<l>
Who deals in sentimentals will succeed!
</l>
<l>
Poor Ned
    <hi rend="italic">and</hi>
I
    <hi rend="italic">are dead to all intents</hi>,
</l>
<l>
We can as soon speak
<hi>Greek</hi>
as
<hi>sentiments!</hi>
</l>
<l>Both nervous grown, to keep our spirits up,</l>
<l>We now and then take down a hearty cup.</l>
<l>What shall we do?—If Comedy forsake us!</l>
<l>They'll turn us out, and no one else will take us,</l>
<l>But why can't I be moral?—Let me try—</l>
<l>My heart thus pressing—fix'd my face and eye—</l>
<l>With a sententious look, that nothing means,</l>
<l>(Faces are blocks, in sentimental scenes)</l>
<l>
Thus I begin
<hi>—All is not gold that glitters,</hi>
</l>
<l>Pleasure seems sweet, but proves a glass of bitters.</l>
<l>When ign'rance enters, folly is at hand;</l>
<l>Learning is better far than house and land:</l>
<l>Let not your virtue trip, who trips may stumble,</l>
<l>And virtue is not virtue, if she tumble.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>I give it up—morals won't do for me;</l>
<l>To make you laugh I must play tragedy.</l>
<l>One hope remains—hearing the maid was ill,</l>
<l>
A
<hi rend="italic">doctor</hi>
comes this night to shew his skill.
</l>
<l>To cheer her heart, and give your muscles motion,</l>
<l>
He in
<hi rend="italic">five draughts</hi>
prepar'd, presents a potion:
</l>
<l>
<pb/>
A kind of magic charm—for be assur'd,
</l>
<l>
If you will swallow it, the maid is cur'd:
</l>
<l>
But desp'rate the Doctor, and her case is,
</l>
<l>
If you reject the dose, and make wry faces!
</l>
<l>This truth he boasts, will beast it while he lives,</l>
<l>
No
<hi rend="italic">pois'nous drugs</hi>
are mix'd in what he gives;
</l>
<l>Should he succeed, you'll give him his degree;</l>
<l>If not, within he will receive no fee!</l>
<l>
The college
<hi>you,</hi>
must his pretensions back,
</l>
<l>
Pronounce him
<hi>regular,</hi>
or dub him
<hi>quack.</hi>

<head>EPILOGUE</head>
    <l>By Dr. GOLDSMITH.</l>
<l>
<hi>WELL,</hi>
having stoop'd to conquer with success,
</l>
<l>And gain'd a husband without aid from dress,</l>
<l>Still as a Bar-maid, I could wish it too,</l>
<l>As I have conquer'd him to conquer you:</l>
<l>And let me say, for all your resolution,</l>
<l>That pretty Bar-maids have done execution.</l>
<l>Our life is all a play, compos'd to please,</l>
<l>"We have our exits and our entrances."</l>
<l>The first act shews the simple country maid,</l>
<l>Harmless and young, of ev'ry thing afraid;</l>
<l>Blushes when hir'd, and with unmeaning action,</l>
<l>I hopes as how to give you satisfaction.</l>
<l>Her second act displays a livelier scene,—</l>
<l>Th' unblushing Bar-maid of a country inn.</l>
<l>Who whisks about the house, at market caters,</l>
<l>Talks loud, coquets the guests, and scolds the waiters.</l>
<l>Next the scene shifts to town, and there she soars,</l>
<l>The chop house toast of ogling connoissieurs.</l>
<l>On 'Squires and Cits she there displays her arts,</l>
<l>And on the gridiron broils her lover's hearts—</l>
<l>And as she smiles, her triumphs to compleat,</l>
<l>Even Common Councilmen forget to eat.</l>
<l>The fourth act shews her wedded to the 'Squire,</l>
<l>And Madam now begins to hold it higher;</l>
<l>
<pb/>
Pretends to taste, at Operas cries
<hi rend='italic'>caro,</hi>
</l>
<l>
And quits her Nancy Dawson, for
<hi rend="italic">Che Faro.</hi>
</l>
<l>Doats upon dancing, and in all her pride,</l>
<l>
Swims round the room, the
<hi>Heinel</hi>
of Cheapside:
</l>
<l>Ogles and leers with artificial skill,</l>
<l>Till having lost in age the power to kill,</l>
<l>She sits all night at cards, and ogles at spadille.</l>
<l>Such, thro' our lives, the eventful history—</l>
<l>The fifth and last act still remains for me.</l>
<l>The Bar-maid now for your protection prays,</l>
<l>Turns Female Barrister, and leads for Bayes.</l>

Mrs. HARDCASTLE
<hi>and</hi>
Mr. HARDCASTLE.
</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
I Vow, Mr. Hardcastle, you're very particular. Is there a creature in the whole country, but ourselves, that does not take a trip to town now and then, to rub off the rust a little? There's the two Miss Hoggs, and our neighbour, Mrs. Grigsby, go to take a month's polishing every winter.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Ay, and bring back vanity and affectation to last them the whole year. I wonder why London cannot keep its own fools at home. In my time, the follies of the town crept slowly among us, but now they travel faster than a stage-coach. Its fopperies come down, not only as inside passengers, but in the very basket.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="2"/>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Ay,
<hi rend="italic">your</hi>
times were fine times, indeed; you have been telling us of
<hi rend="italic">them</hi>
for many a long year. Here we live in an old rumbling mansion, that looks for all the world like an inn, but that we never see company. Our best visitors are old Mrs. Oddfish, the curate's wife, and little Cripplegate, the lame dancing-master: And all our entertainment your old stories of Prince Eugene and the Duke of Marlborough. I hate such old-fashioned trumpery.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
And I love it. I love every thing that's old: old friends, old times, old manners, old books, old wine; and, I believe, Dorothy,
<stage>(taking her hand)</stage>
you'll own I have been pretty fond of an old wife.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Lord, Mr. Hardcastle, you're for ever at your Dorothy's and your old wife's. You may be a Darby, but I'll be no Joan, I promise you. I'm not so old as you'd make me, by more than one good year. Add twenty to twenty, and make money of that.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Let me see; twenty added to twenty, makes just fifty and seven.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>It's false, Mr. Hardcastle: I was but twenty when I was brought to bed of Tony, that I had by Mr. Lumpkin, my first husband; and he's not come to years of discretion yet.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Nor ever will, I dare answer for him. Ay, you have taught
<hi rend="italic">him</hi>
finely.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>No matter, Tony Lumpkin has a good fortune. My son is not to live by his learning. I don't think a boy wants much learning to spend fifteen hundred a year.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="3"/>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Learning, quotha! A mere composition of tricks and mischief.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Humour, my dear: nothing but humour. Come, Mr. Hardcastle, you must allow the boy a little humour.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
I'd sooner allow him an horse-pond. If burning the footmens shoes, frighting the maids, and worrying the kittens, be humour, he has it. It was but yesterday he fastened my wig to the back of my chair, and when I went to make a bow, I popt my bald head in Mrs. Frizzle's face.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>And am I to blame? The poor boy was always too sickly to do any good. A school would be his death. When he comes to be a little stronger, who knows what a year or two's Latin may do for him?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Latin for him! A cat and fiddle. No, no, the ale-house and the stable are the only schools he'll ever go to.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Well, we must not snub the poor boy now, for I believe we shan't have him long among us. Any body that looks in his face may see he's consumptive.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Ay, if growing too fat be one of the symptoms.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>He coughs sometimes.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Yes, when his liquor goes the wrong way.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>I'm actually afraid of his lungs.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
And truly so am I; for he sometimes whoops like
<pb n="4"/>
a speaking trumpet—
<stage>(Tony hallooing behind the Scenes)</stage>
—O there he goes—A very consumptive figure, truly.
</l>
</sp>
<stage>
<hi>Enter</hi>
TONY,

</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Tony, where are you going, my charmer? Won't you give papa and I a little of your company, lovee?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>I'm in haste, mother, I cannot stay.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>You shan't venture out this raw evening, my dear: You look most shockingly.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>
I can't stay, I tell you. The Three Pigeons expects me down every moment. There's some fun going forward.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>

Not so low neither. There's Dick Muggins the exciseman, Jack Slang the horse doctor, Little Aminadab that grinds the music box, and Tom Twist that spins the pewter platter.

<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Ay, there goes a pair that only spoil each other, But is not the whole age in a combination to drive sense and discretion out of doors? There's my pretty darling Kate; the fashions of the times have almost infected her too. By living a year or two in town, she is as fond of gauze, and French frippery, as the best of them.</l>
</sp>
<stage>
<hi>Enter</hi>
MISS HARDCASTLE.
</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Blessings on my pretty innocence! Drest out as usual my Kate. Goodness! What a quantity of superfluous silk has thou got about thee, girl! I could never teach the fools of this age, that the indigent world could be cloathed out of the trimmings of the vain.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>You know our agreement, Sir. You allow me the morning to receive and pay visits, and to dress in my own manner; and in the evening, I put on my housewife's dress to please you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Well, remember I insist on the terms of our agreement; and, by the bye, I believe I shall have occasion to try your obedience this very evening.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>I protest, Sir, I don't comprehend your meaning.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Then, to be plain with you, Kate, I expect the</l>
<pb n="6"/>
<l>young gentleman I have chosen to be your husband from town this very day. I have his father's letter, in which he informs me his son is set out, and that he intends to follow himself shortly after.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Indeed! I wish I had known something of this before. Bless me, how shall I behave? It's a thousand to one I shan't like him; our meeting will be so formal, and so like a thing of business, that I shall find no room for friendship or esteem.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Depend upon it, child, I'll never controul your choice; but Mr. Marlow, whom I have pitched upon, is the son of my old friend, Sir Charles Marlow, of whom you have heard me talk so often. The young gentleman has been bred a scholar, and is designed for an employment in the service of his country. I am told he's a man of an excellent understanding.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Is he?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Very generous.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>I believe I shall like him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Young and brave.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>I'm sure I shall like him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>And very handsome.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
My dear Papa, say no more
<stage>(kissing his hand)</stage>
he's mine, I'll have him.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>And to crown all, Kate, he's one of the most bashful and reserved young fellows in all the world.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="7"/>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Eh! you have frozen me to death again. That word reserved, has undone all the rest of his accomplishments. A reserved lover, it is said, always makes a suspicious husband.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>On the contrary, modesty seldom resides in a breast that is not enriched with nobler virtues. It was the very feature in his character that first struck me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
He must have more striking features to catch me, I promise you. However, if he be so young, so handsome, and so every thing, as you mention, I be
lieve he'll do still. I think I'll have him.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Ay, Kate, but there is still an obstacle. Its more than an even wager, he may not have
<hi rend="italic">you.</hi>
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>My dear Papa, why will you mortify one so?—Well, if he refuses, instead of breaking my heart at his indifference, I'll only break my glass for its flattery. Set my cap to some newer fashion, and look out for some less difficult admirer.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Bravely resolved! In the mean time I'll go prepare the servants for his reception; as we seldom see company they want as much training as a company of recruits, the first day's muster.

<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Lud, this news of Papa's, puts me all in a slutter. Young, handsome; these he put last; but I put them foremost. Sensible, good-natured; I like all that. But then reserved, and sheepish, that's much against him. Yet can't he be cured of his timidity, by being taught to be proud of his wife? Yes, and can't I—But I vow I'm disposing of the husband, before I have secured the lover.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>I'm glad you're come, Neville, my dear. Tell me, Constance, how do I look this evening? Is there any thing whimsical about me? Is it one of my well looking days, child? Am I in face to day?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss NEVILLE.</speaker>
<l>
Perfectly, my dear. Yet now I look again—bless me!—sure no accident has happened among the canary birds or the gold fishes. Has your brother or the cat been meddling? Or has the last novel been too moving?
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>No; nothing of all this. I have been threatened—I can scarce get it out—I have been threatened with a lover.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss NEVILLE.</speaker>
<l>And his name—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Is Marlow.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss NEVILLE.</speaker>
<l>Indeed!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>The son of Sir Charles Marlow.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss NEVILLE.</speaker>
<l>
As I live, the most intimate friend of Mr. Hastings,
<hi rend="italic">my</hi>
admirer. They are never asunder. I believe you must have seen him when we lived in town.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Never.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss NEVILLE.</speaker>
<l>He's a very singular character, I assure you. Among women of reputation and virtue, he is the modestest man alive; but his acquaintance give him a very different character among creatures of another stamp: you understand me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
An odd character, indeed. I shall never be able
<pb n="9"/>
to manage him. What shall I do? Pshaw, think no more of him, but trust to occurrences for success. But how goes on your own affair my dear, has my mother been courting you for my brother Tony, as usual?
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss NEVILLE.</speaker>
<l>I have just come from one of our agreeable tête a-têtes. She has been saying a hundred tender things, and setting off her pretty monster as the very pink of perfection.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
And her partiality is such, that she actually thinks him so. A fortune like your's is no small temptation. Besides, as she has the sole management of it, I'm not surprized to see her unwilling to let it go out of the family.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss NEVILLE.</speaker>
<l>A fortune like mine, which chiefly consists in jewels, is no such mighty temptation. But at any rate if my dear Hastings be but constant, I make no doubt to be too hard for her at last. However, I let her suppose that I am in love with her son, and she never once dreams that my affections are fixed upon another.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
My good brother holds out stoutly. I could almost love him for hating you so.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss NEVILLE.</speaker>
<l>
It is a good natured creature at bottom, and I'm sure would wish to see me married to any body but himself. But my aunt's bell rings for our afternoon's walk round the improvements. Allons. Courage is necessary as our affairs are critical.

it! We were told it was but forty miles across the country, and we have come above threescore.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>
And all Marlow, from that unaccountable reserve of yours, that would not let us enquire more frequently on the way.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
I own, Hastings, I am unwilling to lay myself under an obligation to every one I meet; and often, stand the chance of an unmannerly answer.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>At present, however, we are not likely to receive any answer.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>No offence, gentlemen. But I'm told you have been enquiring for one Mr. Hardcastle, in those parts. Do you know what part of the country you are in?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>
Not in the least Sir, but should thank you for information.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>Nor the way you came?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>No, Sir; but if you can inform us—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>Why, gentlemen, if you know neither the road you are going, nor where you are, nor the road you came, the first thing I have to inform you is, that—You have lost your way.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>We wanted no ghost to tell us that.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>Pray, gentlemen, may I be so bold as to ask the place from whence you came?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>That's not necessary towards directing us where we are to go.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>
No offence; but question for question is all fair,
<pb n="14"/>
you know. Pray, gentlemen, is not this same Hardcastle a cross-grain'd, old-fashion'd, whimsical fellow, with an ugly face; a daughter, and a pretty son?
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>We have not seen the gentleman, but he has the family you mention.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>
The daughter, a tall trapesing, trolloping, talkative maypole—-The son, a pretty, well-bred, agreeable youth, that every body is fond of.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
Our information differs in this. The daughter is said to be well-bred and beautiful; the son, an aukward booby, reared up, and spoiled at his mother's apron-string.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>He-he-hem—Then, gentlemen, all I have to tell you is, that you won't reach Mr. Hardcastle's house this night, I believe.</l>
</sp>

<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>Unfortunate!</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>
It's a damn'd long, dark, boggy, dirty, dangerous way. Stingo, tell the gentlemen the way to Mr. Hardcastle's;
<stage>(winking upon the Landlord)</stage>
Mr. Hardcastle's, of Quagmire Marsh, you understand me.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LANDLORD.</speaker>
<l>Master Hardcastle's! Lock-a-daisy, my masters, you're come a deadly deal wrong! When you came to the bottom of the hill, you should have cross'd down Squash-lane.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>Cross down Squash-lane!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LANDLORD.</speaker>
<l>Then you were to keep streight forward, 'till you came to four roads.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>Come to where four roads meet!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="15"/>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>Ay; but you must be sure to take only one of them.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>O Sir, you're facetious.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>Then keeping to the right, you are to go side-ways till you come upon Crack-skull common: there you must look sharp for the track of the wheel, and go forward, 'till you come to farmer Murrain's barn. Coming to the farmer's barn, you are to turn to the right, and then to the left, and then to the right about again, till you find out the old mill—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
Zounds, man! we could as soon find out the longitude!
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>What's to be done, Marlow?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>This house promises but a poor reception; though perhaps the Landlord can accommodate us.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LANDLORD.</speaker>
<l>Alack, master, we have but one spare bed in the whole house.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>
And to my knowledge, that's taken up by three lodgers already.
<stage>(after a pause, in which the rest seem disconcerted)</stage>
I have hit it. Don't you think, Stingo, our landlady could accommodate the gentlemen by the fire-side, with—three chairs and a bolster?
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>I hate sleeping by the fire-side.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>And I detest your three chairs and a bolster.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>You do, do you?—then let me see—what—if you go on a mile further, to the Buck's Head; the old Buck's Head on the hill, one of the best inns in the whole county?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="16"/>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>O ho! so we have escaped an adventure for this night, however.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LANDLORD.</speaker>
<stage>(Apart to Tony)</stage>
<l>Sure, you ben't sending them to your father's as an inn, be you?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>
Mum, you fool you. Let
<hi rend="italic">them</hi>
find that out.
<stage>(to them)</stage>
You have only to keep on streight forward, till you come to a large old house by the road side. You'll see a pair of large horns over the door. That's the sign. Drive up the yard, and call stoutly about you.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>Sir, we are obliged to you. The servants can't miss the way?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>No, no: But I tell you though, the landlord is rich, and going to leave off business; so he wants to be thought a Gentleman, saving your presence, he! he! he! He'll be for giving you his company, and ecod if you mind him, he'll persuade you that his mother was an alderman, and his aunt a justice of peace.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LANDLORD.</speaker>
<l>A troublesome old blade to be sure; but a keeps as good wines and beds as any in the whole country.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>Well, if he supplies us with these, we shall want no further connexion. We are to turn to the right, did you say?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>
No, no; streight forward. I'll just step myself, and shew you a piece of the way.

Ay, mind how I hold them. I learned to hold my hands this way, when I was upon drill for the militia. And so being upon drill—

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
You must not be so talkative, Diggory. You must be all attention to the guests. You must hear us talk,
<pb n="18"/>
and not think of talking; you must see us drink, and not think of drinking; you must see us eat, and not think of eating.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DIGGORY.</speaker>
<l>
By the laws, your worship, that's parfectly unpossible. Whenever Diggory sees yeating going forward, ecod he's always wishing for a mouthful himself.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Blockhead! Is not a belly-full in the kitchen as good as a belly-full in the parlour? Stay your stomach with that reflection.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DIGGORY.</speaker>
<l>Ecod I thank your worship, I'll make a shift to stay my stomach with a slice of cold beef in the pantry.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Diggory, you are too talkative. Then if I happen to say a good thing, or tell a good story at table, you must not all burst out a-laughing, as if you made part of the company.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DIGGORY.</speaker>
<l>Then ecod your worship must not tell the story of Ould Grouse in the gun-room: I can't help laughing at that—he! he! he!—for the soul of me. We have laughed at that these twenty years—ha! ha! ha!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Ha! ha! ha! The story is a good one. Well, honest Diggory, you may laugh at that—but still remember to be attentive. Suppose one of the company should call for a glass of wine, how will you behave? A glass of wine, Sir, if you please
<stage>(to Diggory)</stage>
—Eh, why don't you move?
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DIGGORY.</speaker>
<l>Ecod, your worship, I never have courage till I see the eatables and drinkables brought upo' the table, and then I'm as bauld as a lion.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>SERVANT.</speaker>
<l>Welcome, gentlemen, very welcome. This way.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>After the disappointments of the day, welcome once more, Charles, to the comforts of a clean room and a good fire. Upon my word, a very well-looking house; antique, but creditable.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>The usual fate of a large mansion. Having first ruined the master by good housekeeping, it at last comes to levy contributions as an inn.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="20"/>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>As you say, we passengers are to be taxed to pay all these fineries. I have often seen a good sideboard, or a marble chimney-piece, tho' not actually put in the bill, enflame a reckoning confoundedly.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>Travellers, George, must pay in all places. The only difference is, that in good inns, you pay dearly for luxuries; in bad inns, you are fleeced and starved.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>You have lived pretty much among them. In truth, I have been often surprized, that you who have seen so much of the world, with your natural good sense, and your many opportunities, could never yet acquire a requisite share of assurance.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
The Englishman's malady. But tell me, George, where could I have learned that assurance you talk of? My life has been chiefly spent in a college, or an inn, in seclusion from that lovely part of the creation that chiefly teach men confidence. I don't know that I was ever familiarly acquainted with a single modest woman—except my mother—But among females of another class you know—
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>Ay, among them you are impudent enough of all conscience.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
They are of
<hi rend="italic">us</hi>
you know.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>But in the company of women of reputation I never saw such an ideot, such a trembler; you look for all the world as if you wanted an opportunity of stealing out of the room.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
Why man that's because I
<hi>do</hi>
want to steal out of the room. Faith, I have often formed
<pb n="21"/>
a resolution to break the ice, and rattle away at any rate. But I don't know how, a single glance from a pair of fine eyes has totally overset my resolution. An impudent fellow may counterfeit modesty, but I'll be hanged if a modest man can ever counterfeit impudence.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>If you could but say half the fine things to them that I have heard you lavish upon the bar-maid of an inn, or even a college bed maker—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
Why, George, I can't say fine things to them, They freeze, they petrify me. They may talk of a comet, or a burning mountain, or some such bagatelle. But to me, a modest woman, drest out in all her finery, is the most tremendous object of the whole creation.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>Ha! ha! ha! At this rate, man, how can you ever expect to marry!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
Never, unless as among kings and princes, my bride were to be courted by proxy. If, indeed, like an Eastern bridegroom, one were to be introduced to a wife he never saw before, it might be endured. But to go through all the terrors of a formal courtship, together with the episode of aunts, grandmothers and cousins, and at last to blurt out the broad staring question, of,
<hi>madam will you marry me?</hi>
No, no, that's strain much above me I assure you.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>I pity you. But how do you intend behaving to the lady you are come down to visit at the request of your father?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
As I behave to all other ladies. Bow very low. Answer yes, or no, to all her demands—But for
<pb n="22"/>
the rest, I don't think I shall venture to look in her face, till I see my father's again.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>I'm surprized that one who is so warm a friend can be so cool a lover.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
To be explicit, my dear Hastings, my chief inducement down was to be instrumental in forwarding your happiness, not my own. Miss Neville loves you, the family don't know you, as my friend you are sure of a reception, and let honour do the rest.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>
My dear Marlow! But I'll suppress the emotion. Were I a wretch, meanly seeking to carry off a fortune, you should be the last man in the world I would apply to for assistance. But Miss Neville's person is all I ask, and that is mine, both from her deceased father's consent, and her own inclination.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
Happy man! You have talents and art to captivate any woman. I'm doom'd to adore the sex, and yet to converse with the only part of it I despise. This stammer in my address, and this aukward prepossessing visage of mine, can never permit me to soar above the reach of a milliner's 'prentice, or one of the dutchesses of Drury-lane. Pshaw! this fellow here to interrupt us.

<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Gentlemen, once more you are heartily welcome. Which is Mr. Marlow? Sir, you're heartily welcome. It's not my way, you see, to receive my friends with my back to the fire. I like to give them a hearty reception in the old stile at my gate. I like to see their horses and trunks taken care of.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<stage>(aside)</stage>
<l>
He has got our names from the servants already.
<pb n="23"/>
<stage>(To Him)</stage>
We approve your caution and hospitality, Sir.
<stage>(To Hastings)</stage>
I have been thinking, George, of changing our travelling dresses in the morning. I am grown confoundedly ashamed of mine.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>I beg, Mr. Marlow, you'll use no ceremony in this house.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>I fancy, George, you're right: the first blow is half the battle. I intend opening the campaign with the white and gold.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mr. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Mr. Marlow—Mr. Hastings—gentlemen—pray be under no constraint in this house. This is Liberty-hall, gentlemen. You may do just as you please here.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
Yet, George, if we open the campaign too fiercely at first, we may want ammunition before it is over. I think to reserve the embroidery to secure a retreat.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Your talking of a retreat, Mr. Marlow, puts me in mind of the Duke of Marlborough, when we went to besiege Denain. He first summoned the garrison.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
Don't you think the
<hi rend="italic">ventre dor</hi>
waistcoat will do with the plain brown?
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
He first summoned the garrison, which might consist of about five thousand men—
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>I think not: Brown and yellow mix but very poorly.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
I say, gentlemen, as I was telling you, he summoned the garrison, which might consist of about five thousand men—
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>The girls like finery.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="24"/>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Which might consist of about five thousand men, well appointed with stores, ammunition, and other implements of war. Now, says the Duke of Marlborough, to George Brooks, that stood next to him—You must have heard of George Brooks; I'll pawn my Dukedom, says he, but I take that garrison without spilling a drop of blood. So—
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>What, my good friend, if you gave us a glass of punch in the mean time, it would help us to carry on the siege with vigour.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Punch, Sir!
<stage>(aside)</stage>
This is the most unaccountable kind of modesty I ever met with.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>Yes, Sir, Punch. A glass of warm punch, after our journey, will be comfortable. This is Liberty-Hall, you know.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Here's Cup, Sir.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<stage>(Aside)</stage>
<l>So this fellow, in his Liberty-hall, will only let us have just what he pleases.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<stage>(Taking the Cup)</stage>
<l>
I hope you'll find it to your mind. I have prepared it with my own hands, and I believe you'll own the ingredients are tolerable. Will you, be so good as to pledge me, Sir? Here, Mr. Marlow, here is to our better acquaintance.

</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="25"/>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>From the excellence of your cup, my old friend, I suppose you have a good deal of business in this part of the country. Warm work, now and then, at elections, I suppose.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
No, Sir, I have long given that work over. Since our betters have hit upon the expedient of electing each other, there's no business
<hi rend="italic">for us that sell ale.</hi>
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>So, then you have no turn for politics I find.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Not in the least. There was a time, indeed, I fretted myself about the mistakes of government, like other people; but finding myself every day grow more angry, and the government growing no better, I left it to mend itself. Since that, I no more trouble my head about
<hi rend="italic">Heyder Ally,</hi>
or
<hi rend="italic">Ally Cawn,</hi>
than about
<hi rend="italic">Ally Croaker.</hi>
Sir, my service to you.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>
So that with eating above stairs, and drinking below, with receiving your friends within, and amusing them without, you lead a good pleasant bustling life of it.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>I do stir about a great deal, that's certain. Half the differences of the parish are adjusted in this very parlour.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<stage>(After drinking)</stage>
<l>
And you have an argument in your cup, old gentleman, better than any in Westminster-hall.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Ay, young gentleman, that, and a little philosophy.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<stage>(Aside)</stage>
<l>Well, this is the first time I ever heard of an innkeeper's philosophy.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="26" />
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>So then, like an experienced general, you attack them on every quarter. If you find their reason manageable, you attack it with your philosophy; if you find they have no reason, you attack them with this. Here's your health, my philosopher.</l>
<stage>(drinks)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Good, very good, thank you; ha, ha. Your Generalship puts me in mind of Prince Eugene, when he fought the Turks at the battle of Belgrade. You shall hear.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>Instead of the battle of Belgrade. I believe it's almost time to talk about supper. What has your philosophy got in the house for fupper?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
For Supper, Sir!
<stage>(aside)</stage>
Was ever such a request to a man in his own house!
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>Yes, Sir, supper Sir; I begin to feel an appetite. I shall make devilish work to-night in the larder, I promise you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<stage>(Aside)</stage>
<l>
Such a brazen dog sure never my eyes beheld.
<stage>(to him)</stage>
Why really, Sir, as for supper I can't well tell. My Dorothy, and the cook maid, settle these things between them. I leave these kind of things entirely to them.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>You do, do you?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Entirely. By-the-bye, I believe they are in actual consultation upon what's for supper this moment in the kitchen.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
Then I beg they'll admit
<hi>me</hi>
as one of their privy
<pb n="27"/>
council. It's a way I have got. When I travel, I always chuse to regulate my own supper. Let the cook be called. No offence I hope, Sir.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
O no, Sir, none in the least; yet I don't know how: our Bridget, the cook maid, is not very communicative upon these occasions. Should we send for her, she might scold us all out of the house.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>Let's see your list of the larder then. I ask it as a favour. I always match my appetite to my bill of fare.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<stage>(To Hardcastle, who looks at them with surprize)</stage>
<l>Sir, he's very right, and it's my way too.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Sir, you have a right to command here. Here, Roger, bring us the bill of fare for to night's supper. I believe it's drawn out. Your manner, Mr. Hastings, puts me in mind of my uncle, Colonel Wallop. It was a saying of his, that no man was sure of his supper till he had eaten it.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<stage>(Aside)</stage>
<l>All upon the high ropes! His uncle a Colonel! We shall soon hear of his mother being a justice of peace. But let's hear the bill of fare.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<stage>(Perusing)</stage>
<l>
What's here? For the first course; for the second course; for the desert. The devil, Sir, do you think we have brought down the whole Joiners Company, or the Corporation of Bedford, to eat up such a supper? Two or three little things, clean and comfortable, will do.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>But, let's hear it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="28"/>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<stage>(Reading)</stage>
<l>For the first course at the top, a pig, and pruin sauce.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>Damn your pig, I say.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>And damn your pruin sauce, say I.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>And yet, gentlemen, to men that are hungry, pig, with pruin sauce, is very good eating.</l>
</sp>

Gentlemen, you are my guests, make what alterations you please. Is there any thing else you wish to retrench or alter, gentlemen?
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>

</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="29"/>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
Why, really, Sir, your bill of fare is so exquisite, that any one part of it is full as good as another. Send us what you please. So much for supper. And now to see that our beds are air'd, and properly taken care of.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>I entreat you'll leave all that to me. You shall not stir a step.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
Leave that to you! I protest, Sir, you must excuse me, I always look to these things myself.
</l>

<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>I must insist, Sir, you'll make yourself easy on that head.</l>

    <stage>Enter Miss NEVILLE.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss NEVILLE.</speaker>
<l>
My dear Hastings! To what unexpected good fortune? to what accident am I to ascribe this happy meeting?
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>Rather let me ask the same question, as I could never have hoped to meet my dearest Constance at an inn.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss NEVILLE.</speaker>
<l>
An inn! sure you mistake! my aunt, my guardian, lives here. What could induce you to think this house an inn?
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>My friend Mr. Marlow, with whom I came down, and I, have been sent here as to an inn, I assure you. A young fellow whom we accidentally met at a house hard by directed us hither.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss NEVILLE.</speaker>
<l>Certainly it must be one of my hopeful cousin's tricks, of whom you have heard me talk so often, ha! ha! ha! ha!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>He whom your aunt intends for you? He of whom I have such just apprehensions?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss NEVILLE.</speaker>
<l>
You have nothing to fear from him, I assure you. You'd adore him if you knew how heartily he despises me. My aunt knows it too, and has undertaken to court me for him, and actually begins to think she has made a conquest.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="31"/>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>
Thou dear dissembler! You must know, my Constance, I have just seized this happy opportunity of my friend's visit here to get admittance into the family. The horses that carried us down are now fatigued with their journey, but they'll soon be refreshed; and then if my dearest girl will trust in her faithful Hastings, we shall soon be landed in France, where even among slaves the laws of marriage are respected.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss NEVILLE.</speaker>
<l>
I have often told you, that though ready to obey you, I yet should leave my little fortune behind with reluctance. The greatest part of it was left me by my uncle, the India Director, and chiefly consists in jewels. I have been for some time persuading my aunt to let me wear them. I fancy I'm very near succeeding. The instant they are put into my possession you shall find me ready to make them and myself yours.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>Perish the baubles! Your person is all I desire. In the meantime, my friend Marlow must not be let into his mistake. I know the strange reserve of his temper is such, that if abruptly informed of it, he would instantly quit the house before our plan was ripe for execution.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss NEVILLE.</speaker>
<l>But how shall we keep him in the deception? Miss Hardcastle is just returned from walking; what if we still continue to deceive him?—This, this way—</l>

Enter MARLOW.

<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>The assiduities of these good people teize me beyond bearing. My host seems to think it ill manners to leave me alone, and so he claps not only himself but his old-fashioned wife on my back. They talk of coming to sup with us too; and then, I suppose, we are to run the gauntlet thro' all the rest of the family.—What have we got here!—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>My dear Charles! Let me congratulate you!—The most fortunate accident!—Who do you think is just alighted?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>Cannot guess.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>
Our mistresses boy, Miss Hardcastle and Miss Neville. Give me leave to introduce Miss Constance Neville to your acquaintance. Happening to dine in the neighbourhood, they called, on their return to take fresh horses, here. Miss Hardcastle has just stept into the next room, and will be back in an instant. Wasn't it lucky? eh!
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<stage>(Aside)</stage>
<l>I have just been mortified enough of all conscience, and here comes something to complete my embarrassment.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>Well! but wasn't it the most fortunate thing in the world?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
Oh! yes. Very fortunate—a most joyful encounter—But our dresses, George, you know,
<pb n="33"/>
are in disorder—What if we should postpone the happiness 'till to-morrow?—To-morrow at her own house—It will be every bit as convenient—And rather more respectful—To-morrow let it be.
</l>
<stage>[offering to go.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss NEVILLE.</speaker>
<l>
By no means, Sir. Your ceremony will displease her. The disorder of your dress will shew the ardour of your impatience. Besides, she knows you are in the house, and will permit you to see her.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
O! the devil! how shall I support it? Hem! hem! Hastings, you must not go. You are to assist me, you know. I shall be confoundedly ridiculous. Yet, hang it! I'll take courage. Hem!
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>Pshaw man! it's but the first plunge, and all's over. She's but a woman, you know.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
And of all women, she that I dread most to encounter!
</l></sp>
<stage>Enter Miss HARDCASTLE as returned from walking, a Bonnet, &amp;</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS,</speaker>
<stage>(introducing them.)</stage>
<l>Miss Hardcastle, Mr. Marlow, I'm proud of bringing two persons of such merit together, that only want to know, to esteem each other.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE</speaker>
<stage>aside.</stage>
<l>
Now, for meeting my modest gentleman with a demure face, and quite in his own manner.
<stage>
(After a pause, in which he appears very uneasy and disconcerted.)
</stage>
I'm glad of your safe arrival, Sir—I'm told you had some accidents by the way.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="34"/>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>Only a few madam. Yes, we had some. Yes, Madam, a good many accidents, but should be sorry—Madam—or rather glad of any accidents—that are so agreeably concluded. Hem!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<stage>(To him.)</stage>
<l>You never spoke better in your whole life. Keep it up, and I'll insure you the victory.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
I'm afraid you flatter, Sir. You that have seen so much of the finest company can find little entertainment in an obscure corner of the country.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<stage>(Gathering courage.)</stage>
<l>
I have lived, indeed, in the world, Madam; but I have kept very little company. I have been but an observer upon life, Madam, while others were enjoying it.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss NEVILLE.</speaker>
<l>But that, I am told, is the way to enjoy it at last.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<stage>(To him.)</stage>
<l>Cicero never spoke better. Once more, and you are confirm'd in assurance for ever.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<stage>(To him.)</stage>
<l>Hem! Stand by me then, and when I'm down, throw in a word or two to set me up again.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>An observer, like you, upon life, were, I fear, disagreeably employed, since you must have had much more to censure than to approve.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>Pardon me, Madam. I was always willing to be amused. The folly of most people is rather an object of mirth than uneasiness.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="35"/>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<stage>(To him.)</stage>
<l>Bravo, Bravo. Never spoke so well in your whole life. Well! Miss Hardcastle, I see that you and Mr. Marlow are going to be very good company. I believe our being here will but embarrass the interview.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
Not in the least, Mr. Hastings. We like your company of all things.
<stage>(To him.)</stage>
Zounds! George, sure you won't go? How can you leave us?
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>
Our presence will but spoil conversation, so we'll retire to the next room.
<stage>(To him)</stage>
You don't consider, man, that we are to manage a little tête-à-tête of our own.
</l>
</sp>
<stage>Exeunt.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<stage>(After a pause)</stage>
<l>But you have not been wholly an observer, I presume, Sir: The ladies I should hope have employed some part of your addresses.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<stage>(Relapsing into timidity)</stage>
<l>Pardon me, Madam, I—I—I—as yet have studied—only—to—deserve them.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
And that some say is the very worst way to obtain them.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
Perhaps so, madam. But I love to converse only with the more grave and sensible part of the sex.—But I'm afraid I grow tiresome.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Not at all, Sir; there is nothing I like so much as grave conversation myself; I could hear it for ever. Indeed I have often been surprized how a
<pb n="36"/>
man of
<hi>sentiment</hi>
could ever admire those light airy pleasures, where nothing reaches the heart.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
It's—a disease—of the mind, madam. In the variety of tastes there must be some who wanting a relish—for—um—a—um.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>I understand you, Sir. There must be some, who wanting a relish for refined pleasures, pretend to despise what they are incapable of tasting.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
My meaning, madam, but infinitely better expressed. And I can't help observing—a—
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<stage>(Aside)</stage>
<l>
Who could ever suppose this fellow impudent upon some occasions.
<stage>(To him)</stage>
You were going to observe, Sir—
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>I was observing, madam—I protest, madam, I forget what I was going to observe.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<stage>(Aside)</stage>
<l>
I vow and so do I.
<stage>(To him)</stage>
You were observing, Sir, that in this age of hypocrisy something about hypocrisy, Sir.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>Yes, madam. In this age of hypocrisy there are few who upon strict enquiry do not—a—a—a—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>I understand you perfectly, Sir.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<stage>(Aside)</stage>
<l>Egad! and that's more than I do myself.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
You mean that in this hypocritical age there are few that do not condemn in public what they practise
<pb n="37"/>
in private, and think they pay every debt to virtue when they praise it.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>True, madam; those who have most virtue in their mouths, have least of it in their bosoms. But I'm sure I tire you, madam.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Not in the least, Sir; there's something so agreeable and spirited in your manner, such life and force—pray, Sir, go on.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>Yes, madam. I was saying—that there are some occasions—when a total want of courage, madam, destroys all the—and puts us—upon a—a—a—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>I agree with you entirely, a want of courage upon some occasions assumes the appearance of ignorance, and betrays us when we most want to excel. I beg you'll proceed.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>Yes, madam. Morally speaking, madam—But I see Miss Neville expecting us in the next room. I would not intrude for the world.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
I protest, Sir, I never was more agreeably entertained in all my life. Pray go on.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>Yes, madam. I was—But she beckons us to join her. Madam, shall I do myself the honour to attend you?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Well then, I'll follow.</l>
</sp>

<l>This pretty smooth dialogue has done for me.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Ha! ha! ha! Was there ever such a sober sentimental interview? I'm certain he scarce look'd in my face the whole time. Yet the fellow, but for his unaccountable bashfulness, is pretty well too. He has good sense, but then so buried in his fears, that it fatigues one more than ignorance. If I could teach him a little confidence, it would be doing somebody that I know of a piece of service. But who is that somebody?—that, faith, is a question I can scarce answer.
</l>

<stage>[Exit.</stage>
<stage>Enter TONY and Miss NEVILLE, followed by Mrs. HARDCASTLE and HASTINGS.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>
What do you follow me for, cousin Con? I wonder you're not ashamed to be so very engaging.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss NEVILLE.</speaker>
<l>
I hope, cousin, one may speak to one's own relations, and not be to blame.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>Ay, but I know what sort of a relation you want to make me though; but it won't do. I tell you, cousin Con, it won't do, so I beg you'll keep your distance, I want no nearer relationship.</l>
</sp>
<stage>[She follows coqueting him to the back scene.</stage>
<sp>
<pb n="39"/>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Well! I vow, Mr. Hastings, you are very entertaining. There's nothing in the world I love to talk of so much as London, and the fashions, though I was never there myself.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>Never there! You amaze me! From your air and manner, I concluded you had been bred all your life either at Ranelagh, St. James's, or Tower Wharf.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
O! Sir, you're only pleased to say so. We Country persons can have no manner at all. I'm in love with the town, and that serves to raise me above some of our neighbouring rustics; but who can have a manner, that has never seen the Pantheon, the Grotto Gardens, the Borough, and such places where the Nobility chiefly resort? All I can do, is to enjoy London at second-hand. I take care to know every tête-à-tête from the Scandalous Magazine, and have all the fashions, as they come out, in a letter from the two Miss Rickets of Crookedlane. Pray how do you like this head, Mr. Hastings?
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>Extremely elegant and degagée, upon my word, Madam. Your Friseur is a Frenchman, I suppose?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>I protest I dressed it myself from a print in the Ladies Memorandum-book for the last year.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>
Indeed. Such a head in a side-box, at the Playhouse, would draw as many gazers as my Lady May'ress at a City Ball.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="40"/>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>I vow, since inoculation began, there is no such thing to be seen as a plain woman; so one must dress a little particular or one may escape in the crowd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>But that can never be your case, Madam, in any dress.</l>
<stage>(bowing)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Yet, what signifies
<hi>my</hi>
dressing when I have such a piece of antiquity by my side as Mr. Hardcastle: all I can say will never argue down a single button from his cloaths. I have often wanted him to throw off his great flaxen wig, and where he was bald, to plaister it over like my Lord Pately, with powder.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>You are right, Madam; for, as among the ladies, there are none ugly, so among the men there are none old.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>But what do you think his answer was? Why, with his usual Gothic vivacity, he said I only wanted him to throw off his wig to convert it into a tête for my own wearing.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>Intolerable! At your age you may wear what you please, and it must become you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Pray, Mr. Hastings, what do you take to be the most fashionable age about town?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>
Some time ago, forty was all the mode; but I'm told the ladies intend to bring up fifty for the ensuing winter.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="41"/>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Seriously. Then I shall be too young for the fashion.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>No lady begins now to put on jewels 'till she's past forty. For instance, Miss there, in a polite circle, would be considered as a child, as a mere maker of samplers.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>And yet Mrs. Niece thinks herself as much a woman, and is as fond of jewels as the oldest of us all.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>Your niece, is she? And that young gentleman, a brother of yours, I should presume?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
My son, Sir. They are contracted to each other. Observe their little sports. They fall in and out ten times a day, as if they were man and wife already.
<stage>(To them.)</stage>
Well Tony, child, what soft things are you saying to your cousin Constance this evening?
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>I have been saying no soft things; but that it's very hard to be followed about so. Ecod! I've not a place in the house now that's left to myself but the stable.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Never mind him, Con. my dear. He's in another story behind your back.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss NEVILLE.</speaker>
<l>
There's something generous in my cousin's manner. He falls out before faces to be forgiven in private.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="42"/>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>That's a damned confounded—crack.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Ah! he's a sly one. Don't you think they're like each other about the mouth, Mr. Hastings? The Blenkinsop mouth to a T. They're of a size too. Back to back, my pretties, that Mr. Hastings may see you. Come Tony.</l>

<l>If I'm a man, let me have my fortin. Ecod! I'll not be made a fool of no longer.</l>

<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Is this, ungrateful boy, all that I'm to get for the pains I have taken in your education? I that have rock'd you in your cradle, and fed that pretty mouth with a spoon! Did not I work that waistcoat to make you genteel? Did not I prescribe for you every day, and weep while the receipt was operating?
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>
Ecod! you had reason to weep, for you have been dosing me ever since I was born. I have gone through every receipt in the complete huswife ten times over; and you have thoughts of coursing me through
<hi>Quincy</hi>
next spring. But, Ecod! I tell you, I'll not be made a fool of no longer.

<l>I wish you'd let me and my good alone then. Snubbing this way when I'm in spirits. If I'm to have any good, let it come of itself; not to keep dinging it, dinging it into one so.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
That's false; I never see you when you're in spirits. No, Tony, you then go to the alehouse or kennel. I'm never to be delighted with your agreeable, wild notes, unfeeling monster!

<stage>Enter HARDCASTLE solus.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>WHAT could my old friend Sir Charles mean by recommending his son as the modestest young man in town? To me he appears the most impudent piece of brass that ever spoke with a tongue. He has taken possession of the easy chair by the fire-side already. He took off his boots in the parlour, and desired me to see them taken care of. I'm desirous to know how his impudence affects my daughter.—She will certainly be shocked at it.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Enter Miss HARDCASTLE, plainly dress'd.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Well, my Kate, I see you have changed your dress as I bid you; and yet, I believe, there was no great occasion.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
I find such a pleasure, Sir, in obeying your commands, that I take care to observe them without ever debating their propriety.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
And yet, Kate, I sometimes give you some cause, particularly when I recommended my
<hi>modest</hi>
gentleman to you as a lover to-day.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
You taught me to expect something extraordinary, and I find the original exceeds the description.

<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>I was never so surprized in my life! He has quite confounded all my faculties!</l>

<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>I never saw any thing like it: And a man of the world too!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Ay, he learned it all abroad,—what a fool was I, to think a young man could learn modesty by travelling. He might as soon learn wit at a masquerade.

<l>A good deal assisted by bad company and a French dancing-master.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Sure you mistake, papa! a French dancing-master could never have taught him that timid look,—that aukward address,—that bashful manner—
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Whose look? whose manner? child!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Mr. Marlow's: his meauvaise honte, his timidity struck me at the first sight.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Then your first sight deceived you; for I think him one of the most brazen first sights that ever astonished my senses.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Sure, Sir, you rally! I never saw any one so modest.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="49"/>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>And can you be serious! I never saw such a bouncing swaggering puppy since I was born. Bully Dawson was but a fool to him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Surprizing! He met me with a respectful bow, a stammering voice, and a look fixed on the ground.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>He met me with a loud voice, a lordly air, and a familiarity that made my blood freeze again.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
He treated me with diffidence and respect; censured the manners of the age; admired the prudence of girls that never laughed; tired me with apologies for being tiresome; then left the room with a bow, and, madam, I would not for the world detain you.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>He spoke to me as if he knew me all his life before. Asked twenty questions, and never waited for an answer. Interrupted my best remarks with some silly pun, and when I was in my best story of the Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene, he asked if I had not a good hand at making punch. Yes, Kate, he ask'd your father if he was a maker of punch!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>One of us must certainly be mistaken.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
If he be what he has shewn himself, I'm determined he shall never have my consent.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>And if he be the sullen thing I take him, he shall never have mine.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="50"/>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>In one thing then we are agreed—to reject him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Yes. But upon conditions. For if you should find him less impudent, and I more presuming; if you find him more respectful, and I more importunate—I don't know—the fellow is well enough for a man—Certainly we don't meet many such at a horse race in the country.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>If we should find him so—But that's impossible. The first appearance has done my business. I'm seldom deceived in that.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>And yet there may be many good qualities under that first appearance.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Ay, when a girl finds a fellow's outside to her taste, she then sets about guessing the rest of his furniture. With her, a smooth face stands for good sense, and a genteel figure for every virtue.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
I hope, Sir, a conversation begun with a compliment to my good sense won't end with a sneer at my understanding?
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Pardon me, Kate. But if young Mr. Brazen can find the art of reconciling contradictions, he may please us both, perhaps.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>And as one of us must be mistaken, what if we go to make further discoveries?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Agreed. But depend on't I'm in the right.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="51"/>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>And depend on't I'm not much in the wrong.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>
Ecod! I have got them. Here they are. My Cousin Con's necklaces, bobs and all. My mother shan't cheat the poor souls out of their fortune neither. O! my genus, is that you?

<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>My dear friend, how have you managed wit your mother? I hope you have amused her with pretending love for your cousin, and that you are willing to be reconciled at last? Our horses will be refreshed in a short time, and we shall soon be ready to set off.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>
And here's something to bear your charges by the way,
<stage>(giving the casket.)</stage>
Your sweetheart's jewels. Keep them, and hang those, I say, that would rob you of one of them.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>But how have you procured them from your mother?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>
Ask me no questions, and I'll tell you no fibs. I procured them by the rule of thumb. If I had not a key to every drawer in mother's bureau, how could I go to the alehouse so often as I do? An honest man may rob himself of his own at any time.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="52"/>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>
Thousands do it every day. But to be plain with you; Miss Neville is endeavouring to procure them from her aunt this very instant. If she succeeds, it will be the most delicate way at least of obtaining them.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>Well, keep them, till you know how it will be. But I know how it will be well enough, she'd as soon part with the only sound tooth in her head.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>But I dread the effects of her resentment, when she finds she has lost them.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>
Never you mind her resentment, leave

to manage that. I don't value her resentment the bounce of a cracker. Zounds! here they are. Morrice. Prance.

<stage>TONY, Mrs. HARDCASTLE, Miss NEVILLE.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Indeed, Constance, you amaze me. Such a girl as you want jewels? It will be time enough for jewels, my dear, twenty years hence, when your beauty begins to want repairs.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss NEVILLE.</speaker>
<l>
But what will repair beauty at forty, will certainly improve it at twenty, Madam.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Yours, my dear, can admit of none. That natural blush is beyond a thousand ornaments. Besides, child, jewels are quite out at present. Don't you see half the ladies of our acquaintance, my lady, Kill day light, and Mrs. Crump, and the rest of them,</l>
<pb n="53"/>
<l>carry their jewels to town, and bring nothing but Paste and Marcasites back.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss NEVILLE.</speaker>
<l>But who knows, Madam, but somebody that shall be nameless would like me best with all my little finery about me?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Consult your glass, my dear, and then see, if with such a pair of eyes, you want any better sparklers. What do you think, Tony, my dear, does your cousin Con. want any jewels, in your eyes, to set off her beauty.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>That's as thereafter may be.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss NEVILLE.</speaker>
<l>My dear aunt, if you knew how it would oblige me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>A parcel of old-fashioned rose and table-cut things. They would make you look like the court of king Solomon at a puppet-shew. Besides, I believe I can't readily come at them. They may be missing for aught I know to the contrary.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<stage>(Apart to Mrs. Hardcastle.)</stage>
<l>Then why don't you tell her so at once, as she's so longing for them. Tell her they're lost. It's the only way to quiet her. Say they're lost, and call me to bear witness.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<stage>(Apart to Tony.)</stage>
<l>You know, my dear, I'm only keeping them for you. So if I say they're gone, you'll bear me witness, will you? He! he! he!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>Never fear me. Ecod! I'll say I saw them taken out with my own eyes.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="54"/>
<speaker>Miss NEVILLE.</speaker>
<l>I desire them but for a day, Madam. Just to be permitted to shew them as relicks, and then they may be lock'd up again.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>To be plain with you, my dear Constance; if I could find them, you should have them. They're missing, I assure you. Lost, for aught I know; but we must have patience wherever they are.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss NEVILLE.</speaker>
<l>I'll not believe it; this is but a shallow pretence to deny me. I know they're too valuable to be so slightly kept, and as you are to answer for the loss.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Don't be alarm'd, Constance. If they be lost, I must restore an equivalent. But my son knows they are missing, and not to be found.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>That I can bear witness to. They are missing, and not to be found, I'll take my oath on't.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
You must learn resignation, my dear; for tho' we lose our fortune, yet we should not lose our patience. See me, how calm I am.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss NEVILLE.</speaker>
<l>Ay, people are generally calm at the misfortunes of others.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Now, I wonder a girl of your good sense should waste a thought upon such trumpery. We shall soon find them; and, in the mean time, you shall make use of my garnets till your jewels be found.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss NEVILLE.</speaker>
<l>I detest garnets.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="55"/>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>

</sp>
<stage>[Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss NEVILLE.</speaker>
<l>I dislike them of all things. You shan't stir.—Was ever any thing so provoking to mislay my own jewels, and force me to wear her trumpery.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>
Don't be a fool. If she gives you the garnets, take what you can get. The jewels are your own already. I have stolen them out of her bureau, and she does not know it. Fly to your spark, he'll tell you more of the matter. Leave me to manage

<l>
Why boy, I

ruin'd in earnest. My bureau has been broke open, and all taken away.

<l>Stick to that; ha, ha, ha; stick to that. I'll bear witness, you know, call me to bear witness.</l>

<l>I tell you, Tony, by all that's precious, the jewels are gone, and I shall be ruin'd for ever.</l>

<l>Sure I know they're gone, and I am to say so.</l>

<l>My dearest Tony, but hear me. They're gone, I say.</l>

That's right, that's right: You must be in a bitter passion, and then nobody will suspect either of us. I'll bear witness that they are gone.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Was there ever such a cross-grain'd brute, that won't hear me! Can you bear witness that you're no better than a fool? Was ever poor woman so beset with fools on one hand, and thieves on the other.

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>What an unaccountable creature is that brother of mine, to send them to the house as an inn, ha, ha. I don't wonder at his impudence.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAID.</speaker>
<l>But what is more, madam, the young gentleman as you passed by in your present dress, ask'd me if you were the bar maid? He mistook you for the bar maid, madam.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Did he? Then as I live I'm resolved to keep up the delusion. Tell me, Pimple, how do you like my present dress. Don't you think I look something like Cherry in the Beaux Stratagem?
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAID.</speaker>
<l>It's the dress, madam, that every lady wears in the country, but when she visits or receives company.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>And are you sure he does not remember my face or person?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="58" />
<speaker>MAID.</speaker>
<l>Certain of it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>I vow I thought so; for though we spoke for some time together, yet his fears were such, that he never once looked up during the interview. Indeed, if he had, my bonnet would have kept him from seeing me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAID.</speaker>
<l>But what do you hope from keeping him in his mistake?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
In the first place, I shall be
<hi>seen,</hi>
and that is no small advantage to a girl who brings her face to market. Then I shall perhaps make an acquaintance and that's no small victory gained over one who never addresses any but the wildest of her sex. But my chief aim is to take my gentleman off his guard, and like an invisible champion of romance examine the giant's force before I offer to combat.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MAID.</speaker>

But are you sure you can act your part, and disguise your voice, so that he may mistake that, as he has already mistaken your person?

<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>No, Sir, we have been out of that these ten days.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>One may call in this house, I find, to very little purpose. Suppose I should call for a taste, just by way of trial, of the nectar of your lips; perhaps I might be disappointed in that too.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Nectar! nectar! that's liquor there's no call for in these parts. French, I suppose. We keep no French wines here, Sir.</l>

<l>Of true English growth, I assure you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>

<l>Eighteen years! Why one would think, child, you kept the bar before you were born. How old are you?</l>

<l>I protest, child, you use me extremely ill. If you keep me at this distance, how is it possible you and I can be ever acquainted?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
And who wants to be acquainted with you? I want no such acquaintance, not I. I'm sure you did not treat Miss Hardcastle that was here awhile ago in this obstropalous manner. I'll warrant me, before her you look'd dash'd, and kept bowing to the ground, and talk'd, for all the world, as if you was before a justice of peace.
</l>

<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>

<l>
Egad! she has hit it, sure enough.
<stage>(To her.)</stage>
In awe of her, child? Ha! ha! ha! A mere, aukward, squinting thing, no, no. I find you don't know me. I laugh'd, and rallied her a little; but I was unwilling to be too severe. No, I could not be too severe,

Yes, my dear, a great favourite. And yet, hang me, I don't see what they find in me to follow. At the Ladies Club in town, I'm called their agreeable Rattle. Rattle, child, is not my real name, but one I'm known by. My name is Solomons. Mr. Solomons, my dear, at your service.

<l>
And why not now, my angel? Such beauty fires beyond the power of resistance.—Pshaw! the father here! My old luck: I never nick'd seven that I did not throw ames ace three times following.

</stage>
<stage>Enter HARDCASTLE, who stands in surprize.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
So, madam! So I find
<hi rend="italic">this</hi>
is your
<hi>modest</hi>
lover. This is your humble admirer that kept his eyes fixed on the ground, and only ador'd at humble distance. Kate, Kate, art thou not asham'd to deceive your father so?
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Never trust me, dear papa, but he's still the modest man I first took him for, you'll be convinced of it as well as I.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>By the hand of my body I believe his impudence is infectious! Didn't I see him seize your hand? Didn't I see him hawl you about like a milk maid? and now you talk of his respect and his modesty, forsooth!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>But if I shortly convince you of his modesty, that he has only the faults that will pass off with time, and the virtues that will improve with age, I hope you'll forgive him.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
The girl would actually make one run mad! I tell you I'll not be convinced. I am convinced. He has scarcely been three hours in the house, and he has already encroached on all my prerogatives. You may like his impudence, and call it modesty.
<pb n="64"/>
But my son-in-law, madam, must have very different qualifications.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Sir, I ask but this night to convince you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>You shall not have half the time, for I have thoughts of turning him out this very hour.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Give me that hour then, and I hope to satisfy you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Well, an hour let it be then. But I'll have no trifling with your father. All fair and open do you mind me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
I hope, Sir, you have ever found that I considered your commands as my pride; for your kindness is such, that my duty as yet has been inclination.

<stage>Enter HASTINGS and Miss NEVILLE.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>YOU surprise me! Sir Charles Marlow expected here this night? Where have you had your information?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss NEVILLE.</speaker>
<l>You may depend upon it. I just saw his letter to Mr. Hardcastle, in which he tells him he intends setting out a few hours after his son.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>
Then, my Constance, all must be completed before he arrives. He knows me; and should he find me here, would discover my name, and perhaps my designs, to the rest of the family.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss NEVILLE.</speaker>
<l>The jewels, I hope, are safe.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>Yes, yes. I have sent them to Marlow, who keeps the keys of our baggage. In the meantime, I'll go to prepare matters for our elopement. I have had the Squire's promise of a fresh pair of horses; and, if I should not see him again, will write him further directions.</l>
</sp>
<stage>[Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss NEVILLE.</speaker>

Enter MARLOW, followed by a Servant.
</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>I wonder what Hastings could mean by sending me so valuable a thing as a casket to keep for him, when he knows the only place I have is the seat of a post-coach at an Inn-door. Have you deposited the casket with the landlady, as I ordered you? Have you put it into her own hands?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SERVANT.</speaker>
<l>Yes, your honour.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>She said she'd keep it safe, did she?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SERVANT.</speaker>
<l>Yes, she said she'd keep it safe enough; she ask'd me how I came by it? and she said she had a great mind to make me give an account of myself.</l>
</sp>
<stage>
<hi>[Exit</hi>
Servant.
</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>Ha! ha! ha! They're safe however. What an unaccountable set of beings have we got amongst! This little bar-maid though runs in my head most strangely, and drives out the absurdities of all the rest of the family. She's mine, she must be mine, or I'm greatly mistaken.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Enter HASTINGS.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>
Bless me! I quite forgot to tell her that I intended to prepare at the bottom of the garden. Marlow here, and in spirits too!
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>Give me joy, George! Crown me, shadow me with laurels! Well, George, after all, we modest fellows don't want for success among the women.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="67"/>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>Some women you mean. But what success has your honour's modesty been crowned with now, that it grows so insolent upon us?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>Didn't you see the tempting, brisk, lovely, little thing that runs about the house with a bunch of keys to its girdle?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>Well! and what then?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>She's mine, you rogue you. Such fire, such motion, such eyes, such lips—but, egad! she would not let me kiss them though.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>But are you so sure, so very sure of her?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>Why man, she talk'd of shewing me her work above-stairs, and I am to improve the pattern.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>
But how can
<hi>you,</hi>
Charles, go about to rob a woman of her honour?
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
Pshaw! pshaw! we all know the honour of the bar-maid of an inn. I don't intend to
<hi>rob</hi>
her, take my word for it, there's nothing in this house, I shan't honestly
<hi>pay</hi>
for.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>I believe the girl has virtue.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>And if she has, I should be the last man in the world that would attempt to corrupt it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>You have taken care, I hope, of the casket I sent you to lock up? It's in safety?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="68"/>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
Yes, yes. It's safe enough. I have taken care of it. But how could you think the seat of a post-coach at an Inn-door a place of safety? Ah! numbskull! I have taken better precautions for you than you did for yourself.—I have—
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>What!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>I have sent it to the landlady to keep for you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>To the landlady!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>The landlady.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>You did.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>I did. She's to be answerable for its forth-coming, you know,</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>Yes, she'll bring it forth, with a witness.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>Wasn't I right? I believe you'll allow that I acted prudently upon this occasion?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<stage>(Aside.)</stage>
<l>He must not see my uneasiness.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>You seem a little disconcerted though, methinks. Sure nothing has happened?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>No, nothing. Never was in better spirits in all my life. And so you left it with the landlady, who, no doubt, very readily undertook the charge?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="69"/>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>Rather too readily. For she not only kept the casket; but, thro' her great precaution, was going to keep the messenger too. Ha! ha! ha!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>He! he! he! They're safe however.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>As a guinea in a miser's purse.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<stage>(Aside.)</stage>
<l>
So now all hopes of fortune are at an end, and we must set off without it.
<stage>(To him.)</stage>
Well, Charles, I'll leave you to your meditations on the pretty bar-maid, and, he! he! he! may you be as successful for yourself as you have been for me.
</l>
</sp>
<stage>[Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>Thank ye, George! I ask no more. Ha! ha! ha!</l>
</sp>
<stage>Enter HARDCASTLE.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
I no longer know my own house. It's turned all topsey-turvey. His servants have got drunk already. I'll bear it no longer, and yet, from my respect for his father, I'll be calm.
<stage>(To him.)</stage>
Mr. Marlow, your servant. I'm your very humble servant.
</l>
<stage>(bowing low.</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
Sir, your humble servant.
<stage>(Aside.)</stage>
What's to be the wonder now?
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>I believe, Sir, you must be sensible, Sir, that no man alive ought to be more welcome than your father's son, Sir. I hope you think so?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="70"/>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
I do from my soul, Sir. I don't want much intreaty. I generally make my father's son welcome wherever he goes.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
I believe you do, from my soul, Sir. But tho' I say nothing to your own conduct, that of your Servants is insufferable. Their manner of drinking is setting a very bad example in this house, I assure you.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
I protest, my very good Sir, that's no fault of mine. If they don't drink as they ought
<hi>they</hi>
are to blame. I ordered them not to spare the cellar. I did, I assure you.
<stage>(To the side scene.)</stage>
Here, let one of my servants come up.
<stage>(To him.)</stage>
My positive directions were, that as I did not drink myself, they should make up for my deficiencies below.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Then they had your orders for what they do! I'm satisfied!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>They had, I assure. You shall hear from one of themselves.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Enter SERVANT drunk.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>You, Jeremy! Come forward, sirrah! What were my orders? Were you not told to drink freely, and call for what you thought fit, for the good of the house?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<stage>(Aside.)</stage>
<l>I begin to lose my patience.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JEREMY.</speaker>
<l>
Please your honour, liberty and Fleet-street for ever! Tho' I'm but a servant, I'm as good as another
<pb n="71"/>
man. I'll drink for no man before supper, Sir, dammy! Good liquor will sit upon a good supper, but a good supper will not sit upon—hiccup—upon my conscience, Sir.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>You see, my old friend, the fellow is as drunk as he can possibly be. I don't know what you'd have more, unless you'd have the poor devil soused in a beer-barrel.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Zounds! He'll drive me distracted if I contain myself any longer. Mr. Marlow. Sir; I have submitted to your insolence for more than four hours, and I see no likelihood of its coming to an end. I'm now resolved to be master here, Sir, and I desire that you and your drunken pack may leave my house directly.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>Leave your house!—Sure you jest, my good friend? What, when I'm doing what I can to please you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>I tell you, Sir, you don't please me; so I desire you'll leave my house.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>Sure you cannot be serious? At this time o'night, and such a night. You only mean to banter me?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>I tell you, Sir, I'm serious; and, now that my passions are rouzed, I say this house is mine, Sir; this house is mine, and I command you to leave it directly.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
Ha! ha! ha! A puddle in a storm. I shan't stir a step, I assure you.
<stage>(In a serious tone.)</stage>
This, your house, fellow! It's my house. This is my
<pb n="72"/>
house. Mine, while I chuse to stay. What right have you to bid me leave this house, Sir? I never met with such impudence, curse me, never in my whole life before.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Nor I, confound me if ever I did. To come to my house, to call for what he likes, to turn me out of my own chair, to insult the family, to order his servants to get drunk, and then to tell me
<hi>This house is mine, Sir.</hi>
By all that's impudent it makes me laugh. Ha! ha! ha! Pray, Sir,
<stage>(bantering.)</stage>
as you take the house, what think you of taking the rest of the furniture? There's a pair of silver candlesticks, and there's a fire-screen, and here's a pair of brazen nosed bellows, perhaps you may take a fancy to them?
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>Bring me your bill, Sir, bring me your bill, and let's make no more words about it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>There are a set of prints too. What think you of the rake's progress for your own apartment?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>Bring me your bill, I say; and I'll leave you and your infernal house directly.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Then there's a mahogony table, that you may see your own face in.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>My bill, I say.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
I had forgot the great chair, for your own particular slumbers, after a hearty meal.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>Zounds! bring me my bill, I say, and let's hear no more on't.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="73"/>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Young man, young man, from your father's letter to me, I was taught to expect a well-bred modest man, as a visitor here, but now I find him no better than a coxcomb and a bully; but he will be down here presently, and shall hear more of it.</l>
</sp>
<stage>[Exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
How's this! Sure I have not mistaken the house! Every thing looks like an inn. The servants cry, coming. The attendance is aukward; the bar-maid too to attend us. But she's here, and will further inform me. Whither so fast, child. A word with you.
</l>
</sp>
<stage>
<hi>Enter</hi>
Miss HARDCASTLE.
</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Let it be short then. I'm in a hurry.
<stage>(Aside.)</stage>
(I believe he begins to find out his mistake, but its too soon quite to undeceive him.)
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>Pray, child, answer me one question. What are you, and what may your business in this house be?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>A relation of the family, Sir.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>What. A poor relation?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Yes, Sir. A poor relation appointed to keep the keys, and to see that the guests want nothing in my power to give them.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>That is, you act as the bar-maid of this inn.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="74"/>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Inn. O law—What brought that in your head. One of the best families in the county keep an inn. Ha, ha, ha, old Mr. Hardcastle's house an inn.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
Mr. Hardcastle's house! Is this house Mr. Hardcastle's house, child!
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Ay, sure. Whose else should it be.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>So then all's out, and I have been damnably imposed on. O, confound my stupid head, I shall be laugh'd at over the whole town. I shall be stuck up in caricatura in all the print-shops. The Dullissimo Maccaroni. To mistake this house of all others for an inn, and my father's old friend for an inn-keeper. What a swaggering puppy must he take me for. What a silly puppy do I find myself. There again, may I be hang'd, my dear, but I mistook you for the bar-maid.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Dear me! dear me! I'm sure there's nothing in my
<hi>behavour</hi>
to put me upon a level with one of that stamp.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
Nothing, my dear, nothing. But I was in for a list of blunders, and could not help making you a subscriber. My stupidity saw every thing the wrong way. I mistook your assiduity for assurance, and your simplicity for allurement. But its over—This house I no more shew
<hi>my</hi>
face in.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
I hope, Sir, I have done nothing to disoblige you. I'm sure I should be sorry to affront any gentleman who has been so polite, and said so many
<pb n="75"/>
civil things to me. I'm sure I should be sorry
<stage>(pretending to cry)</stage>
if he left the family upon my account. I'm sure I should be sorry, people said any thing amiss, since I have no fortune but my character.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<stage>[Aside.]</stage>
<l>
By heaven, she weeps. This is the first mark of tenderness I ever had from a modest woman, and it touches me;
<stage>(to her)</stage>
Excuse me, my lovely girl, you are the only part of the family I leave with reluctance. But to be plain with you, the difference of our birth, fortune and education, make an honourable connexion impossible; and I can never harbour a thought of seducing simplicity that trusted in my honour, or bringing ruin upon one, whose only fault was being too lovely.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<stage>[Aside].</stage>
<l>
Generous man! I now begin to admire him.
<stage>(to him.)</stage>
But I'm sure my family is as good as miss Hardcastle's, and though I'm poor, that's no great misfortune to a contented mind, and, until this moment, I never thought that it was bad to want fortune.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>And why now, my pretty simplicity?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Because it puts me at a distance from one, that if I had a thousand pound I would give it all to.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<stage>[Aside.]</stage>
<l>
This simplicity bewitches me, so that if I stay I'm undone. I must make one bold effort, and leave her.
<stage>(to her)</stage>
Your partiality in my favour, my dear, touches me most sensibly, and
<pb n="76"/>
were I to live for myself alone, I could easily fix my choice. But I owe too much to the opinion of the world, too much to the authority of a father, so that—I can scarcely speak it—it affects me. Farewell.

a little if I can.
<stage>[To Mrs. Hardcastle.]</stage>
But I have not told you, Madam, of my cousin's smart answer just now to Mr. Marlow. We so laugh'd—You must know, Madam—this way a little, for he must not hear us.

<speaker>TONY.</speaker>

A damn'd cramp piece of penmanship, as ever I saw in my life. I can read your print-hand very well. But here there are such handles, and shanks, and dashes, that one can scarce tell the head from the tail.
<hi>To Anthony Lumpkin, Esquire.</hi>
It's very odd, I can read the outside of my letters, where my own name is, well enough. But when I come to open it, it's all—buzz. That's hard, very hard; for the inside of the letter is always the cream of the correspondence.
</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Ha, ha, ha. Very well, very well. And so my son was too hard for the philosopher.</l>

<l>Yes, Madam; but you must hear the rest, Madam. A little more this way, or he may hear us. You'll hear how he puzzled him again.</l>

Dear 'Squire, Hoping that you're in health, as I am at this present. The gentlemen of the Shake bag club has cut the gentlemen of goose-green quite out of feather. The odds—um—odd battle—um—long fighting—um here, here, it's all about cocks, and fighting; it's of no consequence, here, put it up, put it up,

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
How's this!
<stage>(reads)</stage>
Dear 'Squire, I'm now waiting for Miss Neville, with a post-chaise and pair, at the bottom of the garden, but I find my horses yet unable to perform the journey. I expect you'll assist us with a pair of fresh horses, as you promised. Dispatch is necessary, as the
<hi rend="italic">hag</hi>
(ay the hag) your mother, will otherwise suspect us. Your's, Hastings. Grant me patience. I shall run distracted. My rage choaks me.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss NEVILLE.</speaker>
<l>
I hope, Madam, you'll suspend your resentment for a few moments, and not impute to me any impertinence, or sinister design that belongs to another.

<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<stage>(Curtesying very low.)</stage>
<l>
Fine spoken, Madam, you are most miraculously polite and engaging, and quite the very pink of curtesy and circumspection, Madam.
<stage>(Changing her tone.)</stage>
And you, you great ill-fashioned oaf, with scarce sense enough to keep your mouth shut. Were you too join'd against me? But I'll defeat all your plots in a moment. As for you, Madam, since you have got a pair of fresh horses ready, it would be cruel to disappoint them. So, if you please, instead of running away with your spark, prepare, this very moment, to run off with
<hi>me.</hi>
Your old aunt Pedigree will keep you secure, I'll warrant me. You too, Sir, may mount your horse, and guard us upon the way. Here, Thomas, Roger, Diggory, I'll shew you, that I wish you better than you do yourselves.

Sir, I shall be always proud of her approbation.

<l>Approbation is but a cold word, Mr. Marlow; if I am not deceived, you have something more than approbation thereabouts. You take me.</l>

<l>Come, boy, I'm an old fellow, and know what's what, as well as you that are younger. I know what has past between you; but mum.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>Sure, Sir, nothing has past between us but the most profound respect on my side, and the most distant reserve on her's. You don't think, Sir, that my impudence has been past upon all the rest of the family.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Impudence! No, I don't say that—Not quite impudence—Though girls like to be play'd with, and rumpled a little too sometimes. But she has told no tales, I assure you.</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir CHARLES.</speaker>
<l>Now I'm perfectly convinced, indeed. I know his conversation among women to be modest and submissive. This forward canting ranting manner by no means describes him, and I am confident, he never sate for the picture.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Then what, Sir, if I should convince you to your face of my sincerity? If you and my papa, in about half an hour, will place yourselves behind that screen, you shall hear him declare his passion to me in person.

No, no. Only mother is confoundedly frightened. She thinks herself forty miles off. She's sick of the journey, and the cattle can scarce crawl. So if your own horses be ready, you may whip off with cousin, and I'll be bound that no soul here can budge a foot to follow you.

<l>My dear friend, how can I be grateful?</l>

<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>
Ay, now its dear friend, noble 'Squire. Just now, it was all ideot, cub, and run me through the guts. Damn
<hi>your</hi>
way of fighting, I say. After we take a knock in this part of the country, we kiss and be friends. But if you had run me through the guts, then I should be dead, and you might go kiss the hangman.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>

The rebuke is just. But I must hasten to relieve miss Neville; if you keep the old lady employed, I promise to take care of the young one.

<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Oh, Tony, I'm killed. Shook. Battered to death. I shall never survive it. That last jolt that laid us against the quickset hedge has done my business.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>Alack, mama, it was all your own fault. You would be for running away by night, without knowing one inch of the way.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>I wish we were at home again. I never met so many accidents in so short a journey. Drench'd in the mud, overturn'd in a ditch, stuck fast in a slough, jolted to a jelly, and at last to lose our way. Whereabouts do you think we are, Tony?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="95"/>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>By my guess we should be upon Crackskull common, about forty miles from home.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>O lud! O lud! the most notorious spot in all the country. We only want a robbery to make a complete night on't.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TONY.</speaker>
<l>Don't be afraid, mama, don't be afraid. Two of the five that kept here are hanged, and the other three may not find us. Don't be afraid. Is that a man that's galloping behind us? No; its only a tree. Don't be afraid.</l>

<l>It was I, Sir, talking to myself, Sir. I was saying that forty miles in four hours was very good going. Hem. As to be sure it was. Hem. I have got a sort of cold by being out in the air. We'll go in, if you please. Hem.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

Mr. Hardcastle, as I'm alive! My fears blinded me. But who, my dear, could have expected to meet you here, in this frightful place, so far from home. What has brought you to follow us?

<l>My dear Constance, why will you deliberate thus? If we delay a moment, all is lost for ever. Pluck up a little resolution, and we shall soon be out of the reach of her malignity.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss NEVILLE.</speaker>
<l>
I find it impossible. My spirits are so sunk with the agitations I have suffered, that I am unable to face any new danger. Two or three years patience will at last crown us with happiness.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HASTINGS.</speaker>
<l>
Such a tedious delay is worse than inconstancy. Let us fly, my charmer. Let us date our happiness from this very moment. Perish fortune. Love and content will encrease what we possess beyond a monarch's revenue. Let me prevail.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="99"/>
<speaker>Miss NEVILLE.</speaker>
<l>
No, Mr. Hastings; no. Prudence once more comes to my relief, and I will obey its dictates. In the moment of passion, fortune may be despised, but it ever produces a lasting repentance. I'm resolved to apply to Mr. Hardcastle's compassion and justice for redress.

What a situation am I in. If what you say appears, I shall then find a guilty son. If what he says be true, I shall then lose one that, of all others, I most wish'd for a daughter.

<l>I am proud of your approbation, and to shew I merit it, if you place yourselves as I directed, you shall hear his explicit declaration. But he comes.</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<stage>(In her own natural manner.)</stage>
<l>
I believe these sufferings cannot be very great, Sir, which you can so easily remove. A day or two longer, perhaps, might lessen your uneasiness, by shewing the little value of what you now think proper to regret.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<stage>[Aside.]</stage>
<l>
This girl every moment improves upon me.
<stage>(To her.)</stage>
It must not be, Madam. I have already trifled too long with my heart. My very pride begins to submit to my passion. The disparity of education and fortune, the anger of a parent, and the contempt of my equals, begin to lose their weight; and nothing can restore me to myself, but this painful effort of resolution.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Then go, Sir. I'll urge nothing more to detain you. Tho' my family be as good as her's you came down to visit, and my education, I hope, not inferior, what are these advantages without equal affluence? I must remain contented with the slight approbation of imputed merit; I must have only the mockery of your addresses, while all your serious aims are fix'd on fortune.</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
By heavens, Madam, fortune was ever my smallest consideration. Your beauty at first caught my eye; for who could see that without emotion. But every moment that I converse with you, steals in some new grace, heightens the picture, and gives it stronger expression. What at first seem'd rustic plainness, now appears refin'd simplicity. What seem'd forward assurance, now strikes me as the result of courageous innocence, and conscious virtue.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir CHARLES.</speaker>
<l>What can it mean! He amazes me!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>I told you how it would be. Hush!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
I am now determined to stay, Madam, and I have too good an opinion of my father's discernment, when he sees you, to doubt his approbation.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>No, Mr. Marlow, I will not, cannot detain you. Do you think I could suffer a connexion, in which there is the smallest room for repentance? Do you think I would take the mean advantage of a transient passion, to load you with confusion? Do you think I could ever relish that happiness, which was acquired by lessening your's?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>
By all that's good, I can have no happiness but what's in your power to grant me. Nor shall I ever feel repentance, but in not having seen your merits before. I will stay, even contrary to your wishes; and tho' you should persist to shun me, I
<pb n="102"/>
will make my respectful assiduities atone for the levity of my past conduct.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Miss HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>
Sir, I must entreat you'll desist. As our acquaintance began, so let it end, in indifference. I might have given an hour or two to levity; but feriously, Mr. Marlow, do you think I could ever submit to a connexion, where
<hi>I</hi>
must appear mercenary, and
<hi>you</hi>
imprudent? Do you think I could ever catch at the confident addresses of a secure admirer?
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<stage>(Kneeling.)</stage>
<l>Does this look like security. Does this look like confidence. No, Madam, every moment that shews me your merit only serves to encrease my diffidence and confusion. Here let me continue—</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Sir CHARLES.</speaker>
<l>
I can hold it no longer. Charles, Charles, how hast thou deceived me! Is this your indifference, your uninteresting conversation!
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>Your cold contempt; your formal interview. What have you to say now?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>That I'm all amazement! What can it mean!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
<l>It means that you can say and unsay things at pleasure. That you can address a lady in private, and deny it in public; that you have one story for us, and another for my daughter.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<pb n="103"/>
<speaker>MARLOW.</speaker>
<l>Daughter!—this lady your daughter!</l>

<l>
In which of your characters, Sir, will you give us leave to address you. As the faultering gentleman, with looks on the ground, that speaks just to be heard, and hates hypocrisy; or the loud confident creature, that keeps it up with Mrs. Mantrap, and old Miss Biddy Buckskin, till three in the morning; ha, ha, ha.

<l>Since his death, I have been obliged to stoop to dissimulation to avoid oppression. In an hour of levity, I was ready even to give up my fortune to secure my choice. But I'm now recover'd from the delusion, and hope from your tenderness what is denied me from a nearer connexion.</l>
