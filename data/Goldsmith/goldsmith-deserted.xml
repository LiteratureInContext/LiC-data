    SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS.</head>
    <lb/>
    <p><hi rend="small-caps">Dear Sir,</hi></p>
    
    <p>I can have no expectations in an address of this kind, either to add to your reputation, or to establish my own.
    You can gain nothing from my admiration, as I am ignorant of that art in which you are said to excel;
    and I may lose much by the severity of your judgment, as few have a juster taste in poetry than yuou. Setting interest therefore
    aside, to which I never paid much attention, I must be indulged at present in following my affections. The only dedication I ever made was to my brother, because I loved him better than most other men. He is since dead. Permit me to inscribe this Poem to you.</p>

    <p> How far you may be pleased with the versification and mere mechanical parts of this attempt, I don't pretend to inquire; but I know you will, object (and indeed several of our best and wisest friends concur with the opinion) that the depopulation it deplores is nowhere to be seen, and the disorder it laments are only to be found in the poet's own imagination. To this I can scarce make any other answer than that I sincerely believe what I have written; but I have taken all 
        <pb n="vi" facs="pageImages/vi.png"/>
        possible pains, in my country excursions, for these four or five years past, to be certain of what I allege, and that all my views and inquiries have led me to believe those miseries real, which I attempt to display. But this is not the place to enter into an inquiry, whether the country be depopulating, or not; a discussion will take up much room, and I should prove myself, at best, an indifferent politician, to tire the reader, with a long preface, when I want is his unfatigued attention to a long poem.</p>
    <p> In regretting the depopulation of the country, I inveigh against the increase of our luxuries; and here also I expect the shout of modern politicians against me. For twenty or thirty years past, it has been the fashion to consider luxury as one of the greatest national advantages; and all the wisdom of antiquity in that particular, as erroneous. Still, however, I must remain a professed ancient on that head, and continue to think those luxuries prejudicial to states, by which so many vices are introduced, and so many kingdoms have been undone. Indeed, so much has been poured out of late on the other side of the question, that, merely for the sake of novelty and variety, one would sometimes wish to be in the right.</p>
    <p>I am, dear Sir,</p>
    <p>Your sincere friend,and ardent admirer,</p>
    <p>OLIVER GOLDSMITH</p>

<lg>

    <l n="1">Sweet <hi rend="small caps">AUBURN</hi>, loveliest village of the plain,</l>
<l n="2">Where health and plenty cheered the labouring swain,</l>
<l n="3">Where smiling Spring its earliest visit paid,</l>
<l n="4">And parting summer's lingering blooms delayed;</l>
<l n="5">Dear lovely bowers of innocence and ease,</l>
<l n="6">Seats of my youth, when every sport could please,</l>
<l n="7">How often have I loitered o'er thy green,</l>
<l n="8">Where humble happiness endeared each scene;</l>
<l n="9">How often have I paused on every charm,</l>
<l n="10">The shelter'd cot, the cultivated farm,</l>
 <l n="11">The never-failing brook, the busy mill,</l>
<l n="12">The decent church that topt the neighbouring hill;</l>
<l n="13">The hawthorn bush, with seats beneath the shade,</l>
<l n="14">For talking age and whispering lovers made.</l>
    
    <pb n="8" facs="pageImages/8.png"/>
<l n="15">How often have I blest the coming day,</l>
<l n="16">When toil remitting lent its turn to play,</l>
<l n="17">And all the village train from labour free,</l>
<l n="18">Led up their sports beneath the spreading tree;</l>
<l n="19">While many a pastime circled in the shade,</l>
<l n="20">The young contending as the old surveyed;</l>
<l n="21">And many a gambol frolicked o'er the ground,</l>
<l n="22">And flights of art and feats of strength went round:</l>
<l n="23">And still as each repeated pleasure tired,</l>
<l n="24">Succeeding sports the mirthful band inspired;</l>
<l n="25">The dancing pair that simply sought renown,</l>
<l n="26">By holding out to tire each other down,</l>
<l n="27">The swain mistrustless of his smutted face,</l>
<l n="28">While secret laughter tittered round the place,</l>
<l n="29">The bashful virgin's side-long looks of love,</l>
<l n="30">The matron's glance, that would those looks reprove.</l>
<l n="31">These were thy charms, sweet village; sports like these,</l>
<l n="32">With sweet succession, taught even toil to please;</l>
<l n="33">These round thy bowers their cheerful influence shed,</l>
<l n="34">These were thy charms--But all these charms are fled.</l>
</lg>
    
<lg type="stanza">
<l n="35" rend="indent">Sweet smiling village, loveliest of the lawn,</l>
<l n="36">Thy sports are fled, and all thy charms withdrawn:</l>
    
    <pb n="9" facs="pageImages/9.png"/>
<l n="37">Amidst thy bowers the tyrant's hand is seen,</l>
<l n="38">And desolation saddens all thy green:</l>
<l n="39">One only master grasps the whole domain,</l>
<l n="40">And half a tillage stints thy smiling plain:</l>
<l n="41">No more thy glassy brook reflects the day,</l>
<l n="42">But choaked with sedges, works its weedy way;</l>
<l n="43">Along thy glades, a solitary guest,</l>
<l n="44">The hollow-sounding bittern guards its nest;</l>
<l n="45">Amidst thy desert walks the lapwing flies,</l>
<l n="46">And tires their echoes with unvaried cries:</l>
<l n="47">Sunk are thy bowers in shapeless ruin all,</l>
<l n="48">And the long grass o'ertops the mouldering wall;</l>
<l n="49">And, trembling, shrinking from the spoiler's hand,</l>
<l n="50">Far, far away thy children leave the land.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l n="51" rend="indent">Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey,</l>
<l n="52">Where wealth accumulates, and men decay;</l>
<l n="53">Princes and lords may flourish, or may fade;</l>
<l n="54">A breath can make them, as a breath has made:</l>
<l n="55">But a bold peasantry, their country's pride,</l>
<l n="56">When once destroy'd, can never be supplied.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l n="57" rend="indent">A time there was, ere England's griefs began,</l>
<l n="58">When every rood of ground maintained its man;</l>
<l n="59">For him light labour spread her wholesome store,</l>
<l n="60">Just gave what life required, but gave no more:</l>
<l n="61">His best companions, innocence and health;</l>
<l n="62">And his best riches, ignorance of wealth.</l>

    <pb n="10" facs="pageImages/10.png"/>
<l n="63" rend="italic">But times are altered; trade's unfeeling train</l>
<l n="64">Usurp the land and disposses the swain;</l>
<l n="65">Along the lawn, where scattered hamlets rose,</l>
<l n="66">Unwieldy wealth and cumbrous pomp repose;</l>
<l n="67">And every want to luxury allied,</l>
<l n="68">And every pang that folly pays to pride.</l>
<l n="69">Those gentle hours that plenty bade to bloom,</l>
<l n="70">Those calm desires that asked but little room,</l>
<l n="71">Those healthful sports that graced the peaceful scene,</l>
<l n="72">Lived in each look, and brighten'd all the green;</l>
<l n="73">These, far departing, seek a kinder shore,</l>
<l n="74">And rural mirth and manners are no more.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l n="75" rend="indent">Sweet <hi rend="small caps">AUBURN</hi>! parent of the blissful hour,</l>
<l n="76">Thy glades forlorn confess the tyrant's power,</l>
<l n="77">Here, as I take my solitary rounds,</l>
<l n="78">Amidst thy tangling walks, and ruined grounds,</l>
<l n="79">And, many a year elapsed, return to view</l>
<l n="80">Where once the cottage stood, the hawthorn grew-</l>
<l n="81">Here, as with doubtful, pensive steps I range,</l>
<l n="82">Trace every scene, and wonder at the change,</l>
<l n="83">Remembrance wakes with all her busy train,</l>
<l n="84">Swells at my breast, and turns the past to pain.</l>
</lg>
  
<lg type="stanza">
<l n="85" rend="italic">In all my wanderings through this world of care,</l>
<l n="86">In all my griefs-and God has given my share-</l>
    
    <pb n="11" facs="pageImages/11.png"/>
<l n="87">I still had hopes, my latest hours to crown,</l>
<l n="88">Amidst these humble bowers to lay me down;</l>
<l n="89">My anxious day to husband near the close,</l>
<l n="90">And keep life's flame from wasting by repose:</l>
<l n="91">I still had hopes, for pride attends us still,</l>
<l n="92">Amidst the swains to show my book-learned skill,</l>
<l n="93">Around my fire an evening group to draw,</l>
<l n="94">And tell of all I felt, and all I saw:</l>
<l n="95">And, as a hare, whom hounds and horns pursue,</l>
<l n="96">Pants to the place from whence at first she flew,</l>
<l n="97">I still had hopes, my long vexations past,</l>
<l n="98">Here to return--and die at home at last.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l n="99" rend="indent">O blest retirement! friend to life's decline,</l>
<l n="100">Retreats from care that never must be mine,</l>
<l n="101">How blest is he who crowns in shades like these,</l>
<l n="102">A youth of labour with an age of ease;</l>
<l n="103">Who quits a world where strong temptations try,</l>
<l n="104">And, since 'tis hard to combat, learns to fly.</l>
 <l n="105">For him no wretches, born to work and weep,</l>
<l n="106">Explore the mine, or tempt the dangerous deep;</l>
<l n="107">No surly porter stands in guilty state,</l>
<l n="108">To spurn imploring famine from the gate:</l>
<l n="109">But on he moves to meet his latter end,</l>
<l n="110">Angels around befriending virtue's friend;</l>
<l n="111">Sinks to the grave with unperceived decay,</l>
<l n="112">While resignation gently slopes the way;</l>
    
    <pb n="12" facs="pageImages/12.png"/>
<l n="113">And all his prospects brightening to the last,</l>
<l n="114">His Heaven commences ere the world be past!</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l n="115" rend="indent">Sweet was the sound, when oft, at evening's close,</l>
<l n="116">Up yonder hill the village murmur rose;.</l>
<l n="117">There, as I pass'd with careless steps and slow,</l>
<l n="118">The mingled notes came softened from below;</l>
<l n="119">The swain responsive as the milk-maid sung,</l>
<l n="120">The sober herd that lowed to meet their young,</l>
<l n="121">The noisy geese that gobbled o'er the pool,</l>
<l n="122">The playful children just let loose from school;</l>
<l n="123">The watch dog's voice that bay'd the whispering wind,</l>
<l n="124">And the loud laugh that spoke the vacant mind:</l>
<l n="125">These all in sweet confusion sought the shade,</l>
<l n="126">And filled each pause the nightingale had made.</l>
<l n="127">But now the sounds of population fail,</l>
<l n="128">No cheerful murmurs fluctuate in the gale;</l>
<l n="129">No busy steps the grass-grown foot-way tread,</l>
<l n="130">But all the bloomy flush of life is fled;</l>
<l n="131">All but yon widowed, solitary thing,</l>
<l n="132">That feebly bends beside the plashy spring;</l>
<l n="133">She, wretched matron, forced, in age, for bread,</l>
<l n="134">To strip the brook with mantling cresses spread,</l>
<l n="135">To pick her wintry faggot from the thorn,</l>
<l n="136">To seek her nightly shed, and weep till morn;</l>
    
    <pb n="13" facs="pageImages/13.png"/>
<l n="137">She only left of all the harmless train,</l>
<l n="138">The sad historian of the pensive plain.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l n="139" rend="indent">Near yonder copse, where once the garden smil'd,</l>
<l n="140">And still where many a garden flower grows wild,</l>
<l n="141">There, where a few torn shrubs the place disclose,</l>
<l n="142">The village preacher's modest mansion rose.</l>
<l n="143">A man he was to all the country dear,</l>
<l n="144">And passing rich with forty pounds a-year.</l>
<l n="145">Remote from towns he ran his godly race,</l>
<l n="146">Nor e'er had changed, nor wish'd to change, his place;</l>
<l n="147">Unskilful he to fawn, or seek for power</l>
<l n="148">By doctrines fashioned to the varying hour;</l>
<l n="149">Far other aims his heart had learned to prize,</l>
<l n="150">More bent to raise the wretched than to rise.</l>
<l n="151">His house was known to all the vagrant train,</l>
<l n="152">He chid their wanderings, but relieved their pain:</l>
<l n="153">The long-remembered beggar was his guest,</l>
<l n="154">Whose beard descending swept his aged breast;</l>
<l n="155">The ruin'd spendthrift, now no longer proud,</l>
<l n="156">Claim'd kindred there, and had his claims allowed;</l>
<l n="157">The broken soldier, kindly bade to stay,</l>
<l n="158">Sate by his fire, and talked the night away;-</l>
<l n="159">Wept o'er his wounds, or tales of sorrow done,</l>
<l n="160">Shouldered his crutch, and show'd how fields were won.</l>
    
    <pb n="14" facs="pageImages/14.png"/>
<l n="161">Pleased with his guests, the good man learn'd to glow,</l>
<l n="162">And quite forgot their vices in their woe;</l>

<l n="164">His pity gave ere charity began,</l></lg>
 
<lg type="stanza">
<l n="165" rend="indent">Thus to relieve the wretched was his pride,</l>
<l n="166">And even his failings leaned to Virtue's side;</l>
<l n="167">But in his duty prompt at every call,</l>
<l n="168">He watch'd and wept, he prayed and felt, for all:</l>
<l n="169">And, as a bird each fond endearment tries,</l>
<l n="170">To tempt its new-fledged offspring to the skies,</l>
<l n="171">He tried each art, reproved each dull delay,</l>
<l n="172">Allured to brighter worlds, and led the way.</l>

<l n="173" rend="indent">Beside the bed where parting life was laid,</l>
<l n="174">And sorrow, guilt, and pain, by turns dismayed,</l>

<l n="176">Despair and anguish fled the struggling soul;</l>
<l n="177">Comfort came down the trembling wretch to raise,</l>

<l n="179" rend="indent">At church, with meek and unaffected grace,</l>

<l n="188">Their welfare pleased him, and their cares distrest;</l>
<l n="189">To them his heart, his love, his griefs were given,</l>
<l n="190">But all his serious thoughts had rest in Heaven.</l>
<l n="191">As some tall cliff that lifts its awful form,</l>
<l n="192">Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm,</l>

<l n="198">The village master taught his little school.</l>
<l n="199">A man severe he was, and stern to view,</l>
<l n="200">I knew him well, and every truant knew;</l>
<l n="201">Well had the boding tremblers learned to trace</l>
<l n="202">The day's disasters in his morning face;</l>
<l n="203">Full well they laugh'd with counterfeited glee</l>
<l n="204">At all his jokes, for many a joke had he;</l>
<l n="205">Full well the busy whisper circling round,</l>
<l n="206">Convey'd the dismal tidings when he frowned:</l>
<l n="207">Yet he was kind, or if severe in aught,</l>
<l n="208">The love he bore to learning was in fault.</l>
    
    <pb n="16" facs="pageImages/16.png"/>
<l n="209">The village all declared how much he knew;</l>
<l n="210">'Twas certain he could write, and cipher too:</l>
<l n="211">Lands he could measure, terms and tides presage,</l>
<l n="212">And even the story ran that he could gauge.</l>
<l n="213">In arguing, too, the parson owned his skill,</l>
<l n="214">For even tho' vanquished, he could argue still;</l>
<l n="215">While words of learned length, and thundering sound,</l>
<l n="216">Amazed the gazing rustics ranged around;</l>
<l n="217">And still they gazed, and still the wonder grew,</l>
<l n="218">That one small head could carry all he knew.</l>

<l n="236">With aspen boughs, and flowers, and fennel, gay;</l>
<l n="237">While broken tea-cups, wisely kept for shew,</l>
