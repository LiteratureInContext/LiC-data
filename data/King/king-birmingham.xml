                     <note>The first typewritten copy of King's letter was put together by Willie
                        Pearl Mackey, secretary to Wyatt Tee Walker, Executive Director for the
                        Southern Christian Leadership Conference, from notes smuggled out of
                        Birmingham City Jail (<ref

                           >Samford Library Special Collection</ref>). The letter was originally
                        written as a letter--it was addressed to Bishop C. C. J. Carpenter, Bishop
                        Joseph A. Durick, Rabbi Milton L. Grafman, Bishop Nolan B. Harmon, The Rev.
                        George H. Murray, The rev. Edward V. Ramabe, and The Rev. Earl Stallings.
                        The letter was dated from Birmingham City Jail, April 16, 1963. King closed
                        the letter with the salutation, "Yours for the cause of Peace and
                        Brotherhood." This digital edition uses the text first officially published

               eight clergymen.</head>
            <p>MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.</p>
            <div>
               <p>MY DEAR FELLOW CLERGYMEN,</p>

               <p><hi rend="italic">While confined</hi> here in the Birmingham city jail, I came across your recent
                  statement calling my present activities "unwise and untimely." Seldom do I pause
                  to answer criticism of my work and ideas. If I sought to answer all the criticisms
                  that cross my desk, my secretaries would have little time for anything other than
                  such correspondence in the course of the day, and I would have no time for
                  constructive work. But since I feel that you are men of genuine good will and that
                  your criticisms are sincerely set forth, I want to try to answer your statement in
                  what I hope will be patient and reasonable terms.</p>
               <p>I think I should indicate why I am here in Birmingham, since you have been
                  influenced by the view which argues against "outsiders coming in." I have the
                  honor of serving as president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, an
                  organization operating in every southern state, with headquarters in Atlanta,
                  Georgia. We have some eighty five affiliated organizations across the South, and
                  one of them is the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights. Frequently we
                  share staff, educational and financial resources with our affiliates. Several
                  months ago the affiliate here in Birmingham asked us to be on call to engage in a
                  nonviolent direct action program if such were deemed necessary. We readily
                  consented, and when the hour came we lived up to our promise. So I, along with
                  several members of my staff, am here because I was invited here. I am here because
                  I have organizational ties here.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head type="sub">I</head>
                  <p> But more basically, I am in Birmingham because injustice is here. Just as the
                     prophets of the eighth century B.C. left their villages and carried their "thus
                     saith the Lord" far afield, and just as the
                     Apostle Paul left his village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of Jesus Christ
                     to the far corners of the Greco Roman world, so am I compelled to carry the
                     gospel of freedom beyond my own home town. Like Paul, I must constantly respond
                     to the Macedonian call for aid.</p>

                  <p> Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and
                     states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens
                     in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are
                     caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of
                     destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. Never again can
                     we afford to live with the narrow, provincial "outside agitator" idea. Anyone
                     who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere
                     within its bounds.</p>

                  <p> You deplore the demonstrations taking place in Birmingham. But your statement,
                     I am sorry to say, fails to express a similar concern for the conditions that
                     brought about the demonstrations. I am sure that none of you would want to rest
                     content with the superficial kind of social analysis that deals merely with
                     effects and does not grapple with underlying causes. It is unfortunate that
                     demonstrations are taking place in Birmingham, but it is even more unfortunate
                     that the city's white power structure left the Negro community with no
                     alternative.</p>
               </div>
               <div>
                  <head type="sub">II</head>
                  <p> In any nonviolent campaign there are four basic steps: collection of the facts
                     to determine whether injustices exist; negotiation; self purification; and
                     direct action. We have gone through all these steps in Birmingham. There can
                     be no gainsaying the fact that racial injustice engulfs this community.
                     Birmingham is probably the most thoroughly segregated city in the United
                     States. Police brutality  is widely known. Its unjust treatment of Negroes in the courts is a notorious reality.There have been more unsolved bombings
                     of Negro homes and churches in Birmingham than in any other city in the nation.
                     These are the hard, brutal facts of the case. On the basis of these conditions,
                     Negro leaders sought to negotiate with the city fathers. But the latter
                     consistently refused to engage in good faith negotiation.</p>

                  <p>Then, last September, came the opportunity to talk with leaders of Birmingham's
                     economic community. In the course of the negotiations, certain promises were
                     made by the merchants--for example, to remove the stores' humiliating racial
                     signs. On the basis of these promises, the Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth and the
                     leaders of the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights agreed to a
                     moratorium on all demonstrations. As the weeks and months went by, we realized
                     that we were the victims of a broken promise. The signs  remained.</p>
                  <p>As in so many past experiences, our hopes had <pb n="768"
                        facs="pageImages/cc__Page_3.jpg"/>been blasted,and our disappointment was keenly felt. We had no alternative except to prepare for
                     direct action, whereby we would present our very bodies as a means of laying
                     our case before the conscience of the local and the national community. Mindful
                     of the difficulties involved, we decided to undertake a process of self
                     purification. We began a series of workshops on nonviolence, and we repeatedly
                     asked ourselves: "Are you able to accept blows without retaliating?" "Are you
                     able to endure the ordeal of jail?" We decided to schedule our direct action
                     program for the Easter season, realizing that except for Christmas, this is the
                     main shopping period of the year. Knowing that a strong economic-withdrawal
                     program would be the by product of direct action, we felt that this would be
                     the best time to bring pressure to bear on the merchants. .</p>

                  <p> But  Birmingham's mayoral election was coming up in
                     March
                     When we discovered that the Commissioner of Public Safety, Eugene "Bull"
                     Connor, had piled up enough votes to be in the run off, we decided to postpone the demonstrations until the day after the run-off so that they could not be used to cloud the issues..It is evident then, that we did not move irresponsibly into direct action Like many others, we waited to see Mr.
                     Connor defeated, and to this end we endured postponement after postponement.
                     Having aided in this community need, we felt that our direct action program
                     could be delayed no longer.</p>

                  <p> You may well ask,: "Why direct action? Why sit ins, marches and so forth? Isn't
                     negotiation a better path?" You are quite right in calling for negotiation.
                     Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action
                     seeks to foster such a tension that a community which
                     has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks
                     so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the
                     creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent resister may sound
                     rather shocking. But I readily acknowledge  that I am not afraid of the word "tension."
                     I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive,
                     nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it
                     was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could shake off the bondage of myths and half truths to the unfettered realm of creative
                     analysis and objective appraisal, so must we see the need for nonviolent
                     gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from
                     the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of
                     understanding and brotherhood. </p>
                  <p>The purpose of our direct action program is to create a situation so crisis
                     packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation. I therefore concur
                     with you in your call for negotiation. Too long has our beloved Southland been
                     bogged down in a tragic effort to live in monologue rather than dialogue.</p>

                  <p> One of the basic points in your statement is that the action that I and my
                     associates have taken in Birmingham is untimely. Some have asked: "Why didn't
                     you give the new city administration time to act?" The only answer that I can
                     give to this query is that the new Birmingham administration must be prodded
                     about as much as the outgoing one, before it will act. We are sadly mistaken if
                     we feel that the election of Albert Boutwell as mayor will bring the millennium
                     to Birmingham. While Mr. Boutwell is a much more gentle person than Mr. Connor,
                     they are both segregationists, dedicated to maintenance of the status quo. I
                     have hope that Mr. Boutwell will be reasonable enough to see the futility of
                     massive resistance to desegregation. But he will not see this without pressure
                     from devotees of civil rights. My friends, I must say to you that we have not
                     made a single gain in civil rights without determined legal and nonviolent
                     pressure. Lamentably, it is an historical fact that privileged groups seldom
                     give up their privileges voluntarily. Individuals may see the moral light and
                     voluntarily give up their unjust posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded
                     us, groups tend to be more immoral than individuals.</p>

                  <p> We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by
                     the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed. Frankly, I have yet to
                     engage in a direct action campaign that was "well timed" in the view of those
                     who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. For years now I
                     have heard the word "Wait!" It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing
                     familiarity. This "Wait" has almost always meant "Never." As our distinguished jurors once said, that "justice too long delayed is
                     justice denied."</p>

                  <p> We have waited for more than 340 years for our constitutional and God given
                     rights. The nations of Asia and Africa are moving with jetlike speed toward
                     gaining political independence, but we still creep at horse and buggy pace
                     toward gaining a cup of coffee at a lunch counter. Perhaps it is easy for those
                     who have never felt the stinging darts of segregation to say, "Wait." But when
                     you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown
                     your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate filled policemen
                     curse, kick and even kill your black brothers and sisters; when you see the
                     vast majority of your twenty million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight
                     cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society; when you suddenly find
                     your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you <pb n="769"
                        facs="pageImages/cc__Page_4.jpg"/>seek to explain to your six year old
                     daughter why she can't go to the public amusement park that has just been
                     advertised on television, and see tears welling up in her eyes when she is told
                     that Funtown is closed to colored children, and see ominous clouds of
                     inferiority beginning to form in her little mental sky, and see her beginning
                     to distort her personality by developing an unconscious bitterness toward white
                     people; when you have to concoct an answer for a five year old son who is
                     asking: "Daddy, why do white people treat colored people so mean?"; when you
                     take a cross county drive and find it necessary to sleep night after night in
                     the uncomfortable corners of your automobile because no motel will accept you;
                     when you are humiliated day in and day out by nagging signs reading "white" and
                     "colored"; when your first name becomes "nigger," your middle name becomes
                     "boy" (however old you are) and your last name becomes "John," and your wife
                     and mother are never given the respected title "Mrs."; when you are harried by
                     day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a Negro,, never quite knowing                                                                                 what to expect next, and are plagued with
                     inner fears and outer resentments; when you are forever fighting a degenerating
                     sense of "nobodiness"--then you will understand why we find it difficult to
                     wait. There comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over, and men are no
                     longer willing to be plunged into the abyss of despair. I hope, sirs, you can
                     understand our legitimate and unavoidable impatience.</p>

                  <head type="sub">V</head>
                  <p> You express a great deal of anxiety over our willingness to break laws. This
                     is certainly a legitimate concern. Since we so diligently urge people to obey
                     the Supreme Court's decision of 1954 outlawing segregation in the public
                     schools, at first glance it may seem rather paradoxical for us consciously to
                     break laws. One may well ask: "How can you advocate breaking some laws and
                     obeying others?" The answer lies in the fact that there are two types of laws:
                     just and unjust. I would agree with Augustine that "an unjust law is no law at                                                                                                                                                                                                                   all."</p>

                  <p> Now, what is the difference between the two? How does one determine whether                               a law is just or unjust? A just law is a man made code that squares with the
                     moral law or the law of God. An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony
                     with the moral law. To put it in the terms of St. Thomas Aquinas: An unjust law
                     is a human law that is not rooted in eternal law and natural law. Any law that
                     uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is
                     unjust. All segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the
                     soul and damages the personality. It gives the segregator a false sense of
                     superiority and the segregated a false sense of inferiority. Segregation, to
                     use the terminology of the Jewish philosopher Martin Buber, substitutes an "I
                     it" relationship for an "I thou" relationship and ends up relegating persons to
                     the status of things. Hence segregation is not only politically, economically
                     and sociologically unsound, it is  sinful. Paul Tillich has
                     said that sin is separation. Is not segregation an existential expression of
                     man's tragic separation, his awful estrangement, his terrible sinfulness? Thus
                     it is that I can urge men to disobey segregation ordinances, for such ordinances 	are morally wrong.".</p>

                  <p> Let us consider some of the ways in which a law can be unjust. A law is unjust,                      for example, if a  majority group compels a minority group to
                     obey but does not make binding on itself. By the
                     same token, a law  in all probability is just if the majority itself willing to obey it. lf. This is sameness made legal. Let me
                     give another explanation. Also a  law is unjust if it is inflicted 
on a minority
                     that, as a result of being denied the right to vote, had no part in enacting or
                     devising the law. Who can say that the legislature of Alabama which set up that
                     state's segregation laws was democratically elected? Throughout Alabama all
                     sorts of devious methods are used to prevent Negroes from becoming registered
                     voters, and there are some counties in which, even though Negroes constitute a
                     majority of the population, not a 
single Negro is registered. Can any law
                     enacted under such circumstances be considered democratically structured?</p>

                  <p> Sometimes a law is just on its face and unjust in its application. For
                     instance, I have been arrested on a charge of parading without a permit. Now,
                     there is nothing wrong in having an ordinance which requires a permit for a
                     parade. But such an ordinance becomes unjust when it is used to maintain
                     segregation and to deny citizens the First-Amendment privilege of peaceful
                     assembly and protest.</p>

                  <p> I hope you are able to see the distinction I am trying to point out. In no
                     sense do I advocate evading or defying the law, as would the rabid
                     segregationist. That would lead to anarchy. One who breaks an unjust law must
                     do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the penalty. I submit
                     that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and
                     who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the
                     conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the
                     highest respect for law.</p>

                  <p> Of course, there is nothing new about this kind of civil disobedience. It was
                     evidenced sublimely in the refusal of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego to obey
                     the laws of Nebuchadnezzar, on the ground that a higher moral law was at stake.
                     It was practiced superbly by the early Christians, who were willing to face
                     hungry lions and the excruciating pain of chopping blocks rather than submit to
                     certain unjust laws of the Roman Empire. To a degree, academic freedom is a
                     reality today because Socrates practiced civil disobedience.we should never forget that <pb n="770" facs="pageImages/cc__Page_5.jpg"/> 
everything
                     Adolf Hitler did in Germany was "legal" and everything the Hungarian freedom
                     fighters did in Hungary was "illegal." It was "illegal" to aid and comfort a
                     Jew in Hitler's Germany. Even so, I am sure that, had I lived in Germany at the
                     time, I would have aided and comforted my Jewish brothers. If today I lived in
                     a Communist country where certain principles dear to the Christian faith are
                     suppressed, I would openly advocate disobeying that country's antireligious
                     laws.</p>

               <div>
                  <head type="sub">VI</head>
                  <p> I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers.
                     First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely
                     disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable
                     conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom
                     is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white
                     moderate, who is more devoted to "order" than to justice; who prefers a
                     negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the
                     presence of justice; who constantly says: "I agree with you in the goal you
                     seek, but I cannot agree with your methods"; who
                     paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom;
                     who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to
                     wait for a "more convenient season." Shallow understanding from people of good
                     will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill
                     will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.</p>

                  <p> I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist
                     for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose
                     they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social
                     progress. I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present
                     tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious
                     negative peace, in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight, to a
                     substantive and positive peace, in which all men will respect the dignity and
                     worth of human personality. Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action
                     are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden
                     tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be
                     seen and dealt with. Like a boil that can never be cured so long as it is
                     covered up but must be opened with all its puss-flowing ugliness to the natural medicines of
                     air and light, injustice must be exposed, with all the tension its exposure
                     creates, to the light of human conscience and the air of national opinion
                     before it can be cured.</p>

                  <p> In your statement you assert that our actions, even though peaceful, must be
                     condemned because they precipitate violence. But is this a logical assertion?
                     Isn't this like condemning a robbed man because his possession of money
                     precipitated the evil act of robbery? Isn't this like condemning Socrates
                     because his unswerving commitment to truth and his philosophical inquiries
                     precipitated the act by the misguided populace in which they made him drink
                     hemlock? Isn't this like condemning Jesus because his unique God consciousness
                     and never ceasing devotion to God's will precipitated the evil act of
                     crucifixion? We must come to see that, as the federal courts have consistently
                     affirmed, it is wrong to urge an individual to cease his efforts to gain his
                     basic constitutional rights because the quest may precipitate violence. Society
                     must protect the robbed and punish the robber. </p>
                  <p>I had also hoped that the white moderate would reject the myth concerning time
                     in relation to the struggle for freedom. I have just received a letter from a
                     white brother in Texas. He writes: "All Christians know that the colored people
                     will receive equal rights eventually, but it is possible that you are in too
                     great a religious hurry. It has taken Christianity almost 2,000 years to
                     accomplish what it has. The teachings of Christ take time to come to earth."
                     Such an attitude stems from a tragic misconception of time, from the strangely
                     irrational notion that there is something in the very flow of time that will
                     inevitably cure all ills. Actually, time itself is neutral; it can be used
                     either destructively or constructively. More and more I feel that the people of
                     ill will have used time much more effectively than have the people of good
                     will. We will have to repent in this generation not merely for the hateful
                     words and actions of the bad people but for the appalling silence of the good
                     people. Human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability; it comes
                     through the tireless efforts of men willing to be co workers with God, and
                     without this hard work, time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social
                     stagnation. We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that the time is
                     always ripe to do right. Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy
                     and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood.
                     Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial
                     injustice to the solid rock of human dignity.</p>

                  <p> You speak of our activity in Birmingham as extreme. At first I was rather
                     disappointed that fellow clergymen would see my nonviolent efforts as those of
                     an extremist. I began thinking about the fact that I stand in the middle of two
                     opposing forces in the Negro community. One is a force of complacency, made up
                     in part of Negroes who, as a result of long years of oppression, are so drained
                     of self respect and a sense of "somebodiness" that they have adjusted to
                     segregation; and in part of a few middle-class Negroes who, because of a degree
                     of academic and economic security and because in some ways they profit by
                     segregation, have unconciously become insensitive to the problems of the masses. The other
                     force is one of bitterness and hatred, and it <pb n="771"
                        facs="pageImages/cc__Page_6.jpg"/>comes perilously close to advocating
                     violence. It is expressed in the various black nationalist groups that are
                     springing up across the nation, the largest and best known being Elijah
                     Muhammad's Muslim movement. Nourished by the Negro's frustration over the
                     continued existence of racial discrimination, this movement is made up of
                     people who have lost faith in America, who have absolutely repudiated
                     Christianity, and who have concluded that the white man is an incorrigible
                     "devil."</p>

                  <p> I have tried to stand between these two forces, saying that we need emulate
                     neither the "do nothingism" of the complacent nor the hatred and despair of the
                     black nationalist. For there is the more excellent way of love and nonviolent
                     protest. I am grateful to God that, through the influence of the Negro church,
                     the way of nonviolence became an integral part of our struggle. </p>


 <p>If this  philosophy had not emerged, by now many streets of the South would, I am
                     convinced, be flowing with blood. And I am further convinced that if our white
                     brothers dismiss as "rabble rousers" and "outside agitators" those of us who
                     employ nonviolent direct action, and if they refuse to support our nonviolent
                     efforts, millions of Negroes will, out of frustration and despair, seek solace
                     and security in black nationalist ideologies--a development that would
                     inevitably lead to a frightening racial nightmare.</p>

                  <p> Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever. The yearning for freedom
                     eventually manifests itself, and that is what has happened to the American
                     Negro. Something within has reminded him of his birthright of freedom, and
                     something without has reminded him that it can be gained. Consciously or
                     unconsciously, he has been caught up by the Zeitgeist, and with his black
                     brothers of Africa and his brown and yellow brothers of Asia, South America and
                     the Caribbean, the United States Negro is moving with a sense of great urgency
                     toward the promised land of racial justice. If one recognizes this vital urge
                     that has engulfed the Negro community, he should readily understand why public
                     demonstrations are taking place. The Negro has many pent up resentments and
                     latent frustrations, and he must release them. So let him march; let him make
                     prayer pilgrimages to the city hall; let him go on freedom rides -and try to
                     understand why he must do so. If his repressed emotions are not released in
                     nonviolent ways, they will seek expression through violence; this is not a
                     threat but a fact of history. So I have not said to my people: "Get rid of your
                     discontent." Rather, I have tried to say that this normal and healthy
                     discontent can be channeled into the creative outlet of nonviolent direct
                     action. And now this approach is being termed extremist. </p>
                  <p>But though I was initially disappointed at being categorized as an extremist,
                     as I continued to think about the matter I gradually gained a measure of
                     satisfaction from the label. Was not Jesus an extremist for love: "Love your
                     enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for
                     them which despitefully use you, and persecute you." Was not Amos an extremist
                     for justice: "Let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever
                     flowing stream." Was not Paul an extremist for the Christian gospel: "I bear in
                     my body the marks of the Lord Jesus." Was not Martin Luther an extremist: "Here
                     I stand; I cannot do otherwise, so help me God." And John Bunyan: "I will stay
                     in jail to the end of my days before I make a butchery of my conscience." And
                     Abraham Lincoln: "This nation cannot survive half slave and half free." And
                     Thomas Jefferson: "We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are
                     created equal . . ." So the question is not whether we will be extremists, but
                     what kind of extremists we will be. Will we be extremists for hate or for love?
                     Will we be extremists for the preservation of injustice or for the extension of
                     justice? In that dramatic scene on Calvary's hill three men were crucified. We
                     must never forget that all three were crucified for the same crime--the crime
                     of extremism. Two were extremists for immorality, and thus fell below their
                     environment. The other, Jesus Christ, was an extremist for love, truth and
                     goodness, and thereby rose above his environment. Perhaps the South, the nation
                     and the world are in dire need of creative extremists.</p>

                  <p> I had hoped that the white moderate would see this need. Perhaps I was too
                     optimistic; perhaps I expected too much. I suppose I should have realized that
                     few members of the oppressor race can understand the deep groans and passionate
                     yearnings of the oppressed race, and still fewer have the vision to see that
                     injustice must be rooted out by strong, persistent and determined action. I am
                     thankful, however, that some of our white brothers in the South have grasped
                     the meaning of this social revolution and committed themselves to it. They are
                     still all too few in quantity, but they are big in quality. Some -such as Ralph
                     McGill, Lillian Smith, Harry Golden, James McBride Dabbs, Ann Braden and Sarah
                     Patton Boyle--have written about our struggle in eloquent and prophetic terms.
                     Others have marched with us down nameless streets of the South. They have
                     languished in filthy, roach infested jails, suffering the abuse and brutality
                     of policemen who view them as "dirty nigger-lovers." Unlike so many of their
                     moderate brothers and sisters, they have recognized the urgency of the moment
                     and sensed the need for powerful "action" antidotes to combat the disease of
                     segregation. </p>

                  <head type="sub">IX</head>
                  <p>Let me take note of my other major disappointment. Though there are some notable exceptions, I have also been disappointed with the white church and its leadership. I do not say this as one of those negative critics who can always find something wrong with the church. I say this as a minister of the gospel, who loves the church; who was nurtured in its boom; who has been sustained by its spiritual blessings and who will remain true to it as long as the cord of life shall lengthen. </p>

                  <p> When I was suddenly catapulted into the leadership of the bus protest in
                     Montgomery, Alabama, a <pb n="772" facs="pageImages/cc__Page_7.jpg"/>few years
                     ago, I felt we would be supported by the white church. I felt that the white
                     ministers, priests and rabbis of the South would be among our strongest allies.
                     Instead, some have been outright opponents, refusing to understand the freedom
                     movement and misrepresenting its leaders; all too many others have been more
                     cautious than courageous and have remained silent behind the anesthetizing
                     security of stained glass windows.</p>

                  <p> In spite of my shattered dreams, I came to Birmingham with the hope that the
                     white religious leadership of this community would see the justice of our cause
                     and, with deep moral concern, would serve as the channel through which our just
                     grievances could reach the power structure. I had hoped that each of you would
                     understand. But again I have been disappointed.</p>

                  <p> I have heard numerous southern religious leaders admonish their worshipers to
                     comply with a desegregation decision because it is the law, but I have longed
                     to hear white ministers declare: "Follow this decree because integration is
                     morally right and because the Negro is your brother." In the midst of blatant
                     injustices inflicted upon the Negro, I have watched white churchmen stand on
                     the sideline and mouth pious irrelevancies and sanctimonious trivialities. In
                     the midst of a mighty struggle to rid our nation of racial and economic
                     injustice, I have heard many ministers say: "Those are social issues, with
                     which the gospel has no real concern." And I have watched many churches commit
                     themselves to a completely other worldly religion which makes a strange,
                     un-Biblical distinction between body and soul, between the sacred and the
                     secular.</p>

<p> We are moving toward the close of the 20th century with a religious community largely adjusted to the status quo-a tailllight behind other community agencies rather than a headlight leading men to higher levels of justice. </p>

               <div>
                  <head type="sub">X</head>
                  <p> I have traveled the length and breadth of Alabama, Mississippi and all the
                     other southern states. On sweltering summer days and crisp autumn mornings I
                     have looked at the South's beautiful churches with their lofty spires pointing
                     Heavenward, and at her impressive religious education buildings. Over and over I have found myself asking: "What kind of
                     people worship here? Who is their God? Where were their voices when the lips of
                     Governor Barnett dripped with words of interposition and nullification? Where
                     were they when Governor Wallace gave a clarion call for defiance and hatred?
                     Where were their voices of support when bruised and weary Negro men and women
                     decided to rise from the dark dungeons of complacency to the bright hills of
                     creative protest?"</p>

                  <p> Yes, these questions are still in my mind. In deep disappointment I have wept
                     over the laxity of the church. But be assured that my tears have been tears of
                     love. There can be no deep disappointment where there is not deep love. Yes, I
                     love the church. How could I do otherwise? I am in the rather unique position
                     of being the son, the grandson and the great grandson of preachers. Yes, I see
                     the church as the body of Christ. But, oh! How we have blemished and scarred
                     that body through social neglect and through fear of being nonconformists.</p>

                  <p> There was a time when the church was very powerful--in the time when the early
                     Christians rejoiced at being deemed worthy to suffer for what they believed. In
                     those days the church was not merely a thermometer that recorded the ideas and
                     principles of popular opinion; it was a thermostat that transformed the mores
                     of society. Whenever the early Christians entered a town, the people in power
                     became disturbed and immediately sought to convict the Christians for being
                     "disturbers of the peace" and "outside agitators."' But the Christians pressed
                     on, in the conviction that they were "a colony of heaven," called to obey God
                     rather than man. Small in number, they were big in commitment. By their effort and example
                     they brought an end to such ancient evils as infanticide and gladiatorial
                     contests. </p>

               <div>
                  <head type="sub">XI</head>
                  <p>Things are different now. So often the contemporary church is a weak,
                     ineffectual voice with an uncertain sound. So often it is an archdefender of
                     the status quo. Far from being disturbed by the presence of the church, the
                     power structure of the average community is consoled by the church's
                     silent--and often even vocal--sanction of things as they are.</p>

                  <p> But the judgment of God is upon the church as never before. If today's church
                     does not recapture the sacrificial spirit of the early church, it will lose its
                     authenticity, forfeit the loyalty of millions, and be dismissed as an
                     irrelevant social club with no meaning for the twentieth century. Every day I
                     meet young people whose disappointment with the church has turned into outright
                     disgust.</p>

                  <p> Perhaps I have once again been too optimistic. Is organized religion too
                     inextricably bound to the status quo to save our nation and the world? Perhaps
                     I must turn my faith to the inner spiritual church, the church within the
                     church, as the true ekklesia and the hope of the world. But again I am thankful
                     to God that some noble souls from the ranks of organized religion have broken
                     loose from the paralyzing chains of conformity and joined us as active partners
                     in the struggle for freedom. They have left their secure congregations and
                     walked the streets of Albany, Georgia, with us. They have gone down the
                     highways of the South on tortuous rides for freedom. Yes, they have gone to
                     jail with us. Some have been dismissed from their churches, have lost the
                     support of their bishops and fellow ministers. But they have acted in the faith
                     that right defeated is stronger than evil triumphant. Their witness has been
                     the spiritual salt that has preserved <pb n="773"
                        facs="pageImages/cc__Page_8.jpg"/>the true meaning of the gospel in these
                     troubled times. They have carved a tunnel of hope through the dark mountain of
                     disappointment. </p>
                  <p>I hope the church as a whole will meet the challenge of this decisive hour. But
                     even if the church does not come to the aid of justice, I have no despair about
                     the future. I have no fear about the outcome of our struggle in Birmingham,
                     even if our motives are at present misunderstood. We will reach the goal of
                     freedom in Birmingham and all over the nation, because the goal of America is
                     freedom. Abused and scorned though we may be, our destiny is tied up with
                     America's destiny. Before the pilgrims landed at Plymouth, we were here. Before
                     the pen of Jefferson etched the majestic words of the Declaration of
                     Independence across the pages of history, we were here. For more than two
                     centuries our forebears labored in this country without wages; they made cotton
                     king; they built the homes of their masters while suffering gross injustice and
                     shameful humiliation -and yet out of a bottomless vitality they continued to
                     thrive and develop. If the inexpressible cruelties of slavery could not stop
                     us, the opposition we now face will surely fail. We will win our freedom
                     because the sacred heritage of our nation and the eternal will of God are
                     embodied in our echoing demands. </p>

                  <p>Before closing I feel impelled to mention one other point in your statement
                     that has troubled me profoundly. You warmly commended the Birmingham police
                     force for keeping "order" and "preventing violence." I doubt that you would
                     have so warmly commended the police force if you had seen its dogs sinking
                     their teeth into unarmed, nonviolent Negroes. I doubt that you would so quickly
                     commend the policemen if you were to observe their ugly and inhumane treatment
                     of Negroes here in the city jail; if you were to watch them push and curse old
                     Negro women and young Negro girls; if you were to see them slap and kick old
                     Negro men and young boys; if you were to observe them, as they did on two
                     occasions, refuse to give us food because we wanted to sing our grace together.
                     I cannot join you in your praise of the Birmingham police department.</p>

                  <p> It is true that the police have exercised a degree of discipline in handling
                     the demonstrators. In this sense they have conducted themselves rather
                     "nonviolently" in public. But for what purpose? To preserve the evil system of
                     segregation. Over the past few years I have consistently preached that
                     nonviolence demands that the means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek.
                     I have tried to make clear that it is wrong to use immoral means to attain
                     moral ends. But now I must affirm that it is just as wrong, or perhaps even
                     more so, to use moral means to preserve immoral ends. Perhaps Mr. Connor and
                     his policemen have been rather nonviolent in public, as was Chief Pritchett in
                     Albany, Georgia, but they have used the moral means of nonviolence to maintain
                     the immoral end of racial injustice. As T. S. Eliot has said: "The last
                     temptation is the greatest treason: To do the right deed for the wrong
                     reason."</p>

                  <p> I wish you had commended the Negro sit inners and demonstrators of Birmingham
                     for their sublime courage, their willingness to suffer and their amazing
                     discipline in the midst of great provocation. One day the South will recognize
                     its real heroes. They will be the James Merediths, with the noble sense of
                     purpose that enables them to face jeering and hostile mobs, and with the
                     agonizing loneliness that characterizes the life of the pioneer. They will be
                     old, oppressed, battered Negro women, symbolized in a seventy two year old
                     woman in Montgomery, Alabama, who rose up with a sense of dignity and with her
                     people decided not to ride segregated buses, and who responded with
                     ungrammatical profundity to one who inquired about her weariness: "My feets is
                     tired, but my soul is at rest." They will be the young high school and college
                     students, the young ministers of the gospel and a host of their elders,
                     courageously and nonviolently sitting in at lunch counters and willingly going
                     to jail for conscience' sake. One day the South will know that when these
                     disinherited children of God sat down at lunch counters, they were in reality
                     standing up for what is best in the American dream and for the most sacred
                     values in our Judaeo Christian heritage, thereby bringing our nation back to
                     those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the founding fathers in
                     their formulation of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.</p>

                  <p> Never before have I written so long a letter. I'm afraid it is much too long
                     to take your precious time. I can assure you that it would have been much
                     shorter if I had been writing from a comfortable desk, but what else can one do
                     when he is alone in a narrow jail cell, other than write long letters, think
                     long thoughts and pray long prayers?</p>
                  <p>If I have said anything in this letter that overstates the truth and indicates
                     an unreasonable impatience, I beg you to forgive me. If I have said anything
                     that understates the truth and indicates my having a patience that allows me to
                     settle for anything less than brotherhood, I beg God to forgive me.</p>

                  <p> I hope this letter finds you strong in the faith. I also hope that
                     circumstances will soon make it possible for me to meet each of you, not as an
                     integrationist or a civil-rights leader but as a fellow clergyman and a
                     Christian brother. Let us all hope that the dark clouds of racial prejudice
                     will soon pass away and the deep fog of misunderstanding will be lifted from
                     our fear drenched communities, and in some not too distant tomorrow the radiant
                     stars of love and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their
                     scintillating beauty.</p>
