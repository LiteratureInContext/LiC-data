The activity of the audience in the pit and the behaviour of the occupants of the boxes, especially with the King present, were part of the theatregoing spectacle."

Her Tears, however, and the Destraction she appeared in, after the ruinous Extasy was past, as it heighten'd his Wonder, so it abated his Satisfaction: – He could not imagine for what Reason a Woman, who, if she intended not to be a Mistress, had counterfeited the Part of one, and taken so much Pains to engage him, should lament a Consequence which she could not but expect, and till the last Test, seem'd inclinable to grant; and was both surpris'd and troubled at the Mystery. – He omitted nothing that he thought might make her easy; and still retaining an Opinion that the Hope of Interest had been the chief Motive which had led her to act in the Manner she had done, and believing that she might know so little of him, as to suppose, now she had nothing left to give, he might not make that Recompense she expected for her Favours: To put her out of that Pain, he pulled out of his Pocket a Purse of Gold, entreating her to accept of that as an Earnest of what he intended to do for her; assuring her, with ten thousand Protestations, that he would spare nothing, which his whole Estate could purchase, to procure her Content and Happiness.

When they came to the Inn where they were to lie, he declar'd himself somewhat more freely, and perceiving she did not resent it past Forgiveness, grew more encroaching still: – He now took the Liberty of kissing away her Tears, and catching the Sighs as they issued from her Lips; telling her if Grief was infectious, he was resolv'd to have his Share; protesting he would gladly exchange Passions with her, and be content to bear her Load of Sorrow, if she would as willingly ease the Burden of his Love. – She said little in answer to the strenuous Pressures with which at last he <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e688">[Page 274]</span> ventur'd to enfold her, but not thinking it Decent, for the Character she had assum'd, to yield so suddenly, and unable to deny both his and her own Inclinations, she counterfeited a fainting, and fell motionless upon his Breast. – He had no great Notion that she was in a real Fit, and the Room they supp'd in happening to have a Bed in it, he took her in his Arms and laid her on it, believing, that whatever her Distemper was, that was the most proper Place to convey her to. – He laid himself down by her, and endeavour'd to bring her to herself; and she was too grateful to her kind Physician at her returning Sense, to remove from the Posture he had put her in, without his Leave.</p><p>IT may, perhaps, seem strange that Beauplaisir should in such near Intimacies continue still deceiv'd: I<a class="link_ref" href="a045"></a><span class="note" id="n045"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>While "Fantomina" appears to be told in the third person omniscient, there is a first-person narrator who interjects at points with her own thoughts, as she does here.</span> know there are Men who will swear it is an Impossibility, and that no Disguise could hinder them from knowing a Woman they had once enjoy'd. In answer to these Scruples, I can only say, that besides the Alteration which the Change of Dress made in her, she was so admirably skill'd in the Art of feigning, that she had the Power of putting on almost what Face she pleas'd, and knew so exactly how to form her Behaviour to the Character she represented, that all the Comedians at both Playhouses are infinitely short of her Performances: She could vary her very Glances, tune her Voice to Accents the most different imaginable from those in which she spoke when she appear'd herself. – These Aids from Nature, join'd to the Wiles of Art, and the Distance between the Places where the imagin'd Fantomina and Celia were, might very well prevent his having any Thought that they were the same, or that the fair Widow was either of them: It never so much as enter'd his Head, and though he did fancy he observed in the Face of the latter, Features which were not altogether unknown to him, yet he could not recollect when or where he had known them; – and being told by her, that from her Birth, she had <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e696">[Page 275]</span> never remov'd from Bristol, a Place where he never was, he rejected the Belief of having seen her, and suppos'd his Mind had been deluded by an Idea of some other, whom she might have a Resemblance of.</p><p>THEY pass'd the Time of their Journey in as much Happiness as the most luxurious Gratification of wild Desires could make them; and when they came to the End of it, parted not without a mutual Promise of seeing each other often. – He told her to what Place she should direct a Letter to him; and she assur'd him she would send to let him know where to come to her, as soon as she was fixed in Lodgings.</p><p>SHE kept her Promise; and charm'd with the Continuance of his eager Fondness, went not home, but into private Lodgings, whence she wrote to him to visit her the first Opportunity, and enquire for the Widow Bloomer. – She had no sooner dispatched this Billet<a class="link_ref" href="a046"></a><span class="note" id="n046"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>A "billet" is the French word for letter; a billet doux is a love letter. </span>, than she repair'd to the House where she had lodg'd as Fantomina, charging the People if Beauplaisir should come there, not to let him know she had been out of Town. From thence she wrote to him, in a different Hand<a class="link_ref" href="a047"></a><span class="note" id="n047"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>"Hand" here refers to the style of handwriting used in the letter.</span>, a long Letter of Complaint, that he had been so cruel in not sending one Letter to her all the Time he had been absent, entreated to see him, and concluded with subscribing herself his unalterably Affectionate Fantomina.

This, indeed, must be said of Beauplaisir, that he had a <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e754">[Page 278]</span> greater Share of good Nature than most of his Sex, who, for the most part, when they are weary of an Intreague, break it entirely off, without any Regard to the Despair of the abandon'd Nymph<a class="link_ref" href="a049"></a><span class="note" id="n049"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><img src="https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/dp/original/DP826799.jpg" alt="" style="float:right; width:300px;" />A "nymph" is a mythological nature spirit, usually depicted as a young woman disporting, semi-nude, in woodlands or near water. The word is often used allegorically or metaphorically to refer to elegant, flirtatious young women.

Though he retain'd no more than a bare Pity and Complaisance for Fantomina, yet believing she lov'd him to an Excess, would not entirely forsake her, though the Continuance of his Visits was now become rather a Penance than a Pleasure.</p><p>THE Widow Bloomer triumph'd some Time longer over the Heart of this Inconstant, but at length her Sway was at an End, and she sunk in this Character, to the same Degree of Tastelessness, as she had done before in that of Fantomina and Celia. – She presently perceiv'd it, but bore it as she had always done; it being but what she expected, she had prepar'd herself for it, and had another Project in embrio<a class="link_ref" href="a050"></a><span class="note" id="n050"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>This is an archaic spelling of <span style="font-style:italic">embryo</span>.</span>, which she soon ripen'd into Action. She did not, indeed, compleat it altogether so suddenly as she had done the others, by reason there must be Persons employ'd in it; and the Aversion she had to any Confidents in her Affairs, and the Caution with which she had hitherto acted, and which she was still determin'd to continue, made it very difficult for her to find a Way without breaking thro' that Resolution to compass what she wish'd. – She got over the Difficulty at last, however, by proceeding in a Manner, if possible, more extraordinary than all her former Behaviour: – Muffling herself up in her Hood one Day, she went into the Park<a class="link_ref" href="a051"></a><span class="note" id="n051"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>St. James's Park was radically redeveloped by Charles II after his return to the throne as a public space associated with the court. Here, Fantomina recounts visiting the park to acquire the services of some young men down on their luck and willing to be hired for a variety of services. Edmund Waller, whom Haywood quotes in her epigraph, praised the park as a grand, idealized gathering place for the fashionable elite in <a class="link_ref" href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A97029.0001.001/1:2?rgn=div1;view=fulltext">"ON St. James's PARK As lately improved by his MAJESTY"</a>; however, John Wilmot, second Earl of Rochester, reveals the darker, seamier side of the park in his satire, <a class="link_ref" href="https://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poems/ramble-st-jamess-park">"A Ramble in St. James's Park"</a>.

'Tis hard to say, which of these Parties went away best pleas'd; they, that Fortune had sent them so unexpected a Windfall; or she, that she had found Persons, who appeared so well qualified to serve her. <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e833">[Page 280]</span></p><p>INDEFATIGABLE in the Pursuit of whatsoever her Humour was bent upon, she had no sooner left her new-engag'd Emissaries, than she went in search of a House for the compleating her Project. – She pitch'd on one very large, and magnificently furnished, which she hir'd by the Week<a class="link_ref" href="a055"></a><span class="note" id="n055"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ps4lGG0I9zw/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="" style="float:right; width:300px;" />As Incognita, Fantomina would have rented what <a class="link_ref" href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ecco/004859210.0001.000/1:7?rgn=div1;view=fulltext">John Trusler describes as a "high rented" townhouse in a central location</a>. He goes on to note that "Houses about twenty-one feet in front will let from four guineas a week furnished to eight guineas, according to the season of the year and the time they are engaged for."

Then writing a Letter to Beauplaisir, in a Character vastly different from either of those she had made use of, as Fantomina, or the fair Widow Bloomer, order'd one of them to deliver it into his own Hands, to bring back an Answer, and to be careful that he sifted out nothing of the Truth. – <span class="said">‘I do not fear, (said she,) that you should discover to him who I am, because that is a Secret, of which you yourselves are ignorant; but I would have you be so careful in your Replies, that he may not think the Concealment springs from any other Reasons than your great Integrity to your Trust. – Seem therefore to know my whole Affairs; and let your refusing to make him Partaker in the Secret, appear to be only the Effect of your Zeal for my Interest and Reputation.’</span> Promises of entire Fidelity on the one side, and Reward on the other, being past, the Messenger made what haste he could to the House of Beauplaisir; and being there told where he might find him, perform'd exactly the Injunction that had been given him.

It became a fashionable accoutrement during the eighteenth century, when masquerades were popular, and it was also often worn to the theater. The image included here is a French pastel drawing (c.1750) by Jean-Marc Nattier showing an aristocratic woman with vizard and fan (<a class="link_ref" href="https://neiljeffares.wordpress.com/2018/02/03/nattiers-portraits-of-m-et-mme-royer/">via Neil Jeffares</a>).

Her fine Shape, and Air, and Neck, appear'd to great Advantage; and by that which was to be seen of her, one might believe the rest to be perfectly agreeable. Beauplaisir was prodigiously charm'd, as well with her Appearance, as with the Manner she entertain'd him: But though he was wild with Impatience for the Sight of a Face which belong'd to so exquisite a Body, yet he would not immediately press for it, believing before he left her he should easily obtain that Satisfaction. – A noble Collation being over, he began to sue for the Performance of her Promise of granting every Thing he could ask, excepting the Sight of her Face, and Knowledge of her Name. It would have been a ridiculous Piece of Affection in her to have seem'd coy in complying with what she herself had been the first in desiring: She yielded without even a Shew of Reluctance: And if there be any true Felicity in an Armour such as theirs, both here enjoy'd it to the full. But not in the Height of all their mutual Raptures, could he prevail on her to satisfy his Curiosity with the Sight of her Face: She told him that she hop'd he knew so much of her, as might serve to convince him, she was not unworthy of his tenderest Regard; and if he cou'd not content himself with that which she was willing to reveal, and which was the Conditions of their meeting, dear as he was to her, she would rather part with him for ever, than consent to gratify an Inquisitiveness, which, in her Opinion, had no Business with his Love. It was in vain that he endeavour'd to make her sensible of her Mistake; and that this Restraint was the greatest Enemy imaginable to the Happiness of them both: She was not to be perswaded, and he was oblig'd to desist his Solicitations, though determin'd in his Mind to compass what he so ardently desir'd, before he left the House. He then turned the Discourse wholly on the Violence of <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e928">[Page 285]</span> the Passion he had for her; and express'd the greatest Discontent in the World at the Apprehensions of being separated; – swore he could dwell for ever in her Arms, and with such an undeniable Earnestness pressed to be permitted to tarry with her the whole Night, that had she been less charm'd with his renew'd Eagerness of Desire, she scarce would have had the Power of refusing him; but in granting this Request, she was not without a Thought that he had another Reason for making it besides the Extremity of his Passion, and had it immediately in her Head how to disappoint him.</p><p>THE Hours of Repose being arriv'd, he begg'd she would retire to her Chamber; to which she consented, but oblig'd him to go to Bed first; which he did not much oppose, because he suppos'd she would not lie in her Mask, and doubted not but the Morning's Dawn would bring the wish'd Discovery. – The two imagin'd Servants usher'd him to his new Lodging; where he lay some Moments in all the Perplexity imaginable at the Oddness of this Adventure. But she suffer'd not these Cogitations to be of any long Continuance: She came, but came in the Dark; which being no more than he expected by the former Part of her Proceedings, he said nothing of; but as much Satisfaction as he found in her Embraces, nothing ever long'd for the Approach of Day with more Impatience than he did. At last it came; but how great was his Disappointment, when by the Noises he heard in the Street, the hurry of the Coaches, and the Cries of Penny-Merchants<a class="link_ref" href="a060"></a><span class="note" id="n060"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Penny merchants were street vendors or hawkers; their cries would fill the streets.

He was still in the same Darkness as before; for she had taken care to blind the Windows in such a manner, that not the least Chink was left to let in the Day. – He complain'd of her Behaviour in Terms that she would not have been able to resist yielding to, if she had not been certain it would have been the Ruin of her Passion: – She, therefore, answered him only as she had done before; and getting out of the Bed from him, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e941">[Page 286]</span> flew out of the Room with too much Swiftness for him to have overtaken her, if he had attempted it. The Moment she left him, the two Attendants enter'd the Chamber, and plucking down the Implements which had skreen'd him from the Knowledge of that which he so much desir'd to find out, restored his Eyes once more to Day: – They attended to assist him in Dressing, brought him Tea, and by their Obsequiousness, let him see there was but one Thing which the Mistress of them would not gladly oblige him in. – He was so much out of Humour, however, at the Disappointment of his Curiosity, that he resolv'd never to make a second Visit. – Finding her in an outer Room, he made no Scruples of expressing the Sense he had of the little Trust she reposed in him, and at last plainly told her, he could not submit to receive Obligations from a Lady, who thought him uncapable of keeping a Secret, which she made no Difficulty of letting her Servants into. – He resented, – he once more entreated, – he said all that Man could do, to prevail on her to unfold the Mystery; but all his Adjurations were fruitless; and he went out of the House determin'd never to re-enter it, till she should pay the Price of his Company with the Discovery of her Face and Circumstances. – She suffer'd him to go with this Resolution, and doubted not but he would recede from it, when he reflected on the happy Moments they had pass'd together; but if he did not, she comforted herself with the Design of forming some other Stratagem, with which to impose on him a fourth Time.</p><p>SHE kept the House, and her Gentlemen-Equipage for about a Fortnight, in which Time she continu'd to write to him as Fantomina and the Widow Bloomer, and received the Visits he sometimes made to each; but his Behaviour to both was grown so cold, that she began to grow as weary of receiving his now insipid Caresses as he was of offering them: She was beginning to think in what Manner she <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e946">[Page 287]</span> should drop these two Characters, when the sudden Arrival of her Mother, who had been some Time in a foreign Country, oblig'd her to put an immediate Stop to the Course of her whimsical Adventures. – That Lady, who was severely virtuous, did not approve of many Things she had been told of the Conduct of her Daughter; and though it was not in the Power of any Person in the World to inform her of the Truth of what she had been guilty of, yet she heard enough to make her keep her afterwards in a Restraint, little agreeable to her Humour, and the Liberties to which she had been accustomed.</p><p>BUT this Confinement was not the greatest Part of the Trouble of this now afflicted Lady: She found the Consequences of her amorous Follies would be, without almost a Miracle, impossible to be concealed: – She was with Child; and though she would easily have found Means to have skreen'd even this from the Knowledge of the World, had she been at liberty to have acted with the same unquestionable Authority over herself, as she did before the coming of her Mother, yet now all her Invention was at a Loss for a Stratagem to impose on a Woman of her Penetration: – By eating little, lacing prodigious strait<a class="link_ref" href="a061"></a><span class="note" id="n061"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><img src="https://media.vam.ac.uk/media/thira/collection_images/2006BB/2006BB0967_jpg_l.jpg" alt="" style="float:right; width:300px;" />Lacing here refers to the lacing up of the stays, a shaping undergarment <a class="link_ref" href="http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O115752/stays-unknown/">like the one seen here, from the late eighteenth century, housed in the Victoria and Albert Museum</a>. According to Valerie Steele in <span style="font-style:italic">The Corset: A Cultural History</span>, tightly laced stays <a class="link_ref" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=uk6I0-MDXVQC">were the visible sign of strict morality" (26)</a>.</span>, and the Advantage of a great Hoop-Petticoat<a class="link_ref" href="a062"></a><span class="note" id="n062"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><img src="https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ci/original/CI65.13.1a%E2%80%93c_Fv2.jpg" alt="" style="float:right; width:300px;" />Throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, women's formal fashion was characterized by the exaggerated bell shape created by the hoop petticoat, <a class="link_ref" href="http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1318194/hoop-unknown/">an example of which can be seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum's digital collections</a>. By 1750, the hoop petticoat could be as large as 1.5 meters in diameter, and with the addition of panniers, court dress like that which Fantomina is described as wearing--and which the included image shows--could be notably voluminous.</span>, however, her Bigness was not taken notice of, and, perhaps, she would not have been suspected till the Time of her going into the Country, where her Mother design'd to send her, and from whence she intended to make her escape to some Place where she might be delivered with Secrecy, if the Time of it had not happen'd much Sooner than she expected. – A Ball being at Court, the good Old Lady was willing she should partake of the Diversion of it as a Farewel to the Town. – It was there she was seiz'd with those Pangs, which none in her Condition are exempt from: – She could not conceal the sudden Rack which all at once invaded her; or had her Tongue been mute, her wildly rolling Eyes, the Distortion of her Features, and the Convulsions <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e972">[Page 288]</span>which shook her whole Frame, in spite of her, would have reveal'd she labour'd under some terrible Shock of Nature. – Every Body was surpris'd, every Body was concern'd, but few guessed at the Occasion. – Her Mother griev'd beyond Expression, doubted not but she was struct with the Hand of Death; and order'd her to be carried Home in a Chair, while herself follow'd in another. – A Physician was immediately sent for: But he was presently perceiving what was her Distemper, call'd the old Lady aside, and told her, it was not a Doctor of his Sex, but one of her own<a class="link_ref" href="a063"></a><span class="note" id="n063"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Until the mid to late eighteenth century, childbirth was an almost exclusively female domain. Midwives were women who had experience in both giving birth and attending at other births. During the eighteenth century, midwifery was becoming professionalized and as a result masculinized into obsetetric science. For more information on the shift in the science of childbirth from a feminine tradition to a masculine profession, see <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09699080400200227">Ernelle Fife's "Gender and Professionalism in Eighteenth-Century Midwifery"</a>.</span>, her Daughter stood in need of. – Never was Astonishment and Horror greater than that which seiz'd the Soul of this afflicted Parent at these Words: She could not for a Time believe the Truth of what she heard; but he insisting on it, and conjuring her to send for a Midwife, she was at length convinc'd if it. – All the Pity and Tenderness she had been for some Moment before possess'd of, now vanish'd, and were succeeded by an adequate Shame and Indignation: – She flew to the Bed where her Daughter was lying, and telling her what she had been inform'd of, and which she was now far from doubting, commanded her to reveal the Name of the Person whose Insinuations had drawn her to this Dishonour. – It was a great while before she could be brought to confess any Thing, and much longer before she could be prevailed on to name the Man whom she so fatally had lov'd; but the Rack of Nature growing more fierce, and the enraged old Lady protesting no Help should be afforded her while she persisted in her Obstinacy, she, with great Difficulty and Hesitation in her Speech, at last pronounc'd the Name of Beauplaisir. She had no sooner satisfy'd her weeping Mother, than that sorrowful Lady sent Messengers at the same Time, for a Midwife, and for that Gentleman who had occasion'd the other's being wanted. – He happen'd by Accident to be at home, and immediately obey'd the Summons, though prodigiously <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e982">[Page 289]</span> surpris'd what Business a Lady so much a Stranger to him could have to impart. – But how much greater was his Amazement, when taking him into her Closet<a class="link_ref" href="a063a"></a><span class="note" id="n063a"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><img src="https://english.illinoisstate.edu/digitaldefoe/teaching/bobker/1GreenCloset.png" alt="" style="float:right; width:300px;" />In the eighteenth century, a "closet" was a small office or private room leading off of a bedroom; here, individuals would conduct business, write letters, read, or converse with close acquaintances. It was not used to store clothes. For more information, see <span style="font-style:italic">Daily Life in 18th-Century England</span> (85-86), or <a class="link_ref" href="https://english.illinoisstate.edu/digitaldefoe/teaching/bobker/overview.html">Danielle Bobker's "Literature and Culture of the Closet in the Eighteenth Century,"</a> from which site the accompanying image, showing the Green Closet at Frogmore, has been drawn.</span>, she there acquainted him with her Daughter's Misfortune, of the Discovery she had made, and how far he was concern'd in it? – All the Idea one can form of wild Astonishment, was mean to what he felt: – He assur'd her, that the young Lady her Daughter was a Person who he had never, more than at a Distance, admir'd: – That he had indeed, spoke to her in publick Company, but that he never had a Thought which tended to her Dishonour. – His Denials, if possible, added to the Indignation she was before enflam'd with: – She had no longer Patience; and carrying him into the Chamber, where she was just deliver'd of a fine Girl, cry'd out, <span class="said">‘I will not be impos'd on: The Truth by one of you shall be reveal'd.’</span> —Beauplaisir being brought to the Bed side, was beginning to address himself to the Lady in it, to beg she would clear the Mistake her Mother was involv'd in; when she, covering herself with the Cloaths, and ready to die a second Time with the inward Agitations of her Soul, shriek'd out, <span class="said">‘Oh, I am undone! – I cannot live, and bear this Shame’</span>! – But the old Lady believing that now or never was the Time to dive into the Bottom of this Mystery, forcing her to rear her Head, told her, she should not hope to Escape the Scrutiny of a Parent she had dishonour'd in such a Manner, and pointing to Beauplaisir, <span class="said">‘Is this the Gentleman, (said she,) to whom you owe your Ruin? or have you deceiv'd me by a fictitious Tale?’</span> <span class="said">‘Oh! no, (resum'd the trembling Creature,) he is, indeed, the innocent Cause of my Undoing: – Promise me your Pardon, (continued she,) and I will relate the Means.’</span> Here she ceas'd, expecting what she would reply, which, on hearing Beauplaisir cry <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e1008">[Page 290]</span> out, <span class="said">‘What mean you Madam? I your Undoing, who never harbour'd the least Design on you in my Life,’</span> she did in these Words, <span class="said">‘Though the Injury you have done your Family, (said she,) is of a Nature which cannot justly hope Forgiveness, yet be assur'd, I shall much sooner excuse you when satisfied of the Truth, than while I am kept in a Suspence, if possible, as vexatious as the Crime itself is to me.’</span> Encouraged by this she related the whole Truth. And 'tis difficult to determine, if Beauplaisir, or the Lady, were most surpris'd at what they heard; he, that he should have been blinded so often by her Artifices; or she, that so young a Creature should have the Skill to make use of them. Both sat for some Time in a profound Revery; till at length she broke it first in these Words: <span class="said">‘Pardon, Sir, (said she,) the Trouble I have given you: I must confess it was with a Design to oblige you to repair the supposed Injury you had done this unfortunate Girl, by marrying her, but now I know not what to say; – The Blame is wholly her's, and I have nothing to request further of you, than that you will not divulge the distracted Folly she has been guilty of.’</span> – He answered her in Terms perfectly polite; but made no Offer of that which, perhaps, she expected, though could not, now inform'd of her Daughter's Proceedings, demand. He assured her, however, that if she would commit the new-born Lady to his Care, he would discharge it faithfully. But neither of them would consent to that; and he took his Leave, full of Cogitations, more confus'd than ever he had known in his whole Life. He continued to visit there, to enquire after her Health every Day; but the old Lady perceiving there was nothing likely to ensue from these Civilities, but, perhaps, a Renewing of the Crime, she entreated him to refrain; and as soon as <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e1019">[Page 291]</span> her Daughter was in a Condition, sent her to a Monastery in France, the Abbess of which had been her particular Friend<a class="link_ref" href="a064"></a><span class="note" id="n064"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>The role of the French convent in English literary and cultural imagination is complex. Elite young women might be educated in a convent before their marriage; the convent might also be a house of reformation; for some women, the convent offered an intellectual alternative alternative to marriage in the company of other women. In the English protestant imagination, the French convent was often seen as an erotically-charged place. <a class="link_ref" href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/413815/summary">As Ana Acosta writes in "Hotbeds of Popery: Convents in the English Literary Imagination,"</a> the convent "provided a site for amorous encounters, forced and broken vows, sacrificed youth, and unrequited love" (619). Yet, the convent is also a specifically female community, where women lived, worked, studied, and conversed with other women outside of the male gaze.
