               both Sexes; and whilst those of his <hi rend="italic">own</hi> strove which should
               gain the largest share in his Friendship; the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> vented
               fruitless Wishes, and in secret, curs’d that Custom which forbids Women to make a
               Declaration of their Thoughts. Amongst the Number of these, was Alovisa, a Lady
               descended (by the Father’s Side) from the Noble Family of the D’ La Tours formerly
               Lord of Beujey, and (by her Mothers) from the equally Illustrious House of
               Montmorency. The late Death of her Parents had left her Coheiress (with her Sister,)
               of a vast Estate.</p>
            <p>Alovisa, if her Passion was not greater than the rest, her Pride, and the good
               Opinion she had of her self, made her the less able to support it; she sigh’d, she
               burn’d, she rag’d, when she perceiv’d the Charming D’Elmont behav’d himself toward
               her with no Mark of a distinguishing Affection. What (said she) have I beheld without
               Concern a Thousand Lovers at my Feet, and shall the only Man I ever endeavour’d, or
               wish’d to Charm, regard me with Indifference? Wherefore has the agreeing World join’d
               with my deceitful Glass to flatter me into a vain Belief I had invincible
               Attractions? D’elmont sees ’em not! D’elmont is insensible. Then would she fall into
               Ravings, sometimes cursing her own want of Power, sometimes the Coldness of D’elmont.
               Many Days she pass’d in these Inquietudes, and every time she saw him (which was very
               frequently) either at Court, at Church, or publick Meetings, she found fresh Matter
               for her troubled Thoughts to work upon: When on any Occasion he happen’d to speak to
               her, it was with that Softness in his Eyes, and that engaging tenderness in his
               Voice, as would half persuade her, that, that God had touch’d his Heart,<pb n="3"/> which
               so powerfully had Influenc’d hers; but if a glimmering of such a Hope gave her a
               Pleasure inconceivable, how great were the ensuing Torments, when she observ’d those
               Looks and Accents were but the Effects of his natural Complaisance, and that to
               whomsoever he Address’d, he carried an equality in his Behaviour, which sufficiently
               evinc’d, his Hour was not yet come to feel those Pains he gave; and if the afflicted
               fair Ones found any Consolation, it was in the Reflection, that no Triumphant Rival
               could boast a Conquest, each now despair’d of gaining. But the impatient Alovisa
               disdaining to be rank’d with those, whom her Vanity made her consider as infinitely
               her Inferiors, suffer’d her self to be agitated almost to Madness, between the two
               Extreams of Love and Indignation; a thousand <hi rend="italic">Chimeras</hi> came
               into her Head, and sometimes prompted her to discover the Sentiments she had in his
               Favour: But these Resolutions were rejected, almost as soon as form’d, and she could
               not fix on any for a long time; ’till at last, Love (ingenious in Invention,)
               inspir’d her with one, which probably might let her into the Secrets of his Heart,
               without the Shame of revealing her own.</p>

            <p>This she sent by a trusty Servant, and so disguis’d, that it was impossible for him
               to be known, with a strict Charge to deliver it to the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>’s
               own Hands, and come away before he had read it; the Fellow perform’d her Orders
               exactly, and when the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>, who was not a little surpriz’d at
               the first opening it, ask’d for the Messenger, and commanded he should be stay’d; his
               Gentleman (who then was waiting in his Chamber,) told him he ran down Stairs with all
               the speed imaginable, immediately on his Lordship’s receiving it. D’elmont having
               never experienc’d the Force of Love, could not presently comprehend the Truth of this
               Adventure; at first he imagin’d some of his Companions had caus’d this Letter to be
               wrote, either to sound his Inclinations, or upbraid his little Disposition to
               Gallantry; but these Cogitations soon gave Place to others; and tho’ he was not very
               vain, yet he found it no difficulty to perswade himself to an Opinion, that it was
               possible for a Lady to distinguish him from other Men. Nor did he find any thing so
               unpleasing in that Thought as might make him endeavour to repell it; the more he
               consider’d his own Perfections, the more he was confirm’d in his Belief, but who to
               fix it on, he was at a Loss as much as<pb n="5"/> ever; then he began to reflect on all the
               Discourse, and little Railleries that had pass’d between him and the Ladies whom he
               had convers’d with since his Arrival, but cou’d find nothing in any of ’em of
               Consequence enough to make him guess at the Person: He spent great part of the Night
               in Thoughts very different from those he was accustom’d to, the Joy which naturally
               rises from the Knowledge ’tis in one’s Power to give it, gave him Notions which till
               then he was a Stranger to; he began to consider a Mistress as an agreeable, as well
               as fashionable Amusement, and resolv’d not to be Cruel.</p>
            <p>In the mean time poor Alovisa was in all the Anxiety imaginable, she counted every
               Hour, and thought ’em Ages, and at the first dawn of Day she rose, and calling up her
               Women, who were amaz’d to find her so uneasy, she employ’d ’em in placing her Jewels
               on her Cloaths to the best Advantage, while she consulted her Glass after what Manner
               she should Dress, her Eyes, the gay; the languishing, the sedate, the commanding, the
               beseeching Air, were put on a thousand times, and as often rejected; and she had
               scarce determin’d which to make use of, when her Page brought her Word, some Ladies
               who were going to Court desir’d her to accompany them; she was too impatient not to
               be willing to be one of the first, so went with them immediately, arm’d with all her
               Lightnings, but full of unsettled Reflections. She had not been long in the Drawing
               Room, before it grew very full of Company, but D’elmont not being amongst ’em, she
               had her Eyes fix’d towards the Door, expecting every Moment to see him enter; but how
               impossible is it to represent her Confusion, when he appear’d, leading the young
               Amena, Daughter to Monsieur <hi rend="italic">Sanseverin</hi>, a Gentleman, who tho’
               he had a very small Estate, and many Children, had by a partial Indulgence, too
               common among Parents, neglecting the rest, maintain’d this Darling of his Heart in
               all the Pomp of Quality. The Beauty and Sweetness of this Lady was present-Death<pb n="6"/>
               to Alovisa’s Hope’s; she saw, or fancy’d she saw an usual Joy in her Eyes, and dying
               Love in his; Disdain, Despair, and Jealousie at once crowded into her Heart, and
               swell’d her almost to bursting; and ’twas no wonder that the violence of such
               terrible Emotions kept her from regarding the Discourses of those who stood by her,
               or the Devoirs that D’elmont made as he pass’d by, and at length threw her into a
               Swoon; the Ladies ran to her assistance, and her charming Rival, being one of her
               particular Acquaintance, shew’d an extraordinary assiduity in applying Means for her
               Relief, they made what hast they cou’d to get her into another Room, and unfasten her
               Robe, but were a great while before they could bring her to herself; and when they
               did, the Shame of having been so disorder’d in such an Assembly, and the Fears of
               their suspecting the Occasion, added to her former Agonies, had rack’d her with most
               terrible Revulsions, every one now despairing of her being able to assist at that
               Night’s Entertainment, she was put into her Chair, in order to be carry’d Home; Amena
               who little thought how unwelcome she was grown, would needs have one call’d, and
               accompany’d her thither, in spight of the Intreaties of D’elmont, who had before
               engag’d her for his Partner in Dancing; not that he was in Love with her, or at that
               time believ’d he cou’d be touch’d with a Passion which he esteem’d a Trifle in it
               self, and below the Dignity of a Man of Sense; but Fortune (to whom this Lady no less
               enamour’d than Alovisa) had made a thousand Invocations, seem’d to have allotted her
               the glory of his first Addresses; she was getting out of her Chariot just as he
               alighted from his, and offering her his Hand, he perceiv’d hers trembled, which
               engaging him to look upon her more earnestly than he was wont, he immediately fancy’d
               he saw something of that languishment in her Eyes, which the obliging Mandate had
               describ’d: Amena was too lovely to make that Belief disagreeable, and he resolv’d on
               the Beginnings of an Amour, without giving himself the trouble of considering the
               Consequences;<pb n="7"/> the Evening being extreamly pleasant, he ask’d if she wou’d not
               favour him so far as to take a turn or two within the Palace-Garden; She who desir’d
               nothing more than such a particular Conversation, was not at all backward of
               complying; he talk’d to her there for some time, in a manner as could leave her no
               room to doubt he was entirely Charm’d, and ’twas the Air such an Entertainment had
               left on both their Faces, as produc’d those sad Effects in the jealous Alovisa. She
               was no sooner led to her Apartment, but she desir’d to be put to Bed, and the good
               natur’d Amena, who really had a very great kindness for her, offer’d to quit the
               Diversions of the Ball, and stay with her all Night; but the unfortunate Alovisa was
               not in a Condition to endure the Presence of any, especially her, so put her off as
               civilly as her Anxiety would give her leave, chusing rather to suffer her to return
               to the Ball, than retain so hateful an Object (as she was now become) in her sight;
               and ’tis likely the other was not much troubled at her Refusal. But how, (when left
               alone, and abandon’d to the whirlwinds of her Passion,) the desperate Alovisa
               behav’d, none but those, who like her, have burn’d in hopeless Fires can guess, the
               most lively Description wou’d come far short of what she felt; she rav’d, she tore
               her Hair and Face, and in the extremity of her Anguish was ready to lay violent Hands
               on her own Life. In this Tempest of Mind, she continu’d for some time, till at length
               rage beginning to dissipate it self in Tears, made way for cooler Considerations; and
               her natural Vanity resuming its Empire in her Soul, was of no little Service to her
               on this Occasion. Why am I thus disturb’d? Mean Spirited as I am! Said she, D’elmont
               is ignorant of the Sentiments I am possess’d with in his favour; and perhaps ’tis
               only want of Incouragement that has so long depriv’d me of my Lover; my Letter bore
               no certain Mark by which he might distinguish me, and who knows what Arts that
               Creature might make use of to allure him. I will therefore (persu’d she, with a more
               cheerful Countenance) direct his erring Search.<pb n="8"/> As she was in this Thought
               (happily for her, who else might have relaps’d) her Women who were waiting in the
               next Room, came in to know if she wanted any thing; yes, answer’d she, with a Voice
               and Eyes wholly chang’d, I’ll rise, one of you help me on with my Cloaths, and let
               the other send Charlo to me, I have instant Business with him. ’Twas in vain for ’em
               to represent to her the Prejudice it might be to her Health to get out of her Bed at
               so unseasonable an Hour, it being then just Midnight: They knew her too absolute a
               Mistress not to be obey’d, and executed her Commands, without disputing the Reason.
               She was no sooner ready, than Charlo was introduc’d who being the same Person that
               carry’d the Letter to D’elmont, guess’d what Affair he was to be concern’d in, and
               shut the Door after him. I commend your Caution, said his Lady, for what I am now
               going to trust you with, is of more concernment than my Life. The Fellow bow’d, and
               made a thousand Protestations of an eternal Fidelity. I doubt it not, resum’d she, go
               then immediately to the <hi rend="italic">Court</hi>, ’tis not impossible but in this
               hurry you may get into the Drawing Room; but if not, make some pretence to stay as
               near as you can ’till the Ball be over; listen carefully to all Discourses where you
               hear Count D’elmont mention’d, enquire who he Dances with, and above all, watch what
               Company he comes out with, and bring me an exact Account. Go, continu’d she hastily,
               these are all the Orders I have for you to Night, but to Morrow I shall employ you
               farther. Then turning to her <hi rend="italic">Escritore</hi>, she sat down, and
               began to prepare a second Letter, which she hop’d wou’d be more lucky than the
               former. She was not long writing, Love and Wit, suggested a World of passionate and
               agreeable Expressions to her in a Moment: But when she had finish’d this so full a
               Discovery of her Heart, and was about to sign her Name to it; not all that Passion
               which had inspir’d her with a Resolution to scruple nothing that might advance the
               compassing her Wishes, nor the vanity which assur’d her of Success, were
               forcible<pb n="9"/> enough to withstand the shock it gave her Pride; No, let me rather die!
               Said she, (starting up and frighted at her own Designs) than be guilty of a Meanness
               which wou’d render me unworthy of Life, Oh Heavens! To offer Love, and poorly sue for
               Pity! ’tis insupportable! What bewitch’d me to harbour such a Thought as even the
               vilest of my Sex wou’d blush at? To pieces then (added she, tearing the Paper) with
               this shameful Witness of my Folly, my furious Desires may be the destruction of my
               Peace, but never of my Honour, that shall still attend my Name when Love and Life are
               fled. She continu’d in this Temper (without being able to compose herself to rest)
               till Day began to appear, and Charlo returned with News which confirmed her most
               dreaded Suspicions. He told her that he had gain’d admittance to the Drawing Room
               several Times, under pretence of delivering Messages to some of the Ladies; that the
               whole Talk among ’em was, that D’elmont, was no longer insensible of Beauty; that he
               observ’d that Gentleman in very particular Conference with Amena, and that he waited
               on her Home in his Chariot, her own not being in the way, I know it, said Alovisa
               (walking about in a disorder’d Motion) I did not doubt but that I was undone, and to
               my other Miseries, have that of being aiding to my Rival’s Happiness: Whatever his
               Desires were, he carefully conceal’d ’em, till my cursed Letter prompted a Discovery;
               tenacious as I was, and too, too confident of this little Beauty! Here she stop’d,
               and wiping away some Tears which in spight of her ran down her Cheeks, gave Charlo
               leave to ask if she had any more Commands for him. Yes (answer’d she) I will write
               once more to this undiscerning Man, and let him know, ’tis not Amena that is worthy
               of him; that I may do without prejudicing my Fame, and ’twill be at least some
               Easement to my Mind, to undeceive the Opinion he may have conceiv’d of her Wit, for I
               am almost confident she passes for the Authoress of those Lines which have been so
               fatal to me; in speaking this, without any further<pb n="10"/> Thought, she once more took
               her Pen, and wrote these Words.</p>

               Letters to Amena, she is perfectly acquainted with my Hand, and I shall be the most
               expos’d and wretched Woman in the World. Thus Industrious was she in forming Notions
               to Torment<pb n="11"/> herself; nor indeed was there any thing of Improbability in this
               Conjecture. There are too many ungenerous enough to boast such an Adventure; but
               D’elmont tho’ he would have given good Part of his Estate to satisfy his Curiosity,
               yet chose rather to remain in a perpetual Ignorance, than make use of any Means that
               might be disadvantagious to the Lady’s Reputation. He now perceiv’d his Mistake, and
               that it was not Amena who had taken that Method to engage him, and possibly was not
               disgusted to find she had a Rival of such Merit, as the Letter intimated. However, he
               had said too many fine Things to her to be lost, and thought it as inconsistent with
               his Honour as his Inclination to desist a Pursuit in which he had all the Reason in
               the World to assure himself of Victory; for the young Amena (little vers’d in the Art
               of Dissimulation, so necessary to her Sex) cou’d not conceal the Pleasure she took in
               his Addresses, and without even a seeming reluctancy, had given him a Promise of
               meeting him the next Day in the <hi rend="italic">Tuilleries</hi>; nor could all his
               unknown Mistress had writ, perswade him to miss this Assignation, nor let that be
               succeeded with another, and that by a third, and so on, ’till by making a shew of
               Tenderness; he began to fancy himself really touch’d with a Passion he only design’d
               to represent. ’Tis certain this way of Fooling rais’d Desires in him little different
               from what is commonly call’d Love; and made him redouble his Attacks in such a
               Manner, as Amena stood in need of all her Vertue to resist; but as much as she
               thought her self oblig’d to resent such Attempts, yet he knew so well how to excuse
               himself, and lay the Blame on the Violence of his Passion, that he was still too
               Charming, and too Dear to her not to be forgiven. Thus was Amena (by her too generous
               and open Temper) brought to the very brink of Ruin, and D’elmont was possibly
               contriving Means to compleat it, when her Page brought him this Letter.</p>

            <p>’Twas now that D’elmont began to find there were <hi rend="italic"
                  >Embarrassments</hi> in an Intrigue of this Nature, which he had not foreseen, and
               stay’d at Home all Day, impatiently expecting the clearing of an Affair, which at
               present seem’d so ambiguous. When it grew a little Duskish, his Gentleman brought in
               a Young Woman, whom he immediately knew to be: Anaret, an Attendant on Amena; and
               when he had made her sit down, told her he hop’d she was come to make an <hi
                  rend="italic">Eclaircissment</hi>, which would be very obliging to him, and
               therefore desir’d she wou’d not defer it.</p>
            <p><pb n="13"/></p>
            <p>My Lord, said she, ’tis with an unspeakable Trouble I discharge that Trust my Lady
               has repos’d in me, in giving you a Relation of her Misfortunes; but not to keep you
               longer in suspence, which I perceive is uneasy to you; I shall acquaint you, that
               soon after you were gone, my Lady came up into her Chamber, where, as I was preparing
               to undress her, we heard Monsieur Sanseverin in an angry Tone ask where his Daughter
               was, and being told she was above, we immediately saw him enter, with a Countenance
               so inflam’d, as put us both in a mortal Apprehension. An ill use (said he to her)
               have you made of my Indulgence, and the Liberty I have allow’d you! Could neither the
               Considerations of the Honour of your Family, your own Reputation, nor my eternal
               Repose, deter you from such imprudent Actions, as you cannot be ignorant must be the
               inevitable Ruin of ’em all. My poor Lady was too much surpriz’d at these cruel Words,
               to be able to make any Answer to ’em, and stood trembling, and almost fainting, while
               he went on with his Discourse. Was it consistent with the Niceties of your Sex, said
               he, or with the Duty you owe me, to receive the Addresses of a Person whose
               Pretensions I was a Stranger to? If the Count D’elmont has any that are Honourable,
               wherefore are they conceal’d? The Count D’elmont! (cry’d my Lady more frighted than
               before) never made any Declarations to me worthy of your Knowledge, nor did I ever
               entertain him otherwise, than might become your Daughter. ’Tis false (interrupted he
               furiously) I am but too well inform’d of the contrary; nor has the most private of
               your shameful Meetings escap’d my Ears! Judge, Sir, in what a Confusion my Lady was
               in at this Discourse; ’twas in vain, she muster’d all her Courage to perswade him
               from giving Credit to an Intelligence so injurious to her; he grew the more enrag’d,
               and after a thousand Reproaches, flung out of the Room with all the Marks of a most
               violent Indignation, But tho’ your Lordship is too well acquainted<pb n="14"/> with the
               mildness of Amena’s Disposition, not to believe she could bear the Displeasure of a
               Father (who had always most tenderly lov’d her) with indifference; yet ’tis
               impossible for you to imagine in what an excess of Sorrow she was plung’d, she found
               every Passage of her ill Conduct (as she was pleas’d to call it) was betray’d, and
               did not doubt but whoever had done her that ill Office to her Father, wou’d take care
               the Discovery should not be confin’d to him alone. Grief, Fear, Remorse, and Shame by
               turns assaulted her, and made her incapable of Consolation; even the soft Pleas of
               Love were silenc’d by their Tumultuous Clamours, and for a Time she consider’d your
               Lordship in no other view than that of her Undoer. How! cry’d D’elmont (interrupting
               her) cou’d my Amena, who I thought all sweetness, judge so harshly of me. Oh! my
               Lord, resum’d Anaret, you must forgive those first Emotions, which as violent as they
               were, wanted but your Presence to dissipate in a Moment; and if your Idea had not
               presently that Power, it lost no Honour by having Foes to struggle with, since at
               last it put ’em all to flight, and gain’d so entire a Victory, that before Morning,
               of all her Troubles, scarce any but the Fears of losing you remain’d. And I must take
               the Liberty to assure your Lordship, my Endeavours were not wanting to establish a
               Resolution in her to despise every thing for Love and you. But to be as brief as I
               can in my Relation; the Night was no sooner gone, than Monsieur her Father came into
               the Chamber, with a Countenance, tho’ more compos’d, than that with which he left us,
               yet with such an Air of Austerity, as made my timerous Lady lose most of the Spirit
               she had assum’d for this Encounter. I come not now Amena, said he, to upbraid or
               punish your Disobedience, if you are not wholly abandon’d by your Reason, your own
               Reflections will be sufficiently your Tormentors. But to put you in a way, (if not to
               clear your Fame, yet to take away all Occasion of future Calumny,) you must write to
               Count D’elmont.</p>
            <p><pb n="15"/></p>
            <p>I will have no denials continu’d he, (seeing her about to speak) and leading her to
               her Escritore, constrain’d her to write what he dictated, and you receiv’d; just as
               she was going to Seal it, a Servant brought word that a Gentleman desir’d to speak
               with Monsieur Sanseverin, he was oblig’d to step into another Room, and that absence
               gave her an Opportunity of writing a Note, which she dextrously slip’d into the
               Letter, unperceiv’d by her Father at his return, who little suspecting what she had
               done, sent it away immediately. Now, said he, we shall be able to judge of the
               sincerity of the Count’s Affections, but till then I shall take care to prove my self
               a Person not disinterested in the Honour of my Family. As he spoke these Words, he
               took her by the Hand, and conducting her, thro’ his own, into a little Chamber (which
               he had order’d to be made ready for that purpose) shut her into it; I follow’d to the
               Door, and seconded my Lady in her Desires, that I might be permitted to attend her
               there; but all in vain, he told me, he doubted not but that I had been her Confident
               in this Affair, and ordered me to quit his House in a few Days. As soon as he was
               gone out, I went into the Garden, and saunter’d up and down a good while, hoping to
               get an Opportunity of speaking to my Lady through the Window, for I knew there was
               one that look’d into it; but not seeing her, I bethought me of getting a little
               Stick, with which I knock’d gently against the Glass, and engag’d her to open it. As
               soon as she perceiv’d me, a Beam of Joy brighten’d in her Eyes, and glisten’d tho’
               her Tears. Dear Anaret, said she, how kindly do I take this proof of thy Affection,
               ’tis only in thy Power to alleviate my Misfortunes, and thou I know art come to offer
               thy Assistance. Then after I had assur’d her of my willingness to serve her in any
               command, she desir’d me to wait on you with an Account of all that had happen’d, and
               to give you her Vows of an eternal Love. My Eyes, said she weeping, perhaps may ne’er
               behold him more, but<pb n="16"/> Imagination shall supply that want, and from my Heart he
               never shall be Absent. Oh! do not talk thus, cry’d the Count, extreamly touch’d at
               this Discourse. I must, I will see her, nothing shall hold her from me. You may,
               answer’d Anaret, but then it must be with the Approbation of Monsieur Sanseverin, he
               will be proud to receive you in Quality of a Suitor to his Daughter, and ’tis only to
               oblige you to a publick Declaration that he takes these Measures. D’elmont was not
               perfectly pleas’d with these Words: he was too quick sighted not to perceive
               immediately what Monsieur Sanseverin drove at, but as well as he lik’d Amena, found
               no inclination in himself to Marry her; and therefore was not desirous of an
               Explanation of what he resolv’d not to seem to understand. He walk’d two or three
               turns about the Room, endeavouring to conceal his Disgust, and when he had so well
               overcome the shock, as to banish all visible Tokens of it, I would willingly said he
               coldly, come in to any proper Method for the obtaining the Person of Amena, as well
               as her Heart; but there are certain Reasons for which I cannot make a Discovery of my
               Designs to her Father, ’till I have first spoken with her. My Lord, reply’d the
               subtle Anaret (easily guessing at his Meaning) I wish to Heaven there were a
               possibility of your Meeting; there is nothing I would not risque to forward it, and
               if your Lordship can think of any way in which I may be serviceable to you, in this
               short Time I am allow’d to stay in the Family, I beg you would command me. She spoke
               this with an Air which made the Count believe she really had it in her Power to serve
               him in this Occasion, and presently hit on the surest Means to bind her to his
               Interest. You are very obliging, said he, and I doubt not but your Ingenuity is equal
               to your good Nature, therefore will leave the Contrivance of my happiness entirely to
               you, and that you may not think your Care bestow’d on an ungrateful Person, be
               pleas’d (continu’d he, giving her a Purse of <hi rend="italic">Lewis-Dor</hi>’s) to
               accept this small Earnest<pb n="17"/> of my future Friendship. Anaret, like most of her
               Function, was too mercinary to resist such a Temptation, tho’ it had been given her
               to betray the Honour of her whole Sex; and after a little pause, reply’d, Your
               Lordship is too generous to be refus’d, tho’ in a Matter of the greatest Difficulty,
               as indeed this is; for in the strict Confinement my Lady is, I know no way but one,
               and that extreamly hazardous to her; however, I do not fear but my Perswasions,
               joyn’d with her own Desires, will influence her to attempt it. Your Lordship knows we
               have a little Door at the farther End of the Garden, that opens into the <hi
                  rend="italic">Tuillerys</hi>. I do, cry’d D’elmont interrupting her. I have
               several times parted from my Charmer there, when my Entreaties have prevail’d with
               her to stay longer with me than she wou’d have the Family to take notice of. I hope
               to order the Matter so, resum’d Anaret, that it shall be the Scene this Night of a
               most happy Meeting. My Lady unknown to her Father, has the Key of it, she can throw
               it to me from her Window, and I can open it to you, who must be walking near it,
               about Twelve or One a Clock, for by that time every body will be in Bed. But what
               will that avail, cry’d D’elmont hastily; since she lies in her Father’s Chamber,
               where ’tis impossible to pass Without alarming him. You Lovers are so impatient
               rejoyn’d Anaret smiling, I never design’d you should have Entrance there, tho’ the
               Window is so low, that a Person of your Lordship’s Stature and Agility might mount it
               with a Galliard step, but I suppose it will turn to as good an Account, if your
               Mistress by my Assistance stets out of it. But can she, interrupted he; will she,
               dost thou think? Fear not, my Lord, reply’d she, be but punctual to the Hour, Amena,
               shall be yours, if Love, Wit and Opportunity have power to make her so. D’elmont was
               transported with this Promise, and the Thoughts of what he expected to possess by her
               Means, rais’d his Imagination to so high a pitch, as he cou’d not forbear kissing and
               embracing<pb n="18"/> her with such Raptures, as might not have been very pleasing to Amena,
               had she been witness of ’em. But Anaret who had other things in her Head than
               Gallantry, disengag’d her self from him as soon she cou’d, taking more Satisfaction
               in forwarding an Affair in which she propos’d so much Advantage, than in the Caresses
               of the most accomplish’d Gentleman in the World.</p>
            <p>When she came Home, she found every thing as she cou’d wish, Monsieur Abroad, and his
               Daughter at the Window, impatiently watching her return, she told her as much of the
               Discourse she had with the Count as she thought proper, extolling his Love and
               Constancy, and carefully concealing all she thought might give an umbrage to her
               Vertue. But in spight of all the Artifice she made use of, she found it no easie
               Matter to perswade her to get out of the Window; the fears she had of being
               discover’d, and more expos’d to her Father’s Indignation, and the Censure of the
               World, damp’d her Inclinations, and made her deaf to the eager Solicitations of this
               unfaithful Woman. As they were Disputing, some of the Servants happ’ning to come into
               the Garden, oblig’d ’em to break off; and Anaret retir’d, not totally dispairing of
               compassing her Designs, when the appointed Hour should arrive, and Amena should know
               the darling Object of her Wishes was so near. Nor did her Hopes deceive her, the
               Resolutions of a Lover, when made against the Interest of the Person belov’d, are but
               of a short duration; and this unhappy Fair was no sooner left alone, and had leisure
               to Contemplate on the Graces of the Charming D’elmont, but Love plaid his part with
               such Success, as made her repent she had chid Anaret for her Proposal, and wish’d for
               nothing more than an Opportunity to tell her so. She pass’d several Hours in
               Disquietudes she had never known before, till at last she heard her Father come into
               the next Room to go to Bed, and soon after some Body knock’d<pb n="19"/> softly at the
               Window, she immediately open’d it, and perceiv’d by the Light of the Moon which then
               shone very bright, that it was Anaret, she had not Patience to listen to the long
               Speech the other had prepar’d to perswade her, but putting her Head as far as she
               could, to prevent being heard by her Father. Well Anaret, said she, where is this
               Adventrous Lover, what is it he requires of me? Oh! Madam, reply’d she, overjoy’d at
               the compliable Humour she found her in, he is now at the Garden Door, there’s nothing
               wanting but your Key to give him Entrance; what farther he requests, himself shall
               tell you. Oh Heavens! cry’d Amena, searching her Pockets, and finding she had it not;
               I am undone, I have left it in my Cabinet in the Chamber where I us’d to lie. These
               Words made Anaret at her Wits end, she knew there was no possibility of fetching it,
               there being so many Rooms to go thro’, she ran to the Door, and endeavour’d to push
               back the Lock, but had not Strength; she then knew not what to do, she was sure
               D’elmont was on the other side, and fear’d he would resent this usage to the
               disappointment of all her mercenary Hopes, and durst not call to acquaint him with
               his Misfortune for fear of being heard. As for Amena, she was now more sensible than
               ever of the violence of her Inclinations, by the extream vexation this Disappointment
               gave her: Never did People pass a Night in greater uneasiness, than these three; the
                  <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> who was naturally impatient, could not bear a balk of
               this nature without the utmost chagrin. Amena languish’d, and Anaret fretted to
               Death, tho’ she resolv’d to leave no Stone unturn’d to set all right again. Early in
               the Morning she went to his Lodgings, and found him in a very ill Humour, but she
               easily pacify’d him, by representing with a great deal of real Grief, the Accident
               that retarded his Happiness, and assuring him there was nothing cou’d hinder the
               fulfilling it the next Night. When she had gain’d this Point, she came Home and got
               the Key into her possession, but could not find an opportunity all Day of speaking to
               her Lady,<pb n="20"/> Monsieur Sanseverin did not stir out of Doors, and spent most of it
               with his Daughter; in his Discourse to her, he set the Passion the Count had for her
               in so true a light, that it made a very great alteration in her Sentiments; and she
               began to reflect on the Condescensions she had given a Man, who had never so much as
               mention’d Marriage to her, with so much shame, as almost overwhelm’d her Love, and
               she was now determin’d never to see him, till he should declare himself to her Father
               in such a manner as would be for her Honour.</p>
            <p>In the mean time Anaret waited with a great deal of Impatience for the Family going
               to Bed; and as soon as all was hush, ran to give the Count Admittance; and leaving
               him in an Alley on the farther side of the Garden, made the accustom’d Sign at the
               Window. Amena presently open’d it, but instead of staying to hear what she would say,
               threw a Letter out, Carry that, said she, to Count D’elmont, let him know the
               Contents of it are wholly the result of my own Reason. And as for your part, I charge
               you trouble me no farther on this Subject; then shutting the Casement hastily, left
               Anaret in a strange Consternation at this suddain Change of her Humour; however she
               made no delay, but running to the Place where the Count waited her return, deliver’d
               him the Letter, but advis’d him (who was ready enough of himself) not to obey any
               Commands might be given him to the hindrance of his Designs. The Moon was then at the
               full, and gave so clear a Light, that he easily found it contain’d these Words.</p>

            <p>D’elmont knew the Power he had over her too well, to be much discourag’d at what he
               read, and after a little consultation with Anaret, they concluded he should go to
               speak to her, as being the best Sollicitor in his own Cause. As he came down the
               Walk, Amena saw him thro’ the Glass, and the sight of that beloved Object, bringing a
               thousand past Endearments to her Memory, made her incapable of retiring from the
               Window, and she remain’d in a languishing and immoveable Posture, leaning her Head
               against the Shutter, ’till he drew near enough to discern she saw him. He took this
               for no ill Omen, and instead of falling on his Knees at an humble Distance, as some
               Romantick Lovers would have done, redoubled his Pace, and Love and Fortune which on
               this Occasion were resolv’d to befriend him, presented to his View a large
               Rolling-Stone which the Gardiner had accidentally<pb n="22"/> left there; the Iron-work that
               held it was very high, and strong enough to bear a much greater weight than his, so
               he made no more to do, but getting on the top of it, was almost to the Waste above
               the bottom of the Casement. This was a strange Trial, for had she been less in Love,
               good Manners would have oblig’d her to open it; however she retain’d so much of her
               former Resolution, as to conjure him to be gone, and not expose her to such Hazards;
               that if her Father should come to know she held any clandestine Correspondence with
               him, after the Commands he had given her, she were utterly undone, and that he never
               must expect any Condescensions from her, without being first allow’d by him.
               D’elmont, tho’ he was a little startled to find her so much more Mistress of her
               Temper than he believ’d she could be, yet resolv’d to make all possible use of this
               Opportunity, which probably might be the last he shou’d ever have, look’d on her as
               she spoke, with Eyes so piercing, so sparkling with Desire, accompany’d with so
               bewitching softness, as might have thaw’d the most frozen reservedness, and on the
               melting Soul stamp’d Love’s Impression. ’Tis certain they were too irresistable to be
               long withstood, and putting an end to Amena’s grave Remonstrances, gave him leave to
               reply to ’em in this manner. Why my Life, my Angel, said he, my everlasting Treasure
               of my Soul, shou’d these Objections now be rais’d? How can you say you have given me
               your Heart? Nay, own you think me worthy that inestimable Jewel, yet dare not trust
               your Person with me a few Hours: What have you to fear from your adoring Slave? I
               want but to convince you how much I am so, by a thousand yet uninvented Vows. They
               may be spar’d, cry’d Amena, hastily interrupting him, one Declaration to my Father,
               is all the Proof that he or I demands of your Sincerity. Oh! Thou Inhuman and
               Tyrannick Charmer, answer’d he, (seizing her Hand, and eagerly kissing it) I doubt
               not but your faithful Anaret has told you, that I could not without the highest
               Imprudence, presently discover the Passion I have for you to the World.<pb n="23"/> I have,
               my Lord, said that cunning Wench who stood near him, and that ’twas only to acquaint
               her with the Reasons why, for some Time, you would have it a Secret, that you much
               desir’d to speak with her. Besides (rejoyn’d the Count) consider my Angel how much
               more hazardous it is for you to hold Discourse with me here, than at a farther
               distance from your Father; your denying to go with me is the only way to make your
               Fears prove true; his jealousie of you may possibly make him more watchful than
               ordinary, and we are not sure but that this Minute he may tear you from my Arms;
               whereas if you suffer me to bear you hence, if he should happen to come even to your
               Door, and hear no noise, he will believe you sleeping, and return to his Bed well
               satisfy’d. With these and the like Arguments she was at last overcome, and with the
               assistance of Anaret, he easily lifted her down. But this rash Action, so contrary to
               the Resolution she thought herself a few moments before so fix’d in, made such a
               confusion in her Mind, as render’d her insensible for some Time of all he said to
               her. They made what haste they could into the <hi rend="italic">Tuilleries</hi>, and
               D’elmont having plac’d her on one of the most pleasant Seats, was resolv’d to loose
               no time; and having given her some Reasons for his not addressing to her Father,
               which tho’ weak in themselves, were easily believ’d by a Heart so willing to be
               deceiv’d as hers, he began to press for a greater confirmation of her Affection than
               Words; and ’twas now this inconsiderate Lady found herself in the greatest Strait she
               had ever yet been in; all Nature seem’d to favour his Design, the pleasantness of the
               Place, the silence of the Night, the sweetness of the Air, perfum’d with a thousand
               various Odours, wafted by gentle Breezes from adjacent Gardens, compleated the most
               delightful Scene that ever was, to offer up a Sacrifice to Love; not a breath but
               flew wing’d with desire, and sent soft thrilling Wishes to the Soul; Cynthia herself,
               cold as she is reported, assisted in the Inspiration, and sometimes shone with all
               her brightness, as it were to feast<pb n="24"/> their ravish’d Eyes with gazing on each
               others Beauty; then veil’d her Beams in Clouds, to give the Lover boldness, and hide
               the Virgins blushes. What now could poor Amena do, surrounded with so many Powers,
               attack’d by such a charming Force without, betray’d by tenderness within: Virtue and
               Pride, the Guardians of her Honour, fled from her Breast, and left her to her Foe,
               only a modest Bashfulness remain’d, which for a time made some Defence, but with such
               weakness as a Lover less impatient than D’elmont, would have little regarded. The
               heat of the Weather, and her Confinement having hindred her from dressing that Day;
               she had only a thin silk Night Gown on, which flying open as he caught her in his
               Arms, he found her panting-Heart beat measures of Consent, her heaving Breast swell
               to be press’d by his, and every Pulse confess a wish to yeild; her Spirits all
               dissolv’d, sunk in a Lethargy of Love; her snowy Arms, unknowing, grasp’d his Neck,
               her Lips met his half way, and trembled at the touch; in fine, there was but a Moment
               betwixt her and Ruin; when the tread of some Body coming hastily down the Walk,
               oblig’d the half-bless’d Pair to put a stop to farther Endearments. It was Anaret,
               who having been left Centinel in the Garden, in order to open the Door when her Lady
               should return, had seen Lights in every Room in the House, and heard great Confusion,
               so ran immediately to give ’em notice of this Misfortune. These dreadful Tidings soon
               rous’d Amena from her Dream of Happiness, she accus’d the influence of her Amorous
               Stars, upbraided Anaret, and blam’d the Count in Terms little differing from
               distraction, and ’twas as much as both of ’em could do to perswade her to be calm.
               However, ’twas concluded that Anaret should go back to the House, and return to ’em
               again, as soon as she had learn’d what accident had occasion’d this Disturbance. The
               Lovers had now a second Opportunity, if either of ’em had been inclin’d to make use
               of it, but their Sentiments were entirely chang’d with this Alarm;<pb n="25"/> Amena’s
               Thoughts were wholly taken up with her approaching Shame, and vow’d she wou’d rather
               die than ever come in to her Father’s Presence, if it were true that she was miss’d;
               the Count, who wanted not good Nature, seriously reflecting on the Misfortunes he was
               likely to bring on a young Lady, who tenderly lov’d him, gave him a great deal of
               real Remorse, and the Consideration that he should be necessitated, either to own an
               injurious Design, or come into Measures for the clearing of it, which would in no way
               agree with his Ambition, made him extreamly pensive, and wish Amena again in her
               Chamber, more earnestly than ever he had done, to get her out of it; they both
               remain’d in a profound Silence, impatiently waiting the approach of Anaret; but she
               not coming as they expected, and the Night wearing away apace, very much encreas’d
               the Trouble they were in; at length the Count, after revolving a thousand Inventions
               in his Mind, advis’d to walk toward the Garden, and see whether the Door was yet
               open. ’Tis better for you, Madam, said he, whatsoever has happen’d, to be found in
               your own Garden, than in any Place with me. Amena comply’d, and suffer’d herself to
               be led thither, trembling, and ready to sink with Fear and Grief at every Step; but
               when they found all fast, and that there was no hopes of getting Entrance, she fell
               quite senseless, and without any signs of Life, at her Lover’s Feet; he was strangely
               at a loss what to do with her, and made a thousand Vows if he got clear of this
               Adventure, never to embark in another of this Nature; he was little skill’d in proper
               Means to recover her, and ’twas more to her Youth and the goodness of her
               Constitution that she ow’d the Return of her Senses, than his awkard Endeavours; when
               she reviv’d, the piteous Lamentations she made, and the perplexity he was in how to
               dispose of her, was very near reducing him to as bad a Condition as she had been in;
               he never till now having had occasion for a Confident, render’d him so unhappy as not
               to know any one Person<pb n="26"/> at whose House he cou’d, with any Convenience, trust her,
               and to carry her to that where he had Lodgings, was the way to be made the talk of
               all <hi rend="italic">Paris</hi>. He ask’d her several times if she would not command
               him to wait on her to some Place where she might remain free from Censure, till she
               heard from her Father, but cou’d get no Answer but upbraidings from her. So making a
               Virtue of Necessity, he was oblig’d to take her in his Arms, with a design to bring
               her (tho’ much against his Inclinations) to his own Apartment: As he was going thro’
               a very fair Street which led to that in which he liv’d, Amena cry’d out with a sort
               of Joy, loose me, my Lord, I see a Light in yonder House, the Lady of it is my
               dearest Friend, she has power with my Father, and if I beg her Protection, I doubt
               not but she will afford it me, and perhaps find some way to mitigate my Misfortunes;
               the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> was overjoy’d to be eas’d of his fair Burthen, and
               setting her down at the Gate, was preparing to take his leave with an indifference,
               which was but too visible to the afflicted Lady. I see, my Lord, said she, the
               pleasure you take in getting rid of me, exceeds the trouble for the Ruin you have
               brought upon me; but go, I hope I shall resent this Usage as I ought, and that I may
               be the better enabled to do so, I desire you to return the Letter I writ this fatal
               Night, the Resolution it contain’d will serve to remind me of my shameful Breach of
               it.</p>
            <p>Madam (answer’d he coldly, but with great Complaisance) you have said enough to make
               a Lover less obedient, refuse; but because I am sensible of the Accidents that happen
               to Letters, and to shew that I can never be repugnant even to the most rigorous of
               your Commands, I shall make no scruple in fulfilling this, and trust to your Goodness
               for the re-settling me in your Esteem, when next you make me so happy as to see you.
               The formality of this Compliment touch’d her to the Quick, and the thought of what
               she was<pb n="27"/> like to suffer on his account, fill’d her with so just an Anger, that as
               soon as she got the Letter, she knock’d hastily at the Gate, which being immediately
               open’d, broke off any further Discourse, she went in, and he departed to his Lodging,
               ruminating on every Circumstance of this Affair, and consulting with himself how he
               shou’d proceed. Alovisa (for it was her House which Amena by a whimsical effect of
               Chance had made choice of for her Sanctuary) was no sooner told her Rival was come to
               speak with her, but she fell into all the Raptures that successful Malice could
               inspire, she was already inform’d of part of this Night’s Adventure; for the cunning
               Charlo who by her Orders had been a diligent Spy on Count D’elmont’s Actions, and as
               constant an Attendant on him as his shadow, had watch’d him to Monsieur Sanseverin’s
               Garden, seen him enter, and afterwards come with Amena into the <hi rend="italic"
                  >Tuilleries</hi>; where perceiving ’em Seated, ran Home, and brought his Lady an
               Account; Rage, Jealousie and Envy working their usual Effects in her; at this News,
               made her promise the Fellow infinite Rewards if he would invent some Stratagem to
               separate ’em, which he undertaking to do, occasion’d her being up so late,
               impatiently waiting his return; she went down to receive her with great Civility,
               mix’d with a feign’d surprize to see her at such an Hour, and in such a Dishabilee;
               which the other answering ingeniously, and freely letting her into the whole Secret,
               not only of her Amour, but the coldness she observ’d in D’elmont’s Behaviour at
               parting, fill’d this cruel Woman with so exquisite a Joy, as she was hardly capable
               of dissembling; therefore to get liberty to indulge it, and to learn the rest of the
               particulars of Charlo, who she heard was come in, she told Amena she would have her
               go to Bed, and endeavour to compose her self, and that she would send for Monsieur
               Sanseverin in the Morning, and endeavour to reconcile him to her. I will also added
               she, with a deceitful smile, see the Count D’elmont, and talk to him in a manner as
               shall make him<pb n="28"/> truly sensible of his Happiness; nay, so far my Friendship shall
               extend, that if there be any real Cause for making your Amour a Secret, he shall see
               you at my House, and pass for a Visitor of mine; I have no body to whom I need be
               accountable for my Actions and am above the Censures of the World. Amena, thank’d her
               in Terms full of gratitude, and went with the Maid, whom Alovisa had order’d to
               conduct her to a Chamber prepar’d for her; as soon as she had got rid of her, she
               call’d for Charlo, impatient to hear by what contrivance this lucky Chance had
               befallen her. Madam, said, he, tho’ I form’d a thousand Inventions, I found not any
               so plausible, as to alarm Monsieur Sanseverin’s Family, with an out-cry of Fire.
               Therefore I rang the Bell at the fore-gate of the House, and bellow’d in the most
               terrible accent I could possible turn my Voice to, Fire, Fire, rise, or you will all
               be burnt in your Beds. I had not repeated this many times, before I found the Effect
               I wish’d; the Noises I heard, and the Lights I saw in the Rooms, assur’d me there
               were no Sleepers left; then I ran to the <hi rend="italic">Tuilleries</hi>, designing
               to observe the Lover’s proceedings, but I found they were appriz’d of the Danger they
               were in, of being discover’d, and were coming to endeavour an entrance into the
               Garden. I know the rest, interrupted Alovisa, the Event has answer’d even beyond my
               Wishes, and thy Reward for this good Service shall be greater than thy Expectations.
               As she said these Words she retir’d to her Chamber, more satisfy’d than she had been
               for many Months. Quite different did poor Amena pass the Night, for besides the grief
               of having disoblig’d her Father, banish’d her self his House, and expos’d her
               Reputation to the unavoidable Censures of the unpitying World; for an ungrateful, or
               at best an indifferent Lover. She receiv’d a vast addition of Afflictions, when
               taking out the Letter which D’elmont had given her at parting, possible to weep over
               it; and accuse her self for so inconsiderately breaking the noble Resolution she had
               form’d, when it was writ. She found it was Alovisa’s<pb n="29"/> Hand, for the <hi
                  rend="italic">Count</hi> by mistake had given her the second he receiv’d from that
               Lady, instead of that she desir’d him to return. Never was Surprize, Confusion, and
               Dispair at such a height, as in Amena’s Soul at this Discovery; she was now assur’d
               by what she read, that she had fled for Protection to the very Person she ought most
               to have avoided; that she had made a Confident of her greatest Enemy, a Rival
               dangerous to her Hopes in every Circumstance. She consider’d the High Birth and vast
               Possessions that Alovisa was Mistress of in opposition to her Father’s scanted Power
               of making her a Fortune. Her Wit and Subtilty against her Innocence and Simplicity:
               her Pride, and the respect her grandeur commanded from the World, against her own
               deplor’d and wretch’d State, and look’d upon her self as wholly lost. The violence of
               her Sorrow is more easily imagin’d than express’d; but of all her melancholy
               Reflections, none rack’d her equal to the belief she had that D’elmont was not
               unsensible by this time whom the Letter came from, and had only made a Court to her
               to amuse himself a while, and then suffer her to fall a Sacrifice to his Ambition,
               and feed the Vanity of her Rival; a just Indignation now open’d the Eyes of her
               Understanding, and considering all the Passages of the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>’s
               Behaviour, she saw a thousand Things which told her, his Designs on her were far
               unworthy of the Name of Love. None that were ever touch’d with the least of those
               Passions which agitated the Soul of Amena, can believe they would permit Sleep to
               enter her Eyes: But if Grief and Distraction kept her from repose; Alovisa had too
               much Business on her Hands to enjoy much more; She had promis’d Amena to send for her
               Father, and the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>, and found there were not too many
               Moments before Morning, to contrive so many different forms of Behaviour, as should
               deceive ’em all three, compleat the Ruin of her Rival, and engage the Addresses of
               her Lover; as soon as she thought it a proper Hour, she dispatch’d a Messenger to
               Count D’elmont, and another to Monsieur Sanseverin,<pb n="30"/> who full of Sorrow as he
               was, immediately obey’d her Summons. She receiv’d him in her Dressing-room, and with
               a great deal of feign’d Trouble in her Countenance, accosted him in this manner. How
               hard is it, said she, to dissemble Grief, and in spite of all the Care, which I doubt
               not you have taken to conceal it, in consideration of your own, and Daughter’s
               Honour, I too plainly perceive it in your Face to imagine that my own is hid: How,
               Madam, cry’d the impatient Father, (then giving a loose to his Tears) are you
               acquainted then with my Misfortune? Alas, answer’d she, I fear by the Consequences
               you have been the last to whom it has been reveal’d. I hop’d that my Advice, and the
               daily Proofs the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> gave your Daughter of the little regard
               he had for her, might have fir’d her to a generous Disdain, and have a thousand
               Pardons to ask of you for Breach of Friendship, in concealing an Affair so requisite
               you should have known: Oh! Madam resum’d he, interrupting her, I conjure you make no
               Apologies for what is past, I know too well the greatness of your goodness, and the
               favour you have always been pleas’d to Honour her with; not to be assur’d she was
               happy in your Esteem, and only beg I may no longer be kept in Ignorance of the fatal
               Secret. You shall be inform’d of all, said she, but then you must promise me to Act
               by my Advice; which he having promis’d, she told him after what manner Amena came to
               her House, the coldness the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> express’d to her, and the
               violence of her Passion for him. Now, said she, if you should suffer your rage to
               break out in any publick Manner against the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>, it will
               only serve to make your Daughter’s Dishonour the Table-Talk of all <hi rend="italic"
                  >Paris</hi>. He is too great at Court, and has too many Friends to be compell’d to
               any Terms for your Satisfaction; besides, the least noise might make him discover by
               what means he first became acquainted with her, and her excessive, I will not say
               troublesome fondness of him, since; which should he do, the shame wou’d be wholly
               her’s, for few wou’d condemn him for accepting the offer’d Caresses of a<pb n="31"/> Lady so
               young and beautiful as Amena. But is it possible, cry’d he (quite confounded at these
               Words) that she should stoop so low to offer Love. Oh Heavens! Is this the Effect of
               all my Prayers, my Care, and my Indulgence. Doubt not, resum’d Alovisa, of the Truth
               of what I say, I have it from herself, and to convince you it is so, I shall inform
               you of something I had forgot before. Then she told him of the Note she had slip’d
               into the Letter he had forc’d her to write, and of sending Anaret to his Lodgings,
               which she heighten’d with all the aggravating Circumstances her Wit and Malice cou’d
               suggest; till the old Man believing all she said as an Oracle, was almost senseless
               between Grief and Anger; but the latter growing rather the most predominant, he vow’d
               to punish her in such a manner as should deter all Children from Disobedience. Now,
               said Alovisa, it is, that I expect the performance of your Promise; these threats
               avail but little to the retrieving your Daughter’s Reputation, or your quiet; be
               therefore perswaded to make no Words of it, compose your Countenance as much as
               possible to serenity, and think if you have no Friend in any Monastry where you could
               send her till this Discourse, and her own foolish Folly be blown over. If you have
               not, I can recommend you to one at <hi rend="italic">St.</hi> Dennis where the Abbess
               is my near Relation, and on my Letter will use her with all imaginable Tenderness.
               Monsieur was extreamly pleas’d at this Proposal, and gave her those thanks the
               seeming kindness of her offer deserv’d. I would not, resum’d she, have you take her
               Home, or see her before she goes; or if you do, not till all things are ready for her
               Departure, for I know she will be prodigal of her <hi rend="italic">Promises</hi> of
               Amendment, ’till she has prevail’d with your Fatherly Indulgence to permit her stay
               at <hi rend="italic">Paris</hi>, and know as well she will not have the Power to <hi
                  rend="italic">keep</hi> ’em in the same Town with the <hi rend="italic"
               >Count</hi>. She shall, if you please, remain conceal’d in my House, ’till you have
               provided for her Journey, and it will be a great Means to put a stop to any farther
               Reflections the malicious<pb n="32"/> may make on her; if you give out she is already gone
               to some Relations in the Country. As she was speaking, Charlo came to acquaint her,
               one was come to visit her. She made no doubt but ’twas D’elmont, therefore hasten’d
               away Monsieur Sanseverin, after having fix’d him in a Resolution to do every thing as
               she advis’d. It was indeed Count D’elmont that was come, which as soon as she was
               assur’d of, she threw off her dejected and mournful Air, and assum’d one all Gaiety
               and good Humour, dimpl’d her Mouth with Smiles, and call’d the laughing Cupids to her
               Eyes.</p>
            <p>My Lord, said she, you do well by this early visit to retrieve your Sexes drooping
               fame of Constancy, and prove the nicety of Amena’s discernment, in conferring favours
               on a Person, who to his excellent Qualifications, has that of assiduity to deserve
               them; as he was about to reply, the rush of somebody coming hastily down the Stairs
               which faced the Room they were in, oblig’d ’em to turn that way. It was the
               unfortunate Amena, who not being able to endure the Thoughts of staying in her Rivals
               House, distracted with her Griefs, and not regarding what should become of her, as
               soon as she heard the Doors were open, was preparing to fly from that detested Place.
               Alovisa was vex’d to the Heart at the sight of her, hoping to have had some Discourse
               with the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> before they met; but she dissembled it, and
               catching hold of her as she was endeavouring to pass, ask’d where she was going, and
               what occasion’d the Disorder she observ’d in her. I go, (answer’d Amena) from a false
               Lover, and a falser Friend, but why shou’d I upbraid you (continu’d she looking
               wildly sometimes on the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>, and sometimes on Alovisa)
               Treacherous Pair, you know too well each others Baseness, and my Wrongs; no longer
               then, detain a Wretch whose Presence, had you the least Sense of Honour, Gratitude,
               or even common Humanity, wou’d fill your Consciences with Remorse<pb n="33"/> and Shame; and
               who has now no other wish, than that of shunning you for ever. As she spoke this, she
               struggled to get loose from Alovisa’s Arms, who, in spite of the Amazement she was
               in, still held her. D’elmont was no less confounded, and intirely ignorant of the
               Meaning of what he heard, was at a loss how to reply, ’till she resum’d her
               reproaches in this manner: Why, ye Monsters of barbarity, said she, do you delight in
               beholding the Ruins you have made? Is not the knowledge of my Miseries, my
               everlasting Miseries, sufficient to content you? And must I be debarr’d that only
               Remedy for Woes like mine? Death! Oh cruel Return for all my Love, my Friendship! and
               the confidence I repos’d in you. Oh! to what am I reduc’d by my too soft and easie
               Nature, hard fate of tenderness, which healing others, only wounds it’s
               self.-----Just Heavens!------here she stopp’d, the violence of her Resentment,
               endeavouring to vent it self in sighs, rose in her Breast with such an impetuosity as
               choak’d the Passage of her Words, and she fell in a Swoon. Tho’ the <hi rend="italic"
                  >Count</hi>, and Alovisa were both in the greatest Consternation imaginable, yet
               neither of ’em were negligent in trying to Recover her; as they were busi’d about
               her, that fatal Letter which had been the Cause of this Disturbance, fell out of her
               Bosom, and both being eager to take it up (believing it might make some discovery)
               had their Hands on it at the same time; it was but slightly folded, and immediately
               shew’d ’em from what source Amena’s despair proceeded: Her upbraidings of Alovisa,
               and the Blushes and Confusion which he observed in that Ladies Face, as soon as ever
               she saw it open’d, put an end to the Mistery, and one less quick of Apprehension than
               D’elmont, wou’d have made no difficulty in finding his unknown Admirer in the Person
               of Alovisa: She, to conceal the Disorder she was in at this Adventure as much as
               possible, call’d her Women, and order’d ’em to Convey Amena into another Chamber
               where there was more Air; as she was preparing to follow, turning a<pb n="34"/> little
               towards the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>. but still extreamly confus’d, you’ll
               Pardon, me, my Lord, said she, if my concern for my Friend obliges me to leave you.
               Ah Madam, reply’d he, forbear to make any Apologies to me, rather Summon all your
               goodness to forgive a Wretch so blind to happiness as I have been: She either cou’d
               not, or wou’d not make any answer to these Words, but seeming as tho’ she heard ’em
               not, went hastily into the Room where Amena was, leaving the <hi rend="italic"
                  >Count</hi> full of various and confus’d Reflections; the sweetness of his
               Disposition made him regret his being the Author of Amena’s Misfortunes, but how
               miserable is that Woman’s Condition, who by her Mismanagement is reduc’d to so poor a
               Comfort as the pity of her Lover; that Sex is generally too Gay to continue long
               uneasy, and there was little likelihood he cou’d be capable of lamenting Ills, which
               his small Acquaintance with the Passion from which they sprung, made him not
               comprehend. The pleasure the Discovery gave him of a Secret he had so long desir’d to
               find out, kept him from being too much concern’d at the Adventure that occasion’d it;
               but he could not forbear accusing himself of intollerable Stupidity, when he
               consider’d the Passages of Alovisa’s Behaviour, her swooning at the Ball, her
               constant Glances, her frequent Blushes when he talk’d to her, and all his Cogitations
               whether on Alovisa, or Amena, were mingled with a wonder that Love should have such
               Power. The diversity of his Thoughts wou’d have entertain’d him much longer, if they
               had not been interrupted by his Page, who came in a great hurry, to acquaint him,
               that his Brother, the young Chevalier Brillian was just come to Town, and waited with
               Impatience for his coming Home: As much a Stranger as D’elmont was to the Affairs of
               Love, he was none to those of Friendship, and making no doubt but that the former
               ought to yield to the latter in every respect; contented himself with telling one of
               Alovisa’s Servants, as he went out, that he wou’d wait on<pb n="35"/> her in the Evening,
               and made what hast he cou’d to give his beloved Brother the welcome he expected after
               so long an absence; and indeed the manner of their Meeting, express’d a most intire
               and sincere Affection on both sides. The <hi rend="italic">Chevalier</hi> was but a
               Year younger than the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>, they had been bred together from
               their Infancy, and there was such a sympathy in their Souls, and so great a
               Resemblance in their Persons, as very much contributed to endear ’em to each other
               with a Tenderness far beyond that which is ordinarily found among Relations. After
               the first Testimonies of it were over, D’elmont began to Question him how he had
               pass’d his Time since their Separation, and to give him some little Reproaches for
               not writing so often as he might have Expected. Alas! my dearest Brother, reply’d the
                  <hi rend="italic">Chevalier</hi>, such various Adventures have hap’ned to me since
               we parted, as when I relate ’em, will I hope excuse my seeming Negligence; these
               Words were accompany’d with Sighs, and a Melancholly Air immediately overspreading
               his Face, and taking away great part of the Vivacity, which lately sparkled in his
               Eyes, rais’d an impatient Desire in the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> to know the
               Reason of it, which when he had express’d, the other (after having engag’d him, that
               whatever Causes he might find to ridicule his Folly, he wou’d suspend all appearance
               of it till the end of his Narration) began to satisfy in this Manner.</p>

                  <p>At St. <hi rend="italic">Omers</hi>, where you left me, I happen’d to make an
                     Acquaintance with one Monsieur Belpine, a Gentleman who was there on some
                     Business; we being both pretty much Strangers in the Place, occasion’d an
                     Intimacy between us, which the disparity of our Tempers, wou’d have prevented
                     our Commencing at <hi rend="italic">Paris</hi>; but you know I was never a
                     lover of Solitude, and for want of Company more agreeable, was willing to
                     encourage his. He was indeed so obliging as to stay longer at St. <hi
                        rend="italic">Omers</hi> then his Affairs required, purposely to engage me
                     to make <hi rend="italic">Amiens</hi> in my way to <hi rend="italic"
                     >Paris</hi>. He was very Vain, and fancying himself happy in the esteem of the
                     fair Sex, was desirous I should be witness of the Favours they bestow’d on him.
                     Among the Number of those he used to talk of, was Madamoiselle Ansellina de la
                     Tour, a <hi rend="italic">Parisian</hi> Lady, and Heiress of a great Estate,
                     but had been<pb n="37"/> some time at <hi rend="italic">Amiens</hi> with Madam the
                     Baroness <hi rend="italic">de</hi> Beronville her God-Mother. The Wonders he
                     told me of this young Lady’s Wit, and Beauty, inclin’d me to a desire of seeing
                     her; and as soon as I was in a Condition to Travel, we took our Way towards <hi
                        rend="italic">Amiens</hi>, he us’d me with all the Friendship he was capable
                     of expressing; and soon after we arriv’d, carry’d me to the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Baronesses</hi>: But oh Heavens! How great was my Astonishment when I found
                     Ansellina as far beyond his faint Description, as the Sun Beams the Imitation
                     of Art; besides the regularity of her Features, the delicacy of her Complexion,
                     and the just Simmetry of her whole Composition, she has an undescribable
                     Sweetness that plays about her Eyes and Mouth, and softens all her Air: But all
                     her Charms, dazling as they are, would have lost their captivating Force on me,
                     if I had believ’d her capable of that weakness for Belpine, that his Vanity
                     would have me think. She is very Young and Gay, and I easily perceiv’d she
                     suffer’d his Addresses more out of Diversion then any real Regard she had for
                     him; he held a constant Correspondence at <hi rend="italic">Paris</hi>, and was
                     continually furnish’d with every thing that was <hi rend="italic">Novel</hi>,
                     and by that means introduc’d himself into many Companies, who else wou’d not
                     have endured him; but when at any time I was so happy as to entertain the
                     lovely Ansellina alone, and we had Opportunity for serious Discourse, (which
                     was impossible in his Company) I found that she was Mistress of a Wit, Poynant
                     enough to be Satyrical, yet it was accompanied with a Discretion as very much
                     heighten’d her Charms, and compleated the Conquest that her Eyes begun. I will
                     confess to you, Brother, that I became so devoted to my Passion, that I had no
                     leisure for any other Sentiments. Fears, Hopes, Anxities, jealous Pains,
                     uneasie Pleasures, all the Artillery of Love, were garrison’d in my Heart, and
                     a thousand various half form’d Resolutions fill’d my Head. Ansellina’s
                     insensibility among a Crow’d of Admirers, and the disparity of our
                     Fortunes,<pb n="38"/> wou’d have given me just Causes of Despair, if the Generosity of
                     her Temper had not dissipated the one, and her Youth, and the hope her Hour was
                     not yet come, the other. I was often about letting her know the Power she had
                     over me, but something of an awe which none but those who truly Love can guess
                     at, still prevented my being able to utter it, and I believ’d should have
                     languish’d ’till this Moment in an unavailing silence, if an accident had not
                     hapen’d to embolden me: I went one Day to visit my Adorable, and being told she
                     was in the Garden, went thither in hopes to see her, but being deceiv’d in my
                     Expectation, believ’d the Servant who gave me that Information was mistaken,
                     and fancying she might be retir’d to her Closet, as she very often did in an
                     Afternoon, and the pleasantness of the Place inducing me to stay there till she
                     was willing to admit me. I sat down at the Foot of a DIANA, curiously carv’d in
                     Marble, and full of melancholy Reflections without knowing what I did, took a
                     black lead Pen out of my Pocket, and writ on the Pedestal these two Lines.</p>

                  <p>I had scarce finish’d ’em, when I perceiv’d Ansellina at a good distance from
                     me, coming out of a little Arbour; the respect I had for her, made me fear she
                     should know I was the Author of ’em, and guess, what I found, I had not gain’d
                     Courage enough to tell her. I went out of the Alley, as I imagin’d, unseen, and
                     design’d to come up another, and meet her, before she cou’d get into the House.

                  <p>But, my dear Brother, if you are yet insensible of the wonderful Effects of
                     Love, you will not be able to imagine what I felt at this View; I was satisfy’d
                     it could be writ by no Body but Ansellina, there being no other Person in the
                     Garden, and knew as well she could not design that Encouragement for any other
                     Man, because on many Occasions she had seen my Hand; and the Day before had
                     written a Song for her, which she desir’d to learn, with that very Pen I now
                     had made use of; and going hastily away at the sight of her, had forgot to take
                     with me. I gaz’d upon the dear obliging Characters, and kiss’d the Marble which
                     contain’d ’em, a thousand times before I cou’d find in my Heart to efface ’em;
                     as I was in this agreeable Amazement, I heard Belpine’s Voice calling to me as
                     he came up the walk, which oblig’d me to put an end to it, and the Object which
                     occasion’d it. He had been told as well as I, that Ansellina was in the Garden,
                     and expressing some wonder to see me alone, ask’d where she was, I answer’d him
                     with a great deal of real Truth, that I knew not, and that I had been there
                     some Time, but had not been so happy as to Entertain her. He seem’d not to give
                     Credit to what I said, and began to use me after a Fashion as would have much
                     more astonish’d me from any other Person. I would not have you, said he, be
                     concern’d at what I am about to say, because you are one of those for whom I am
                     willing to preserve a Friendship; and to convince you of my Sincerity, give you
                     leave to address after what manner you please to any of the Ladies with whom I
                     have brought you acquainted, excepting Ansellina. But I take this Opportunity
                     to let you know, I have already made choice of her, with a design of Marriage,
                     and from this time forward, shall look on any Visits you shall make to her, as
                     injurious to my Pretensions. Tho’ I was no Stranger to the Vanity and Insolence
                     of Belpine’s Humour, yet not being accustomed to such arbitrary Kind of
                     Treatment, had<pb n="40"/> certainly resented it (if we had been in any other Place)
                     in a very different Manner than I did, but the consideration that to make a
                     Noise there, would be a Reflection, rather than a Vindication on Ansellina’s
                     Fame; I contented myself with telling him he might be perfectly easie, that
                     whatever Qualifications the Lady might have that should encourage his
                     Addresses, I should never give her any Reason to boast a Conquest over me.
                     These Words might have born two Interpretations, if the disdainful Air with
                     which I spoke ’em, and which I could not dissemble, and going immediately away
                     had not made him take ’em, as they were really design’d, to affront him; He was
                     full of Indignation and Jealousy (if it is possible for a Person to be touch’d
                     with that Passion, who is not capable of the other, which generally occasions
                     it) but however, having taken it into his Head to imagine I was better receiv’d
                     by Ansellina than he desired; Envy, and a sort of a Womanish Spleen transported
                     him so far as to go to Ansellina’s Apartment, and rail at me most profusely (as
                     I have since been told) and threaten how much he’d be reveng’d, if he heard I
                     ever should have the assurance to Visit there again. Ansellina at first laugh’d
                     at his Folly, but finding he persisted, and began to assume more Liberty than
                     she ever meant to afford him; instead of list’ning to his Entreaties, to forbid
                     me the Privilege I had enjoy’d of her Conversation; she pass’d that very
                     Sentence on him, and when next I waited of her, receiv’d me with more Respect
                     than ever; and when at last I took the boldness to acquaint her with my
                     Passion; I had the Satisfaction to observe from the frankness of her
                     Disposition, that I was not indifferent to her; nor indeed did she, even in
                     Publick, affect any reservedness more than the decencies of her Sex and Quality
                     requir’d; for after my Pretensions to her were commonly talk’d of, and those
                     who were intimate with her, wou’d rally her about me; she pass’d it off with a
                     Spirit of Gaity and good Humour peculiar to her self, and bated nothing of her
                     usual freedom to me; she permitted me to Read to<pb n="41"/> her, to Walk and Dance
                     with her, and I had all the Opportunities of endeavouring an encrease of her
                     Esteem that I cou’d wish, which so incens’d Belpine, that he made no scruple of
                     reviling both her and me in all Companies wherever he came; saying, I was a
                     little worthless Fellow, who had nothing but my Sword to depend upon; and that
                     Ansellina having no hopes of Marrying him, was glad to take up with the first
                     that ask’d her. These scandalous Reports on my first hearing of ’em had
                     assuredly been fatal to one of us, if Ansellina had not commanded me by all the
                     Passion I profess’d, and by the Friendship she freely acknowledged to have for
                     me, not to take any Notice of ’em. I set too high a Value on the favours she
                     allow’d me, to be capable of Disobedience; and she was too nice a Judge of the
                     Punctillio’s of our Sexes Honour, not to take this Sacrifice of so just a
                     Resentment, as a very great proof how much I submitted to her will, and
                     suffer’d not a Day to pass without giving me some new mark how nearly she was
                     touch’d with it. I was the most contented and happy Person in the World, still
                     hoping that in a little time, (she having no Relations that had Power to
                     contradict her Inclinations) I should be able to obtain every thing from her
                     that an honourable Passion could require; ’till one Evening coming Home pretty
                     late from her, my Servant gave me a Letter, which he told me was left for me,
                     by one of Belpine’s Servants; I presently suspected the Contents, and found I
                     was not mistaken; it was really a Challenge to meet him the next Morning, and
                     must confess, tho’ I long’d for an Opportunity to Chastise his Insolence, was a
                     little troubled how to excuse my self to Ansellina but there was no possibility
                     of evading it, without rendering my self unworthy of her, and hop’d that
                     Circumstance wou’d be sufficient to clear me to her. I will not trouble you,
                     Brother, with the particulars of our Duel, since there was nothing material,
                     but that at the third pass (I know not whether I may call it the effect of my
                     good or evil Fortune) he receiv’d my Sword a good depth<pb n="42"/> in his Body, and
                     fell with all the Symptoms of a Dying-Man. I made all possible hast to send a
                     Surgeon to him. In my way I met two Gentlemen, who it seems he had made
                     acquainted with his Design (probably with an intention to be prevented). They
                     ask’d me what Success, and when I had inform’d ’em, advis’d me to be gone from
                        <hi rend="italic">Amiens</hi> before the News should reach the Ears of
                     Belpine’s Relations, who were not inconsiderable in that Place. I made ’em
                     those Retributions their Civilities deserv’d; but how eminent soever the Danger
                     appear’d that threatned me, cou’d not think of leaving <hi rend="italic"
                        >Amiens</hi>, without having first seen Ansellina. I went to the <hi
                        rend="italic">Baronesses</hi>, and found my Charmer at her Toylet, and
                     either it was my Fancy, or else she really did look more amiable in that
                     Undress, than ever I had seen her, tho’ adorn’d with the utmost Illustrations.
                     She seem’d surpriz’d at seeing me so early, and with her wonted good Humour,
                     asking me the reason of it, put me into a mortal Agony how to answer her, for I
                     must assure you, Brother, that the fears of her Displeasure were a thousand
                     times more dreadful to me, than any other apprehensions; she repeated the
                     Question three or four times before I had Courage to Reply, and I believe she
                     was pretty near guessing the Truth by my Silence, and the disorder in my
                     Countenance before I spoke; and when I did, she receiv’d the account of the
                     whole Adventure with a vast deal of trouble, but no anger; she knew too well,
                     what I ow’d to my Reputation, and the Post his Majesty had honour’d me with, to
                     believe, I cou’d, or ought to dispence with submitting to the Reflections which
                     must have fallen on me, had I acted otherwise than I did. Her Concern and
                     Tears, which she had not Power to contain at the thoughts of my Departure,
                     joyn’d with her earnest Conjurations to me to be gone, let me more than ever
                     into the Secrets of her Heart, and gave me a Pleasure as inconceivable as the
                     necessity of parting did the contrary. Nothing cou’d be more moving than our
                     taking leave, and when she tore her self half willing, and half unwilling,
                     from<pb n="43"/> my Arms, had sent me away inconsolable, if her Promises of coming to
                        <hi rend="italic">Paris</hi>, as soon as she could, without being taken
                     notice of, and frequently writing to me in the mean time, had not given me a
                     Hope, tho’ a distant one, of Happiness. Thus Brother, have I given you, in as
                     few Words as I cou’d, a Recital of every thing that has happen’d to me of
                     Consequence since our Separation, in which I dare believe you will find more to
                     Pity than Condemn. The afflicted Chevalier cou’d not conclude without letting
                     fall some Tears; which the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> perceiving, ran to him,
                     and tenderly embracing him, said all that cou’d be expected from a most
                     affectionate Friend to mitigate his Sorrows, nor suffered him to remove from
                     his Arms ’till he had accomplish’d his Design; and then believing the hearing
                     of the Adventures of another, (especially one he was so deeply interested in)
                     would be the surest Means to give a Truce to the more melancholy Reflections on
                     his own; related every thing that had befallen him since his coming to <hi
                        rend="italic">Paris</hi>. The Letters he receiv’d from a Lady <hi
                        rend="italic">Incognito</hi>, his little Gallantries with Amena, and the
                     accident that presented to his View, the unknown Lady in the Person of one of
                     the greatest Fortunes in all <hi rend="italic">France</hi>. Nothing cou’d be a
                     greater Cordial to the Chevalier, than to find his Brother was belov’d by the
                     Sister of Ansellina; he did not doubt but that by this there might be a
                     possibility of seeing her sooner than else he cou’d have hop’d, and the two
                     Brothers began to enter into a serious consultation of this Affair, which ended
                     with a Resolution to fix their Fortunes there. The <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>
                     had never yet seen a Beauty formidable enough to give him an Hours uneasiness
                     (purely for the sake of Love) and would often say, <hi rend="italic"
                     >Cupid</hi>’s Quiver never held an Arrow of force to reach his Heart; those
                     little Delicacies, those trembling aking Transports, which every sight of the
                     belov’d Object occasions, and so visibly distinguishes a real Passion from a
                     Counterfeit, he look’d on as the Chimera’s of an idle Brain, form’d to inspire
                     Notions of an imaginary Bliss, and make Fools<pb n="44"/> lose themselves in seeking;
                     or if they had a Being; it was only in weak Souls, a kind of a Disease with
                     which he assur’d himself he should never be infected. Ambition was certainly
                     the reigning Passion in his Soul, and Alovisa’s Quality and vast Possessions,
                     promising a full Gratification of that, he ne’er so much as wish’d to know a
                     farther Happiness in Marriage.</p>
                  <p>But while the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Chevalier</hi>
                     were thus Employ’d, the Rival Ladies past their Hours in a very different
                     Entertainment, the despair and bitter Lamentations that the unfortunate Amena
                     made, when she came out of her swooning, were such as mov’d even Alovisa to
                     Compassion, and if any thing but resigning D’elmont cou’d have given her
                     Consolation, she wou’d willing have apply’d it. There was now no need of
                     further Dissimulation, and she confessed to Amena, that she had Lov’d the
                     Charming <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> with a kind of Madness from the first
                     Moment she beheld him: That to favour her Designs on him, she had made use of
                     every Stratagem she cou’d invent, that by her means, the Amour was first
                     discover’d to <hi rend="italic">Monsieur</hi> Sanseverin, and his Family
                     Alarm’d the Night before; and Lastly, that by her Persuasions, he had resolv’d
                     to send her to a Monastry, to which she must prepare her self to go in a few
                     Days without taking any leave even of her Father; have you (cry’d Amena hastily
                     interrupting her) have you prevail’d with my Father to send me from this hated
                     Place without the Punishment of hearing his upbraidings? Which the other
                     answering in the Affirmative, I thank you, resum’d Amena, that Favour has
                     cancell’d all your Score of Cruelty, for after the Follies I have been guilty
                     of, nothing is so dreadful as the Sight of him. And, who wou’d, oh Heavens!
                     (continued she bursting into a Flood of Tears) wish to stay in a World so full
                     of Falshood. She was able to utter no more for some Moments, but at last,
                     raising herself on the Bed where she was laid, and endeavouring to seem a
                     little more compos’d: I have two Favours, Madam, yet to ask of you (rejoin’d
                     she) neither of<pb n="45"/> ’em will, I believe, seem difficult to you to grant, that
                     you will make use of the Power you have with my Father, to let my Departure be
                     as sudden as possible, and that while I am here, I may never see Count
                     D’elmont. It was not likely that Alovisa shou’d deny Requests so suitable to
                     her own Inclinations, and believing, with a great deal of Reason, that her
                     Presence was not very grateful, left her to the Care of her Women, whom she
                     order’d to attend her with the same Diligence as herself. It was Evening before
                     the Count came, and Alovisa spent the remainder of the Day in very uneasie
                     Reflections; she knew not, as yet, whether she had Cause to rejoyce in, or
                     blame her Fortune in so unexpectedly discovering her Passion, and an incessant
                     vicissitude of Hope and Fears, rack’d her with most intollerable Inquietude,
                     till the darling Object of her Wishes appear’d; and tho’ the first sight of
                     him, added to her other Passions, that of Shame, yet he manag’d his Address so
                     well, and so modestly and artfully hinted the Knowledge of his Happiness, that
                     every Sentiment gave place to a new Admiration of the Wonders of his Wit; and
                     if before she lov’d, she now ador’d, and began to think it a kind of Merit in
                     herself, to be sensible of his. He soon put it in her Power to oblige him, by
                     giving her the History of his Brother’s Passion for her Sister, and she was not
                     at all backward in assuring him how much she approv’d of it, and that she wou’d
                     write to Ansellina by the first Post, to engage her coming to <hi rend="italic"
                        >Paris</hi> with all imaginable Speed. In fine, there was nothing He cou’d
                     ask, refus’d, and indeed it would have been ridiculous for her to have affected
                     Coyness, after the Testimonies she had long since given him of one of the most
                     violent Passions that ever was; this fore-Knowledge sav’d abundance of
                     Dissimulation on both Sides, and she took care that if he should be wanting in
                     his kind Expressions after Marriage, he should not have it in his Power to
                     pretend (as some Husbands have done) that his Stock was exhausted in a tedious
                     Courtship. Everything was presently<pb n="46"/> agreed upon, and the Wedding Day
                     appointed, which was to be as soon as every thing cou’d be got ready to make it
                     Magnificent; tho’ the <hi rend="italic">Count’s</hi> good Nature made him
                     desirous to learn something of Amena, yet he durst not enquire, for fear of
                     giving an Umbrage to his intended Bride; but she, imagining the Reason of his
                     Silence, very frankly told him, how she was to be dispos’d of, this Knowledge
                     made no small Addition to his Contentment, for had she stay’d in <hi
                        rend="italic">Paris</hi>, he could expect nothing but continual Jealousies
                     from Alovisa; besides, as he really wish’d her happy, tho’ he could not make
                     her so, he thought Absence might banish a hopeless Passion from her Heart, and
                     Time and other Objects efface an Idea, which could not but be destructive to
                     her Peace. He stay’d at Alovisa’s House ’till it was pretty late, and perhaps
                     they had not parted in some Hours longer, if his impatience to inform his
                     Brother his Success, had not carried him away. The young <hi rend="italic"
                        >Chevalier</hi> was infinitely more transported at the bare Hopes of being
                     something nearer the Aim of all his Hopes, than D’elmont was at the Assurance
                     of losing his in Possession, and could not forbear rallying him for placing the
                     ultimate of his Wishes on such a Toy, as he argu’d Woman was, which the <hi
                        rend="italic">Chevalier</hi> endeavouring to confute, there began a very
                     warm Dispute, in which, neither of ’em being able to convince the other, Sleep
                     at last interpos’d as Moderator. The next Day they went together to visit
                     Alovisa, and from that time were seldom asunder: But in Compassion to Amena,
                     they took what Care they could to conceal the Design they had in Hand, and that
                     unhappy Lady was in a few Days, according to her Rival’s Contrivance, hurried
                     away, without seeing any of her Friends. When she was gone, and there was no
                     farther need of keeping it a Secret, the News of this great Wedding was
                     immediately spread over the whole Town, and every one talk’d of it as their
                     particular Interests or Affections dictated. All D’elmont’s Friends were<pb n="47"/>
                     full of Joy, and he met no inconsiderable Augmentation of it himself, when his
                     Brother receiv’d a Letter from Ansellina, with an Account, that Belpine’s Wound
                     was found not Dangerous, and that he was in a very fair way of Recovery. And it
                     was concluded, that as soon as the Wedding was over, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Chevalier</hi> should go in Person to Amiens, and fetch his belov’d
                     Ansellina, in order for a Second, and as much desir’d Nuptial. There was no
                     Gloom now left to Cloud the Gaiety of the happy Day, nothing could be more
                     Grand than the Celebration of it, and Alovisa now thought her self at the end
                     of all her Cares; but the Sequel of this glorious Beginning, and what Effect
                     the Despair and Imprecations of Amena (when she heard of it) produc’d, shall,
                     with the continuance of the <hi rend="italic">Chevalier</hi> Brillian’s

            <p>The Contentment that appear’d in the Faces of the new Married Pair, added so much to
               the Impatience of the <hi rend="italic">Chevalier</hi> >Brillian to see his belov’d

               for <hi rend="italic">Amiens</hi>: But as human Happiness is seldom of long

               Possession of her Charming Husband, secure of that, despis’d all future Events, ’twas
               time for <hi rend="italic">Fortune</hi>, who long enough had smil’d, now to turn her
               Wheel, and punish the presumption that defy’d her Power.</p>
            <p><pb n="52"/></p>
            <p>As they were one Day at Dinner, a Messenger came to Acquaint <hi rend="italic"
                  >Count</hi>D’elmont that <hi rend="italic">Monsieur</hi>Frankville was taken,
               suddenly, so violently Ill, that his Physicians despair’d of his Life; and that he
               beg’d to speak with him immediately: This Gentleman had been Guardian to theCount
               during his Minority, and the Care and Faithfulness with which that Trust had been
               Discharg’d, made him, with Reason, to regret the danger of losing so good a Friend:
               He delay’d the Visit not a Moment, and found him as the Servant had told him, in a
               Condition which cou’d cherish no hopes of Recovery, as soon as he perceiv’d theCount
               come into the Chamber, he desir’d to be left alone with him, which Order being
               presently obey’d, My dear Charge, (said he taking him by the Hand, and pressing to
               his trembling Bosom) you see me at the point of Death, but the knowledge of your many
               Virtues, and the Confidence I have that you will not deny me the request I am about
               to ask, makes me support the Thoughts of it with Moderation. The other assuring him
               of his readiness to serve him in any Command, encourag’d the old Gentleman to
               prosecute his Discourse in this manner: You are not Ignorant, my Lord (Rejoin’d He)
               that my Son (the only one have) is on his Travels, gone by my Approbation, and his
               own Desires to make the Tour of <hi rend="italic">Europe</hi>; but I have a Daughter,
               whose Protection I wou’d entreat you to undertake; her Education in a Monastery has
               hitherto kept her intirely unacquainted with the Gayeties of a Court, or the
               Conversation of the <hi rend="italic">Beau Monde</hi>, and I have sent for her to <hi
                  rend="italic">Paris</hi> purposely to Introduce her into Company, proper for a
               young Lady, who I never design’d for a Recluse; I know not whether she will be here
               time enough to close my Eyes, but if you will promise to receive her into your House,
               and not suffer her artless and unexperienc’d Youth to fall into those Snares which
               are daily laid for Innocence, and take so far a Care, that neither she, nor the
               Fortune I leave her, be thrown away upon a Man unworthy of her, I shall dye well
               satisfy’d.D’elmont answer’d this<pb n="53"/> Request, with repeated assurances of fulfilling
               it, and frankly offer’d, if he had no other Person in whom he rather wou’d confide,
               to take the management of the whole Estate he left behind him, till youngFrankville
               should return----The anxious Father was transported at this Favour, and thank’d him
               in Terms full of Gratitude and Affection; they spent some Hours in settling this
               Affair, and perhaps had not ended it so soon, if Word had not been brought that the
               young Lady his Daughter was alighted at the Gate; ’tis impossible to express the Joy
               which fill’d the old Gentleman’s Heart at this News, and he began afresh to put
               theCount in mind of what he had promis’d concerning her: As they were in this
               endearing, tho’ mournful Entertainment, the matchless Melliora enter’d, the Surprize
               and Grief for her Father’s Indisposition (having heard of it but since she came into
               the House) hindered her from regarding any thing but him, and throwing herself on her
               Knees by the Bed-side, wash’d the Hand which he stretch’d out to raise her with, in a
               flood of Tears, accompany’d with Expressions, which, unstudy’d and incoherent as they
               were, had a delicacy in ’em, that show’d her Wit not inferiour to her Tenderness; and
               that no Circumstance cou’d render her otherwise than the most lovely Person in the
               World; when the first transports of her Sorrow were over, and that with much ado she
               was persuaded to rise from the Posture she was in: The Affliction I see thee in my
               Dear Child, (said her Father) wou’d be a vast addition to the Agonies I feel, were I
               not so happy as to be provided with Means for a mitigation of it, think not in losing
               me thou wilt be left wholly an Orphan, this worthy Lord will dry thy Tears.
               Therefore, my last Commands to thee shall be, to oblige thee to endeavour to deserve
               the Favours he is pleas’d to do us in accepting thee for---He wou’d have proceeded,
               but his Physicians (who had been in Consultation in the next Room) coming in
               prevented him, and <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> D’elmont taking the charming Melliora
               by the Hand, led her to the Window,<pb n="54"/> and beginning to speak some Words of
               Consolation to her, the softness of his Voice, and graceful Manner with which he
               deliver’d himself (always the inseparable Companions of his Discourse, but now more
               particularly so) made her cast her Eyes upon him; but alas, he was not an Object to
               be safely gaz’d at, and in spight of the Grief she was in, she found something in his
               Form which dissipated it; a kind of painful Pleasure, a mixture of Surprize, and Joy,
               and doubt, ran thro’ her in an instant; her Fathers Words suggested to her
               Imagination, that she was in a possibility of calling the charming Person that stood
               before her, by a Name more tender than that of Guardian, and all the Actions, Looks,
               and Address of D’elmont serv’d but to confirm her in that Belief. For now it was, that
               this insensible began to feel the Power of Beauty, and that Heart which had so long
               been Impregnable, surrender’d in a Moment; the first sight of Melliora gave him a
               Discomposure he had never felt before, he Sympathiz’d in all her Sorrows, and was
               ready to joyn his Tears with hers, but when her Eyes met his, the God of Love seem’d
               there to have united all his Lightnings for one effectual Blaze, their Admiration of
               each others Perfections was mutual, and tho’ he had got the start in Love, as being
               touch’d with that Almighty Dart, before her Affliction had given her leave to regard
               him, yet the softness of her Soul made up for that little loss of time, and it was
               hard to say whose Passion was the Strongest; she listned to his Condolements, and
               assurances of everlasting Friendship, with a pleasure which was but too visible in
               her Countenance, and more enflam’d theCount. As they were exchanging Glances, as if
               each vyed with the other who should dart the fiercest Rays, they heard a sort of
               ominous Whispering about the Bed, and presently one of those who stood near it,
               beckon’d them to come thither; the Physicians had found <hi rend="italic"
                  >Monsieur</hi>Frankville in a much worse Condition than they left him in, and soon
               after perceiv’d evident Symptoms in him of approaching Death, and indeed there were
               but a very few Moments<pb n="55"/> between him and that other unfathomable World; the use of
               Speech had left him, and he cou’d take no other leave of his dear Daughter than with
               his Eyes; which sometimes were cast tenderly on her, sometimes on theCount, with a
               beseeching Look, as it were, to Conjure him to be careful of his Charge; then up to
               Heaven, as witness of the Trust he reposed in him. There cou’d not be a Scene more
               Melancholly than this dumb Farewell, and Melliora, whose soft Disposition had never
               before been shock’d, had not Courage to support so dreadful a one as this, but fell
               upon the Bed just as her Father Breath’d his last, as motionless as he. It is
               impossible to represent the Agony’s which fill’d the Heart of D’elmont at this View,
               he took her in his Arms, and assisted those who were endeavouring to recover her,
               with a wildness in his Countenance, a trembling Horror shaking all his Fabrick in
               such a manner, as might have easily discover’d to the Spectators (if they had not
               been too busily employ’d to take notice of it) that he was Actuated by a Motive far
               more powerful than that of Compassion. As soon as she came to herself, they forc’d
               her from the Dead Body of her Father (to which she Clung) and carried her into
               another Room, and it being judg’d convenient that she should be remov’d from that
               House, where every thing wou’d serve but to remind her of her Loss, theCount desir’d
               the Servants of <hi rend="italic">Monsieur</hi>Frankville shou’d be call’d, and then
               in the presence of ’em all, declar’d their Master’s last Request, and order’d an
               Account of all Affairs shou’d be brought to his House, where he wou’d immediately
               Conduct their young Lady, as he had promis’d to her Father. If Melliora had been
               without any other cause of Grief, this Eclaircissment had been sufficient to have
               made her Miserable: She had already entertained a most tender Affection for theCount,
               and had not so little discernment as not to be sensible she had made the like
               Impression on him; but now she wak’d as from a Dream of promis’d Joys, to certain
               Woes, and the same Hour<pb n="56"/> which gave Birth to her Passion, commenc’d an adequate
               Despair, and kill’d her Hopes just budding.</p>
            <p>Indeed there never was any Condition so truly deplorable as that of this unfortunate
               Lady; she had just lost a dear and tender Father, whose Care was ever watchful for
               her, her Brother was far off, and she had no other Relation in the World to apply her
               self to for Comfort, or Advice; not even an Acquaintance at <hi rend="italic"
                  >Paris</hi>, or Friend, but him who but newly was become so, and whom she found it
               dangerous to make use of, whom she knew it was a Crime to Love, yet cou’d not help
               Loving; the more she thought, the more she grew Distracted, and the less able to
               resolve on any Thing; a thousand Times she call’d on Death to give her ease, but that
               pale Tyrant flies from the Pursuer, she had not been yet long enough acquainted with
               the ills of Life, and must endure (how unwilling soever) her part of Sufferings in
               common with the rest of human kind.</p>
            <p>As soon as D’elmont had given some necessary Directions to the Servants, he came to
               the Couch, where she was sitting in a fix’d and silent Sorrow (tho’ inwardly toss’d
               with various and violent Agitations) and offering her his Hand, entreated her to
               permit him to wait on her from that House of Woe. Alas! Said she, to what purpose
               shou’d I remove, who bear my Miseries about me? Wretch that I am!---a flood of Tears,
               here interpos’d, and hindred her from proceeding, which falling from such lovely
               Eyes, had a Magnetick Influence to draw the same from every beholder; but D’elmont who
               knew that was not the way to Comfort her, dry’d his as soon as possible, and once
               more beg’d she wou’d depart; suffer my return then (answer’d she) to the Monastery,
               for what have I to do in <hi rend="italic">Paris</hi> since I have lost my Father? By
               no means, Madam (resum’d the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> hastily) that were to
               disappoint your Fathers Designs, and contradict his last Desires; believe most
               lovely Melliora (continu’d he taking her by the Hand and letting fall some Tears which
               he cou’d<pb n="57"/> not restrain, upon it) that I bear at least an equal Share in your
               Affliction, and lament for you, and for my self: Such a regard my grateful Soul paid
                  <hi rend="italic">Monsieur</hi> >Frankville for all his wondrous Care and Goodness
               to me, that in his Death methinks I am twice an Orphan. But Tears are fruitless to
               reinspire his now cold Clay, therefore must transmit the Love and Duty I owed him
               living, to his Memory Dead, and an exact performance of his Will; and since he
               thought me worthy of so vast a Trust as Melliora, I hope she will be guided by her
               Fathers Sentiments, and believe that D’elmont (tho’ a Stranger to her) has a Soul not
               uncapable of Friendship. Friendship! Did I say? (rejoyn’d he softning his Voice) that
               term is too mean to express a Zeal like mine, the Care, the Tenderness, the Faith,
               the fond Affection of Parents,---Brothers, ---Husbands,---Lovers, all Compriz’d in
               one! One great Unutterable! Comprehensive Meaning, is mine! for Melliora! She return’d
               no Answer but Sighs, to all he said to her; but he renewing his Entreaties, and
               urging her Father’s Commands, she was at last prevail’d upon to go into his Chariot,
               which had waited at the Door all the Time of his being there.</p>
            <p>As they went, he left nothing unsaid that he believ’d might tend to her Consolation,
               but she had Griefs which at present he was a Stranger to; and his Conversation, in
               which she found a thousand Charms, rather Encreas’d, than Diminish’d the trouble she
               was in: Every Word, every Look of his, was a fresh Dagger to her Heart, and in spight
               of the Love she bore her Father, and the unfeign’d Concern his sudden Death had given
               her, she was now convinc’d that Count D’elmont’s Perfections were her severest
               Wounds.</p>
            <p>When they came to his House, He presented her to Alovisa, and giving her a brief
               Account of what had happened, engag’d that Lady to receive her<pb n="58"/> with all
               imaginable Demonstrations of Civility and Kindness.</p>
            <p>He soon left the two Ladies together, pretending Business, but indeed to satisfie his
               Impatience, which long’d for an opportunity to meditate on this Adventure. But his
               Reflections were now grown far less pleasing than they used to be; real Sighs flew
               from his Breast uncall’d: And Melliora’s Image in dazling Brightness! In terrible
               Array of killing Charms; Fir’d Him with (impossible to be attain’d) Desires: he found
               by sad Experience what it was to Love, and to Despair. He Admir’d! Ador’d! And
               wish’d, even to Madness! Yet had too much Honour, too much Gratitude for the Memory
               of Monsieur Frankville; and too sincere an Awe for the lovely Cause of his
               Uneasiness, to form a Thought that cou’d encourage his new Passion. What wou’d he not
               have given to have been Unmarried? How often did he Curse the Hour in which Alovisa’s
               fondness was discover’d? And how much more his own Ambition, which prompted him to
               take Advantage of it, and hurry’d him Precipitately to a Hymen, where Love, (the
               noblest Guest) was wanting? It was in these racks of Thought, that the
               unfortunateAmena was remembr’d, and he cou’d not forbear acknowledging the Justice of
               that Doom, which inflicted on him, these very Torments he had given her. A severe
               Repentance seiz’d on his Soul, and Alovysa for whom he never had any thing more than
               an Indifferency; now began to seem Distasteful to his Fancy, he look’d on her, as
               indeed she was, the chief Author ofAmena’s Misfortunes, and abhorr’d her for that
               Infidelity. But when he consider’d her, as the Bar ’twixt Him and Melliora she
               appear’d like his ill Genius to him, and he cou’d not support the Thoughts of being
               oblig’d to love her (or at least to seem as if he did) with Moderation. In the midst
               of these Reflections his Servant came in and deliver’d a Letter to him which had been
               just left by the Post. TheCount immediately knew the Hand to beAmena’s, and<pb n="59"/> was
               cover’d with the utmost Confusion and Remorse when he read these Lines.</p>

            <p>Had this Letter came a Day sooner, ’tis probable it wou’d have had but little Effect
               on the Soul of D’elmont, but his Sentiments of Love were now so wholly chang’d, that
               what before he wou’d but have laugh’d at, and perhaps despis’d, now fill’d him with
               Remorse and serious Anguish. He read it over several Times, and found so many Proofs
               in it of a sincere and constant Affection, that he began to pity Her, with a
               Tenderness like that of a Relation, but no more: The charming Melliora had Engross’d
               all his fonder Wishes; else it is not impossible but that >Alovisa might have had
               more Reason to fear her Rivalship after Marriage, than before. That Lady having been
               without the presence of her dear Husband some Hours, had not patience to remain any
               longer without seeing Him, and making an excuse to Melliora for leaving her alone,
               came running to the Closet where he was; how unwelcome she was grown, the Reader may
               imagine, he receiv’d her, not as he was wont; the Gaity which used to sparkle in his
               Eyes, (at once declaring, and creating Amorous desires) now gave Place to a sullen
               Gloominess, he look’d not on her, or if by chance he did; ’twas more with Anger than
               with Love, in spite of his endeavours to conceal it, she was too quick sighted (as
               all are that truly Love) not to be sensible of this Alteration. However she took no
               notice of it, but Kissing and Embracing him (according to her Custom whenever they
               were alone) beg’d him to leave his solitary Amusement, and help her to Comfort the
               afflicted Lady he brought there. Her Endearments serv’d but to encrease his
               Peevishness, and heighten her Surprize at his Behaviour; and indeed, the Moment that
               she enter’d the Closet was the last of her Tranquility.</p>
            <p>When with much perswasions she had prevail’d with him to go with her into the Room
               where Melliora was, he appeared so disorder’d at the second Sight of that Charmer, as
               wou’d certainly have let<pb n="62"/> Alovysa into the secret of his Passion, had she not
               been retir’d to a Window to recover herself from the Confusion her Husbands coldness
               had thrown her in, and by that fortunate disregard of his Looks at that critical
               Instant, given him (who never wanted presence of Mind) leave to form both his
               Countenance and manner of Address, so as to give no suspicion of the Truth.</p>
            <p>This little Company was very far from being Entertaining to one another; every one
               had their particular Cogitations, and were not displeas’d not to be Interrupted in
               them. It growing late, Alovysa conducted Melliora to a Chamber which she had order’d to
               be prepar’d for her, and then retir’d to her own, hoping that when theCount shou’d
               come to Bed, she might be able to make some Discovery of the Cause of his Uneasiness.
               But she was deceiv’d, he spoke not to her, and when by a thousand little Inventions
               she urg’d him to reply to what she said, it was in such a fashion as only let her
               see, that he was extreamly troubled at something, but cou’d not guess at what. As
               soon as Day broke, he rose, and shutting himself into his Closet, left her in the
               greatest Consternation imaginable; she cou’d not think it possible that the Death of
                  <hi rend="italic">Monsieur</hi>Frankville shou’d work this Transformation, and
               knew of no other Misfortune that had happened. At last she remembred she had heard
               one of the Servants say, a Letter was brought to their Master by the Post, and began
               to reflect on every Thing (in the power of <hi rend="italic">Fortune</hi> to
               determine) that cou’d threaten a Disturbance, yet was still as ignorant as ever. She
               lay not long in Bed, but putting on her Cloaths with more Expedition than usual went
               to the Closet, resolving to speak to him in a manner as shou’d oblige him to put an
               end to the uncertainty she was in, but finding the Door lock’d, her Curiosity made
               her look thro’ the Keyhole, and she saw him sometimes very intirely reading a Letter,
               and sometimes writing, as tho’ it were an Answer to it. A sudden Thought came into
               her Head, and<pb n="63"/> she immediately went softly from the place where she was, without
               knocking at the Door, and stay’d in a little Chamber adjacent to it, where none could
               pass to, or from the Closet without being perceiv’d by her; she had not waited long,
               before she heard the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> Ring, and presently saw a Servant
               enter, and soon after return with a Letter in his Hand; she wou’d not speak to him
               then, for fear of being over heard by her Husband, but followed him down Stairs, and
               when he came towards the bottom, call’d to him in a low Voice to tarry ’till she came
               to him; the Fellow durst not but Obey, and there being no body near ’em, commanded
               him to deliver her the Letter: But he either afraid or unwilling to betray his Trust,
               excus’d himself from it as well as he cou’d, but she was resolv’d to have it; and
               when Threats wou’d not avail, condescended to Entreaties, to which she added Bribes,
               which last Article join’d to the promise she made of never revealing it, won him to
               her Purpose. She had scarce patience to forbear opening it before she got to her
               Chamber: The Superscription (which she saw was forAmena) fir’d her with Disdain and
               Jealousie, and it is hardly possible to imagine, much less to describe the Torrent of
               her Indignation, when she found that it contain’d these Words.</p>

                        ’tis true, what you have heard,----I am Marry’d---But ohAmena! Happiness is
                        not always an Attendant on Hymen.--However, I yet may call you Friend--I yet
                        may Love you, tho’ in a different way from what I once pretended to; and
                        believe me, that the Love of Souls, as it is the most uncommon, especially
                        in our Sex, so ’tis the most refin’d and noble of all Passions, and such a
                        Love shall be for ever yours. Even Alovisa (who has robb’d you of the rest)
                        cannot justly resent my giving you that part,----You’ll wonder at this
                        Alteration in my Temper, but ’tis sincere, I am no more the Gay, the
                        Roving D’elmont, and when you come to Paris, perhaps you will find me in a
                        Condition more liable to your Pity than Indignation. What shall I sayAmena?
                        My Crime is my Punishment, I have offended against Love, and against you,
                        and am, if possible, as Miserable, as Guilty: Torn with Remorse, and
                        Tortur’d with----I cannot----must not Name it----but ’tis something which
                        can be term’d no other than the utmost severity of my Fate.---Haste then to
                        Pity me, to comfort, to advise me, if (as you say) you yet retain any
                        remains of your former Tenderness for this Ungrateful Man</hi>,</p>

            <p>Ungrateful indeed! Cry’d Alovisa (Transported with Excess of Rage and Jealousie) Oh
               the Villain!---What Miseries! What Misfortunes are these thou talk’st of? What
               Unhappiness has waited on thy <hi rend="italic">Himen</hi>? ’Tis I alone am wretched!

            <p>Then, as if she wanted to discover something farther to heighten the Indignation she
               was in, she began to read it over again, and indeed the more she consider’d the
               meaning of what she read, the more her Passions swell’d, ’till they got at last the
               entire Dominion of her Reason: She tore the Letter in a thousand pieces, and was not
               much less unmerciful to her Hair and Garments. ’Tis possible, that in the Violence of
               her Fury, she might have forgot her promise to the Servant, to vent some part of it
               on her Husband, if her Woman coming into the Room to know if she was ready to dress,
               had not prevented her, by telling her the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> was gone
               abroad, and had left Word, that he shou’d not return ’till the Evening. Alovisa had
               thrown herself on the Bed, and the Curtains being drawn discover’d not the disorder
               she was in, and which her Pride made her willing shou’d be still a Secret, therefore
               dismist her with saying, she wou’d call her when she wanted any thing. Tho’ Alovisa
               was too apt to give a loose to her Passions on every occasion, to the Destruction of
               her own Peace, yet she knew well enough how to disguise ’em, when ever she found the
               Concealing of them wou’d be an Advantage to her Designs: And when the Transports of
               her Rage was so far over, as to give her Liberty of Reflection, and she began to
               Examine the State of her Affection to the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>, she soon
               perceiv’d it had so much the better of all other Considerations, that in spite of the
               injustice she thought him guilty of to her, she cou’d not perswade her self to do any
               thing that might give him a pretence to Quarrel with her. She thought she had done
               enough in Intercepting this Letter, and did not doubt but thatAmena wou’d take his
               not writing to her so much to Heart, as to prevent her ever returning to <hi
                  rend="italic">Paris</hi>, and resolv’d to omit nothing of her former Endearments,
               or make a shew of being in the least disoblig’d; this sort of Carriage she imagin’d
               wou’d not only lay him more open and unguarded to the diligent watch she design’d to
               make on all<pb n="66"/> his Words and Actions, but likewise awaken him to a just Sense of
               her Goodness, and his own Ingratitude.-----She rightly judg’d that when People are
               Marry’d, Jealousie was not the proper Method to revive a decay’d Passion, and that
               after Possession it must be only Tenderness, and constant Assiduity to please, that
               can keep up desire, fresh and gay: Man is too Arbitrary a Creature to bear the least
               Contradiction, where he pretends an absolute Authority, and that Wife who thinks by
               ill humour and perpetual Taunts, to make him weary of what she wou’d reclaim him
               from, only renders her self more hateful, and makes that justifiable which before was
               blameable in him. These, and the like Considerations made Alovysa put on a Countenance
               of Serenity, and she so well acted the part of an Unsuspecting Wife, that D’elmont was
               far from imagining what she had done: However he still behav’d with the same Caution
               as before, to Melliora; and certainly never did People disguise the Sentiments of
               their Souls more artfully than did these three---Melliora vail’d her secret
               Languishments, under the Covert of her grief for her Father, theCount his Burning
               anguish, in a gloomy Melancholy for the Loss of his Friend; but Alovysa’s Task was
               much the hardest, who had no pretence for grief (raging, and bleeding with neglected
               Love, and stifled Pride) to frame her Temper to a seeming Tranquility----All made it
               their whole study to deceive each other, yet none but Alovysa was intirely in the
               dark; for the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> and Melliora had but too true a guess at
               one another’s meaning, every look of his, for he had Eyes that needed no Interpreter,
               gave her Intelligence of his Heart, and the Confusion which the understanding those
               looks gave her, sufficiently told him how sensible she was of ’em.----Several Days
               they liv’d in this Manner, in which time <hi rend="italic">Monsieur</hi> >Frankville
               was Interr’d. Which Solemnity, the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> took care shou’d be
               perform’d with a Magnificence suitable to the Friendship he publickly profest<pb n="67"/> to
               have born him, and the secret Adoration his Soul paid to his Remains.</p>
            <p>Nothing happned of Moment,’till a Day or two after the Funeral, a Gentleman newly
               arriv’d at <hi rend="italic">Paris</hi>, came to visit the <hi rend="italic"
                  >Count</hi>, and gave him an Account of >Amena’s having taken the Habit; how,
               (said D’elmont Interrupting him) is it possible?----Has she then profest? Yes,
               answer’d the Gentleman, having a Sister whom I always tenderly lov’d at the Monastery
               at St. <hi rend="italic">Dennis</hi>, my affection oblig’d me to make it in my way to
               visit her.Amena was with her at the Grate, when she receiv’d me; I know not how,
               among other Discourses, we hapned to talk of the fine Gentlemen of <hi rend="italic"
                  >Paris</hi>, which it was Impossible to do, without mentioning Count D’elmont,
               theCount answer’d not this Complement as he wou’d have done at another time, but only
               bowing with an humble Air, gave him Liberty to prosecute his Discourse; the moment
               (resum’d he) thatAmena heard your Name, the Tears run from her fair Eyes; in such
               abundance, and she seem’d opprest with so violent a Grief, that she was not able to
               stay any longer with us. When she was gone, my Sister whom she had made her
               Confidant, gave me the History of her Misfortunes, and withal, told me, that the next
               Day she was to be Initiated into Holy Orders: My Curiosity engag’d me to stay at St.
                  <hi rend="italic">Dennis</hi>, to see the Ceremony perform’d, which was Solemn;
               but not with that Magnificence which I expected; it seems it wasAmena’s desire that
               it should be as private as possible, and for that Reason, none of her Relations were
               there, and several of the Formalities of Entrance omitted: After it was over, my
               Sister beckon’d me to come to the Grate, where I saw her before, and Conjur’d me in
               the Name of her new Sister, to give this to your Hands; in speaking these Words, he
               took a Letter out of his Pocket, which theCount immediately opening, to his great
               surprise, found it contain’d, as follows.</p>

            <p>D’elmont was strangely fir’d at the reading these Lines, which left him no Room to
               doubt that his Letter had miscarried, he could not presently imagine by what means,
               but was resolv’d if possible, to find it out. However, he dissembled his Thoughts
               ’till the Gentleman had taken his leave; then calling for the<pb n="69"/> Servant, whom he
               had entrusted with the carrying it, he took him by the Throat, and holding his drawn
               Sword directly to his Breast, swore that Moment should be his last, if he did not
               immediately confess the Truth; the poor Fellow, frighted almost to Death, trembling,
               and falling on his Knees, implor’d Forgiveness, and discover’d all. Alovisa who was in
               the next Chamber, hearing her Husband call for that Servant, with a Tone somewhat
               more imperious than what he was accustom’d to, and a great Noise soon after, imagin’d
               some Accident had happen’d to betray her, and ran in to know the Certainty, just as
               the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> had discharg’d the Servant, at once from his Service
               and his Presence. You have done well Madam (said D’elmont, looking on her with Eyes
               sparkling with Indignation) you have done well, by your impertinent Curiosity and
               Imprudence, to rouze me from my Dream of Happiness, and remind me, that I am that
               wretched Thing a Husband! ’Tis well indeed (answer’d Alovisa, who saw now that there
               was no need of farther Dissimulation) that any thing can make you remember, both what
               you are, and what I am. You, (resum’d he, hastily interrupting her) have taken an
               effectual Method to prove your self a Wife!----a very
               Wife!----Insolent---Jealous---and Censorious!---But Madam (continued he frowning)
               since you are pleas’d to assert your Priveledge, be assur’d, I too shall take my
               turn, and will exert the---Husband! In saying this, he flung out of the Room in spite
               of her Endeavours to hinder him, and going hastily through a Gallery which had a
               large Window that looked into the Garden, he perceived Melliora lying on a green
               Bank, in a melancholy, but a charming Posture, directly opposite to the Place where
               he was; her Beauties appear’d, if possible, more to Advantage than ever he had seen
               them, or at least, he had more Opportunity thus unseen by her, to gaze upon ’em; he
               in a Moment lost all the Rage of Temper he had been in, and his whole Soul was taken
               up with softness; he stood for some Moments fix’d in<pb n="70"/> silent Admiration, but Love
               has small Dominion in a Heart, that can content it self with a distant Prospect, and
               there being a Pair of back-Stairs at the farther end of the Gallery, which led to the
               Garden. He either forgot, or not regarded what Construction > Alovisa might make on
               this private Interview, if by Chance, from any of the Windows she should be Witness
               of it.</p>
            <p>Melliora was so intent on a Book she had in her Hand, that she saw not the <hi
                  rend="italic">Count</hi> ’till he was close enough to her to discern what was the
               Subject of her Entertainment, and finding it the Works of <hi rend="italic"
                  >Monsieur</hi> >L’fontenelle; Philosophy, Madam, at your Age (said he to her with
               an Air, which exprest surprize) is as wond’rous as your other Excellencies; but I am
               confident, had this Author ever seen Melliora, his Sentiments had been otherwise than
               now they seem to be, and he would have been able to write of nothing else but Love
               and her. Melliora blush’d Extremely at his unexpected Presence, and the Complement he
               made Her; but recollecting her self as soon as she cou’d; I have a better Opinion of
                  <hi rend="italic">Monsieur</hi>L’fontenelle, (answer’d she) but if I were really
               Mistress of as many Charms as you wou’d make me believe, I should think my self
               little beholding to Nature, for bestowing them on me, if by their means I were
               depriv’d of so choice an Improvement as this Book has given me. Thank Heaven, then
               Madam, (resum’d he) that you were born in an Age successive to that which has
               produc’d so many fine Treatises of this kind for your Entertainment; since (I am very
               Confident) this, and a long space of future Time will have no other Theme, but that
               which at present you seem so much averse to. Melliora found so much difficulty in
               endeavouring to Conceal the disorder she was in at this Discourse, that it rendered
               her unable to reply; and He, (who possibly guest the occasion of her silence) taking
               one of her Hands and tenderly pressing it between his, look’d so full in<pb n="71"/> her
               Eyes, as heighten’d her Confusion, and discover’d to his ravish’d View, what most he
               wish’d to find: Ambition, Envy, Hate, Fear, or Anger, every other Passion that finds
               Entrance in the Soul; Art, and Discretion, may Disguise, but Love, tho’ it may be
               feign’d, can never be Conceal’d, not only the Eyes (those true and most Perfect
               Intelligencers of the Heart) but every Feature, every Faculty betrays it! It fills
               the whole Air of the Person possest with it; it wanders round the Mouth! Plays in the
               Voice! trembles in the Accent! And shows it self a thousand different, nameless ways!
               Even Melliora’s Care to hide it, made it more apparent, and the Transported D’elmont
               not considering where he was, or who might be a witness of his Rapture, cou’d not
               forbear catching her in his Arms, and grasping her with an Extasie, which plainly
               told her what his thoughts were, tho’ at that time he had not Power to put ’em into
               Words; and indeed there is no greater proof of a vast and elegant Passion, than the
               being uncapable of Expressing it:-----He had perhaps held her in this strict embrace,
               ’till some Accident had discover’d and separated him from her; if the Alarm this
               manner of Proceeding gave her Modesty, had not made her force her self from
               him.---They both stood in a silent Consternation, nor was he much less disorder’d at
               the Temerity, the violence of his ungovernable Passion had made him guilty of, than
               she was at the Liberty he had taken; he knew not how to Excuse, nor she, to Reproach;
               Respect (the constant Attendant on a sincere Affection) had tyed his Tongue, and
               shame mixed with the uncertainty after what manner she shou’d resent it, Hers. At
               last, the Natural Confidence of his Sex Encourag’d him to break this mute
               Entertainment,--There are Times Madam (said he) in which the wisest have not Power
               over their own Actions---If therefore I have offended, impute not the Crime to me,
               but that unavoidable impulse which for a Moment hurry’d me from my self; for be
               assured while D’elmont can Command his Thoughts, they shall be<pb n="72"/> most obedient to
               your Wishes----As Melliora was about to reply, she saw a Servant coming hastily to
               speak to theCount, and was not a little glad of so favourable an opportunity to
               retire without being oblig’d to continue a Discourse in which she must either lay a
               severe Punishment on her Inclinations by making a quarrel with him, or by forgiving
               him too easily, Trespass against the strict Precepts of Virtue she had always
               profess’d: She made what haste she cou’d into her chamber, and carry’d with her a
               World of troubled Meditations, she now no longer doubted of theCount’s Passion, and
               trembled with the Apprehension of what he might in time be prompted to; but when she
               Reflected how dear that Person she had so much cause to fear, was to her, she thought
               her self, at once the most unfortunate and most Guilty of her Sex.</p>
            <p>The Servant who gave ’em this seasonable Interruption delivered a Letter to his
               Master, which he opening hastily, knowing that it came from his Brother by the Seal,
               found the Contents as follows.</p>

                        highest rais’d, and nearest to their Aim.----The Letter I carry’d from her,
                        whom I think it my Happiness to call Sister, joyn’d with my own Faith, Love,
                        and Assiduity; at length Triumph’d over all the little niceties and
                        objections my Charmer made against our Journey, and she Condescended to
                        order every thing requisite for our departure from Amiens shou’d be got
                        ready.----But how shall I Express the Grief, the Horrour, the Distraction of
                        my Soul, when the very Evening before the Day we shou’d have set out, as I
                        was sitting with her, a sudden, but terrible Illness, like the Hand of Death
                        seiz’d on her, she fell (oh! my Brother) Cold, and Speechless in my
                        Arms------Guess, what I endur’d at that Afflicting Moment, all that I had of
                        Man, or Reason left me; and sure had<pb n="73"/> not the Care of the Baroness and
                        some other Ladies (whom my Cries drew in to her Assistance) in a little time
                        recover’d her, I had not now surviv’d to give you this Account: Again, I saw
                        the Beauties of her Eyes! again, I heard her Voice, but her Disorder was yet
                        so great, that it was thought convenient she should be put to Bed; the
                        Baroness seeing my Despair, desired me not to quit her House, and by that
                        Means I had News every Hour, how her Fevor encreas’d, or abated, for the
                        Physicians being desir’d to deal freely, assur’d us, that was her Distemper:
                        For several Days she continued in a Condition that could give us no Hopes of
                        her Recovery; in which Time, as you may imagine, I was little capable of
                        Writing.-----The wildness of my unruly Grief, made me not be permitted to
                        come into her Chamber; but they cou’d not, without they had made use of
                        Force, hinder me from lying at her Door: I counted all her Groans, heard
                        every Sigh the Violence of her Pain drew from her, and watch’d the
                        Countenance of every Person who came out of her Chamber, as Men who wou’d
                        form a Judgment of future Consequences, do the Signs in Heaven.----But I
                        trouble you with this tedious recital, she is now, if there is any
                        Dependance on the Doctors Skill, past Danger, tho’ not fit to Travel, at
                        least this Month, which gives no small Aleviation to the greatness of my
                        Joys (which otherwise wou’d be unbounded) for her Recovery, since it
                        occasions so long a Separation from the best of Brothers, and of Friends:
                        Farewell, may all your Wishes meet Success, and an Eternal round of
                        Happiness attend you; to add to mine, I beg you’ll write by the first Post,
                        which, next to seeing you, is the greatest I can Taste. I am, my Lord, with
                        all imaginable Tenderness and Respect, your most Affectionate Brother and
                        Humble Servant,</hi></p>

            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> judg’d it proper that Alovisa shou’d see this Letter,
               because it so much concern’d her<pb n="74"/> Sister, and was ordering the Servant to carry
               it to her, (not being himself willing to speak to her) just as she was coming towards
               him: She had receiv’d a Letter from the <hi rend="italic">Baroness</hi>De Beronvill,
               at the same time that the <hi rend="italic">Chevalier</hi>Brillian’s was brought, and
               was glad to take the Opportunity of Communicating the Contents of it, in hopes by
               this Conversation, to be reconcil’d to her Husband: But the gloomy Sullenness of the
               Humour he had left her with, return’d at Sight of her, and after some little
               Discourse of Family Affairs, which he could not avoid answering, walk’d carelesly
               away: She follow’d him at a distance, ’till he was got up to the Gallery, and
               perceiving he went toward his Closet, mended her Pace, and was close to him when he
               was going in. My Lord, (said she) with a Voice but half assured, and which would not
               have given her leave to utter more, if he had not interrupted her, by telling her he
               would be alone, and shutting the Door hastily upon her, but she prevented his Locking
               of it, by pushing against it with all her Force, and he, not exerting his, for fear
               of hurting her, suffer’d her Entrance: But look’d on her with a Countenance so
               forbidding, as in spite of the natural Haughtiness of her Temper, and the Resolution
               she had made to speak to him, render’d her unable for some Moments to bring forth a
               Word; but the silent Grief, which appear’d in her Face, pleaded more with the good
               Nature of the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>, than any thing she could have said: He
               began to pity the unhappiness of her too violent Affection, and to wish himself in a
               Capacity of returning it, however, he (like other Husbands) thought it best to keep
               up his Resentments, and take this Opportunity of Quelling all the <hi rend="italic"
                  >Woman</hi> in her Soul, and humbling all the little Remains of Pride that Love
               had left her. Madam, (resum’d he) with an Accent, which tho’ something more softned,
               was still imperious enough, if you have any Thing of Consequence to impart to me, I
               desire you will be as brief as you can, for I would be left to the Freedom<pb n="75"/> of my
               Thoughts---Alovisa cou’d not yet answer, but letting fall a Shower of Tears, and
               throwing her self on the Ground, Embrac’d his Knees with so Passionate a Tenderness,
               as sufficiently exprest her Repentance for having been guilty of any thing to
               disoblige him: D’elmont was most sensibly touch’d at this Behaviour, so vastly
               different from what he cou’d have expected from the greatness of her Spirit, and
               raising her with an obliging Air. I am sorry (said he) that any thing should happen
               to occasion this Submission, but since what’s past, is out of either of our Powers to
               recall: I shall endeavour to think of it no more, provided you’ll promise me, never
               for the future to be guilty of any thing which may give me an uneasiness by the sight
               of yours----’Tis impossible to represent the Transport of Alovisa at this kind
               Expression, she hung upon his Neck, kissed the dear Mouth which had pronounc’d her
               Pardon, with Raptures of unspeakable Delight, she sigh’d with Pleasure, as before she
               had done with Pain, she wept, she even dy’d with Joy!----No, no, my Lord, my Life, my
               Angel, (cry’d she, as soon as she had Power to speak) I never will Offend you more,
               no more be Jealous, no more be doubtful of my Happiness! You are!--you will be only
               mine, I know you will----Your kind Forgiveness of my Folly, assures me that you are
               mine, not more by Duty than by Love! A Tye far more valuable than that of Marriage.
               The <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> conscious of her Mistake, had much ado to conceal
               his Disorder at these Words, and being unwilling she should proceed; as soon as he
               could (without seeming unkind or rude) disingag’d himself from her Arms, and took a
               Pen in his Hand, which he told her he was about to employ in answering the <hi
                  rend="italic">Chevalier</hi> >Brillian’s Letter; Alovisa who now resolv’d an entire
               Obedience to his Will, and remembring he had desired to be alone, withdrew, full of
               the Idea of an imagin’d Felicity----Her Heart was now at ease, she believ’d, that if
               her Husband had any Remains of Passion forAmena, the impossibility of<pb n="76"/> ever
               seeing her again, would soon extinguish them, and since she was so happily
               reconcil’d, was far from repenting her intercepting of his Letter: But poor Lady, she
               did not long enjoy this Peace of Mind, and this Interval of Tranquility serv’d but to
               heighten her ensuing Miseries.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Count’s</hi> secret Passion for Melliora grew stronger by his
               endeavouring to suppress it, and perceiving that she carefully avoided all
               Opportunities of being alone with him one Moment, since his Behaviour to her in the
               Garden, he grew almost Distracted with the continual Restraint he was forc’d to put
               on all his Words and Actions: He durst not Sigh nor send an amorous Glance, for fear
               of offending her, and alarming his Wive’s Jealousy, so lately lull’d to Sleep: He had
               no Person in whom he had Confidence enough to trust with his Misfortune, and had
               certainly sunk under the Pressure of it, if Alovisa, who observing an Alteration in
               his Countenance and Humour, fearing he was really indispos’d (which was the excuse he
               made for his Melancholly) had not perswaded him to go into the Country, hoping that
               change of Air might do him good: He had a very fine Seat near <hi rend="italic"
                  >Anjerville</hi> in the Province of <hi rend="italic">Le Beausse</hi>, which he
               had not been at for some Years, and he was very willing to comply with Alovisa’s
               Desires of passing the remainder of the Summer in a Solitude, which was now become
               agreeable to him; the greatest Difficulty was, in perswading Melliora to accompany
               them thither; he guess’d by her reserv’d Behaviour, that she only waited an
               Opportunity to leave the Place where he was, and was not mistaken in his Conjecture:
               One Day as they were talking of it, she told them she was resolv’d to return to the
               Monastery where she had been Educated, that the World was too noisy a Place for one
               of her Taste, who had no relish for any of the Diversions of it: Every Word she
               spoke, was like a Dagger to D’elmont’s Heart; yet, he so artfully manag’d his
               Endeavours, between the Authority<pb n="77"/> of a Guardian, and the Entreaties of a Friend,
               that she was at last overcome. ’Tis hard for the severest Virtue to deny themselves
               the Sight of the Person belov’d, and whatever Resolutions we make, there are but few,
               who like Melliora might not by such a Lover be prevail’d upon to break them.</p>
            <p>As soon as their coming into the Country was spread abroad, they were visited by all
               the Neighbouring People of Quality, but there was none so welcome to D’elmont as the
                  <hi rend="italic">Baron</hi>D’espernay; they had before theCount’s going into the
               Army been very intimate Acquaintance, and were equally glad of this opportunity to
               renew a Friendship, which Time and Absence had not entirely erac’d. The <hi
                  rend="italic">Baron</hi> had a Sister young, and very agreeable, but gay even to
               Coquetry; they liv’d together, being both single, and he brought her with him,
               hearing the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> was Married, to visit his Lady: There were
               several other young Noble Men and Ladies there, at the same time, and the
               Conversation grew so delightfully Entertaining, that it was impossible for Persons
               less prepossest than the Count and Melliora, to retain their <hi rend="italic"
                  >Chagrin</hi>; but, tho’ there were scarce any in the Company that might not have
               list’ned with a pleas’d Attention, to what those two admirable Persons were capable
               of saying, yet their secret Sorrows kept them both in silence, ’tillMelantha, for
               that was the Name of the <hi rend="italic">Barons</hi> Sister, took upon her to
               divert the Company with some Verses on Love; which she took out of her Pocket-Book
               and read to ’em: Every Body extoll’d the softness of the Stile, and the Subject they
               were upon. But Melliora who was willing to take all opportunities of Condemning that
               Passion, as well to conceal it in her self as to check what ever hopes the <hi
                  rend="italic">Count</hi> might have, now discovered the force of her Reason, the
               Delicacy of her Wit, and the Penetration of her Judgment, in a manner so sweetly
               surprizing to all that were Strangers to her, that they presently found, that it was
               not want of Noble, and truly agreeable Thoughts or Words<pb n="78"/> to express ’em, that
               had so long depriv’d them of the Pleasure of hearing her; she urg’d the Arguments she
               brought against the giving way to Love, and the Danger of all softning Amusements,
               with such a becoming fierceness, as made every Body of the Opinion that she was born
               only to create Desire, not be susceptible of it her self. The <hi rend="italic"
                  >Count</hi> as he was most Concern’d, took the most particular Notice of all she
               said, and was not a little alarm’d to see her appear so much in earnest, but durst
               not answer, or Endeavour to confute her, because of Alovysa’s presence: But it was not
               long before he had an opportunity, a few Days after he met with one, as full as he
               cou’d wish. Returning one Evening from the <hi rend="italic">Baron</hi>D’espernay’s,
               whom he had now made the Confident of his Passion, and who had Encourag’d him in it,
               he was told that Alovysa was gone out to take the Air, and hearing no mention
               of Melliora’s being with her, he stay’d not to enquire, but running directly to her
               Chamber, made his Eyes his best Informers: He found her lying on a Couch in a most
               charming Dissabillee, she had but newly come from Bathing, and her Hair unbraided,
               hung down upon her Shoulders with a negligence more Beautiful than all the Aids of
               Art cou’d form in the most exact <hi rend="italic">Decorum</hi> of Dress; part of it
               fell upon her Neck and Breast, and with it’s Lovely Shadiness, being of a Delicate
               dark Brown, set off to vast Advantage, the matchless whiteness of her Skin: Her Gown
               and the rest of her Garments were white, and all ungirt, and loosely flowing,
               discover’d a Thousand Beauties, which Modish Formalities conceal. A Book lay open by
               her, on which she had reclin’d her Head, as if been tir’d with Reading, she Blush’d
               at sight of the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>, and rose from off the Couch with a
               Confusion which gave new Lustre to her Charms, but he not permitting her to stir from
               the place she was in, sat down by Her, and casting his Eyes on the Book which lay
               there, found it to be <hi rend="italic">Ovid’s-Epistles</hi>, How Madam (cry’d he,
               not a little pleas’d with the Discovery) dare you, who the other Day so warmly<pb n="79"/>
               inveigh’d against Writings of this Nature, trust your self with so Dangerous an
               Amusement? How happens it, that you are so suddenly come over to our Party? Indeed my
               Lord (answer’d she, growing more disorder’d) it was Chance rather than Choice, that
               directed this Book to my Hands, I am yet far from approving Subjects of this Kind,
               and believe I shall be ever so: Not that I can perceive any Danger in it, as to my
               self, the Retirement I have always liv’d in, and the little Propensity I find to
               entertain a Thought of that uneasie Passion, has hitherto secur’d me from any
               Prepossession, without which, <hi rend="italic">Ovid</hi>’s Art is Vain. Nay, Madam,
               reply’d the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>, now you Contradict your former Argument,
               which was, that these sort of Books were, as it were, Preparatives to Love, and by
               their softning Influence, melted the Soul, and made it fit for amorous Impressions,
               and so far, you certainly were in the right, for when once the Fancy is fixed on a
               real Object, there will be no need of Auxillary Forces, the Dear Idea will spread it
               self thro’ every Faculty of the Soul, and in a Moment inform us better, than all the
               Writings of the most Experienc’d Poets, cou’d do in an Age. Well, my Lord, (said she
               endeavouring to Compose her self) I am utterly unambitious of any Learning this way,
               and shall endeavour to retain in Memory, more of the Misfortunes that attended the
               Passion of <hi rend="italic">Sappho</hi>, than the Tender, tho’ never so Elegant
               Expressions it produc’d: And if all Readers of Romances took this Method, the
               Votaries of <hi rend="italic">Cupid</hi> wou’d be fewer, and the Dominion of Reason
               more Extensive. You speak (Answer’d D’elmont) as tho’ Love and Reason were
               Incompatible, there is no Rule (said she) my Lord, without Exception, they are indeed
               sometimes united, but how often they are at Variance, where may we not find Proofs,
               History is full of them, and daily Examples of the many Hair-brain’d Matches, and
               slips, much less excusable, sufficiently evince how little Reason has to do in the
               Affairs of Love, I mean (continu’d she, with a very serious Air) that sort of Love,
               for<pb n="80"/> there are two, which hurries People on to an immediate Gratification of
               their Desires, tho’ never so prejudicial to themselves, or the Person they pretend to
               Love. Pray Madam (said the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> a little nettled at this
               Discourse) what Love is that which seems at least to Merit the Approbation of a Lady
               so extreamly nice? It has many Branches (reply’d she) in the first Place that which
               we owe to Heaven, in the next to our King, our Country, Parents, Kindred, Friends,
               and Lastly, that which Fancy inclines, and Reason guides us to, in a Partner for
               Life, but here every Circumstance must agree, Parity of Age, of Quality, of Fortune,
               and of Humour, Consent of Friends, and Equal Affection in each other, for if any one
               of these particulars fail, it renders all the rest of no Effect. Ah, Madam (cry’d the
                  <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> not able to suffer her to proceed). What share of
               Pity then can you afford to a Man who, loves where almost all these Circumstances are
               wanting, and what Advice wou’d you give a wretch so Curst? I wou’d have him <hi
                  rend="italic">think</hi>, (said she more Gravely than before) How Madam, (resum’d
               he) think did you say? Alas! ’Tis Thought that has undone him, that’s very possible
               (answer’d she) but yet ’tis want of thinking justly, for in a Lovers Mind Illusions
               seem Realities, and what at an other time wou’d be look’d on as Impossible, appears
               easie then: They indulge, and feed their new-born Folly with a prospect of a Hope,
               tho’ ne’re so distant a one, and in the vain pursuit of it, fly Consideration, ’till
               dispair starts up in the midway, and bar’s their promis’d View; whereas if they gave
               way to due Reflection, the Vanity of the Attempt wou’d presently be shown, and the
               same cause that bid ’em cease to hope, wou’d bid ’em cease to wish: Ah Madam (said
               he) how little do you know of that Passion, and how easily cou’d I disprove you by
               the Example of my Friend; despair and Love are of an equal Age in him, and from the
               first Moment he beheld his Adorable Charmer, he has Languished without the least
               mixture of a flattering Hope. I Grant the Flames with which our Modern Gallants are
               ordinarily animated, cannot long<pb n="81"/> subsist without Fewel, but where Love is
               kindled in a Generous Heart by a just Admiration of the real Merits of the Object
               belov’d, Reason goes Hand in Hand with it, and makes it lasting as our Life. In my
               Mind (answer’d Melliora Coldly) an Esteem so Grounded may more properly be ascribed to
               Friendship, then be it so Madam, (rejoyn’d the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> briskly)
               Friendship and Love, where either are sincere, vary but little in their meaning,
               there may indeed be some Distinctions in their Ceremonies, but their Essentials are
               still the same: And if the Gentleman I speak of were so happy as to hope his
               Friendship wou’d be acceptable, I dare promise that he never wou’d complain his Love
               were not so. You have a strange way (said she) to Confound Idea’s, which in my
               Opinion are so vastly different, that I shou’d make no Difficulty in granting my
               Friendship to as many of my Acquaintance, as had Merit to deserve it; but if I were
               to Love in that general Manner, ’twould be a Crime wou’d justly render me
               Contemptible to Mankind: Madam (replyed the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>) when I
               spoke of the Congruity of Love and Friendship, I did not mean that sort, which to me,
               seems unworthy of the Name of either, but that Exalted one, which made <hi
                  rend="italic">Orestes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pilades</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
                  >Theseus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Perithous</hi> so Famous. That, which has no
               Reserve, no separate Interest, or divided Thoughts, That which fills all,----gives
               all the Soul, and esteems even Life a Trifle, to prove it self sincere----What can
               Love do more than yield every thing to the object Belov’d? And Friendship must do so
               too, or it is not Friendship! Therefore take heed fair Angel (continu’d he, taking
               her Hand, and kissing it) how you Promise Friendship, where you ne’re mean to Love:
               And observing she was Silent, your Hand, (said he) your Lip, your Neck, your Breast,
               your All.----All this whole Heaven of Beauty must be no longer in your own
               Disposal----All is the Prize of Friendship! As much Confus’d as Melliora was, at these
               Words, which gave her sufficient Reason to fear he wou’d now declare himself more
               fully than she desir’d;<pb n="82"/> she had Spirit and Resolution enough to withdraw her
               Hand from his, and with a look, that spoke her Meaning but too plainly for the repose
               of the Enamour’d D’elmont: I shall take care my Lord (said she) how I Commence a
               Friendship with any Person who shall make use of it to my Prejudice.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> was now sensible of his Error in going so far, and
               fearing he had undone himself in her Esteem by his rash Proceeding, thought it was
               best at once to throw off a Disguise which, in spight of his Endeavours wou’d fall
               off, of itself, and by making a bold and free Confession of his real Sentiments,
               oblige her to a Discovery of hers.----I do not doubt your Caution, Madam, (answer’d
               he) in this point: Your Reserved Behaviour, even to me, convinces me, but too fully,
               how little you are disposed to give, or receive any Proofs of Friendship: But perhaps
               (continu’d he, with a deep sigh) my too presuming Eyes have rendred me a suspected
               Person, and while you find in me the Wretch I have discrib’d, you find nothing in me
               worthy of a happier Fortune; you are worthy every thing my Lord, (said Melliora quite
               beside her self at these Words) nor are you less happy than you deserve to be, and I
               wou’d rather that these Eyes shou’d loose their sight than view you otherwise than
               now I see you, blest in every Circumstance, the Darling of the World, the Idol of the
               Court, and Favourite of Heaven! Oh stop! (Cry’d D’elmont hastily Interrupting her)
               forbear to Curse me farther, rather Command my Death, than wish the Continuance of my
               present Miseries. Cruel Melliora too well, alas, you know what I have endur’d from the
               first fatal Moment I beheld you, and only feign an Ignorance to distract me more: A
               Thousand times you have read my Rising wishes, sparkling in my Eyes, and glowing on
               my Cheeks, as often seen my Virtue struggling in silent Tremblings, and Life-wasting
               Anguish to suppress desire. Nay, Madam (said he Catching fast hold of both her Hands,
               seeing her about to rise) by all my sleepless Nights, and restless<pb n="83"/> Days, by all
               my countless burning Agonies; by all the Torments of my gall’d, bleeding Heart, I
               swear, that you shall hear me: I have heard too much (cry’d Melliora not able to
               contain her self) and tho’ I am unwilling to believe you have any farther aim in this
               Discourse than your Diversion, yet I must tell your Lordship, that there are Themes
               more proper for it, than the Daughter of your Friend, who was entrusted to your Care
               with a far different Opinion of your Behaviour to her. What have I done (resum’d the
               almost the Distracted <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>, falling at her Feet, and grasping
               her Knees) what have I done, Inhuman Melliora! To deserve this Rigour? My Honour has
               hitherto prevail’d above desire, fierce, and raging as it is, nor had I any other
               hopes by making this Declaration, than to meet that pity my Misfortunes merit; and
               you cannot without Ingratitude deny: Pity, even to Criminals is allow’d, and sure,
               where the offence is unvoluntary, like mine, ’tis due: ’Tis impossible to guess the
               Conflict in Melliora’s Breast at this Instant, she had heard a most Passionate
               Declaration of Love from a married Man, and by Consequence, whatever his Pretences
               were, cou’d look on his Designs no otherwise than aim’d at the Destruction of her
               Honour, and was fir’d with a virtuous Indignation. But then she saw in this married
               Man, the only Person in the World, who was capable of Inspiring her with a tender
               Thought, she saw him reduc’d to the last Extremity of Despair for her sake: She heard
               his sighs, she felt his Tremblings as he held her, and cou’d not refrain shedding
               some Tears, both for him, and for her self, who indeed suffer’d little less; but the
                  <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> was not so happy as to be Witness of this Testimony
               of her Compassion: He had reclin’d his Head on her Lap, possibly to hide those that
               forc’d their way thro’ his Eyes, at the same time; and Alovisa’s Voice which they
               heard below, giving them both an Alarm; they had no further opportunity for Speech,
               and the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> was but just gone out of the Room,
               and Melliora<pb n="84"/> laid on the Couch in the same careless Possture which he had found
               her in; when Alovisa enter’d the Chamber, and after having a little pleasantly
               Reproach’d her, for being so lazy as not to accompany her in the Walk she had been
               taking, ask’d her if she had not seen the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>, who she had
               been told was come home: Poor Melliora had much ado to conceal the Disorder she was in
               at this Question, but recovering her self as well as she could, answer’d in the
               Affirmative; but that he had not staid there longer than to enquire where she was
               gone, and that she knew not but he might be gone in search of her: This was enough to
               make Alovisa take her leave, impatient for the Sight of her dear Lord, a Happiness she
               had not enjoy’d since Morning, but she was disappointed of her Hope. The <hi
                  rend="italic">Count</hi>, as late as it was in the Evening, went into his Chaise,
               which had not been set up since he came from the <hi rend="italic"
               >Baron</hi>D’espernay’s and drove thither again with all the Speed he could.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Baron</hi> was extreamly surpriz’d at his sudden Return, and
               with so much Confusion and Melancholy in his Countenance. But much more so, when he
               had given him an Account of what had pass’d between him and Melliora and cou’d not
               forbear rallying him excessively on the Occasion. What, said he, a Man of Wit, and
               Pleasure like <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>D’elmont a Man, who knows the Sex so well,
               could he let slip so favourable an Opportunity with the finest Woman in the World;
               One, for whose Enjoyment he wou’d Die.----Cou’d a Frown, or a little angry Coyness,
               (which ten to one was but affected) have Power to freeze such fierce Desires. The <hi
                  rend="italic">Count</hi> was not at present in a Humour to relish this Merriment,
               he was too seriously in Love to bear that any thing relating to it, should be turn’d
               into Ridicule, and was far from repenting he had done no more, since what he had
               done, had occasion’d her Displeasure: But the <hi rend="italic">Baron</hi>, who had
               Designs in his Head, which he knew cou’d<pb n="85"/> not by any means be brought to succeed,
               but by keeping the <hi rend="italic">Count’s</hi> Passion warm, made Use of all the
               Artifice he was Master of, to embolden this respective Lover, to the Gratification of
               his Wishes: And growing more grave than he had been, My Lord, said he, you do not
               only injure the Dignity of our Sex in general, but your own Merits in particular, and
               perhaps even Melliora’s secret Inclinations, by this unavailing distant Carriage: and
               causeless Despair.----Have you not confess’d that she has look’d on you with a
               Tenderness, like that of Love, that she has blush’d at your Sight, and trembled at
               your Touch?----What would you more that she should do, or what indeed, can she do
               more, in Modesty, to prove her Heart is yours? A little Resolution on your side would
               make her all yours----Women are taught by Custom to deny what most they covet, and to
               seem Angry, when they are best Pleas’d; believe me, D’elmont, that the most rigid
               Virtue of ’em all, never yet hated a Man for those Faults, which Love occasions: All
               this answer’d the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>, is what I readily agree to:---But O
               her Father’s Memory! My Obligation to him! Her Youth and Innocence are Daggers to my
               cool Reflections---Wou’d it not be Pity (<hi rend="italic">D’espernay!</hi> continued
               he with a deep Sigh) even if she shou’d consent, to ruin so much Sweetness? The <hi
                  rend="italic">Baron</hi> could not forbear laughing at these Words, and the <hi
                  rend="italic">Count</hi> who had started these Objections, only with the Hope of
               having them remov’d, easily suffer’d himself to be perswaded to follow his
               Inclinations; and it was soon concluded betwixt them, that on the first Opportunity,
               Melliora should fall a Sacrifice to Love.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> came not Home ’till the next Morning, and brought
               the <hi rend="italic">Baron</hi> with him, for they were now become inseparable
               Friends: At his return, he found Alovisa in a very ill Humour for his being abroad
               all Night, and in spite of the Resolution she had made of shewing a perfect
               Resignation to her Husband’s<pb n="86"/> Will, could not forbear giving him some Hints, how
               unkindly she took it, which he but little regarded, all his Thoughts were now bent on
               the gaining Melliora. But that Lady alarm’d at his late Behaviour, and with Reason,
               doubting her own Power of resenting it as she ought, or indeed resisting any future
               Attempts he might make, feign’d the necessity of performing some private Rules of
               Devotion, enjoyn’d her as a Pennance, and kept her Chamber that she might not see
               him.</p>
            <p>The Disquietudes of D’elmont for being forc’d to live, but for three or four Days
               without the happiness of beholding her, convinc’d him how impossible it was for him
               to overcome his Passion, tho’ he should never so vigorously endeavour it, and that
               whatever Method he shou’d make use of to satisfy it, might be excus’d by the
               Necessity.</p>
            <p>What is it that a Lover cannot accomplish when Resolution is on his Side? D’elmont
               after having formed a Thousand fruitless Inventions, at last pitch’d on One, which
               promis’d him an assurance of Success: In Melliora’s Chamber there was a little Door
               that open’d to a Pair of Back Stairs, for the Convenience of the Servants coming to
               clean the Room, and at the Bottom of that Descent, a Gate into the Garden. The <hi
                  rend="italic">Count</hi> set his Wits to work, to get the Keys of those two Doors;
               that of the Garden stood always in it, nor cou’d he keep it without its being miss’d
               at Night, when they shou’d come to fasten the Gate, therefore he carefully took the
               Impression in Wax, and had one made exactly like it: The other he cou’d by no means
               compass without making some excuse to go to Melliora’s Chamber, and she had desired
               that none might visit her: But he overcome this Bar to his Design at last; there was
               a Cabinet in it, where he told Alovisa he had put some Papers of great Concern, which
               now he wanted to look over, and desired she would make an Apology for his coming<pb n="87"/>
               in, to fetch them. Melliora imagin’d this was only a Pretence to see her, but his Wife
               being with him, and he saying nothing to her, or taking any further notice than what
               common Civility required, was not much troubled at it. While Alovisa was paying a
               Complement to the Recluse, he was dext’rous enough to slip the Key out of the Door,
               unperceiv’d by either of them.</p>
            <p>As soon as he had got the Passport to his expected Joys in his Possession, he order’d
               a couple of Saddle Horses to be made ready, and only attended by one Servant, rid
               out, as if to take the Air; but when they were got about two or three Miles from his
               House, Commanded him to return and tell his Lady, that he should lye that Night at
               the <hi rend="italic">Baron</hi>D’espernay’s, the Fellow obey’d, and clapping Spurs
               to his Horse, was immediately lost in a Cloud of Dust.</p>
            <p>D’elmont had sent this Message to prevent any of the Family sitting up expecting him,
               and instead of going to the <hi rend="italic">Barons</hi>, turn’d short, and went to
                  <hi rend="italic">Angerville</hi>, where meeting with some Gentlemen of his
               Acquaintance, he pass’d the Hours ’till between Twelve and One, as pleasantly as his
               Impatience to be with Melliora would give him leave: He had not much above a Furlong
               to ride, and his Desires made him not spare his Horse, which he ty’d by the Bridle,
               hot and foaming as he was, to a huge Oak, which grew pretty near his Garden; it was
               incompass’d only with a Hedge, and that so low, that he got over it without any
               Difficulty; he look’d carefully about him, and found no Tell-tale Lights in any of
               the Rooms, and concluding all was as hush’d as he cou’d wish, open’d the first Door,
               but the encreasing Transports of his Soul, as he came up Stairs, to be so near the
               end of all his Wishes, are more easily imagin’d than express’d; but as violent as
               they were, they presently receiv’d a vast Addition, when he came into the happy
               Chamber, and by a most delightfull<pb n="88"/> Gloom, a Friend to Lovers, (for it was
               neither Dark nor Light), he beheld the lovely Melliora in her Bed, and fast asleep,
               her Head was reclin’d on one of her Arms; a Pillow softer and whiter far than that it
               lean’d on, the other was stretch’d out, and with its extension had thrust down the
               Bed-cloths so far, that all the Beauties of her Neck and Breast appear’d to View. He
               took an inexpressible Pleasure in gazing on her as she lay, and in this silent
               Contemplation of her thousand Charms, his Mind was agitated with various Emotions,
               and the resistless Posture he beheld her in, rouz’d all that was honourable in him,
               he thought it Pity even to wake her, but more to wrong such Innocence; and he was
               sometimes prompted to return and leave her as he found her.</p>
            <p>But whatever Dominion, Honour and Virtue may have over our waking Thoughts, ’tis
               certain that they fly from the clos’d Eyes, our Passions then exert their forceful
               Power, and that which is most Predominant in the Soul, agitates the Fancy, and brings
               even Things impossible to pass: Desire, with watchful Diligence repell’d, returns
               with greater Violence in unguarded Sleep, and overthrows the vain Efforts of
               Day. Melliora in spite of her self, was often happy in Idea, and possess’d a Blessing
               which Shame and Guilt deter’d her from in reality. Imagination at this Time was
               active, and brought the charming Count much nearer than indeed he was, and he,
               stooping to the Bed, and gently laying his Face close to hers, (possibly designing no
               more than to steal a Kiss from her, unperceiv’d) that Action concurring at that
               Instant with her Dream, made her throw her Arm (still slumbering) about his Neck, and
               in a soft and languishing Voice, cry out, O! D’elmont, cease, cease to Charm, to such
               a height----Life cannot bear these Raptures!---And then again Embracing him yet
               closer,---O! too, too lovely <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>---Extatick Ruiner!</p>
            <p><pb n="89"/></p>
            <p>Where was now the Resolution he was forming some Moments before? If he had now left
               her, some might have applauded an Honour so uncommon, but more wou’d have condemn’d
               his Stupidity, for I believe there are very few Men, how Stoical soever they pretend
               to be, that in such a tempting Circumstance would not have lost all Thoughts, but
               those, which the present Opportunity inspir’d. That he did, is most certain, for he
               tore open his Wastecoat, and joyn’d his panting Breast to hers, with such a
               tumultuous Eagerness! Seiz’d her with such a rapidity of transported Hope-crown’d
               Passion, as immediately wak’d her from an imaginary Felicity, to the Approaches of a
               solid one. Where have I been (said she, just opening her Eyes) where am I?---(And
               then coming more perfectly to her self) Heaven! What’s this?--I am D’elmont (cry’d the
               o’erjoy’d <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>) the happy D’elmont! Melliora’s, the
               charming Melliora’s D’elmont! Oh, all ye Saints, (resum’d the surpriz’d, trembling
               Fair) ye ministring Angels! Whose Business it is to guard the Innocent! Protect and
               shield my Virtue! O! say, how came you here, my Lord? Love, said he, Love that does
               all, that Wonder-working Power has sent me here, to charm thee, sweet Resister, into
               yielding. O! hold, (cry’d she, finding he was proceeding to Liberties, which her
               Modesty could not allow of) forbear, I do conjure you, even by that Love you plead,
               before my Honour I’ll resign my Life! Therefore, unless you wish to see me dead, a
               Victim to your cruel, fatal Passion, I beg you to desist, and leave me:---I
               cannot---must not (answer’d he, growing still more bold) what, when I have thee thus!
               Thus naked in my Arms, trembling, defenceless, yielding, panting with equal Wishes,
               thy Love confess’d, and every Thought, Desire! What could’st thou think if I should
               leave thee? How justly would’st thou scorn my easy Tameness; my Dulness, unworthy the
               Name of Lover, or even of Man!--Come, come, no more<pb n="90"/> Reluctance (continued he,
               gathering Kisses from her soft Snowy Breast at every Word) Damp not the Fires thou
               hast rais’d with seeming Coyness! I know thou art mine! All mine! And thus I--yet
               think (said she, interrupting him, and struggling in his Arms) think what ’tis that
               you wou’d do; nor, for a Moment’s Joy, hazard your Peace for ever. By Heaven, cry’d
               he, I will this Night be Master of my Wishes, no matter what to Morrow may bring
               forth: As soon as he had spoke these Words, he put it out of her Power either to deny
               or reproach him, by stopping her Mouth with Kisses, and was just on the Point of
               making good what he had vow’d, when a loud knocking at the Chamber Door, put a stop
               to his beginning Extacy, and chang’d the sweet Confusion Melliora had been in, to
               all the Horrors, of a Shame and Guilt-distracted Apprehension: They made no Doubt but
               that it was Alovisa, and that they were betray’d; the <hi rend="italic">Count’s</hi>
               greatest Concern was for Melliora, and the Knocking still continuing louder, all he
               cou’d do in this Exigence, was to make his Escape the Way he came: There was no time
               for taking leave, and he could only say, perceiving she was ready to faint with her
               Fears-----Be comforted my Angel, and resolute in your Denials, to whatever Questions
               the natural Insolence of a Jealous Wife may provoke mine to ask you; and we shall
               meet again (if D’elmont survives this Disappointment) without Danger, of so quick, so
               curst a Separation. Melliora was in too much Distraction to make any Answer to what he
               said, and he had left the Room some Moments, before she cou’d get Spirit enough to
               ask who was at the Door? But when she did, was as much surpriz’d to find it was
               >Melantha, who desir’d to be let in, as before she was frighted at the Belief it
               was Alovisa, however, she immediately slipt on her Night-Gown and Slippers, and open’d
               the Door.</p>
            <p>You are a sound Sleeper indeed (Cry’dMelantha laughing) that all the Noise I have
               made cou’d not<pb n="91"/> wake you. I have not been all this time asleep (answer’d
               Melliora) but not knowing you were in the House, cou’d not imagine who it was that
               gave me this Disturbance. I heartily ask your Pardon (said >Melantha) and I know, my
               Dear, you are too good Natur’d to refuse it me, especially when you know the
               Occasion, which is so very Whimsical, that as grave as you are, you cannot help being
               diverted with it----But come (continu’d she) get on your Cloaths, for you must go
               along with me. Where, said Melliora, Nay, nay, ask no Questions (resum’d >Melantha)
               but make haste, every Minute that we Idle away here, loses us the Diversion of an
               Age. As she spoke these Words, she fell into such an excessive Laughter, that Melliora
               thought her Mad, but being far from Sympathizing in her Gaiety; it has always (said
               she) been hitherto my Custom to have some Reason for what I do, tho’ in never so
               trifling an Affair, and you must excuse me, if I do not break it now. Pish
               (cry’dMelantha) you are of the oddest Temper,----but I will give you your Way for
               once,-----provided you’ll get your self ready in the mean time. I shall certainly put
               on my Cloaths (said Melliora) lest I should take cold, for I expect you’ll not permit
               me to sleep any more this Night. You may be sure of it (rejoyn’dMelantha.) But to the
               Purpose,-----You must know, having an Hour or two on my hands, I came this Evening to
               visit Alovysa, and found her in the strangest Humour!----Good God! What unaccountable
               Creatures these married Women are?----her Husband it seems had sent her Word that he
               wou’d lye at my Brothers, and the poor loving Soul cou’d not bear to live a Night
               without him. I stay’d to condole with her, (tho’ on my Life, I cou’d scarce forbear
               Laughing in her Face) ’till it was too late to go Home.----About twelve a Clock she
               yawn’d, stretch’d, and grew most horridly out of Temper; rail’d at Mankind
               prodigiously, and curs’d Matrimony as heartily as one of Fourscore cou’d do, that had
               been twice a Widow, and was left a Maid!----With much<pb n="92"/> ado, I made her Women
               thrust her into Bed, and retired to a Chamber which they shew’d me, but I had no
               Inclination to sleep, I remember’d my self of five or six <hi rend="italic"
                  >Billet-Doux</hi> I had to answer,----a Lover, that growing foolishly troublesome,
               I have some thoughts of discharging to Morrow----Another that I design to
               Countenance, to pique a third----a new Suit of Cloaths, and Trimmings for the next
               Ball----Half a hundred new Songs---and---a thousand other Affairs of the utmost
               Consequence to a young Lady, came into my Head in a Moment; and the Night being
               extreamly pleasant, I set the Candle in the Chimney, open’d the Window, and fell to
               considering---But I had not been able to come to a conclusion what I should do in any
               one thing I was thinking of, before I was interrupted in my Cogitations, with a noise
               of something rushing hastily thro’ the Myrtles under my Window, and presently after,
               saw it was a Man going hastily along toward the great Alley of the Garden.----At
               first I was going to cry out and Alarm the Family, taking it for a Thief; But,
               Dear Melliora, how glad am I that I did not?----For who do you think, when I look’d
               more heedfully, I perceiv’d it was? Nay, how should I know? (cry’d Melliora peevishly,
               fearing the <hi rend="italic">Count’s</hi> Inadvertency had expos’d himself and her
               to this foolish Woman’s Curiosity) It was <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>D’elmont
               (resum’dMelantha) I’ll lay my Life, that he has been on some Intreague to Night: And
               met with a Disappointment in it, by his quick Return.---But prithee make hast, for I
               long to rally him about it. What wou’d you do Madam? (said Melliora) you wou’d not
               sure go to him? Yes, (answer’dMelantha): I will go down into the Garden, and so shall
               you.---I know you have a back Way from your Chamber---Therefore lay aside this
               unbecoming Demureness, and let us go, and talk him to Death. You may do as you
               please, (said Melliora) but for my part, I am for no such Frolicks. Was ever any thing
               so young, so Formal as you are! (Rejoyn’dMelantha) but I am resolv’d to Teaze<pb n="93"/>
               you out of a humour so directly opposite to the <hi rend="italic">Beau-Monde</hi>,
               and, if you will not Consent to go down with me: I will fetch him up to your
               Chamber----Hold! Hold, (cry’d Melliora perceiving she was going) what do you mean, for
               Heavens sake stay, what will Alovysa think?---I care not, reply’d the other; I have
               set my Heart on an hours Diversion with him and will not be baulk’d, if the repose of
               the World, much less, that of a Jealous, silly Wife, depended on it.</p>
            <p>Melliora saw into the Temper of this Capricious young Lady too well not to believe
               she wou’d do, as she had said, and perhaps, was not over willing to venture her with
               the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> alone, at that Time of Night, and in the Humour she
               knew he was, therefore putting on an Air more chearful than that she was Accustom’d
               to wear, well (said she) I will Accompany you into the Garden, since it will so much
               oblige you; but if the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> be wise, he will, by quitting the
               Place, as soon as he sees us, disappoint you worse than I shou’d have done, if I had
               kept you here. With these Words she took her by the Hand, and they went down the
               Stairs, where the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> was but just past before them.</p>
            <p>He had not Power to go away, without knowing who it was, that had given him that
               Interruption, and had stood all this Time, on the upper Step behind the inner Door.
               His Vexation, and Disdain when he heard it wasMelantha gave him as much Pain, as his
               Concern while he believ’d it Alovysa, and he cou’d not forbear muttering a thousand
               Curses on her Impertinence. He always despis’d, but now abhor’d her: She had behav’d
               her self to him in a Fashion, as made him sufficiently Sensible she was desirous of
               engaging him, and he resolv’d to Mortifie by the bitterest Slights, both her Pride,
               and Love, if ’tis proper, to call that sort of liking which Agitates the Soul of <hi
                  rend="italic">Coquet</hi>, by that Name.</p>
            <p><pb n="94"/></p>
            <p>The Ladies walk’d in the Garden for some time, andMelantha search’d every Bush,
               before she found the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> who stood Conceal’d in the Porch,
               which being cover’d with <hi rend="italic">Jessamin</hi>, and <hi rend="italic"
                  >Fillaree</hi>, was Dark enough to hide him from their View, tho’ they had pass’d
               close to him as they came out. He had certainly remain’d there ’till Morning, and
               disappointed >Melantha’s search in part of the Revenge he ow’d her, if his Desires to
               be with Melliora, on any Terms, had not prevail’d, even above his Anger to the other.
               But he cou’d not see that Charmer of his Soul, and imagine there might be yet an
               opportunity that Night of stealing a Kiss from her (now he believ’d resistless Lips)
               of Touching her Hand! Her Breast! And repeating some farther Freedoms which his late
               Advantage over her had given him, without being fill’d with Wishes too Fiery and too
               Impatient to be restrain’d. He watch’d their turning, and when he saw that they were
               near an Ally which had another that led to it, he went round and met them.</p>
            <p>Melantha was overjoy’d at sight of him, and Melliora, tho’ equally pleas’d, was
               Cover’d with such a Confusion, at the Remembrance of what had pass’d, that it was
               happy for her that her Companion’s Volubility gave her no room for Speech. There is
               nothing more certain, than that Love, tho’ it fills the mind with a thousand charming
               Ideas, which those untouch’d by that Passion, are not capable of conceiving, yet it
               entirely takes away the Power of Utterance, and the deeper Impression it had made on
               the Soul, the less we are able to express it, when willing to indulge and give a
               loose to Thought; what Language can furnish us with Words sufficient, all are too
               poor, all wanting both in Sublimity, and Softness, and only Fancy! A lovers Fancy!
               can reach the Exalted soaring of a Lovers Meaning! But, if so impossible to be
               Describ’d, if of so Vast, so Wonderful a Nature as nothing but it’s self can
               Comprehend,<pb n="95"/> how much more impossible must it be, entirely to conceal it! What
               Strength of boasted Reasons? What Force of Resolution? What modest Fears, or cunning
               Artifice can correct the Fierceness of its fiery Flashes in the Eyes, keep down the
               struggling Sighs, command the Pulse, and bid trembling cease? Honour and Virtue may
               distance Bodies, but there is no Power in either of those Names, to stop the Spring,
               that with a rapid Whirl transports us from our selves, and darts our Souls into the
               Bosom of the darling Object. This may seem strange to many, even of those who call,
               and perhaps believe that they are Lovers, but the few who have Delicacy enough to
               feel what I but imperfectly attempt to speak, will acknowledge it for Truth, and pity
               the Distress of Melliora.</p>
            <p>As they were passing thro’ a Walk of Trees on each Side, whose intermingling Boughs
               made a friendly Darkness, and every thing Undistinguishable, the Amorous D’elmont
               throwing his eager Arms round the Waist of his (no less transported) Melliora, and
               Printing burning Kisses on her Neck, reap’d painful Pleasure, and created in her a
               racking kind of Extasie, which might perhaps, had they been now alone, prov’d her
               Desires were little different from his.</p>
            <p>After Melantha had vented part of the Raillery, she was so big with, on the <hi
                  rend="italic">Count</hi>, which he but little regarded, being wholly taken up with
               other Thoughts, she propos’d, going into the Wilderness, which was at the farther end
               of the Garden, and they readily agreeing to it. Come, my Lord, (said she) to the <hi
                  rend="italic">Count</hi>, you are Melancholly, I have thought of a way which will
               either indulge the Humour you are in, or divert it, as you shall chuse: There are
               several little Paths in this Wilderness, let us take each a separate one, and when we
               meet, which shall be here, where we part, agree to tell an entertaining Story, which,
               whoever fails in, shall be<pb n="96"/> doom’d to the Punishment of being left here all
               Night: The <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> at these Words, forgot all his Animosity, and
               was ready to hug her for this Proposal. Melliora did a little oppose it; but the
               others were too Powerful, and she was forc’d to submit: Thou art the dullest
               Creature, I’ll lay my Life, (my Lord, cry’dMelantha, taking hold of the Count in a
               gay manner) that it falls to her Lot to stay in the Wilderness. Oh Madam, (reply’d
               the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>) you are too severe, we ought always to suspend our
               Judgment ’till after the Tryal, which I confess my self so pleas’d with, that I am
               Impatient for its coming on: Well then, (said she, laughing) farewel for half an
               Hour. Agreed (cry’d the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>) and walk’d away:Melantha saw
               which way he went, and took another Path, leaving Melliora to go forward in that, in
               which they were, but I believe the Reader will easily imagine that she was not long
               to enjoy the Priviledge of her Meditations.</p>
            <p>After the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> had gone some few Paces, he planted himself
               behind a Thicket, which, while it hid him, gave the Opportunity of observing them,
               and when he found the Coast clear, rush’d out, and with unhurting Gripe, seiz’d once
               more on the unguarded Prey. Blest turn of Fortune, (said he in a Rapture,) Happy,
               happy Moment!---Lost, lost Melliora, (said she) most unhappy Maid!---Oh why, my Lord,
               this quick Return? This is no Place to answer thee, (resum’d he, taking her in his
               Arms, and bearing her behind that Thicket, where he himself had stood) ’twas in vain
               for her to resist, if she had had the Power over her Inclinations, ’till he, sitting
               her softly down, and beginning to Caress her in the manner he had done when she was
               in Bed, she assum’d Strength enough to raise her self a little, and catching hold of
               his Transgressing Hands, laid her Face on them, and Bath’d them in a shower of Tears:
               O! D’elmont (said she) Cruel D’elmont! Will you then take Advantage of my Weakness? I
               confess I<pb n="97"/> feel for you, a Passion, far beyond all, that yet, ever bore the Name
               of Love, and that I can no longer withstand the too powerful Magick of your Eyes, nor
               deny any Thing that charming Tongue can ask; but now’s the Time to prove your self
               the Heroe! subdue your self, as you have Conquer’d me! be satisfied with Vanquishing
               my Soul, fix there your Throne, but leave my Honour free! Life of my Life (cry’d he)
               wound me no more by such untimely Sorrows: I cannot bear thy Tears, by Heaven they
               sink into my Soul, and quite unman me, but tell me (continu’d he tenderly Kissing
               her) coud’st thou, with all this Love, this charming----something more than
               softness-----cou’dst thou I say, consent to see me Pale and Dead, stretch’d at thy
               Feet, consum’d with inward Burnings, rather than blest, than rais’d by Love, and
               thee, to all a Deity in thy Embraces? For O! Believe me when I swear, that ’tis
               impossible to live without thee. No more, no more (said she letting her Head fall
               gently on his Breast) too easily I guess thy sufferings by my own. But yet, D’elmont
               ’tis better to die in Innocence, than to live in Guilt. O! Why (Resum’d he, sighing
               as if his Heart wou’d burst) shou’d what we can’t avoid, be call’d a Crime? Be
               Witness for me Heaven! How much I have struggl’d with this rising Passion, even to
               Madness struggl’d!---but in vain, the mounting Flame blazes the more, the more I
               wou’d suppress it---my very Soul’s on Fire---I cannot bear it---Oh Melliora! Didst
               thou but know the thousandth Part, of what this Moment I endure, the strong
               Convulsions of my warring Thoughts, thy Heart steel’d as it is, and Frosted round
               with Virtue, wou’d burst it’s icy Shield, and melt in Tears of Blood, to pity me.
               Unkind and Cruel! (answer’d she) do I not partake them then?----Do I not bear, at
               least, an equal share in all your Agonies? Have---you no Charms---or have not I a
               Heart?---A most susceptible and tender Heart?----Yes, you may feel it Throb, it beats
               against my Breast, like an Imprison’d Bird, and fain wou’d burst it’s Cage! to fly to
               you, the aim of all it’s Wishes!--Oh D’elmont!--With<pb n="98"/> these Words she sunk wholly
               into his Arms unable to speak more: Nor was he less dissolv’d in Rapture, both their
               Souls seem’d to take Wing together, and left their Bodies Motionless, as unworthy to
               bear a part in their more elevated Bliss.</p>
            <p>But D’elmont at his returning Sense, repenting the Effects of the violent Transport,
               he had been in was now, preparing to take from the resistless Melliora, the last, and
               only remaining Proof that she was all his own, whenMelantha (who had contriv’d this
               separation only with a Design to be alone with the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>, and
               had carefully observ’d which way he took) was coming towards them. The rustling of
               her Cloaths among the Bushes, gave the disappointed Couple leave to rise from the
               Posture they were in, and Melliora to abscond behind a Tree, before she could come
               near enough to discern who was there.</p>
            <p>Melantha, as soon as she saw the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>, put on an Air, of
               Surprize, as if it were but by Chance, that she was come into his walk, and Laughing
               with a visible Affectation, bless me! You here, my Lord! (said she) I vow this has
               the look of Assignation, but I hope you will not be so vain as to believe I came on
               purpose to seek you. No Madam (answer’d he coldly) I have not the least Thought of
               being so happy. Lord! You are strangely grave (Rejoyn’d she) but suppose I really had
               come with a Design to meet you, what kind of Reception might I have expected? I know
               no Reason Madam (said he) that can oblige me to entertain a Supposition so unlikely.
               Well then (resum’d she) I’ll put it past a Supposition, and tell you plainly, that I
               did walk this way on purpose to divert your Spleen. I am sorry (reply’d he, tir’d to
               Death with her Impertinence) that you are disappointed; for I am not in a Humour at
               present, of receiving any Diversion. Fie (said she) is this an answer for the gay,
               Gallant, engaging <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> D’elmont, to give a Lady who makes a
               Declaration of admiring him----who thinks it not<pb n="99"/> too much to make the first
               Advances, and who wou’d believe her self fully recompenc’d for breaking thro’ the
               nice Decorums of her Sex, if he receiv’d it kindly---Madam (said he, not a little
               amaz’d at her Imprudence) I know of no such Person, or if I did, I must confess,
               shou’d be very much puzled how to behave in an Adventure so uncommon: Pish (answer’d
               she, growing vext at his coldness) I know that such Adventures are not uncommon with
               you: I’m not to learn the Story of Alovysa, and if you had not been first Address’d,
               perhaps might have been ’till now unmarried. Well Madam (said he, more out of humour)
               put the Case that what you say were true, I am married; and therefore, (interrupted
               she) you ought to be better acquainted with the Temper of our Sex, and know, that a
               Woman, where she says she Loves, expects a thousand fine things in Return. But there
               is more than a possibility (answer’d he) of her being disappointed, and methinks
               Madam, a Lady of your Gaity shou’d be conversant enough with Poetry, to remember
               those too Lines of a famous English Poet.</p>

            </lg>
            <p>Melantha was fretted to the Heart to find him so insensible, but not being one of
               those who are apt to repent any thing they have done, she only pretended to fall into
               a violent fit of Laughter, and when she came out of it, I confess (said she) that I
               have lost my Aim, which was, to make you believe I was dying for Love of you, raise
               you to the highest Degree of Expectation, and then have the pleasure of baulking you
               at once, by letting you know the jest.----But your Lordship is too hard for me, even
               at my own Weapon, ridicule! I am mightly obliged to you Madam (answer’d he, more
               briskly than before) for your Intention, however; but ’tis probable, if I cou’d have
               been drawn into a Belief that you were in earnest, I might, at such a Time, and such
               a Place as this, have<pb n="100"/> taken some Measures which wou’d have sufficiently reveng’d
               me on you----but come Madam, (continu’d he) the Morning begins to break, if you
               please we will find out Melliora, and go into the House: As he spoke these Words, they
               perceiv’d her coming towards them, who had only taken a little round to meet ’em, and
               they all three made what hast they cou’d in: <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> D’elmont
               asked a formal leave of Melliora to go thro’ her Chamber, none of the Servants being
               yet stirring, to let him into the House any other way, which being granted, he cou’d
               not help sighing as he passed by the Bed, where he had been lately so cruelly
               disappointed, but had no opportunity to speak his Thoughts at that time
               to Melliora.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> rung for his Gentleman to rise to undress him, and
               order’d him to send somebody to take care of his Horse, and went to Bed, Alovysa was
               very much surpriz’d at his return from the <hi rend="italic">Baron</hi>’s at so
               unseasonable an Hour, but much more so, when in the Morning,Melantha came laughing
               into the Chamber, and told her, all that she knew of the Adventure of the Night
               before; her old fit of Jealousie now resum’d it’s Dominion in her Soul, she cou’d not
               forbear thinking, that there was something more in it, thanMelantha had discover’d:
               And presently imagin’d that her Husband stay’d not at the <hi rend="italic"
                  >Baron</hi>’s, because she was abroad; but she was more confirm’d in this Opinion,
               whenMelantha calling for her Coach to go home; the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> told
               her that he wou’d accompany her thither, having urgent Business with her Brother.
               ’Tis almost impossible to guess the rage Alovysa was in, but she dissembled it ’till
               they were gone, then going to Melliora’s Chamber, she vented part of it there, and
               began to question her about their Behaviour in the Wilderness. Tho’ Melliora was glad
               to find, since she was jealous, that she was jealous of any Body rather than her
               self, yet she said all that she cou’d, to perswade her, that she had no Reason to be
               uneasie.</p>
            <p><pb n="101"/></p>
            <p>But Alovysa was always of too fiery a Nature to listen patiently to any thing that
               cou’d be offer’d, to alter the Opinion she had taken up, tho’ it were with never so
               little an appearance of Reason, but much more now, when she thought her self, in a
               manner Confirm’d: Forbear (said she) Dear Melliora to take the part of perfidy: I know
               he hates me, I read it in his Eyes, and feel it on his Lips, all Day he shuns my
               Converse, and at night, colder than Ice, receives my warm Embraces, and when, (oh
               that I cou’d tear the tender folly from me Heart) with Words as soft as Love can
               Form, I urge him to disclose the Cause of his Disquiet, he answers but in sighs, and
               turns away: Perhaps (reply’d Melliora) his Temper naturally is gloomy, and love it
               self, has scarce the Power to alter Nature. Oh no, (Interrupted Alovysa) far from it:
               Had I ne’er known him otherwise, I cou’d forgive what now I know, but he was once as
               kind as tender Mothers to their new born Babes, and fond as the first Wishes of
               desiring Youth: Oh! With what eagerness has he approach’d me, when absent but an
               Hour!---Hadst thou ’ere seen him in those Days of Joy, even, thou, cold Cloyster’d
               Maid, must have ador’d him What Majesty, then sat upon his Brow?-----What Matchless
               Glories shone around him!----Miriads of <hi rend="italic">Cupids</hi>, shot
               resistless Darts in every Glance,---his Voice when softned in amorous Accents,
               boasted more Musick, than the Poet <hi rend="italic">Orpheus!</hi> When e’re he
               spoke, methought the Air seem’d Charm’d, the Winds forgot to blow, all Nature
               listn’d, and like Alovisa melted into Transport----but he is chang’d in all----the
               Heroe, and the Lover are Extinct, and all that’s left, of the once gay D’elmont, is a
               dull senceless Picture: Melliora was too sensibly Touch’d with this Discourse, to be
               able presently to make any Answer to it, and she cou’d not forbear accompanying her
               in Tears, while Alovysa renew’d her Complaints in this manner; his Heart (said she)
               his Heart is lost, for ever Ravish’d from me, that Bosom where I had Treasur’d all my
               Joys, my Hopes, my<pb n="102"/> Wishes, now burns and pants, with longings for a rival Curst!
               Curst,Melantha, by Heaven they are even impudent in Guilt, they Toy, they Kiss, and
               make Assignations before my Face, and this Tyrant Husband braves me with his
               falsehood, and thinks to awe me into Calmness, but, if I endure it---No (continu’d
               she stamping, and walking about the Room in a disorder’d Motion) I’ll be no longer
               the tame easie wretch I have been---all <hi rend="italic">France</hi> shall Eccho
               with my Wrongs---The ungrateful Monster!---Villain, whose well nigh wasted Stream of
               Wealth had dry’d, but for my kind of supply, shall he enslave me!--Oh Melliora shun
               the Marriage Bed, as thou woud’st a Serpents Den, more Ruinous, more Poysonous far,
               is Man.</p>
            <p>’Twas in vain that Melliora endeavour’d to pacifie her, she continu’d in this Humour
               all Day, and in the Evening receiv’d a considerable Addition to her former Disquiet:
               The <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> sent a Servant of the <hi rend="italic">Barons</hi>
               (having not taken any of his own with him) to acquaint her, that he shou’d not be at
               home that Night. ’Tis well (said she ready to burst with Rage) let the <hi
                  rend="italic">Count</hi> know that I can change as well as he, and shall excuse
               his Absence tho’ it lasts to all Eternity, (go continu’d she, seeing him surpriz’d)
               deliver this Message, and withal, assure him, that what I say, I mean. She had scarce
               made an end of these Words, when she flung out of the Room, unable to utter more, and
               lock’d her self into her Chamber, leaving Melliora no less distracted, tho’ for
               different Reasons, to retire to her’s.</p>
            <p>She had not ’till now, had a moments Time for reflection since her Adventure in the
               Wilderness, and the Remembrance of it, joyn’d with the Despair, and Grief of Alovisa,
               which she knew her self the sole occasion of, threw her into most terrible Agonies.
               She was ready to die with shame, when she consider’d how much the secret of her Soul
               was laid open to him, who of all the World she ought most to have conceal’d it from,
               and with remorse, for<pb n="103"/> the Miseries her fatal Beauty was like to bring on a
               Family for whom she had the greatest Friendship.</p>
            <p>But these Thoughts soon gave way to another, equally as shocking, she was present
               when the Servant brought Word the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> wou’d lie abroad, and
               had all the Reason imaginable to believe that Message was only a feint, that he might
               have an opportunity to come unobserv’d to her Chamber, as he had done the Night
               before. She cou’d not presently guess by what means he had got in, and therefore was
               at a loss how to prevent him, ’till recollecting all the Circumstances of that tender
               interview, she remembred that whenMelantha had surpriz’d them, he made his escape by
               the back Stairs into the Garden, and that when they went down, the Door was lock’d:
               Therefore concluded it must be by a Key, that he had gain’d admittance: And began to
               set her Invention to Work, how to keep this dangerous Enemy to her Honour, from
               coming in a second Time. She had no Keys that were large enough to fill the Wards,
               and if she had put one in, on the inside, it wou’d have fallen out immediately on the
               least touch, but at last, after trying several ways, she tore her Handkerchief into
               small pieces, and thrust it into the hole with her Busk, so hard, that it was
               impossible for any Key to enter.</p>
            <p>Melliora thought she had done a very Heroick Action, and sate her self down on the
               Bed-side in a pleas’d Contemplation of the Conquest, she believ’d her Virtue had
               gain’d over her Passion: But alas, How little did she know the true State of her own
               Heart? She no sooner heard a little noise at the Door, as presently after she did,
               but she thought it was the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>, and began to tremble not
               with fear, but desire.</p>
            <p>It was indeed <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> D’elmont, who had borrow’d Horses and a
               Servant of the <hi rend="italic">Baron</hi>, and got into the Garden as before, but
               with a much greater Assurance now of making himself entirely happy in<pb n="104"/> the
               Gratification of his utmost Wishes. But ’tis impossible to represent the greatness of
               his vexation and surprize, when all his Efforts to open the Door, were in vain: He
               found something had been done to the Lock, but cou’d not discover what, nor by any
               means remove the obstacle which Melliora had put there. She, on the other hand, was in
               all the confusion imaginable: Sometimes prompted by the violence of her Passion, she
               wou’d run to the Door, resolving to open it; and then, frighted with the apprehension
               of what wou’d be the Consequence, as hastily fly from it: If he had stay’d much
               longer, ’tis possible love wou’d have got the better of all other Considerations, but
               a light appearing on the other side of the Garden, oblig’d the thrice disappointed
               Lover, to quit his Post. He had sent away the Horses by the Servant who came with
               him, and had no opportunity of going to the <hi rend="italic">Barons</hi> that Night,
               so came to his own Fore-gate, and thunder’d with a force, suitable to the fury he was
               possest with; it was presently open’d, most of the Family being up. Alovisa had rav’d
               her self into Fits, and her disorder created full Employment for the Servants, who
               busily running about the House with Candles fetching things for her, occasion’d that
               reflection which he had seen.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> was told of his Lady’s Indisposition, but he thought
               he had sufficient pretence not to come where she was, after the Message she had sent
               him by the <hi rend="italic">Baron</hi>’s Servant, and order’d a Bed to be made ready
               for him in another Chamber.</p>
            <p>Alovisa soon heard he was come in, and it was with much ado, that her Women prevail’d
               on her not to rise and go to him that moment, so little did she remember what she had
               said. She pass’d the Night in most terrible Inquietudes, and early in the Morning
               went to his Chamber, but finding it shut, she was oblig’d to wait, tho’ with a World
               of impatience, ’till she heard he was stirring, which not being till towards<pb n="105"/>
               Noon, she spent all that Time in considering how she shou’d accost him.</p>
            <p>As soon as the Servant whom she had order’d to watch, brought her Word that his Lord
               was dressing, she went into the Room, there was no body with him but his Gentleman,
               and he withdrawing out of respect, imagining by both their Countenances, there might
               something be said, not proper for him to hear. I see (said she) my Presence is
               unwish’d, but I have learn’d from you to scorn Constraint, and as you openly avow
               your falshood, I shall my Indignation, and my just Disdain! Madam (answer’d he
               suddenly) if you have any thing to reproach me with, you cou’d not have chose a more
               unlucky Time for it, than this, nor was I ever less dispos’d to give you
               Satisfaction. No, barbarous cold Insulter! (resum’d she) I had not the least hope you
               wou’d, I find that I am grown so low in your Esteem, I am not worth pains of an
               Invention.----By Heaven, this damn’d indifference is worse than the most vile
               Abuse!---’Tis plain Contempt!----O that I cou’d resent it as I ought----then Sword,
               or Poison shou’d revenge me---why am I so Curst to Love you still?---O that those
               Fiends (continu’d she, bursting into Tears) that have deform’d thy Soul, wou’d change
               thy Person too, turn every Charm to horrid Blackness, grim as thy Cruelty, and foul
               as thy Ingratitude, to free that Heart, thy Perjury has ruin’d. I thought Madam (said
               he, with an Accent maliciously Ironical) that you had thrown off, even the
               appearances of Love for me, by the Message you sent me Yesterday---O thou Tormenter
               (interrupted she) hast thou not wrong’d me in the tenderest Point, driven me to the
               last Degree of Misery! To Madness!---To Despair? And dost thou----can’st thou
               Reproach me for complaining?---Your coldness; your unkindness stung me to the Soul,
               and then I said, I know not what---but I remember well, that I wou’d have seem’d
               careless, and indifferent like you. You need not (reply’d he) give your self the
               trouble of an Apology,<pb n="106"/> I have no design to make a quarrel of it: And wish, for
               both our Peace, you cou’d as easily moderate your Passions, as I can mine, and that
               you may the better do so, I leave you to reflect on what I have said, and the little
               Reason I have ever given you for such intemperance. He left the Chamber with these
               Words, which instead of quelling, more enflam’d Alovysa’s Rage. She threw her self
               down into an Elbow Chair that stood there, and gave a loose to the Tempest of her
               Soul, Sometimes she curst, and vow’d the bitterest Revenge: Sometimes she wept, and
               at others, was resolv’d to fly to Death, the only Remedy for neglected Love: In the
               midst of these confus’d Meditations, casting her Eye on a Table by her, she saw
               Paper, and something written on it, which hastily taking up, found it the <hi
                  rend="italic">Count</hi>’s Character, and read (to her inexpressible Torment)
               these Lines.</p>

            <p>There was no more written, but there needed no more to make Alovysa, before half
               distracted, now quite so. She was now convinc’d that she had a much more dangerous
               Rival thanMelantha, and her Curiosity who it might be, was not much less troublesome
               to her than other Passions.</p>
            <p>She was going to seek her Husband with this Testimony of his Infidelity in her Hand,
               when he, remembring he had left it there, was coming hastily back to fetch it. The
               Excess of Fury which she met him with, is hardly to be imagin’d, she upbraided him in
               such a Fashion as might be called reviling, and had so little regard to good Manners,
               or even decency in what she said, that it dissipated all the confusion he was in at
               first, to see so plain a Proof against him in her Hands, and rouz’d him to a rage not
               much Inferior to her’s. She endeavour’d (tho’ she took a wrong Method) to bring him
               to a Confession, he had done amiss; and he, to lay the Tempest of her Tongue, by
               storming louder, but neither succeeded in their wish: And he, stung with the
               bitterness of her Reproaches, and tired with Clamour, at last flung from her with a
               solemn Vow never to eat, or Sleep with her more.</p>
            <p>A Wife if equally haughty and jealous, if less fond than Alovysa will scarce be able
               to comprehend the greatness of her Sufferings: And it is not to be wonder’d at, that
               she, so violent in all her Passions, and agitated by so many, at once, committed a
               thousand Extravagancies, which those who know the force but of one, by the Aid of
               Reason, may avoid. She tore<pb n="108"/> down the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>’s Picture
               which hung in the Room, and stamp’d on it, then the Letter, her own Cloaths, and
               Hair, and whoever had seen her in that Posture, wou’d have thought she appear’d more
               like what the Furies are represented to be, than a Woman.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> when he took leave the Night before of the <hi
                  rend="italic">Baron</hi>D’espernay, had promis’d to return to him in the Morning,
               and give him an Account of his Adventure with Melliora, but the vexation of his
               disappointment, and quarrel with his Wife, having hindred him all this time, the <hi
                  rend="italic">Baron</hi> came to his House, impatient to know the Success of an
               Affair on which his own hopes depended. He was told by the Servants that their Lord
               was above, and running hastily without Ceremony, the first Person he saw was
               Alovisa, in the condition I have describ’d.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Baron</hi> had passionately lov’d this Lady from the first
               Moment he had seen her, but it was with that sort of Love, which considers more it’s
               own gratification, than the Interest, or quiet, of the object beloved. He imagin’d by
               the Wildness of Alovysa’s Countenance and Behaviour, that the <hi rend="italic"
                  >Count</hi> had given her some extraordinary occasion of distaste, and was so far
               from being troubled at the Sorrow he beheld her in, that he rejoyc’d in it, as the
               advancement of his Designs. But he wanted not cunning to disguise his Sentiments, and
               approaching her with a tender, and submissive Air, entreated her to tell him the
               Cause of her disorder. Alovysa had always consider’d him as a Person of worth, and
               one who was entitled to her Esteem by the vast respect he always paid her, and the
               Admiration, which in every opportunity, he exprest for her Wit and Beauty. She was
               not perhaps far from guessing the Extent of his Desires, by some Looks, and private
               Glances he had given her, and, notwithstanding her Passion, for the <hi rend="italic"
                  >Count</hi>, was too vain to be offended at it. On the contrary, it pleas’d her
               Pride, and confirm’d her in the good Opinion she<pb n="109"/> had of her self, to think a Man
               of his Sense shou’d be compell’d by the force of her irresistible Attractions to
               adore and to despair, and therefore made no Difficulty of disburthening all the
               anguish of her Soul, in the Bosom of this, as she believ’d, so faithful Friend.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Baron</hi> seem’d to receive this Declaration of her Wrongs,
               with all imaginable concern: And accus’d the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> of
               Stupidity in so little knowing the value of a Jewel he was Master of, and gave her
               some hints, that he was not unsensible who the Lady was, that had been the Cause of
               it, which Alovisa presently taking hold on, O speak her Name (said she) quick, let me
               know her, or own thy Friendship was but feign’d to undo me, and that thou hatest the
               wretched Alovisa. O far (resum’d he) far be such thoughts, first let me Die, to prove
               my Zeal---my Faith, sincere to you, who only next to Heaven, are worthy
               Adoration---but forgive me, if I say, in this, you must not be obey’d. O why, said
               she? Perhaps, (answer’d he) I am a trusted Person---A confident, and if I should
               reveal the secret of my Friend, I know, tho’ you approv’d the Treachery, you wou’d
               detest the Traytor. O! Never (rejoyn’d she impatiently) ’twou’d be a Service, more
               than the whole Study of my Life can pay----am I not Rack’d,----Stab’d---and Mangled
               in Idea, by some dark Hand shaded with Night and Ignorance? And shou’d I not be
               grateful for a friendly Clue to guide me from this Labyrinth of Doubt, to a full Day
               of Certainty, where all the fiend may stand expos’d before me, and I have Scope to
               Execute my Vengeance? Besides, (continu’d she, finding he was silent and seemingly
               extreamly mov’d at what she said) ’tis joyning in the Cause of Guilt to hide her from
               me----come, you must tell me---your Honour suffers else---both that, and pity, plead
               the Injur’d’s Cause. Alas (said he) Honour can ne’er consent to a Discovery of what,
               with solemn Vows I have promis’d to Conceal; but Oh!---There is something in my Soul,
               more Powerful, which<pb n="110"/> says, that Alovysa must not be deny’d. Why then (cry’d she)
               do you delay? Why keep me on the Rack, when one short Word wou’d ease me of my
               Torment? I have consider’d (answer’d he after a pause) Madam, you shall be satisfied,
               depend on it you shall, tho’ not this Moment, you shall have greater Proofs than
               Words can give you----Occular Demonstration shall strike denial Dumb. What mean you?
               Interrupted she; you shall behold (said he) the guilty pair, link’d in each others
               Arms. OhEspernay (rejoyn’d she) coud’st thou do that?---’Tis easie (answer’d he) as I
               can order Matters---but longer Conferrence may render me suspected---I’ll go seek the
                  <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>, for he must be my Engine to betray himself---In a
               Day or two, at farthest you shall enjoy all the Revenge Detection can bestow.</p>
            <p>Alovysa wou’d fain have perswaded him to have told her the Name of her Rival, in part
               of that full Conviction he had promis’d her, but in vain, and she was oblig’d to
               leave the Issue of this Affair entirely to his Management.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Baron</hi> was extreamly pleas’d with the Progress he had made,
               and did not doubt, but for the purchase of this secret he shou’d obtain every thing
               he desired of Alovysa. He found <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> D’elmont full of troubled
               and perplexed Thoughts, and when he had heard the History of his disappointment: I am
               sorry to hear (said he) that the foolish Girl does not know her own mind---but come
               (my Lord continued he, after a little pause) do not suffer your self to sink beneath
               a Caprice, which all those who converse much with that Sex must frequently meet
               with---I have a Contrivance in my Head, that cannot fail to render all her peevish
               Virtue frustrate: And make her happy in her own despite. OhEspernay! (reply’d the <hi
                  rend="italic">Count</hi>) thou talkest as Friendship prompts thee, I know thou
               wishest my Success, but alas! So many, and such unforeseen Accidents<pb n="111"/> have
               happen’d hitherto to prevent me, that I begin to think the Hand of Fate has set me
               down for lost. For shame my Lord (Interrupted the <hi rend="italic">Baron</hi>) be
               not so poor in Spirit----Once more I tell you that she shall be yours---a Day or two
               shall make her so---and because I know you Lovers are unbelieving, and impatient----I
               will Communicate the Means. A Ball, and Entertainment shall be provided at my House,
               to which, all the Neighbouring People of Condition shall be invited, amongst the
               number, your self, your Lady, and Melliora; it will be late before ’tis done, and I
               must perswade your Family, and some others who live farthest off, to Countenance the
               Design to stay all Night; all that you have to do, is to keep up your Resentment
               to Alovysa, that you may have a pretence to sleep from her: I shall take care to have
               Melliora plac’d where no Impediment may bar your Entrance. Impossible Suggestion!
               (cry’d D’elmont shaking his Head) Alovysa is in too much Rage of Temper to listen to
               such an Invitation, and without her, we must not hope for Melliora. How Industrious
               are you (resum’d the <hi rend="italic">Baron</hi>) to create difficulties where there
               is none: Tho’ I confess this may have, to you, a reasonable Appearance of one. But
               know, my Friendship builds it’s hopes to serve you on a sure Foundation---this
               jealous furious Wife, makes me the Confident of her imagin’d Injuries, Conjures me to
               use all my Interest with you for a reconcilement, and believes I am now pleading for
               her----I must for a while rail at your Ingratitude, and Condemn your want of Taste,
               to keep my Credit with her, and now and then sweeten her with a doubtful Hope that it
               may be possible at last to bring you to acknowledge, that you have been in an Error;
               this at once confirms her, that I am wholly on her side, and engages her to follow my
               Advice.</p>
            <p>Tho’ nothing Palls desire so much as too easie an Assurance of Means to gratifie it,
               yet a little hope is<pb n="112"/> absolutely necessary to preserve it. The fiery Wishes
               of D’elmont’s Soul, before chill’d by despair, and half supprest with clouding Griefs,
               blaz’d now, as fierce, and vigorous as ever, and he found so much probability in what
               the <hi rend="italic">Baron</hi> said, that he was ready to adore him for the
               Contrivance.</p>
            <p>Thus all Parties, but Melliora, remain’d in a sort of a pleas’d Expectation. TheCount
               doubted not of being happy, nor Alovisa of having her curiosity satisfy’d by the <hi
                  rend="italic">Baron’s</hi> Assistance, nor himself of the reward he design’d to
               demand of her for that good Service, and each long’d impatiently for the Day, or
               rather Night, which was to bring this great Affair to a Period. Poor Melliora was the
               only Person, who had no interval of Comfort. Restrain’d by Honour, and enflam’d by
               Love, her very Soul was torn: And when she found that Count D’elmont made no attempt
               to get into her Chamber again, as she imagin’d he wou’d, she fell into a Despair more
               terrible than all her former Inquietudes; she presently fancy’d that the
               disappointment he had met with the Night before, had driven the hopeless Passion from
               his Heart, and the Thoughts of being no longer beloved by him, were unsupportable.
               She saw him not all that Day, nor the next, the quarrel between him and Alovisa having
               caus’d separate Tables, she was oblig’d in Decency, to eat at that where she was, and
               had the Mortification of hearing her self Curs’d every Hour, by the enrag’d Wife, in
               the Name of her unknown Rival, without daring to speak a Word in her own
               Vindication.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the <hi rend="italic">Baron</hi> diligent to make good the Promises
               he had given the Count and Alovisa, for his own Ends, got every thing ready, and came
               himself to D’elmont’s House, to entreat their Company at his. Now Madam (said he)
               to Alovisa the time is come to prove your Servants Faith: This Night shall put an end
               to your uncertainty: They had no opportunity for further Speech; <pb n="113"/> Melliora came
               that Moment into the Room, who being ask’d to go to the Ball, and seeming a little
               unwilling to appear at any publick Diversion, by Reason of the late Death of her
               Father, put the <hi rend="italic">Baron</hi> in a Mortal Apprehension for the Success
               of his Undertaking: But Alovysa joyning in his Entreaties, she was at last prevail’d
               upon: TheCount went along with the <hi rend="italic">Baron</hi> in his Chariot: And
               the Ladies soon follow’d in an other.</p>
            <p>There was a vast deal of Company there, and the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> danc’d
               with several of the Ladies, and was extreamly gay amongst them: Alovysa watch’d his
               Behaviour, and regarded every one of them, in their Turn, with Jealousie, but was far
               from having the least Suspicion of her whom only she had Cause.</p>
            <p>Tho’ Melliora’s greatest Motive to go, was, because she might have the happiness of
               seeing her admir’d <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>; a Blessing, she had not enjoy’d
               these two Days, yet she took but little Satisfaction in that View, without an
               opportunity of being spoke to by him. But that uneasiness was remov’d, when the
               serious Dances being over, and they all joyning in a grand Ballet: He every now and
               then, got means to say a Thousand tender Things to her, press’d her Hand whenever he
               turn’d her, and wou’d sometimes, when at a distance from Alovisa, pretend to be out,
               on purpose to stand still, and talk to her. This kind of Behaviour banish’d part of
               her Sufferings, for tho’ she cou’d consider both his, and her own Passion in no other
               View, than that of a very great Misfortune to them both, yet there are so many
               Pleasures, even in the Pains of Love. Such tender thrillings, such Soul-ravishing
               Amusements, attend some happy Moments of Contemplation, that those who most
               Endeavour, can wish but faintly to be freed from.</p>
            <p><pb n="114"/></p>
            <p>When it grew pretty late, the Baron made a sign to the Count to follow him into a
               little Room joyning to that where they were, and when he had, now my Lord, (said he)
               I doubt not but this Night will make you entirely Possessor of your Wishes: I have
               prolonged the Entertainment, on purpose to detain those, who ’tis necessary for our
               Design, and have ordered a Chamber for Melliora, which has no Impediment to Bar your
               Entrance: O! Thou best of Friends, (answer’d D’elmont) how shall I requite thy
               Goodness? In making (resum’d the Baron) a right Use of the Opportunity I give you,
               for if you do not, you render fruitless all the Labours of my Brain, and make me
               wretched, while my Friend is so. Oh! fear me not (cry’d D’elmont in a Rapture) I will
               not be deny’d, each Faculty of my Soul is bent upon Enjoyment, tho’ Death in all its
               various Horrors glar’d upon me, I’d scorn ’em all in Melliora’s Arms---O! the very
               Name transports me---New fires my Blood, and tingles in my Veins---Imagination points
               out all her Charms--Methinks I see her lie in sweet
               Confusion--Fearing--Wishing--Melting---Her glowing Cheeks--Her closing dying
               Eyes--her every kindling--Oh ’tis too vast for Thought! Even Fancy flags, and cannot
               reach her Wonders! As he was speaking,Melantha, who had taken notice of his going out
               of the Room, and had follow’d him with a Design of talking to him, came time enough
               to hear the latter part of what he said, but seeing her Brother with him, withdrew
               with as much haste as she came, and infinitely more uneasiness of Mind; she was now
               but too well assur’d that she had a greater difficulty than the Count’s Matrimonial
               Engagement to get over, before she could reach his Heart, and was ready to burst with
               Vexation to think she was supplanted: Full of a Thousand tormenting Reflections she
               return’d to the Ball Room, and was so out of Humour all the Night, that she<pb n="115"/>
               could hardly be commonly Civil to any Body that spoke to her.</p>
            <p>At last, the Hour so much desired by the Count, the Baron, and Alovisa (tho’ for
               various Reasons) was arriv’d: The Company broke up; those who liv’d near, which were
               the greatest part, went home, the others being entreated by the Baron, stay’d. When
               they were to be conducted to their Chambers, he call’d >Melantha, and desired she
               would take care of the Ladies as he should direct, but above all, charg’d to
               place Alovisa and Melliora in two Chambers which he shewed her.</p>
            <p>Melantha was now let into the Secret she so much desired to know, the Name of her
               Rival, which she had not come time enough to hear, when she did the Count’s Rapturous
               Description of her. She had before found out, that her Brother was in Love with
               Alovysa, and did not doubt, but that there was a double Intrigue to be carry’d on
               that Night, and was the more confirm’d in that Opinion, when she remembred, that the
                  <hi rend="italic">Baron</hi> had order’d the Lock that Day to be taken off the
               Door of that Chamber where Melliora was to be lodg’d. It presently came into her Head,
               to betray all she knew to Alovisa, but she soon rejected that Resolution for another,
               which she thought would give her a more pleasing Revenge: She conducted all the
               Ladies to such Chambers as she thought fit, and Alovisa to that her Brother had
               desired, having no design of disappointing him, but Melliora she led to one where she
               always lay her self, resolving to supply her Place in the other, where the Count was
               to come: Yes, (said she to her self) I will receive his Vows in Melliora’s Room, and
               when I find him rais’d to the highest pitch of Expectation, declare who I am, and awe
               him into Tameness; ’twill be a charming Piece of Vengeance, besides, if he be not the
               most ungrateful Man on Earth, he must<pb n="116"/> Adore my Generosity in not exposing him to
               his Wife, when I have him in my Power, after the Coldness he has us’d me with. She
               found something so pleasing in this Contrivance, that no Considerations whatever,
               could have Power to deter her from pursuing it.</p>
            <p>When the Baron found every thing was silent and ready for his Purpose, he went softly
               to Count D’elmont’s Chamber, where he was impatiently expected; and taking him by
               the Hand, led him to that, where he had ordered Melliora to be Lodg’d. When they were
               at the Door, you see my Lord, (said he) I have kept my Promise; there lies the Idol
               of your Soul, go in, be bold, and all the Happiness, you wish attend you. The Count
               was in too great a hurry of disorder’d Thoughts to make him any other Answer than a
               passionate Embrace, and gently pushing open the Door which had no fastning to it,
               left the Baron to prosecute the remaining part of his treacherous Design.</p>
            <p>Alovisa had all the time of her being at the Baron’s, endur’d most grievous Racks of
               Mind, her Husband appear’d to her that Night, more gay and lovely, if possible than
               ever, but that Contentment which sat upon his Face, and added to his Graces, stung
               her to the Soul, when she reflected how little Sympathy there was between them:
               Scarce a Month (said she to her self) was I bless’d with those looks of Joy, a
               pensive sullenness has dwelt upon his Brow e’er since, ’till now; ’tis from my Ruin
               that his Pleasure flows, he hates me, and rejoyces in a Pretence, tho’ never so poor
               a one, to be absent from me. She was inwardly toss’d with a Multitude of these and
               the like perturbations, tho’ the Assurance the Baron had given her of Revenge, made
               her conceal them tolerably well, while she was in Company, but when she was left
               alone in the Chamber, and perceiv’d the Baron did not come so soon as she expected.
               Her Rage<pb n="117"/> broke out in all the Violence imaginable: She gave a loose to every
               furious Passion, and when she saw him enter, Cruel <hi rend="italic">D’Espernay</hi>
               (said she) where have you been!---Is this the Friendship which you vow’d? To leave me
               here distracted with my Griefs, while my perfidious Husband, and the cursed she, that
               robs me of him, are perhaps, as happy, as their guilty Love can make them? Madam
               (answer’d he) ’tis but a Moment since they are met: A Moment! (interrupted she) a
               Moment is too much, the smallest Particle of undivided Time, may make my Rival blest,
               and vastly recompence for all that my Revenge can do. Ah Madam (resum’d the Baron)
               how dearly do you still Love that most ungrateful Man: I had hopes that the full
               Knowledge of his Falshood might have made you scorn the scorner, I shall be able by
               to Morrow (reply’d the Cunning Alovisa who knew his drift well enough) to give you a
               better account of my Sentiments than now I can:---But why do we delay (continued she
               impatiently) are they not together?---The Baron saw this was no time to press her
               farther, and therefore taking a Wax Candle which stood on the Table, in one Hand, and
               offering the other to lead her, I am ready Madam (said he) to make good my Promise,
               and shall esteem no other Hours of my Life happy, but those which may be serviceable
               to you: They had only a small part of a Gallery to go thro’, and Alovisa had no time
               to answer to these last Words, if she had been compos’d enough to have done it,
               before they were at the Door, which as soon as the Baron had brought her to, he
               withdrew with all possible Speed.</p>
            <p>Tho’ the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> had been but a very little time in the Arms of
               his suppos’d Melliora, yet he had made so good use of it, and had taken so much
               Advantage of her complying Humour, that all his Fears were at an End, he now thought
               himself the most Fortunate of all Mankind; and <hi rend="italic">Melantha</hi> was
               far from repenting the Breach of the Resolution she<pb n="118"/> had made of discovering her
               self to him. His Behaviour to her was all Rapture, all killing extacy, and she
               flatter’d her self with a Belief, that when he shou’d come to know to whom he ow’d
               that bliss he had possess’d, he would not be ungrateful for it.</p>
            <p>What a confus’d Consternation must this Pair be in, when Alovysa rush’d into the
               Room;---’tis hard to say, which was the greatest, the <hi rend="italic">Count’s</hi>
               concern for his imagin’d Melliora’s Honour, or >Melantha’s for her own; but if one may
               form a Judgment from the Levity of the one’s Temper, and generosity of the other’s,
               one may believe that his had the Preheminence: But neither of them were so lost in
               Thought, as not to take what measures the Place and Time wou’d permit, to baffle the
               Fury of this Incens’d Wife:Melantha slunk under the Cloaths and theCount started up
               in the Bed at the first Appearance of the Light, which Alovysa had in her Hand, and in
               the most angry Accent he cou’d turn his Voice to, ask’d her the Reason of her coming
               there: Rage, at this sight (prepar’d and arm’d for it as she was) took away all Power
               of utterance from her; but she flew to the Bed, and began to tear the Cloaths
               (whichMelantha held fast over her Head) in so violent a manner, that the <hi
                  rend="italic">Count</hi> found the only way to Tame her, was to meet Force with
               Force; so jumping out, he seiz’d on her, and throwing her into a Chair, and holding
               her down in it, Madam, Madam (said he) you are Mad, and I as such shall use you,
               unless you promise to return quietly, and leave me. She cou’d yet bring forth no
               other Words, than Villain,----Monster! And such like Names, which her Passion and
               Injury suggested, which he but little regarding but for the noise she made; for shame
               (resum’d he) expose not thus your self and me, if you cannot command your Temper, at
               least confine your Clamours---I will not stir (said she, raving and struggling to get
               loose) ’till I have seen the Face that has undone me, I’ll tear out her bewitching
               Eyes---the<pb n="119"/> curst Adultress! And leave her Mistress of fewer Charms than thou
               canst find in me: She spoke this with so elevated a Voice, that the <hi rend="italic"
                  >Count</hi> endeavour’d to stop her Mouth, that she might not alarm the Company
               that were in the House, but he cou’d not do it time enough to prevent her from
               shrieking out Murder.---Help! Or the barbarous Man will kill me! At these Words the
                  <hi rend="italic">Baron</hi> came running in immediately, full of Surprize and
               Rage at something he had met with in the mean time: How came this Woman here, cry’d
               the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> to him: Ask me not my Lord (said he) for I can
               answer nothing, but every thing this cursed Night, I think, has happened by
               Enchantment; he was going to say something more, but several of his Guests hearing a
               noise, and cry of Murder, and directed by the Lights they saw in that Room, came in,
               and presently after a great many of the Servants, that the Chamber was as full as it
               cou’d hold: The <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> let go his Wife on the sight of the
               first stranger that enter’d; and indeed, there was no need of his confining her in
               that Place (tho’ he knew not so much) for the violence of so many contrary Passions
               warring in her Breast at once, had thrown her into a Swoon, and she fell back when he
               let go his hold of her, Motionless, and in all appearance Dead. The <hi rend="italic"
                  >Count</hi> said little, but began to put on his Cloaths, asham’d of the Posture
               he had been seen in; but the >Baron endeavour’d to perswade the Company, that it was
               only a Family Quarrel of no Consequence, told them he was sorry for the disturbance
               it had given them, and desir’d them to return to their Rest, and when the Room was
               pretty clear, order’d two or three of the Maids to carry Alovysa to her Chamber, and
               apply Things proper for her Recovery; as they were bearing her out, Melliora who had
               been frighted as well as the rest, with the noise she heard, was running along the
               Gallery to see what had happen’d, and met them; her Trouble to find Alovysa in that
               Condition, was unfeign’d, and she assisted those<pb n="120"/> that were employ’d about her,
               and accompany’d them where they carry’d her.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> was going to the Bed-side to comfort the conceal’d
               Fair, that lay still under the Cloaths, when he saw Melliora at the Door: What
               Surprize was ever equal to his, at this View?-----He stood like one transfix’d with
               Thunder, he knew not what to think, or rather cou’d not think at all, confounded with
               a seeming Impossibility. He beheld the Person, whom he thought had lain in his Arms,
               whom he had enjoy’d, whose Bulk and Proportion he still saw in the Bed, whom he was
               just going to Address to, and for whom he had been in all the Agonies of Soul
               imaginable, come from a distant Chamber, and unconcern’d, ask’d cooly, how Alovisa
               came to be taken ill! He look’d confusedly about, sometimes on Melliora, sometimes
               towards the Bed, and sometimes on the Baron; am I awake, (said he) or is every thing
               I see and hear, Illusion? The Baron could not presently resolve after what manner he
               should answer, tho’ he perfectly knew the Truth of this Adventure, and who was in the
               Bed; for, when he had conducted Alovisa to that Room, in order to make the Discovery
               he had promised, he went to his Sister’s Chamber, designing to abscond there, in case
               the Count should fly out on his Wife’s Entrance, and seeing him there, imagine who it
               was that betray’d him; and finding the Door shut, knock’d and call’d to have it
               opened; Melliora, who began to think she should lye in quiet no where, ask’d who was
               there, and what he would have? I would speak with my Sister, (reply’d he, as much
               astonish’d then, to hear who it was that answer’d him, as the Count was now to see
               her) and Melliora having assur’d him that she was not with her, left him no Room to
               doubt, by what means the Exchange had been made: Few Men, how amorous soever
               themselves, care that the Female part of their Family should be so, and he was most
               sensibly<pb n="121"/> mortify’d with it, but reflecting that it could not be kept a Secret,
               at least from the Count, my Lord, (said he, pointing to the Bed) there lies the Cause
               of your Amazement, that wicked Woman has betray’d the Trust I repos’d in her, and
               deceiv’d both you and me; rise, continued he, throwing open the Curtains, thou shame
               of thy Sex, and everlasting Blot and Scandal of the Noble House thou art descended
               from; rise, I say, or I will stab thee here in this Scene of Guilt; in speaking these
               Words, he drew out his Sword, and appear’d in such a real Fury, that the Count, tho’
               more and more amaz’d with every thing he saw and heard, made no doubt but he wou’d do
               as he said, and ran to hold his Arm.</p>
            <p>As no Woman that is Mistress of a great share of Wit, <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be
               a Coquet, so no Woman that has not a little, <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be
               one:Melantha, tho’ frighted to Death with these unexpected Occurrences, feign’d a
               Courage, which she had not in reality, and thrusting her Head a little above the
               Cloaths, Bless me Brother (said she) I vow I do not know what you mean by all this
               Bustle, neither am I guilty of any Crime: I was vex’d indeed to be made a Property
               of, and chang’d Beds with Melliora for a little innocent Revenge; for I always
               design’d to discover my self to the Count, time enough to prevent Mischief. The Baron
               was not so silly as to believe what she said, tho’ the Count, as much as he hated
               her, had too much Generosity to contradict her, and keeping still hold of the Baron,
               come <hi rend="italic">D’Espernay</hi>, (said he) I believe your Sisters Stars and
               mine, have from our Birth been at Variance, for this is the third Disappointment she
               has given me; once in Melliora’s Chamber, then in the Wilderness, and now here; but I
               forgive her, therefore let us retire and leave her to her Repose. The Baron was
               sensible that all the Rage in the World could not recall what had been done, and only
               giving her a furious Look, went with the Count out of the Room, without saying any
               thing more to her at that Time.</p>
            <p><pb n="122"/></p>
            <p>The Baron with much Entreating, at last prevail’d on Count D’elmont to go into his
               Bed, where he accompany’d him; but they were both of them too full of troubled
               Meditations, to Sleep: His Sister’s Indiscretion vex’d the Baron to the Heart, and
               took away great part of the Joy, for the fresh Occasion the Count had given Alovisa to
               withdraw her Affection from him. But with what Words can the various Passions that
               agitated the Soul of D’elmont be described? The Transports he had enjoy’d in an
               imaginary Felicity, were now turn’d to so many real Horrors; he saw himself expos’d
               to all the World, for it would have been Vanity to the last Degree, to believe this
               Adventure would be kept a Secret, but what gave him the most bitter Reflection, was,
               that Melliora when she should know it, as he could not doubt but she immediately
               wou’d be told it by Alovisa, wou’d judge of it by the Appearance, and believe him,
               at once, the most vicious, and most false of Men. As for his Wife, he thought not of
               her, with any Compassion for his Sufferings, but with Rage and Hate, for that jealous
               Curiosity, which he suppos’d had led her to watch his Actions that Night; (for he had
               not the least Suspicion of the Baron.)Melantha he always despised, but now detested,
               for the Trick she had put upon him; yet thought it would be not only unmanly, but
               barbarous to let her know he did so: It was in vain for him to endeavour to come to a
               Determination after what manner he should behave himself to any of them, and when the
               Night was past, in forming a thousand several Resolutions, the Morning found him as
               much to seek as before: He took his Leave early of the Baron, not being willing to
               see any of the Company after what had happened, ’till he was more Compos’d.</p>
            <p>He was not deceiv’d in his Conjectures concerning Melliora, for Alovisa was no sooner
               recover’d<pb n="123"/> from her Swoon, than, she, with bitter Exclamations, told her what had
               been the Occasion, and put that astonish’d Fair one into such a visible Disorder, as
               had she not been too full of Misery, to take Notice of it, had made her easily
               perceive that she was deeply interested in the Story: But whatever she said against
               the Count, as she could not forbear something, calling him Ungrateful, Perjur’d,
               Deceitful, and Inconstant, Alovisa took only, as a Proof of Friendship to her self,
               and the Effects of that just Indignation all Women ought to feel for him, that takes
               a Pride in Injuring any one of them.</p>
            <p>When the Count was gone, the Baron sent to Alovisa to enquire of her Health, and if
               he might have leave to visit her in her Chamber, and being told she desired he
               shou’d, resolv’d now to make his Demand. Melliora had but just parted from her, in
               order to get herself ready to go Home, and she was alone when he came in. As soon as
               the first Civilities were over, she began afresh to conjure him to let her know the
               Name of her Rival, which he artfully evading, tho’ not absolutely denying, made her
               almost distracted; the Baron carefully observ’d her every Look and Motion, and when
               he found her Impatience was rais’d to the highest degree; Madam (said he, taking her
               by the Hand, and looking tenderly on her) you cannot blame a Wretch who has lavish’d
               all he had away to one poor Jewel, to make the most he can of that, to supply his
               future Wants: I have already forfeited all pretence to Honour, and even common
               Hospitality, by betraying the Trust that was repos’d in me, and exposing under my own
               Roof, the Man who takes me for his dearest Friend, and what else I have suffer’d from
               that unavoidable Impulse which compell’d me to do all this, your self may judge, who
               too well know, the Pangs and Tortures of neglected Love---Therefore, (continued he
               with a deep Sigh) since this last reserve is all my Hopes dependance, do not, Oh
               Charming<pb n="124"/> Alovisa, think me Mercinary, if I presume to set a Price upon it,
               which I confess too high, yet nothing less can Purchase: No Price (reply’d Alovisa,
               who thought a little Condescension was necessary to win him to her purpose) can be
               too dear to buy my Peace, nor Recompence too great for such a Service: What, not your
               Love, said the Baron, eagerly kissing her Hand? No (resum’d she, forcing herself to
               look kindly on him) not even that, when such a Proof of yours engages it; but do not
               keep me longer on the Rack, give me the Name and then.---She spoke these last Words
               with such an Air of Languishment, that the Baron thought his Work was done, and
               growing bolder, from her Hand he proceeded to her Lips, and answer’d her only in
               Kisses, which distastful as they were to her, she suffer’d him to take, without
               Resistance, but that was not all he wanted, and believing this the Critical Minute,
               he threw his Arms about her Waist, and began to draw her by little and little toward
               the Bed; which she affected to permit with a kind of an unwilling Willingness;
               saying, Well, if you wou’d have me able to deny you nothing you can ask, tell me the
               Name I so much wish to know: But the Baron was as cunning as she, and seeing thro’
               her Artifice, was resolv’d to make sure of his Reward first: Yes, yes, my
               adorable Alovisa (answer’d he, having brought her now very near the Bed) you shall
               immediately know all, thy Charms will force the Secret from my Breast, close as it is
               lodg’d within my inmost Soul.---Dying with Rapture I will tell thee all.---If that a
               Thought of this injurious Husband, can interpose amidst Extatick Joys. What will not
               some Women venture, to satisfy a jealous Curiosity? Alovisa had feign’d to consent to
               his Desires, (in hopes to engage him to a Discovery) so far, and had given him so
               many Liberties, that now, it was as much as she cou’d do to save herself, from the
               utmost Violence, and perceiving she had been outwitted, and that nothing but the
               really yielding up her Honour, cou’d oblige him to<pb n="125"/> reveal what she desired.
               Villain, said she, (struggling to get loose from his Embrace) dare thy base Soul
               believe so vilely of me? Release me from thy detested Hold, or my Cries shall force
               thee to it, and proclaim thee what thou art, a Monster! The Baron was not enough
               deluded by her pretence of Kindness, to be much surpriz’d at this sudden turn of her
               Behaviour, and only cooly answer’d, Madam, I have no design of using Violence, but
               perceive, if I had depended on your Gratitude, I had been miserably deceiv’d. Yes
               (said she, looking contemptibly on him) I own thou would’st; for whatsoever I might
               say, or thou could’st hope, I love my Husband still, with an unbated Fondness, doat
               upon him! Faithless and Cruel as he is, he still is lovely! His Eyes lose nothing of
               their brightness, nor his Tongue its softness! His very Frowns have more Attraction
               in them than any others Smiles! and canst thou think! Thou, so different in all from
               him, that thou seemest not the same Species of Humanity, nor ought’st to stile thy
               self a Man since he is no more: Canst thou, I say, believe a Woman, bless’d as Alovisa
               has been, can e’er blot out the dear Remembrance, and quit her Hopes of re-gain’d
               Paradise in his Embrace, for certain Hell in Thine? She spoke these Words with so
               much Scorn, that the Baron skill’d as he was in every Art to tempt, cou’d not conceal
               the Spite he conceiv’d at them, and letting go her Hand, (which perforce he had held)
               I leave you Madam (said he) to the Pleasure of enjoying your own Humour; neither
               that, nor your Circumstances are to be envy’d, but I’d have you to remember, that you
               are your own Tormentor, while you refuse the only means can bring you Ease. I will
               have Ease another way (said she, incens’d at the Indignity she imagin’d he treated
               her with) and if you still persist in refusing to discover to me the Person who has
               injur’d me, I shall make no difficulty of letting the Count know how much of his
               Secrets you have imparted, and for what Reason you conceal the other: You may do so
               (answer’d<pb n="126"/> he) and I doubt not but you will---Mischief is the darling Favourite
               of Woman! Blood is the Satisfaction perhaps, that you require, and if I fall by him,
               or he by me, your Revenge will have its aim, either on the Unloving or the Unlov’d;
               for me, I set my Life at nought, without your Love ’tis Hell; but do not think that
               even dying, to purchase Absolution, I’d reveal one Letter of that Name, you so much
               wish to hear, the Secret shall be buried with me.----Yes, Madam (continued he, with a
               malicious Air) that happy Fair unknown, whose Charms have made you wretched, shall
               undiscover’d, and unguess’d at, Triumph in those Joys you think none but your Count
               can give. Alovisa had not an Opportunity to make any Answer to what he said; Melliora
               came that Moment into the Room, and ask’d if she was ready to go, and Alovisa saying
               that she was, they both departed from the Baron’s House, without much Ceremony on
               either side.</p>
            <p>Alovisa had not been long at home before a Messenger came to acquaint her, that her
               Sister having miss’d of her at <hi rend="italic">Paris</hi>, was now on her Journey
               to <hi rend="italic">Le Beausse</hi>, and wou’d be with her in a few Hours: She
               rejoyc’d as much at this News, as it was possible for one so full of disquiet to do,
               and order’d her Chariot and Six to be made ready again, and went to meet her.</p>
            <p>D’elmont heard of Ansellina’s coming almost as soon as Alovisa, and his Complaisance
               for Ladies, join’d with the extream desire he had of seeing his Brother, whom he
               believ’d was with her, wou’d certainly have given him Wings to have flown to them
               with all imaginable Speed, had not the late Quarrel between him and his Wife, made
               him think it was improper to join Company with her on any Account whatever: He was
               sitting in his Dressing-Room Window in a melancholly and disturb’d Meditation,
               ruminating on every Circumstance of his<pb n="127"/> last Nights Adventure, when he perceiv’d
               a couple of Horsemen come galloping over the Plain, and make directly toward his
               House. The Dust they made, kept him from distinguishing who they were, and they were
               very near the Gate before he discover’d them to be the <hi rend="italic"
                  >Chevalier</hi>Brillian, and his Servant: The Surprize he was in to see him
               without Ansellina was very great, but much more so, when running down, as soon as he
               saw he was alighted, and opening his Arms eagerly to Embrace him; the other drawing
               back, No, my Lord (said he) since you are pleas’d to forget I am your Brother, I
               pretend no other way to merit your Embraces: Nor can think it any Happiness to hold
               him in my Arms, who keeps me distant from his Heart. What mean you (cry’d D’elmont,
               extreamly astonish’d at his Behaviour) you know so little (resum’d the <hi
                  rend="italic">Chevalier</hi>) of the power of Love, your self, that perhaps, you
               think I ought not to resent what you having done to ruin me in mine: But, however
               Sir, Ambition is a Passion which you are not a Stranger to, and have settled your own
               Fortune according to your Wish, methinks you shou’d not wonder that I take it ill,
               when you endeavour to prevent my doing so to: The <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> was
               perfectly Confounded at these Words, and looking earnestly on him; Brother (said he)
               you seem to lay a heavy Accusation on me, but if you still retain so much of that
               former Affection which was between us, as to desire I shou’d be clear’d in your
               Esteem, you must be more plain in your Charge, for tho’ I easily perceive that I am
               wrong’d, I cannot see by what means I am so. My Lord, you are not wrong’d (cry’d the
                  <hi rend="italic">Chevalier</hi> hastily) you know you are not: If my Tongue were
               silent, the despair that sits upon my Brow, my alter’d Looks, and grief-sunk Eyes,
               wou’d proclaim your Barbarous---most unnatural Usage of me. Ungrateful >Brillian
               (said theCount, at once inflam’d with Tenderness and Anger) is this the Consolation I
               expected from your Presence? I know not for what Cause I am upbraided, being Innocent
               of any,<pb n="128"/> nor what your Troubles are, but I am sure my own are such, as needed not
               this Weight to overwhelm me. He spoke this so feelingly, and concluded with so deep a
               sigh as most sensibly touch’d the Heart of >Brillian. If I cou’d believe that you had
               any (reply’d he) it were enough to sink me quite, and rid me of a Life
               which Ansellina’s loss has made me hate. What said you, (interrupted the <hi
                  rend="italic">Count</hi>)Ansellina’s loss? If that be true, I pardon all the
               wildness of your unjust Reproaches, for well I know, despair has small regard to
               Reason, but quickly speak the Cause of your Misfortune:---I was about to enquire the
               Reason that I saw you not together, when your unkind Behaviour drove it from my
               Thoughts. That Question (answer’d the <hi rend="italic">Chevalier</hi>) ask’d by you
               some Days since, wou’d have put me past all the Remains of Patience, but I begin to
               hope I am not so unhappy as I thought, but still am blest in Friendship, tho’ undone
               in Love----but I’ll not keep you longer in suspence, my Tale of Grief is short in the
               Repeating, tho’ everlasting in its Consequence. In saying this, he sat down, and the
                  <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> doing the like, and assuring him of Attention, he
               began his Relation in this manner.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship may remember that I gave you an Account by Letter, of Ansellina’s
               Indisposition, and the Fears I was in for her; but by the time I receiv’d your
               Answer, I thought my self the happiest of Mankind: She was perfectly recover’d, and
               every Day I receiv’d new Proofs of her Affection: We began to talk now of coming to
                  <hi rend="italic">Paris</hi>, and she seem’d no less Impatient for that Journey
               than my self, and one Evening, the last I ever had the Honour of her Conversation;
               she told me, that in spite of the Physicians Caution, she wou’d leave <hi
                  rend="italic">Amiens</hi> in three or four Days; You may be sure I did not
               disswade her from that Resolution; but, how great was my Astonishment, when going the
               next Morning to the <hi rend="italic">Baronesses</hi>, to give the Ladies the <hi
                  rend="italic">Bonjour</hi>, as I constantly<pb n="129"/> did every Morning, I perceiv’d an
               unusual coldness in the Face of every one in the Family; the <hi rend="italic"
                  >Baroness</hi> herself spoke not to me, but to tell me that Ansellina wou’d see no
               Company: How, Madam, said I, am I not excepted from those general Orders, what can
               this sudden alteration in my Fortune mean? I suppose (reply’d she) that Ansellina has
               her Reasons for what she does: I said all that despair cou’d suggest, to oblige her
               to give me some light into this Mistery, but all was in vain, she either made me no
               Answers, or such as were not Satisfactory, and growing weary with being Importun’d,
               she abruptly went out of the Room, and left me in a confusion not to be Express’d: I
               renew’d my visit the next Day, and was then deny’d admittance by the Porter: The
               same, the following one, and as Servants commonly form their Behaviour, according to
               that of those they serve, it was easy for me to observe I was far from being a
               welcome Guest: I writ to Ansellina, but had my Letter return’d unopen’d: And that
               Scorn so unjustly thrown upon me, tho’ it did not absolutely cure my Passion, yet it
               stirr’d up so much just Resentment in me, that it abated very much of its Tenderness:
               About a Fortnight I remain’d in this perplexity, and at the end of it was plung’d
               into a greater, when I receiv’d a little <hi rend="italic">Billet</hi> from Ansellina,
               which as I remember, contain’d these Words.</p>

            <p>I cannot but say, I thought this manner of proceeding very odd, and vastly different
               from that openness of Nature, I always admir’d in her, but as I had been always a
               most obsequious Lover; I resolv’d not to forfeit that Character, and give a Proof of
               an implicite Obedience to her Will, tho’ with what Anxiety of Mind you may imagine. I
               stood at a distance, and saw her take Coach, and as soon as her Attendants were out
               of sight, I got on Horseback, and follow’d; I several Times lay at the same Inn where
               she did, but took care not to appear before her: Never was any sight more pleasing to
               me, than that of <hi rend="italic">Paris</hi>, because I there hop’d to have my
               Destiny unravell’d; but your being out of Town, preventing her making any stay, I was
               reduc’d to another tryal of Patience; about Seven Furlongs from hence, hap’ning to
               Bait at the same <hi rend="italic">Cabaret</hi> with her, I saw her Woman, who had
               been always perfectly obliging to me, walking alone in the Garden; I took the liberty
               to show my self to her, and ask her some Questions concerning my future Fate, to
               which she answer’d with all the Freedom I cou’d desire, and observing the
               Melancholly, which was but too apparent in my Countenance: Sir, said she, tho’ I
               think nothing can be more blame-worthy than to betray the Secrets of our Superiors,
               yet I hope I shall stand excus’d for declaring so much of my Lady’s as the Condition
               you are in, seems to require; I wou’d not therefore have you believe that in this
               Separation, you are the only Sufferer, I can assure you, my Lady bears her part of
               Sorrow too.----How can that be possible (cry’d I) when my Misfortune is brought upon
               me, only by the change of her Inclination? Far from it (answer’d she) you have a
               Brother--he only is to blame, she has receiv’d Letters from<pb n="131"/>
               <hi rend="italic">Madam</hi> D’elmont which have---as she was speaking, she was call’d
               hastily away, without being able to finish what she was about to say, and I was so
               Impatient to hear: Her naming you in such a manner, planted ten thousand Daggers in
               my Soul!----What cou’d I imagine by those Words, <hi rend="italic">You have a
                  Brother, he only is to Blame</hi>, and her mentioning Letters from that Brother’s
               Wife; but that it was thro’ you I was made wretched? I repeated several times over to
               my self, what she had said, but cou’d wrest no other Meaning from it, than that you
               being already possess’d of the Elder Sister’s Fortune, were willing to Engross the
               other’s too, by preventing her from Marrying: Pardon me, my Lord, if I have Injur’d
               you, since I protest, the Thoughts of your designing my undoing, was, if possible,
               more dreadful to me than the Ill it self.</p>
            <p>You will, reply’d the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>, be soon convinc’d how little Hand
               I had in those Letters, whatever they contain’d, when you have been here a few Days.
               He then told him of the disagreement between himself and Alovisa, her perpetual
               Jealousy, her Pride, her Rage, and the little probability there was of their being
               ever reconcil’d, so as to live together as they ought, omitting nothing of the Story,
               but his Love for Melliora, and the Cause he had given to create this uneasiness.
               They both concluded, that Ansellina’s alteration of Behaviour was entirely owing to
               something her Sister had written, and that she wou’d use her utmost endeavour to
               break off the Match wholly in Revenge to her Husband: As they were discoursing on
               means to prevent it, the Ladies came to the Gate; they saw them thro’ the Window, and
               ran to receive them immediately: The <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> handed Ansellina out
               of the Coach, with great Complaisance, while the <hi rend="italic">Chevalier</hi>
               wou’d have done the same by Alovisa, but she wou’d not permit him, which the <hi
                  rend="italic">Count</hi> observing, when he had paid those Complements to her
               Sister, which he thought civility requir’d,<pb n="132"/> Madam (said he, turning to her and
               frowning) is it not enough, you make me wretched by your continual Clamours, and
               Upbraidings, but that your ill Nature must extend to all, whom you believe I love?
               She answer’d him only with a disdainful Look, and haughty Toss, which spoke the
               Pleasure she took in having it in her Power to give him Pain, and went out of the
               Room with Ansellina.</p>
            <p>D’elmont’s Family was now become a most distracted one, every Body was in confusion,
               and it was hard for a disinterested Person, to know how to behave among them: The <hi
                  rend="italic">Count</hi> was ready to die with Vexation, when he reflected on the
               Adventure at theBaron’s withMelantha, and how hard it wou’d be to clear his Conduct
               in that point with Melliora: She, on the other Hand, was as much tormented at his
               not attempting it. The <hi rend="italic">Chevalier</hi>, was in the height of
               despair, when he found that Ansellina continued her Humour, and still avoided letting
               him know the occasion of it: And Alovisa, tho’ she contented herself for some Hours
               with relating to her Sister, all the Passages of her Husband’s unkind usage of her,
               yet when that was over, her Curiosity return’d, and she grew so madly Zealous to find
               out, who her rival was, that she repented her Behaviour to the <hi rend="italic"
                  >Baron</hi>, and sent him the next Day privately, a <hi rend="italic">Billet</hi>,
               wherein she assur’d him, that she had acquainted the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>
               with nothing that had pass’d between them, and that she desir’d to speak with him.
               ’Tis easy to believe he needed not a second Invitation; he came immediately,
               and Alovisa renew’d her Entreaties in the most pressing manner she was capable of, but
               in vain, he told her plainly, that if he cou’d not have her Heart, nothing but the
               full Possession of her Person shou’d Extort the Secret from him. ’Twould swell this
               Discourse beyond what I design, to recount her various Starts of Passions, and
               different Turns of Behaviour, sometimes louder than the Winds she rav’d! Commanded!
               Threatned! Then, still as <hi rend="italic">April</hi> Showers,<pb n="133"/> or Summer Dews
               she wept, and only whisper’d her Complaints, now dissembling Kindness, then declaring
               unfeign’d Hate; ’till at last, finding it impossible to prevail by any other means,
               she promis’d to admit him at Midnight into her Chamber: But as it was only the force
               of her too passionate Affection for her Husband, which had work’d her to this pitch
               of raging Jealousie, so she had no sooner made the Assignation, and the <hi
                  rend="italic">Baron</hi> had left her (to seek the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> to
               prevent any suspicion of their long Conversation) but all D’elmont’s Charms came fresh
               into her Mind, and made the Thoughts of what she had promis’d, Odious and
               Insupportable; she open’d her Mouth more than once to call back the <hi rend="italic"
                  >Baron</hi>, and Recant all that she had said; but her ill Genius, or that Devil,
               Curiosity, which too much haunts the Minds of Women, still prevented Her: What will
               become of me, (said she to her self) what is it I am about to do? Shall I foregoe my
               Honour---quit my Virtue,---sully my yet unspotted Name with endless Infamy---and
               yield my Soul to Sin, to Shame, and Horror, only to know what I can ne’er Redress?
               If D’elmont hates me now, will he not do so still?---What will this curs’d Discovery
               bring me but added Tortures, and fresh weight of Woe: Happy had it been for her if
               these Considerations cou’d have lasted, but when she had been a Minute or two in this
               Temper, she wou’d relapse and cry, what! must I tamely bear it then?---Endure the
               Flouts of the malicious World, and the contempt of every saucy Girl, who while she
               pities, scorns my want of Charms--Shall I neglected tell my Tale of Wrongs, (O, Hell
               is in that Thought) ’till my despair shall reach my Rival’s Ears, and Crown her
               Adulterous Joys with double Pleasure.---Wretch that I am!--Fool that I am, to
               hesitate, my Misery is already past Addition, my everlasting Peace is broke! Lost
               even to hope, what can I more endure?---No, since I must be ruin’d, I’ll have the
               Satisfaction of dragging with me to Perdition, the Vile, the Cursed she that has
               undone me: I’ll be reveng’d on her, then<pb n="134"/> die my self, and free me from
               Pollution. As she was in this last Thought, she perceiv’d at a good distance from
               her, the <hi rend="italic">Chevalier</hi>Brillian and Ansellina in Discourse; the
               sight of him immediately put a new contrivance into her Head, and she compos’d her
               self as she cou’d, and went to meet them.</p>
            <p>Ansellina having been left alone, while her Sister was Entertaining the <hi
                  rend="italic">Baron</hi>, had walk’d down into the Garden to divert her self,
               where the <hi rend="italic">Chevalier</hi>, who was on the watch for such an
               opportunity, had follow’d her; he cou’d not forbear, tho’ in Terms full of Respect,
               taxing her with some little Injustice for her late Usage of him, and Breach of
               Promise, in not letting him know her Reasons for it: She, who by Nature was extreamly
               averse to the disguising her Sentiments, suffer’d him not long to press her for an
                  <hi rend="italic">Eclaircissment</hi>, and with her usual Freedom, told him what
               she had done, was purely in compliance with her Sister’s Request; that she cou’d not
               help having the same Opinion of him as ever, but that she had promis’d Alovisa to
               defer any Thoughts of marrying him, till his Brother shou’d confess his Error: The
               obliging things she said to him, tho’ she persisted in her Resolution, dissipated
               great part of his Chagreen, and he was beginning to excuse D’elmont, and persuade her
               that her Sister’s Temper was the first occasion of their quarrel, when Alovisa
               interrupted them. Ansellina was a little out of Countenance at her Sister’s Presence,
               imagining she wou’d be Incens’d at finding her with the <hi rend="italic"
                  >Chevalier</hi>; but that distressed Lady was full of other Thoughts, and desiring
               him to follow her to her Chamber, as soon as they were set down, confess’d to him,
               how, fir’d with his Brother’s Falshood, she endeavour’d to revenge it upon him, that
               she had been his Enemy, but was willing to enter into any Measures for his
               Satisfaction, provided he wou’d comply with one, which she should propose, which he
               faithfully promising, after she had sworn him to Secrecy, discover’d to him
               every<pb n="135"/> Circumstance, from her first Cause of Jealousy, to the Assignation she had
               made with the <hi rend="italic">Baron</hi>; now, said she, it is in your Power to
               preserve both your Brother’s Honour, and my Life (which I sooner will resign than my
               Vertue) if you stand conceal’d in a little Closet, which I shall convey you to, and
               the Moment he has satisfy’d my Curiosity, by telling me her Name that has undone me,
               rush out, and be my Protector. The <hi rend="italic">Chevalier</hi> was infinitely
               Surpriz’d at what he heard, for his Brother had not given him the least hint of his
               Passion, but thought the request she made, too reasonable to be deny’d.</p>
            <p>While they were in this Discourse, Melliora, who had been sitting indulging her
               Melancholly in that Closet which Alovisa spoke of, and which did not immediately
               belong to that Chamber, but was a sort of an Entry, or Passage, into another, and
               tir’d with Reflection, was fallen asleep, but on the noise which Alovysa and the <hi
                  rend="italic">Chevalier</hi> made in coming in, wak’d, and heard to her
               inexpressible trouble, the Discourse that pass’d between them: She knew that unknown
               Rival was herself, and condemn’d the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> of the highest
               Imprudence, in making a confidant, as she found he had, of the <hi rend="italic"
                  >Baron</hi>; she saw her Fate, at least that of her Reputation was now upon the
               Crisis, that, that very Night she was to be expos’d to all the Fury of an enrag’d
               Wife, and was so shook with apprehension, that she was scarce able to go out of the
               Closet time enough to prevent their discovering she was there; what cou’d she do in
               this Exigence, the Thoughts of being betray’d, was worse to her than a thousand
               Deaths, and it was to be wondred at, as she has since confest, that in that height of
               Desparation, she had not put an end to the Tortures of Reflection, by laying violent
               Hands on her own Life: As she was going from the Closet hastily to her own
               Appartment, the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Baron</hi> pass’d
               her, and that sight heightening the distraction she was in, she stept<pb n="136"/> to the <hi
                  rend="italic">Count</hi>, and in a faultring, scarce intelligible Accent,
               whisper’d, for Heaven’s Sake let me speak with you before Night, make some pretence
               to come to my Chamber, where I’ll wait for you. And as soon as she had spoke these
               Words, darted from him so swift, that he had no opportunity of replying, if he had
               not been too much overwhelm’d with Joy at this seeming Change of his Fortune to have
               done it; he misunderstood part of what she said, and instead of her desiring to speak
               with him <hi rend="italic">before Night</hi>, he imagin’d, she said <hi rend="italic"
                  >at Night</hi>. He presently communicated it to the <hi rend="italic">Baron</hi>,
               who congratulated him upon it; and never was any Night more impatiently long’d for,
               than this was by them both. They had indeed not many Hours of Expectation, but
               Melliora thought them Ages; all her hopes were, that if she cou’d have an
               opportunity of discovering to <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> D’elmont what she had heard
               between his Wife and Brother, he might find some means to prevent the <hi
                  rend="italic">Baron’s</hi> Treachery from taking Effect. But when Night grew on,
               and she perceiv’d he came not, and she consider’d how near she was to inevitable
               Ruin, what Words can sufficiently express her Agonies? So I shall only say, they were
               too violent to have long kept Company with Life; Guilt, Horrour, Fear, Remorse, and
               Shame at once oppress’d her, and she was very near sinking beneath their Weight, when
               somebody knock’d softly at the Door; she made no doubt but it was the <hi
                  rend="italic">Count</hi>, and open’d it immediately, and he catching her in his
               Arms with all the eagerness of transported Love, she was about to clear his Mistake,
               and let him know it was not an amourous Entertainment she expected from him; when a
               sudden cry of Murder, and the noise of clashing Swords, made him let go his hold, and
               draw his own, and run along the Gallery to find out the occasion, where being in the
               dark, and only directed by the noise he heard in his Wife’s Chamber, something met
               the point, and a great shriek following it, he cry’d for Lights but none coming
               immediately; he stepping farther stumbled at the Body which had fallen, he then
               redoubled his outcrys,<pb n="137"/> and Melliora, frighted as she was, brought one from her
               Chamber, and at the same Instant that they discover’d it was Alovisa, who coming to
               alarm the Family, had by Accident run on her Husband’s Sword, they saw the <hi
                  rend="italic">Chevalier</hi> pursuing the <hi rend="italic">Baron</hi>, who
               mortally wounded, dropt down by Alovisa’s side; what a dreadful View was this? The <hi
                  rend="italic">Count</hi>, Melliora, and the Servants, who by this time were most of
               them rowz’d, seem’d without Sence or Motion, only the <hi rend="italic"
                  >Chevalier</hi> had Spirit enough to speak, or think, so stupify’d was every one
               with what they saw. But he ordering the Servants to take up the Bodies, sent one of
               ’em immediately for a Surgeon, but they were both of them past his Art to
               cure; Alovisa spoke no more, and the <hi rend="italic">Baron</hi> liv’d but two Days,
               in which time the whole Account, as it was gather’d from the Mouths of those chiefly
               concern’d, was set down, and the Tragical part of it being laid before the KING,
               there appear’d so much of Justice in the <hi rend="italic">Baron’s</hi> Death, and
               Accident in Alovisa’s, that the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                  >Chevalier</hi> found it no difficult matter to obtain their Pardon. The <hi
                  rend="italic">Chevalier</hi> was soon after Married to his beloved Ansellina;
               but Melliora look’d on herself as the most guilty Person upon Earth, as being the
               primary Cause of all the Misfortunes that had happen’d, and retir’d immediately to a
               Monastery, from whence, not all the entreaties of her Friends, nor the implorations
               of the Amorous D’elmont cou’d bring her, she was now resolv’d to punish, by a
               voluntary Banishment from all she ever did, or cou’d love; the Guilt of Indulging
               that Passion, while it was a Crime. He, not able to live without her, at least in the
               same Climate, committed the Care of his Estate to his Brother, and went to Travel,
               without an Inclination ever to return:Melantha who was not of a Humour to take any
               thing to Heart, was Married in a short Time, and had the good Fortune not to be
               suspected by her Husband, though she brought him a Child in Seven Months after her
               Wedding.</p>

            <p>Tho’ Count <hi rend="italic">D’elmont</hi> never had any tenderness for <hi
                  rend="italic">Alovisa</hi>, and her Extravagance of Rage and Jealousie, join’d to
               his Passion for <hi rend="italic">Melliora</hi>, had every Day abated it, yet the
               manner of her Death was too great a shock to the sweetness of his Disposition, to be
               easily worn off; he cou’d not remember her Uneasiness, without reflecting that it
               sprung only from her too violent Affection for him; and tho’ there was no possibility
               of living happily with her, when he consider’d that she died, not only for him, but
               by his Hand, his Compassion for the Cause, and Horror for the unwish’d, as well as
               undesign’d Event, drew Lamentations from him, more sincere, perhaps, than one of
               those Husbands,<pb n="142"/> who call themselves very loving ones, wou’d make.</p>
            <p>To alleviate the troubles of his Mind, he had endeavour’d all he cou’d, to persuade
                  <hi rend="italic">Melliora</hi> to continue in his House; but that afflicted Lady
               was not to be prevail’d upon, she look’d on her self, as in a manner, accessary to
                  <hi rend="italic">Alovisa</hi>’s Death, and thought the least she ow’d to her
               Reputation was to see the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> no more, and tho’ in the
               forming this Resolution, she felt Torments unconceivable, yet the strength of her
               Virtue enabled her to keep it, and she return’d to the Monastery, where she had been
               Educated, carrying with her nothing of that Peace of Mind with which she left it.</p>
            <p>Not many Days pass’d between her Departure, and the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>’s;
               he took his way towards <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>, by the Persuasions of his
               Brother, who, since he found him bent to Travel, hop’d that Garden of the World might
               produce something to divert his Sorrows; he took but two Servants with him, and those
               rather for conveniency than State: <hi rend="italic">Ambition</hi>, once his darling
               Passion, was now wholly extinguish’d in him by these Misfortunes, and he no longer
               thought of making a Figure in the World; but his <hi rend="italic">Love</hi> nothing
               cou’d abate, and ’tis to be believ’d that the violence of that wou’d have driven him
               to the use of some fatal Remedy, if the <hi rend="italic">Chevalier Brillian</hi>, to
               whom he left the Care of <hi rend="italic">Melliora</hi>’s and her Brother’s Fortune
               as well as his own, had not, tho’ with much difficulty, obtain’d a Promise from her,
               of conversing with him by Letters.</p>
            <p>This was all he had to keep hope alive, and indeed it was no inconsiderable
               Consolation, for she that allows a Correspondence of that Kind with a Man that has
               any Interest in her Heart, can never persuade herself, while she does so, to make him
               become indifferent to her. When we give our selves the liberty<pb n="143"/> of even talking
               of the Person we have once lov’d, and find the least pleasure in that Discourse, ’tis
               ridiculous to imagine we are free from that Passion, without which, the mention of it
               would be but insipid to our Ears, and the remembrance to our Minds, tho’ our Words
               are never so Cold, they are the Effects of a secret Fire, which burns not with less
               Strength for not being Dilated. The <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> had too much
               Experience of all the Walks and Turns of Passion to be ignorant of this, if <hi
                  rend="italic">Melliora</hi> had endeavour’d to disguise her Sentiments, but she
               went not so far, she thought it a sufficient vindication of her Virtue, to withold
               the rewarding of his Love, without feigning a coldness to which she was a stranger,
               and he had the satisfaction to observe a tenderness in her Stile, which assur’d him,
               that her <hi rend="italic">Heart</hi> was unalterably his, and very much strengthen’d
               his Hopes, that one Day her Person might be so too, when time had a little effac’d
               the Memory of those Circumstances, which had obliged her to put this constraint on
               her Inclinations.</p>
            <p>He wrote to her from every Post-Town, and waited till he receiv’d her Answer, by this
               means his Journey was extreamly tedious, but no Adventures of any moment, falling in
               his way ’till he came to <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi>, I shall not trouble my Readers
               with a recital of particulars which cou’d be no way Entertaining.</p>
            <p>But, how strangely do they deceive themselves, who fancy that they are Lovers, yet on
               every little turn of Fortune, or Change of Circumstance, are agitated, with any
               Vehemence, by Cares of a far different Nature? <hi rend="italic">Love</hi> is too
               jealous, too arbitrary a Monarch to suffer any other Passion to equalize himself in
               that Heart where he has fix’d his Throne. When once enter’d, he becomes the whole
               Business of our Lives, we think----we Dream of nothing else, nor have a Wish not
               inspir’d by him: Those who have the Power to apply themselves so seriously to any
               other Consideration as to forget him, tho’ but for a Moment,<pb n="144"/> are but Lovers in
               Conceit, and have entertain’d Desire but as an agreeable Amusement, which when
               attended with any Inconvenience, they may without much difficulty shake off. Such a
               sort of Passion may be properly enough call’d <hi rend="italic">Liking</hi>, but
               falls widely short of <hi rend="italic">Love</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Love</hi>, is
               what we can neither resist, expel, nor even alleviate, if we should never so
               vigorously attempt it; and tho’ some have boasted, <hi rend="italic">Thus far will I
                  yield and no farther</hi>, they have been convinc’d of the Vanity of forming such
               Resolutions by the impossibility of keeping them. <hi rend="italic">Liking</hi> is a
               flashy Flame, which is to be kept alive only by ease and delight. <hi rend="italic"
                  >Love</hi>, needs not this fewel to maintain its Fire, it survives in Absence, and
               disappointments, it endures, unchill’d, the wintry Blasts of cold Indifference and
               Neglect, and continues its Blaze, even in a storm of Hatred and Ingratitude, and
               Reason, Pride, or a just sensibility of conscious Worth, in vain oppose it. <hi
                  rend="italic">Liking</hi>, plays gaily round, feeds on the Sweets in gross, but is
               wholly insensible of the Thorns which guard the nicer, and more refin’d Delicacies of
               Desire, and can consequently give neither Pain, nor Pleasure in any superlative
               degree. <hi rend="italic">Love</hi> creates intollerable Torments! Unspeakable Joys!
               Raises us to the highest Heaven of Happiness, or sinks us to the lowest Hell of
               Misery.</p>
            <p>Count <hi rend="italic">D’elmont</hi> experienc’d the Truth of this Assertion; for
               neither his just concern for the manner of <hi rend="italic">Alovisa</hi>’s Death
               cou’d curb the Exuberance of his Joy, when he consider’d himself belov’d by <hi
                  rend="italic">Melliora</hi>, nor any Diversion of which <hi rend="italic"
                  >Rome</hi> afforded great Variety, be able to make him support being absent from
               her with Moderation. There are I believe, but few modern Lovers, how Passionate and
               constant soever they pretend to be, who wou’d not in the <hi rend="italic"
               >Count</hi>’s Circumstances have found some matter of Consolation; but he seem’d
               wholly dead to Gaiety. In vain, all the <hi rend="italic">Roman</hi> Nobility courted
               his acquaintance; in vain the Ladies made use of their utmost Artifice to engage him:
               He prefer’d a solitary Walk, a lonely Shade, or the<pb n="145"/> Bank of some purling Stream,
               where he undisturb’d might contemplate on his belov’d <hi rend="italic"
               >Melliora</hi>, to all the noisy Pleasures of the Court, or the endearments of the
               inviting Fair. In fine, he shun’d as much as possible all Conversation with the Men,
               or Correspondence with the Women; returning all their <hi rend="italic"
                  >Billet-Doux</hi>, of which scarce a Day past, without his receiving some,
               unanswer’d.</p>
            <p>This manner of Behaviour in a little time deliver’d him from the Persecutions of the
               Discreet; but having receiv’d one Letter which he had us’d as he had done the rest,

            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> order’d one of his Servants to deliver this Letter
               to the Person who brought the other; but he return’d immediately with it in his Hand,
               and told his Lordship that he cou’d not prevail on the Fellow to take it; that he
               said he had business with the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>,<pb n="148"/> and must needs see
               him, and was so Importunate, that he seem’d rather to <hi rend="italic">Demand</hi>,
               than <hi rend="italic">Entreat</hi> a Grant of his Request. D’elmont was astonish’d,
               as well he might, but commanded he should be admitted.</p>
            <p>Nothing cou’d be more comical than the appearance of this Fellow, he seem’d to be
               about three-score Years of Age, but Time had not been the greatest Enemy to his Face,
               for the Number of Scars, was far exceeding that of Wrincles, he was tall above the
               common Stature, but so lean, that, till he spoke, he might have been taken for one of
               those Wretches who have pass’d the Hands of the Anatomists, nor wou’d his Walk have
               dissipated that Opinion, for all his Motions, as he enter’d the Chamber, had more of
               the Air of Clock-work, than of Nature; his Dress was not less particular; he had on a
               Suit of Cloaths, which might perhaps have been good in the Days of his Great
               Grand-father, but the Person who they fitted must have been five times larger about
               the Body than him who wore them; a large broad buff Belt however remedy’d that
               Inconvenience, and girt them close about his Waste, in which hung a Faulchion, two
               Daggers, and a Sword of a more than ordinary Extent; the rest of his Equipage was a
               Cloak, which buttoning round his Neck fell not so low as his Hips, a Hat, which in
               rainy weather kept his Shoulders dry much better than an <hi rend="italic"
                  >Indian</hi> Umbrella, one Glove, and a formidable pair of Whiskers. As soon as he
               saw the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>, my Lord, said he, with a very impudent Air, my
               Orders were to bring your self, not a Letter from you, nor do I use to be employ’d in
               Affairs of this Nature, but to serve one of the richest and most beautiful Ladies in
                  <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi>, who I assure you, it will be dangerous to disoblige.
                  <hi rend="italic">D’elmont</hi> ey’d him intentively all the time he spoke, and
               cou’d scarce, notwithstanding his Chagreen, forbear Laughing at the Figure he made,
               and the manner of his Salutation. I know not, answer’d he, Ironically, what
               Employments you have been us’d to, but certainly you appear to me, one<pb n="149"/> of the
               most unfit Persons in the World for what you now undertake, and if the Contents of
               the Paper you brought me, had not inform’d me of your Abilities this Way, I should
               never have suspected you for one of <hi rend="italic">Cupid</hi>’s Agents: You are
               merry, my Lord, reply’d the other, but I must tell you, I am a Man of Family and
               Honour, and shall not put up an Affront; but, continued he, shaking the few Hairs
               which frequent Skirmishes had left upon his Head, I shall defer my own satisfaction
               ’till I have procur’d the Ladies; therefore, if your Lordship will prepare to follow,
               I shall walk before, at a perceivable Distance, and without St. <hi rend="italic"
                  >Peter</hi>’s Key, open the Gate of Heaven. I should be apt (said the <hi
                  rend="italic">Count</hi>, not able to keep his Countenance at these Words) rather
               to take it for the other Place; but be it as it will; I have not the least
               Inclination to make the Experiment, therefore, you may walk as soon as you please
               without expecting me to accompany you. Then you absolutely refuse to go (cry’d the
               Fellow, clapping his Hand on his Forhead, and staring at him, as if he meant to scare
               him into Compliance!) Yes (answer’d the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>, laughing more
               and more) I shall neither go, nor waste any farther time or Words with you, so wou’d
               advise you not to be saucy, or tarry till my Anger gets the better of my Mirth, but
               take the Letter and be gone, and trouble me no more. The other, at these Words laid
               his Hand on his Sword, and was about to make some very impudent Reply, when <hi
                  rend="italic">D’elmont</hi>, growing weary of his Impertinence, made a Sign to his
               Servants, that they should turn him out, which he perceiving, took up the Letter
               without being bid a second time, and muttering some unintelligible Curses between his
               Teeth, march’d out, in the same affected Strut, with which he enter’d.</p>
            <p>This Adventure, tho’ surprizing enough to a Person so entirely unacquainted with the
               Character and Behaviour of these <hi rend="italic">Bravo</hi>’s, as <hi rend="italic"
                  >D’elmont</hi> was, gave him but very little matter of Reflection, and it
               being<pb n="150" /> the time for Evening Service at St. <hi rend="italic">Peter</hi>’s, he
               went, according to his Custom, to hear <hi rend="italic">Vesper</hi>’s there.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more Common, than for the Nobility and Gentry of <hi rend="italic"
                  >Rome</hi>, to divert themselves with Walking, and talking to one another in the
                  <hi rend="italic">Collonade</hi> after Mass, and the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>,
               tho’ averse to all other publick Assemblies, wou’d sometimes spend an Hour or two
               there.</p>
            <p>As he was walking there this Evening, a Lady of a very gallant Mein pass’d swiftly by
               him, and flurting out her Handkerchief with a careless Air, as it were by Chance,
               drop’d an <hi rend="italic">Agnus Dei</hi> set round with Diamonds at his Feet, he
               had too much Complaisance to neglect endeavouring to overtake the Lady, and prevent
               the Pain he imagin’d she wou’d be in, when she shou’d miss so rich a Jewel: But she,
               who knew well enough what she had done, left the Walk where the Company were, and
               cross’d over to the Fountain, which being more retir’d was the most proper for her
               Design: She stood looking on the Water, in a thoughtful Posture, when the <hi
                  rend="italic">Count</hi> came up to her, and bowing, with an Air peculiar to
               himself, and which all his Chagreen could not deprive of an irresistable Power of
               attraction, Presented the <hi rend="italic">Agnus Dei</hi> to her. I think my self,
               Madam, said he, highly indebted to Fortune, for making me the means of your
               recovering a Jewel, the Loss of which wou’d certainly have given you some disquiet:
               Oh Heavens! cry’d she, receiving it with an affected Air of Surprize, could a Trifle
               like this, which I knew not that I had let fall, nor perhaps shou’d have thought on
               more, cou’d this, and belonging to a Woman too, meet the Regard of him, who prides in
               his Insensibility? Him! Who has no Eyes for Beauty, nor no Heart for Love! As she
               spoke these Words she contriv’d to let her Vail fall back as if by Accident, and
               discover’d a Face, Beautiful even to Perfection! Eyes black and sparkling, a Mouth
               form’d to Invite, a Skin dazlingly white, thro’ which<pb n="151"/> a most delightful Bloom
               diffus’d a chearful Warmth, and glow’d in amorous Blushes on her Cheeks. The <hi
                  rend="italic">Count</hi> could not forbear gazing on her with Admiration, and
               perhaps, was, for a Moment, pretty near receeding from that Insensibility she had
               reproach’d him with; but the Image of Melliora, yet unenjoy’d, all ravishingly Kind
               and Tender, rose presently in his Soul, fill’d all his Faculties, and left no Passage
               free for rival Charms. Madam, said he after a little Pause, the <hi rend="italic"
                  >Italian</hi> Ladies take care to skreen their too dazling Lustre behind a Cloud,
               and, if I durst take that Liberty, have certainly reason to Tax your Accusation of
               Injustice; he, on whom the Sun has never vouchsafed to shine, ought not to be
               condemn’d for not acknowledging its brightness; yours is the first Female Face I have
               beheld, since my Arrival here, and it wou’d have been as ridiculous to have feign’d
               my self susceptible of Charms which I had never seen, as it wou’d be Stupidity, not
               to confess those I now do, worthy Adoration. Well, resum’d she smiling, if not the
                  <hi rend="italic">Lover</hi>’s, I find, you know how to Act the <hi rend="italic"
                  >Courtier</hi>’s Part, but continued she, looking languishingly on him, all you
               can say, will scarce make me believe, that there requires not a much brighter Sun
               than mine, to Thaw a certain Frozen <hi rend="italic">Resolution</hi>, you pretend to
               have made. There need no more to confirm the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> in the
               Opinion he had before conceiv’d, that this was the Lady from whom he had receiv’d the
               two Letters that Day, and thought he had now the fairest Opportunity in the World to
               put an End to her Passion, by assuring her how impossible it was for him ever to
               return it, and was forming an Answer to that purpose; when a pretty deal of Company
               coming toward them, she drew her Vail over her Face, and turning hastily from him,
               mingled with some Ladies, who seem’d to be of her Acquaintance.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> knew by experience, the unutterable Perturbations of
               Suspence, and what agonizing Tortures rend an amorous Soul, divided betwixt Hope<pb n="152"/>
               and Fear: Despair itself is not so Cruel as Uncertainty, and in all Ills, especially
               in those of Love, it is less Misery to <hi rend="italic">Know</hi>, than <hi
                  rend="italic">Dread</hi> the worst. The Remembrance of what he had suffer’d thus
               agitated, in the Beginning of his Passion for <hi rend="italic">Melliora</hi>, made
               him extreamly pity the unknown Lady, and regret her sudden Departure; because it had
               prevented him from setting her into so much of his Circumstances, as he believ’d were
               necessary to induce her to recall her Heart. But when he consider’d how much he had
               struggled, and how far he had been from being able to repel Desire, he began to
               wonder that it cou’d ever enter into his Thoughts that there was even a possibility
               for <hi rend="italic">Woman</hi>, so much stronger in her Fancy, and weaker in her
               Judgment, to suppress the Influence of that powerful Passion; against which, no Laws,
               no Rules, no Force of Reason, or Philosophy, are sufficient Guard.</p>
            <p>These Reflections gave no small Addition to his Melancholy; <hi rend="italic"
                  >Amena</hi>’s Retirement from the World; <hi rend="italic">Alovisa</hi>’s Jealousy
               and Death; <hi rend="italic">Melliora</hi>’s Peace of Mind and Reputation, and the
               Despair of several, whom he was sensible, the Love of him, had rendred miserable,
               came fresh into his Memory, and he look’d on himself as most unhappy, in being the
               occasion of making others so.</p>
            <p>The Night which succeeded this Day of Adventures, chancing to be abroad pretty late;
               as he was passing thro’ a Street, he heard a Clashing of Swords, and going nearer to
               the place where the Noise was, he perceiv’d by some Lights which glimmer’d from a
               distant Door, a Gentleman defending himself with much Bravery against Three, who
               seem’d eager for his Death. <hi rend="italic">D’elmont</hi> was mov’d to the highest
               Indignation at the sight of such Baseness; and drawing his Sword, flew furiously on
               the Assassins, just as one of them was about to run his Sword into the Breast of the
               Gentleman; who, by the breaking of his own Blade, was left unarm’d. <hi rend="italic"
                  >Turn Villain</hi>, cry’d D’elmont, <hi rend="italic">or while you are acting that
                     Inhumanly, receive<pb n="153"/> the just Reward of it from me</hi>. The Ruffian fac’d
               about immediately, and made a Pass at him, while one of his Comrades did the same on
               the other side; and the third was going to execute on the Gentleman, what his fellows
               Surprize had made him leave undone: But he now gain’d Time to pull a Pistol out of
               his Pocket, with which he shot him in a Moment dead, and snatching his Sword from him
               as he fell, ran to assist the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>, who ’tis likely wou’d
               have stood in need of it, being engag’d with two, and those the most desparate sort
               of <hi rend="italic">Bravo’s</hi>, Villains that make a Trade of Death. But the Noise
               of the Pistol made them apprehensive there was a farther Rescue, and put ’em to
               flight. The Gentleman seem’d agitated with a more than ordinary Fury; and instead of
               staying to Thank the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>, or enquire how he had escap’d, ran
               in pursuit of those who had assaulted him, so swiftly, that it was in vain for the
                  <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>, not being well acquainted with the Turnings of the
               Streets, to attempt to follow him, if he had a Mind to it: But seeing there was a Man
               kill’d, and not knowing either the Persons who fought, or the occasion of their
               Quarrel, he rightly judg’d, that being a Stranger in the place, his Word wou’d not be
               very readily taken in his own Vindication; therefore thought his wisest Course wou’d
               be to make off, with what Speed he cou’d, to his Lodging. While he was considering,
               he saw something on the Ground which glitter’d extreamly; and taking it up, found
               that it was part of the Sword which the assaulted Gentleman had the Misfortune to
               have broke: The Hilt was of a fine Piece of Agate, set round on the Top with
               Diamonds, which made him believe the Person whom he had preserv’d, was of
               considerable Quality, as well as Bravery.</p>
            <p>He had not gone many Paces from the place where the Skirmish happened, before a Cry
               of Murder met his Ears, and a great Concourse of People his Eyes: He had receiv’d two
               or three slight Wounds, which,<pb n="154"/> tho’ not much more than Skin-deep, had made his
               Linnen bloody, and he knew wou’d be sufficient to make him be apprehended, if he were
               seen, which it was very difficult to avoid: He was in a narrow Street, which had no
               Turning, and the Crowd was very near him, when looking round him with a good deal of
               Vexation in his Thoughts, he discern’d a Wall, which in one part of it seem’d pretty
               low: He presently resolv’d to climb it, and trust to Fortune for what might befall
               him on the other side, rather than stay to be expos’d to the Insults of the
               Outrageous Mob; who, ignorant of his Quality, and looking no farther than the outside
               of Things, wou’d doubtless have consider’d him no otherwise, than a Midnight <hi
                  rend="italic">Rioter</hi>.</p>
            <p>When he was got over the Wall, he found himself in a very fine Garden, adorn’d with
               Fountains, Statues, Groves, and every Ornament, that Art, or Nature, cou’d produce,
               for the Delight of the Owner: At the upper End there was a Summer-house, into which
               he went, designing to stay ’till the Search was over.</p>
            <p>But He had not been many Moments in his Concealment before he saw a Door open from
               the House, and two Women come out; they walk’d directly up to the place where he was;
               he made no doubt but that they design’d to enter, and retir’d into the farthest
               Corner of it: As they came pretty near, he found they were earnest in Discourse, but
               cou’d understand nothing of what they said, ’till she, who seem’d to be the Chief,
               raising her Voice a little higher than she had done: Talk no more, <hi rend="italic"
                  >Brione</hi> said she, if e’re thy Eyes are Blest to see this Charmer of my Soul,
               thou wil’t cease to wonder at my Passion; great as it is, ’tis wanting of his
               Merit.----Oh! He is more than Raptur’d Poets feign, or Fancy can invent! Suppose Him
               so, (<hi rend="italic">cry’d the other</hi>,) yet still he wants that Charm which
               shou’d Endear the others to you---Softness,---Heavens! To Return your Letters! To
               Insult your Messenger! To slight such Favours as any Man of Soul wou’d die to<pb n="155"/>
               obtain! Methinks such Usage shou’d make him odious to you,---even I shou’d scorn so
               spiritless a Wretch. Peace, thou Prophaner, <hi rend="italic">said the Lady in an
                  angry Tone</hi>, such Blasphemy deserves a Stab----But thou hast never heard his
               Voice, nor seen his Eyes, and I forgive Thee. Have you then spoke to him, <hi
                  rend="italic">interrupted the Confidant</hi>, Yes, <hi rend="italic">answer’d the
                  Lady</hi>, and by that Conversation, am more undone than ever; it was to tell thee
               this Adventure, I came to Night into this agreeable Solitude. With these Words they
               came into the Summer-house, and the Lady seating her self on a Bench; Thou know’st,
                  <hi rend="italic">resum’d she</hi>, I went this Evening to Saint <hi rend="italic"
                  >Peter</hi>’s, there I saw the glorious Man; saw him in all his Charms; and while
               I bow’d my Knee, in show to Heaven, my Soul was prostrate only to him. When the
               Ceremony was over, perceiving he stay’d in the <hi rend="italic">Collonade</hi>, I
               had no power to leave it, but stood, regardless who observ’d me, gazing on him with
               Transports, which only those who Love like me, can guess!---God! With what an Air he
               walk’d! What new Attractions dwelt in every Motion---And when he return’d the Salutes
               of any that pass’d by him, how graceful was his Bow! How lofty his Mein, and yet, how
               affable!----A sort of an inexpressible awful Grandeur, blended with tender
               Languishments, strikes the amaz’d Beholder at once with Fear and Joy!---Something
               beyond Humanity shines round him! Such looks descending Angels wear, when sent on
               Heavenly Embassies to some Favourite Mortal! Such is their Form! Such Radient Beams
               they dart; and with such Smiles they temper their Divinity with Softness!---Oh! With
               what Pain did I restrain my self from flying to him! from rushing into his Arms! From
               hanging on his Neck, and wildly uttering all the furious Wishes of my burning
               Soul!-----I trembled-----panted----rag’d with inward Agonies. Nor was all the Reason
               I cou’d muster up, sufficient to bear me from his Sight, without having first spoke
               to him. To that end I ventur’d to pass by him, and drop’d an <hi rend="italic"
                  >Agnus<pb n="156"/> Dei</hi> at his Feet, believing that wou’d give him an Occasion of
               following me, which he did immediately, and returning it to me, discover’d a new
               Hoard of unimagin’d Charms----All my fond Soul confess’d before of his Perfections,
               were mean to what I now beheld! Had’st thou but seen how he approach’d me--with what
               an awful Reverence---with what a soft beseeching, yet commanding Air, he kiss’d the
               happy Trifle, as he gave it me, thou would’st have envy’d it as well as I! At last he
               spoke, and with an Accent so Divine, that if the sweetest Musick were compar’d to the
               more Celestial Harmony of his Voice, it wou’d only serve to prove how vastly <hi
                  rend="italic">Nature</hi> do’s excell all <hi rend="italic">Art</hi>. But, Madam,
                  <hi rend="italic">cry’d the other</hi>, I am impatient to know the End of this
               Affair; for I presume you discover’d to him both what, and who you were? My Face
               only, reply’d the Lady, for e’re I had opportunity to do more, that malicious
               Trifler, <hi rend="italic">Violetta</hi>, perhaps envious of my Happiness, came
               toward us with a Crowd of Impertinents at her Heels. Curse on the Interruption, and
               broke off our Conversation, just at that Blest, but Irrecoverable Moment, when I
               perceiv’d in my Charming Conqueror’s Eyes, a growing Tenderness, sufficient to
               encourage me to reveal my own. Yes, <hi rend="italic">Brione</hi>, those lovely Eyes,
               while fix’d on mine, shone, with a Lustre, uncommon, even to themselves---A livelier
               Warmth o’erspread his Cheeks----Pleasure sat smiling on his Lips----those Lips, my
               Girl, which even when they are silent, speak; but when unclos’d, and the sweet Gales
               of balmy Breath blow on you, he kills you in a Sigh; each hurry’d Sense is ravish’d
               and your Soul glows with Wonder and Delight. Oh! To be forc’d to leave him in this
               Crisis, when new desire began to dawn; when Love its most lively Symptoms was
               apparent, and seem’d to promise all my Wishes covet, what Separation ever was so
               cruel? Compose your self, dear Madam, said <hi rend="italic">Brione</hi>, if he be
               really in Love; as who so Insensible as not to be so, that once has seen your<pb n="157"/>
               Charms? That <hi rend="italic">Love</hi> will teach him speedily to find out an
               opportunity as favourable as that which you have lately miss’d; or if he shou’d want
               Contrivance to procure his own Happiness, ’tis but your writing to appoint a Meeting.
               He must---He shall be mine! Cry’d the Lady in a Rapture, My Love, fierce as it was
               before, from Hope receives Addition to its Fury; I rave---I burn---I am mad with wild
               Desires---I die, <hi rend="italic">Brione</hi>, if I not possess him. In speaking
               these Words, she threw her self down on a Carpet which was spread upon the Floor; and
               after sighing two or three times, continued to discover the Violence of her impatient
               Passion in this manner: Oh that this Night, said she, were past,---the Blisful
               Expectation of to morrows Joys, and the distracting Doubts of Disappointment, swell
               my unequal beating Heart by turns, and rack me with Vicissitudes of Pain-----I cannot
               live and bear it----soon as the Morning breaks, I’ll know my Doom----I’ll send to
               him----but ’tis an Age till then----Oh that I cou’d sleep---Sleep might perhaps
               anticipate the Blessing, and bring him in Idea to my Arms----but ’tis in vain to hope
               one Moment’s cool Serenity in Love like mine--my anxious Thoughts hurry my Senses in
               Eternal Watchings!---Oh <hi rend="italic">D’elmont! D’elmont!</hi> Tranquill, Cold,
               and Calm <hi rend="italic">D’elmont!</hi> Little doest thou guess the Tempest thou
               hast rais’d within my Soul, nor know’st to pity these consuming Fires!</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> list’ned to all this Discourse with a World of
               Uneasiness and Impatience; and tho’ at the first he fancy’d he remember’d the Voice,
               and had Reason enough from the beginning, especially when the <hi rend="italic">Agnus
                  Dei</hi> was mention’d, to believe it cou’d be no other than himself, whom the
               Lady had so passionately describ’d; yet he had not Confidence to appear till she had
               nam’d him; but then, no consideration was of force to make him neglect this
               opportunity of undeceiving her; his good Sense, as well as good Nature, kept him from
               that Vanity, too many of his Sex imitate<pb n="158"/> the weaker in, of being pleas’d that it
               was in his Power to create Pains, which it was not in his Power, so devoted as he
               was, to Ease.</p>
            <p>He stept from his Retirement as softly as he cou’d, because he was loath to alarm
               them with any Noise, ’till they shou’d discover who it was that made it, which they
               might easily do, in his advancing toward them never so little, that part of the Bower
               being much lighter than that where he had stood; but with his over-caution in sliding
               his Feet along, to prevent being heard, one of them tangled in the Corner of the
               Carpet, which happened not to lie very smooth, and not being sensible presently what
               it was that Embarrass’d him: He fell with part of his Body cross the Lady, and his
               Head in <hi rend="italic">Brione</hi>’s Lap, who was sitting on the Ground by her.
               The Manner of his Fall was lucky enough, for it hinder’d either of them from rising,
               and running to alarm the Family, as certainly in such a fright they wou’d have done,
               if his Weight had not detain’d them; they both gave a great Shriek, but the House
               being at a good distance, they cou’d not easily be heard; and he immediately
               recovering himself, beg’d Pardon for the Terror he had occasion’d them; and
               addressing to the Lady, who at first was dying with her Fears, and now with
               Consternation: <hi rend="italic">D’elmont</hi>, Madam, said he, cou’d not have had
               the Assurance to appear before you, after hearing those undeserv’d Praises your
               Excess of Goodness has been pleas’d to bestow upon him, but that his Soul wou’d have
               reproach’d him of the highest Ingratitude, in permitting you to continue longer in an
               Error, which may involve you in the greatest of Misfortunes, at least I am----As he
               was speaking, three or four Servants with Lights came running from the House; and the
               Lady, tho’ in more Confusion than can be well exprest, had yet Presence of Mind
               enough to bid the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> retire to the place where he had stood
               before, while she and <hi rend="italic">Brione</hi> went out of the Summer-house to
               learn the Cause of this<pb n="159"/> Interruption: Madam, cry’d one of the Servants, as soon
               as he saw her, the Officers of Justice are within; who being rais’d by an Alarm of
               Murther, come to beg your Ladyships Permission to search your Garden, being, as they
               say, inform’d that the Offender made his Escape over this Wall. ’Tis very improbable,
               reply’d the Lady, for I have been here a considerable Time, and have neither heard
               the least Noise, nor seen any Body: However they may search, and satisfy
               themselves----go you, and tell them so. Then turning to the <hi rend="italic"
                  >Count</hi>, when she had dismiss’d her Servants; My Lord, said she Trembling, I
               know not what strange Adventure brought you here to Night, or whether you are the
               Person for whom the Search is made; but am sensible, if you are found here, it will
               be equally injurious to your Safety, and my Reputation; I have a Back-door, thro’
               which you may pass in Security: But, if you have Honour, (continu’d she) Sighing,
               Gratitude, or good Nature, you will let me see you to morrow Night. Madam, (reply’d
               he,) assure your self that there are not many things I more earnestly desire than an
               opportunity to convince you, how sensibly I am touch’d with your Favours, and how
               much I regret my want of Power to---you, (interrupted she,) can want nothing but the
                  <hi rend="italic">Will</hi> to make me the happiest of my Sex---but this is no
               Time for you to <hi rend="italic">Give</hi>, or me to <hi rend="italic">Receive</hi>
               any Proofs of that Return which I expect----Once more I conjure you to be here to
               morrow Night at Twelve, where the Faithful <hi rend="italic">Brione</hi> shall attend
               to admit you. Farewell---be punctual and sincere--’Tis all I ask---when I am not,
               (answer’d he,) may all my Hopes forsake me. By this time they were come to the Door,
               which <hi rend="italic">Brione</hi>, opening softly, let him out, and shut it again
               immediately.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> took care to Remark the place that he might know it
               again, resolving nothing more than to make good his Promise at the appointed Hour,
               but<pb n="160"/> cou’d not help being extreamly troubled, when he consider’d how unwelcome
               his Sincerity wou’d be, and the Confusion he must give the Lady, when instead of
               those Raptures the Violence of her mistaken Passion made her hope, she shou’d meet
               with only cold Civility, and the killing History of the Pre-engagement of his Heart.
               In these and the like melancholly Reflections he spent the Night; and when Morning
               came, receiv’d the severest Augmentation of them, which Fate cou’d load him with.</p>
            <p>It was scarce full Day when a Servant came into his Chamber to acquaint him, that a
               young Gentleman, a Stranger, desir’d to be admitted, and seem’d so impatient till he
               was, That, said the Fellow, not knowing of what Consequence his Business may be, I
               thought it better to Risque your Lordship’s Displeasure for this early Disturbance,
               than by dismissing him, fill you with an unsatisfy’d Curiosity. The <hi rend="italic"
                  >Count</hi> was far from being Angry, and commanded that the Gentleman should be
               brought up, which Order being immediately obey’d, and the Servant withdrawn out of
               Respect: Putting his Head out of the Bed, he was surpriz’d with the Appearance of one
               of the most beautiful <hi rend="italic">Chevaliers</hi> he had ever beheld, and in
               whose Face, he imagin’d he trac’d some Features not Unknown to him. Pardon, me Sir,
               said he, throwing the Curtains more back than they were before, that I receive the
               Honour you do me, in this manner---but being ignorant of your Name, Quality, the
               Reason of your desire to see me, or any thing but your Impatience to do so, in
               gratifying that, I fear, I have injur’d the Respect, which I believe, is due, and
               which, I am sure, my Heart is inclinable to pay to you. Visits, like mine, reply’d
               the Stranger, require but little Ceremony, and I shall easily remit that Respect you
               talk of, while I am unknown to you, provided you will give me one Mark of it, that I
               shall ask of you, when you do. There are very few, reply’d<pb n="161"/>
               <hi rend="italic">D’elmont</hi>, that I cou’d refuse to one, whose Aspect Promises to
               deserve so many. First then, cry’d the other pretty warmly, I demand a Sister of you,
               and not only her, but a Reparation of her Honour, which can be done no otherwise than
               by your Blood. It is impossible to represent the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>’s
               astonishment at these Words, but conscious of his Innocence in any such Affair: I
               shou’d be sorry <hi rend="italic">Seignior</hi>, said he cooly, that Precipitation
               should hurry you to do any Action you wou’d afterwards Repent; you must certainly be
               mistaken in the Person to whom you are talking--Yet, if I were rash like you, what
               fatal Consequences might ensue; but there is something in your Countenance which
               engages me to wish a more friendly Interview than what you speak of: Therefore wou’d
               persuade you to consider calmly, and you will soon find, and acknowledge your
               Mistake; and, to further that Reflection, I assure you, that I am so far from
               Conversing with any Lady, in the Manner you seem to hint, that I scarcely know the
               Name, or Face of any one.---Nay, more, I give you my Word, to which I joyn my Honour,
               that, as I never <hi rend="italic">have</hi>, I never <hi rend="italic">will</hi>
               make the least Pretensions of that kind to any Woman during the Time of my Residence
               here. This poor Evasion, reply’d the Stranger with a Countenance all inflam’d, ill
               suits a Man of Honour.---This is no <hi rend="italic">Roman</hi>, no, <hi
                  rend="italic">Italian Bono-Roba</hi>, who I mean----but <hi rend="italic"
                  >French</hi> like you----like both of us.----And if your Ingratitude had not made
               it necessary for your Peace, to erace all Memory of <hi rend="italic">Monsieur
                  Frankville</hi>, you wou’d before now, by the near resemblance I bear to him, have
               known me for his Son, and that ’tis <hi rend="italic">Melliora</hi>’s---the
               fond---the lost---the ruin’d <hi rend="italic">Melliora</hi>’s Cause which calls for
               Vengeance from her Brother’s Arm! Never was any Soul agitated with more violent
               Emotions, than that of Count <hi rend="italic">D’elmont</hi> at these Words. Doubt,
               Grief, Resentment, and Amazement, made such a Confusion in his Thoughts, that he was
               unable for some Moments to answer this cruel Accusation; and when he did, the Brother of<pb n="162"/>
               <hi rend="italic">Melliora</hi> said he with a deep Sigh, wou’d certainly have been,
               next to her self, the most welcome Person upon Earth to me; and my Joy to have
               Embrac’d him as the dearest of my Friends, at least have equall’d the Surprize I am
               in, to find him without Cause, my Enemy.---But, Sir, if such a Favour may be granted
               to an unwilling Foe, I wou’d desire to know, Why you joyn <hi rend="italic">Ruin</hi>
               to your Sisters Name? Oh! Give me Patience Heaven, cry’d young <hi rend="italic"
                  >Frankville</hi> more enrag’d; is this a Question fit for you to ask, or me to
               Answer? Is not her Honour Tainted---Fame betray’d.---Her self a Vagabond, and her
               House abus’d, and all by you; the unfaithful Guardian of her injur’d Innocence?---And
               can you ask the Cause?----No, rather rise this Moment, and if you are a Man, who dare
               maintain the ill you have done, defend it with your Sword; not with vain Words and
               Womanish Excuses: All the other Passions which had warr’d within <hi rend="italic"
                  >D’elmont</hi>’s Breast, now gave way to Indignation: Rash young Man, said he,
               jumping hastily out of the Bed, and beginning to put his Cloaths on: Your Father
               wou’d not thus have us’d me; nor, did he Live, cou’d blame me, for vindicating as I
               ought my wounded Honour----That I do Love your Sister, is as True, as that you have
               wrong’d me---Basely wrong’d me. But that her Virtue suffers by that Love, is false!
               And I must write the Man that speaks it, <hi rend="italic">Lyar</hi>, tho’ in her
               Brother’s Heart. Many other violent Expressions to the same Effect, pass’d between
               them, while the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> was dressing himself, for he wou’d
               suffer no Servant to come in, to be Witness of his Disorder. But the steady
               Resolution with which he had attested his Innocence, and that inexpressible sweetness
               of Deportment, equally Charming to both Sexes, and which, not even <hi rend="italic"
                  >Anger</hi> cou’d render less graceful, extreamly cool’d the Heat <hi
                  rend="italic">Frankville</hi> had been in a little before, and he in secret, began
               to recede very much from the ill Opinion he had conceiv’d, tho’ the greatness of his
               Spirit kept him from acknowledging he had been<pb n="163"/> in an Error; ’till chancing to
               cast his Eyes on a Table which stood in the Chamber, he saw the hilt of the broken
               Sword which <hi rend="italic">D’elmont</hi> had brought home the Night before, lying
               on it; he took it up, and having first look’d on it with some Confusion in his
               Countenance. My Lord, said he, turning to the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>, I conjure
               you, before we proceed further, to acquaint me truely, how this came into your
               Possession, Tho’ <hi rend="italic">D’elmont</hi> had as great a Courage, when any
               laudable Occasion appear’d to call it forth, as any Man that ever liv’d, yet his
               natural Disposition had such an uncommon Sweetness in it, as no Provocation cou’d
               sowre; it was always a much greater Pleasure to him to <hi rend="italic">Forgive</hi>
               than <hi rend="italic">Punish</hi> Injuries; and if at any time he was <hi
                  rend="italic">Angry</hi>, he was never <hi rend="italic">Rude</hi>, or <hi
                  rend="italic">Unjust</hi>. The little starts of Passion, <hi rend="italic"
                  >Frankville</hi>’s rash Behaviour had occasion’d, all dissolv’d in his more
               accustomary Softness, when he perceiv’d the other growing Calm. And answering to his
               Question, with the most obliging Accent in the World: It was my good Fortune, (said
               he) to be instrumental last Night, in the Rescue of a Gentleman who appear’d to have
               much Bravery, and being Attack’d by odds, behav’d himself in such a Manner, as wou’d
               have made him stand but little in need of my Assistance, if his Sword had been equal
               to the Arm which held it; but the breaking of that, gave me the Glory of not being
               unserviceable to him. After the Skirmish was over, I took it up, hoping it might be
               the means sometime or other of my discovering who the Person was, who wore it; not
               out of Vanity of receiving Thanks for the little I have done, but that I shou’d be
               glad of the Friendship of a Person, who seems so worthy my Esteem. Oh far! (cry’d <hi
                  rend="italic">Frankville</hi>, with a Tone and Gesture quite alter’d,) infinitely
               far from it--It was my self whom you preserv’d; that very Man whose Life you but last
               Night so generously redeem’d, with the hazard of your own, comes now prepar’d to make
               the first use of it against you---Is it possible that you can be so heavenly good to
               Pardon my wild Passions Heat? Let<pb n="164"/> this be witness, with what Joy I do, answer’d
               the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>, tenderly Embracing him, which the other eagerly
               returning; they continu’d lock’d in each others Arms for a considerable Time, neither
               of them being able to say more, than---And was it <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi> I
               Preserv’d!----And was it to <hi rend="italic">D’elmont</hi> I owe my Life!</p>
            <p>After this mutual Demonstration of a perfect Reconcilement was over: See here, my
               Lord, said <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi>, giving a Paper to the <hi rend="italic"
                  >Count</hi>, the occasion of my Rashness, and let my just concern for a Sisters
               Honour, be at least some little Mittigation of my Temerity, in accosting your
               Lordship in so rude a Manner. <hi rend="italic">D’elmont</hi> made no Answer, but
               looking hastily over the Paper found it contain’d these Words.</p>

                           would ill become the Friendship I have always profess’d to your Family,
                           to disquiet you with the Knowledge of a Misfortune, which it was no way

                           from the KING, for the Murder of his Wife; has since taken but little
                           care to conceal the Reasons which induc’d him to that barbarous Action;
                           and all Paris is now sensible that he made that unhappy Lady’s Life a
                           Sacrifice to the more attractive<pb n="165"/> Beauties of Melliora, in bloody
                           Recompence for the Sacrifice she had before made him of her

                           avoid; for none believes you will so far degenerate from the Spirit of

                           or any of the Sisterhood, with her Departure; nor is it known to any one,
                           where, or for what Cause she absconds; but most People imagine, as indeed
                           it is highly reasonable, that the Violence of her guilty Passion for

            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> swell’d with Indignation at every Paragraph of this
               malicious Letter; but when he came to that, which mention’d <hi rend="italic"
                  >Melliora</hi>’s having withdrawn her self from the Monastry, he seem’d to be
               wholly abandon’d by his Reason; all Endeavours to represent his<pb n="166"/> Agonies wou’d be
               vain, and none but those who have felt the same, can have any Notion of what he
               suffer’d. He read the fatal Scroll again and again, and every time grew wilder than
               before; he stamp’d, bit his Lips, look’d furiously about him, then, starting from the
               place where he had stood, measur’d the Room in strange, disorder’d, and unequal
               Paces; all his Motions, all his Looks, all his Air were nothing but Distraction: He
               spoke not for some time, one Word, either prevented by the rising Passions in his
               Soul, or because it was not in the Power of Language to express the greatness of his
               Meaning; and when, at last, he open’d his Mouth, it was but to utter half Sentences,
               and broken Complainings: Is it possible, he cry’d,----gone,---left the Monastry
               unknown---and then again----false----false Woman?----Wretched----wretched Man!
               There’s no such Thing on Earth as Faith---is this the Effect of all her tender
               Passion?--So soon forgot---what can be her Reason?---This Action suits not with her
               Words, or Letters. In this manner he rav’d with a Thousand such like Breathings of a
               tormented Spirit, toss’d and confounded between various Sentiments.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi> stood for a good while silently observing
               him; and if before, he were not perfectly assur’d of his Innocence, the Agonies he
               now saw him in, which were too natural to be suspected for Counterfeit, entirely
               convinc’d him he was so. When the first gust of Passion was blown over, and he
               perceiv’d any likelyhood of being heard, he said a Thousand tender and obliging
               Things to perswade him to Moderation, but to very little Effect, till finding, that
               that which gave him the most stinging Reflection was, the Belief that <hi
                  rend="italic">Melliora</hi> had forsook the Monastry, either because she thought
               of him no more, and was willing to divert her enfranchis’d Inclination with the
               Gaieties of the Town, or that some happier Man had supplanted him in her Esteem.
               Judge not, my Lord,<pb n="167"/> (said he) so rashly of my Sister’s Fidelity, nor know so
               little of your own unmatch’d Perfections, as to suspect that she, who is Blest with
               your Affection, can consider any other Object as worthy her Regard; For my part,
               since your Lordship <hi rend="italic">knows</hi>, and I firmly <hi rend="italic"
                  >believe</hi>, that this Letter contains a great many Untruths, I see no Reason
               why we should not imagine it all of a piece: I declare I think it much more
               improbable that she should leave the Monastry, unless sollicited thereto by you, than
               that she had the Power to deny you any thing your Passion might request. The <hi
                  rend="italic">Count</hi>’s Disorder visibly abated at this Remonstrance; and
               stepping hastily to his Cabinet, he took out the last Letter he receiv’d from <hi
                  rend="italic">Melliora</hi>, and found it was dated but two Days before that from
               Monsieur <hi rend="italic">Sanseverin</hi>; he knew she had not Art, nor was
               accustom’d to endeavour to disguise her Sentiments; and she had written so many
               tender things in that, as when he gave himself leave to consider, he could not,
               without believing her to be either the most Dissembling, or most fickle of her Sex,
               continue in the Opinion which had made him, a few Moments before, so uneasy, that she
               was no longer, what she always subscrib’d her self, <hi rend="italic">Entirely
                  His</hi>.</p>
            <p>The Tempest of Rage and Grief being hush’d to a little more Tranquillity, Count <hi
                  rend="italic">D’elmont</hi>, to remove all Scruples which might be <hi
                  rend="italic">yet</hi> remaining in the Breast of Monsieur <hi rend="italic"
                  >Frankville</hi>, entertain’d him with the whole History of his Adventures, from
               the Time of his Gallantry with <hi rend="italic">Amena</hi>, to the Misfortunes which
               had induc’d him to Travel, disguising nothing of the Truth, but some part of the
               Discourses which had pass’d between him and <hi rend="italic">Melliora</hi> that
               Night when he surpriz’d her in her Bed, and in the Wilderness: For tho’ he freely
               confess’d the Violence of his own unbounded Passion, had hurry’d him beyond all
               Considerations but those of gratifying it; yet he was too tender of <hi rend="italic"
                  >Melliora</hi>’s Honour, to relate anything of her,<pb n="168"/> which her Modesty might
               not acknowledge, without the Expence of a Blush.</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi> list’ned with abundance of Attention to the
               Relation he made him, and could find very little in his Conduct to accuse: He was
               himself too much susceptible of the Power of Love, not to have Compassion for those
               that suffer’d by it, and had too great a share of good Sense not to know that, that
               Passion is not to be Circumscrib’d; and being not only, not <hi rend="italic"
                  >Subservient</hi>, but absolutely <hi rend="italic">Controller</hi> of the <hi
                  rend="italic">Will</hi>, it would be meer Madness, as well as ill Nature, to say a
               Person was Blame-worthy for what was unavoidable.</p>
            <p>When Love once becomes in our Power, it ceases to be worthy of that Name; no Man
               really possest with it, <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be Master of his Actions; and
               whatever Effects it may Enforce, are no more to be Condemn’d, than Poverty, Sickness,
               Deformity, or any other Misfortune incident to Humane Nature. Methinks there is
               nothing more absur’d than the Notions of some People, who in other Things are wise
               enough too; but wanting Elegance of Thought, Delicacy, or Tenderness of Soul, to
               receive the Impression of that harmonious Passion, look on those to be mad, who have
               any Sentiments elevated above their own, and either Censure, or Laugh, at what they
               are not refin’d enough to comprehend. These <hi rend="italic">Insipids</hi>, who know
               nothing of the Matter, tell us very gravely, that we <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to
               Love with Moderation and Discretion,---and take Care that it is for our
               Interest,--that we should never place our Affections, but where Duty leads, or at
               least, where neither Religion, Reputation, or Law, may be a Hindrance to our
               Wishes.---Wretches! We know all this, as well as they; we know too, that we both do,
               and leave undone many other Things, which we ought not; but Perfection is not to be
               expected on this side the Grave: And since ’tis impossible for Humanity to avoid
               Frailties<pb n="169"/> of some kind or other, those are certainly least blamable, which
               spring only from a too great Affluence of the nobler Spirits. <hi rend="italic"
                  >Covetousness</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Envy</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Pride</hi>, <hi
                  rend="italic">Revenge</hi>, are the Effects of an Earthly, Base, and Sordid
               Nature, <hi rend="italic">Ambition</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Love</hi>, of an
               Exalted one; and if they are Failings, they are such as plead their own Excuse, and
               can never want Forgiveness from a generous Heart, provided no indirect Courses are
               taken to procure the Ends of the <hi rend="italic">former</hi>, nor Inconstancy, or
               Ingratitude, stain the Beauty of the <hi rend="italic">latter</hi>.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding all that Monsieur <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi> could say, the
                  <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>, tho’ not in the Rage of Temper he had been in, was
               yet very melancholly; which the other perceiving, Alas, my Lord, said he Sighing, if
               you were sensible of the Misfortunes of others, you would think your own more easy to
               be born: You Love, and are Belov’d; no Obstacle remains between you and your Desires;
               but the Formality of Custom, which a little time will Remove, and at your return to
                  <hi rend="italic">Paris</hi> you will doubtless be happy, if ’tis in my Sister’s
               Power to make you so: You have a sure Prospect of Felicity to <hi rend="italic"

               retriev’d. What mean you? Cry’d the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> pretty much
               surpriz’d at his Words, and the Change which he observ’d in his Countenance; I am in
               Love! Reply’d He, Belov’d! Nay, have Enjoy’d----Ay, there’s the Source of my
               Despair----I know the Heaven I have lost, and that’s my Hell.----The Interest <hi
                  rend="italic">D’elmont</hi> had in his Concerns, as being Son to the Man whom he
               had loved with a kind of filial Affection, and Brother to the Woman whom he ador’d
               above the World, made him extreamly desirous to know what the Occasion of his
               Disquiet was, and having exprest himself to that purpose; I shall make no Difficulty,
               reply’d <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi>, to reveal the Secret of my Love, to him
               who is a Lover, and knows so well, how to pity, and forgive, the Errors which that
               Passion will sometimes lead us into. The <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> was too
               impatient to hear the Relation he was about to give him,<pb n="170"/> to make any other
               Answer to these Words than with a half Smile; which the other perceiving, without any
               farther Prelude, began to satisfy his Curiosity in this manner.</p>

                     <p>You know, my Lord, said he, that I was bred at <hi rend="italic">Rheims</hi>
                        with my Uncle, the Bishop of that Place, and continu’d with him, till after,
                        prompted by Glory, and hope of that Renown you have since so gallantly
                        acquir’d; you left the Pleasures of the <hi rend="italic">Court</hi> for the
                        Fatigues and Dangers of the Field: When I came home, I never ceas’d
                        solliciting my Father to permit me to Travel, ’till weary’d with my
                        continual Importunies, and perhaps, not much displeas’d with my Thirst of
                        Improvement, he at last gave leave. I left <hi rend="italic">Paris</hi> a
                        little before the Conclusion of the Peace, and by that means remain’d wholly
                        a Stranger to your Lordship’s Person, tho’ perfectly acquainted with those
                        admirable Accomplishments which Fame is every where so full of.</p>
                     <p>I have been in the Courts of <hi rend="italic">England</hi>, <hi
                           rend="italic">Spain</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Portugal</hi>, but
                        nothing very material hapning to me in any of those Places, it would be
                        rather Impertinent, than Diverting, to defer, for Trifles, the main Business
                        of my Life, that of my Love, which had not a Being ’till I came into this
                        City.</p>
                     <p>I had been here but a little Time before I had a great many Acquaintance,
                        among the Number of them, was Seignior <hi rend="italic">Jaques Honorius
                           Cittolini</hi>: He, of all the rest, I was most intimate with; and tho’
                        to the Generality of People he behav’d himself with an Air of Imperiousness,
                        he was to me, all free, and easy; he seem’d as if he took a Pleasure in
                        Obliging me; carry’d me every where with him; introduc’d me to the best
                        Company: When I was absent he spoke of me, as of<pb n="171"/> a Person who he had
                        the highest Esteem for; and when I was present, if there were any in Company
                        whose rank oblig’d him to place them above me in the <hi rend="italic"
                           >Room</hi>; he took care to testify that I was not below them in his <hi
                           rend="italic">Respect</hi>; in fine, he was never more happy than when he
                        was giving me some Proof how much he was my Friend; and I was not a little
                        satisfy’d that a Man of almost twice my Years should believe me qualify’d
                        for his Companion in such a manner as he made me.</p>
                     <p>When the melancholly Account of my Fathers Death came to my Ears, he omitted
                        nothing to persuade me to sell my Estate in <hi rend="italic">France</hi>,
                        and settle in <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi>; he told me he had a Daughter,
                        whose Heart had been the aim of the chiefest Nobility; but that he wou’d buy
                        my Company at that Price and to keep me here, wou’d give me her. This
                        Proposition was not altogether so pleasing to me, as perhaps, he imagin’d it
                        wou’d be: I had heard much Talk or this Lady’s Beauty, but I had never seen
                        her; and at that Time, Love was little in my Thoughts, especially that sort
                        which was to end in Marriage. However, I wou’d not absolutely refuse his
                        Offer, but evaded it, which I had the better pretence for, because <hi
                           rend="italic">Violetta</hi>, (so was his Daughter call’d) was gone to <hi
                           rend="italic">Vitterbo</hi> to Visit a sick Relation, and I cou’d not
                        have the opportunity of seeing her. In the mean time, he made me acquainted
                        with his deepest Secrets; among many other Things he told me, that tho’
                        their Family was one of the greatest in <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi>, yet by
                        the too great Liberality of his Father, himself and one Sister was left with
                        very little to Support the Grandeur of their Birth; but that his Sister who
                        was acknowledg’d a Woman of an uncommon Beauty, had the good Fortune to
                        appear so, to Seignior <hi rend="italic">Marcarius Fialasco</hi>: he was the
                        possessor of immense Riches, but very Old; but the young Lady found Charms
                        enough in his Wealth to ballance all other Deficiencies; She Married, and
                        Buried him in a Month’s Time, and he dy’d so full of fondness to his lovely
                        Bride; that he left her Mistress of all he had in the<pb n="172"/> World; giving
                        only to a Daughter he had by a former Wife, the Fortune which her Mother had
                        brought him, and that too, and herself to be dispos’d of, in Marriage, as
                        this Triumphant Widow should think fit; and she, like a kind Sister, thought
                        none worthy of that Alliance, but her Brother; and in a few Days he said, he
                        did not doubt but that I shou’d see him a Bridegroom. I ask’d him if he was
                        happy enough to have made an Interest in the young Lady’s Heart; and he very
                        frankly answer’d, That he was not of a Humour to give himself much
                        uneasiness about it, since it was wholly in his Sister’s Power to make him
                        Master of her Person, and she resolv’d to do that, or Confine her in a
                        Monastry for ever. I cou’d not help feeling a Compassionate concern for this
                        Lady, tho’ she was a Stranger to me, for I cou’d not believe, so Beautiful
                        and accomplish’d a Woman, as he had often describ’d her to be, cou’d find
                        any thing in her design’d Husband which cou’d make this Match agreeable.
                        Nothing can be more different from Graceful, than the Person of <hi
                           rend="italic">Cittolini</hi>; he is of a black swarthy Complexion,
                        hook’d-Nos’d, wall Ey’d, short of Stature; and tho’ he is very Lean, the
                        worst shap’d Man I ever saw; then for his Temper, as friendly as he behav’d
                        to me, I discern’d a great deal of Treachery, and Baseness in it to others;
                        a perpetual peevishness and Pride appear’d in his Deportment to all those
                        who had any dependance on him: And I had been told by some who knew him
                        perfectly well, that his cruel Usage of his first Lady had been the means of
                        her Death; but this was none of my Business, and tho’ I pity’d the Lady, yet
                        my gratitude to him engag’d me to wish him Success in all his Undertakings.
                        ’Till one Day, unluckily both for him and me, as it has since prov’d; he
                        desir’d me to Accompany him to the House of <hi rend="italic">Ciamara</hi>,
                        for so is his Sister call’d, being, willing I suppose, that I shou’d be a
                        Witness of the extraordinary State she liv’d in; and indeed, in all the
                        Courts I had been at, I never saw any thing more Magnificent than her
                        Apartments; the vast quantity of Plate; the Richness<pb n="173"/> of the Furniture;
                        and the number of Servants attending on Her, might have made her be taken
                        rather for a Princess, than a private Woman. There was a very noble
                        Collation, and she sat at Table with us her self, a particular Favour from
                        an <hi rend="italic">Italian</hi> Lady: She is by many Years younger than
                        her Brother, and extreamly Handsome; but has, I know not what, of fierceness
                        in her Eyes, which renders her, at least to me, a Beauty, without a Charm.
                        After the Entertainment, <hi rend="italic">Cittolini</hi> took me into the
                        Gardens, which were answerable to what I had seen within, full of
                        Curiosities; at one end there was a little Building of Marble, to which he
                        led me, and entering into it, see here, <hi rend="italic">Monsieur</hi>,
                        said he, the Place where my Sister spends the greatest part of her Hours,
                        and tell me if ’tis in this kind of Diversion that the <hi rend="italic"
                           >French</hi> Ladies take Delight. I presently saw it was full of Books,
                        and guess’d those Words were design’d as a Satyr on our Ladies, whose
                        disposition to Gallantry seldom affords much time for Reading; but to make
                        as good a Defence for their Honour as I was able. <hi rend="italic"
                           >Seignior</hi>, reply’d I, it must be confest, that there are very few
                        Ladies of any Nation, who think the <hi rend="italic">Acquisition</hi> of
                        Knowledge, worth the Pains it must cost them in the <hi rend="italic"
                           >Search</hi>, but that ours is not without some Examples, that all are
                        not of that Mind; our famous <hi rend="italic">D’anois</hi>, and <hi
                           rend="italic">D’acier</hi> may evince. Well, Well, interrupted he
                        laughing; the propensity which that Sex bears to Learning is so trifling,
                        that I shall not pretend to hold any Argument on its Praise; nor did I bring
                        you here so much to engage you to Admire my Sisters manner of Amusement, as
                        to give you an Opportunity of diverting your self, while I go to pay a
                        Compliment to my Mistress; who, tho’ I have a very great Confidence in you,
                        I dare not trust with the sight of so accomplish’d a <hi rend="italic"
                           >Chevalier</hi>. With these Words he left me, and I, designing to do as
                        he had desir’d; turn’d to the Shelves to take down what Book I cou’d find
                        most suitable to my Humour; but good God! As I was tumbling them over, I saw
                        thro’ a Window which look’d into<pb n="174"/> a Garden behind the Study; tho’ both
                        belonging to one Person: A Woman, or rather Angel, coming down a Walk
                        directly opposite to where I was, never did I see in one Person such various
                        Perfections blended, never did any Woman wear so much of her Soul in her
                        Eyes, as did this Charmer: I saw that moment in her Looks, all I have since
                        experienc’d of her Genius, and her Humour; Wit, Judgment, good Nature and
                        Generosity are in her Countenance, conspicuous as in her Actions; but to go
                        about to make a Description, were to wrong her; She has Graces so peculiar,
                        that none without knowing her, can be able to conceive; and tho’ nothing can
                        be finer than her Shape, or more regular than her Features; yet those, our
                        Fancy or a <hi rend="italic">Painters</hi> Art may Copy: There is something
                        so inexpressibly striking in her Air; such a delightful Mixture of awful and
                        attractive in every little Motion, that no Imagination can come up to. But
                        if Language is too poor to paint her Charms, how shall I make you sensible
                        of the Effects of them on me! The Surprize---the Love---the Adoration which
                        this fatal View involv’d me in, but by that which, you say, your self felt
                        at the first Sight of <hi rend="italic">Melliora</hi>. I was, methought all
                        Spirit,---I beheld her with Raptures, such as we imagine Souls enjoy when
                        freed from Earth, they meet each other in the Realms of Glory; ’twas Heaven
                        to gaze upon her: But Oh! The Bliss was short, the Envious Trees obscur’d
                        her Lustre from me.---The Moment I lost Sight of her, I found my <hi
                           rend="italic">Passion</hi> by my <hi rend="italic">Pain</hi>, the <hi
                           rend="italic">Joy</hi> was vanish’d, but the <hi rend="italic">Sting</hi>
                        remain’d---I was so bury’d in Thought, that I never so much as stirr’d a
                        Step to endeavour to discover which way she went; tho’ if I had consider’d
                        the Situation of the Place, it would have been easy for me to have known,
                        there was a Communication between the two Gardens, and if I had gone but a
                        few Paces out of the Study, must have met her; but Love had for the present
                        depriv’d me of my Sences; and it but just enter’d into my Head that there
                        was a Possibility of renewing my Happiness, when I perceiv’d <hi
                           rend="italic">Cittolini</hi><pb n="175"/> returning. When he came pretty near;
                        Dear <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi>, said he, pardon my Neglect of you;
                        but I have been at <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>’s Apartment, and am told
                        she is in the lower Garden; I will but speak to her, snatch a Kiss and be
                        with you again: He went hastily by me without staying for any Answer, and it
                        was well he did so, for the Confusion I was in, had made me little able to
                        reply. His Words left me no room to hope it was any other than <hi
                           rend="italic">Camilla</hi> I had seen, and the Treachery I was guilty of
                        to my Friend, in but wishing to invade his Right, gave me a Remorse which I
                        had never known before: But these Reflections lasted not long; Love
                        generally exerts himself on these Occasions, and is never at a loss for
                        means to remove all the Scruples that may be rais’d to oppose him. Why, said
                        I to my self, should I be thus Tormented? She is not yet married, and ’tis
                        almost impossible she can with Satisfaction, ever yield to be so, to him.
                        Could I but have opportunity to Talk to her, to let her know my
                        Passion,---to endeavour to deliver her from the Captivity she is in, perhaps
                        she would not condemn my Temerity: I found a great deal of Pleasure in this
                        Thought, but I was not suffer’d to enjoy it long; <hi rend="italic"
                           >Honour</hi> suggested to me, that <hi rend="italic">Cittolini</hi> lov’d
                        me, had Oblig’d me, and that to supplant him would be Base and Treacherous:
                        But would it not be more so, cry’d the Dictates of my <hi rend="italic"
                           >Love</hi>, to permit the Divine <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi> to fall a
                        Sacrifice to one so every way undeserving of her; one who ’tis likely she
                        abhors; one who despises her Heart, so he may but possess her Fortune to
                        support his Pride, and her Person to gratify a Passion far unworthy of the
                        Name of <hi rend="italic">Love</hi>; One! who ’tis probable, when Master of
                        the one, and satiated with the other, may treat her with the utmost
                        Inhumanity. Thus, for a time, were my Thoughts at Strife; but Love at length
                        got the Victory, and I had so well compos’d my self before <hi rend="italic"
                           >Cittolini</hi>’s Return that he saw nothing of the Disorder I had been
                        in; but it was not so with him, his Countenance, at the best displeasing
                        enough, was now the perfect<pb n="176"/> Representative of Ill Nature, Malice, and
                        Discontent. <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi> had assur’d him, that nothing
                        could be more her Aversion, and that she was resolv’d, tho’ a Monastick Life
                        was what she had no Inclination to, yet she would fly to that Shelter, to
                        avoid his Bed. You may imagine, my Lord, I was Transported with an Excess of
                        Joy, when he told me this; but Love taught me to dissemble it, ’till I had
                        taken leave of him, which I made an Excuse to do, as soon as possible.</p>
                     <p>Now all that troubled me was to find an Opportunity to declare my Passion;
                        and, I confess, I was so dull in Contrivance, that tho’ it took up all my
                        Thoughts, none of them were to any purpose: Three or four Days I spent in
                        fruitless Projections, the last of which I met with a new Embarrassment; <hi
                           rend="italic">Cittolini</hi>’s Daughter was return’d, he renew’d his
                        Desires of making me his Son, and invited me the next Evening to his House,
                        where I was to be entertain’d with the sight of her; I could not well avoid
                        giving him my Promise to be there, but resolv’d in my Mind to behave my self
                        in such a manner as should make her disapprove of me. While I was thus
                        busied in Contriving how to avoid <hi rend="italic">Violetta</hi>, and
                        engage <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, a Woman wrapt up very closely in her
                        Vail came to my Lodgings, and brought me a Note, in which I found these
                        Words.</p>

                     <p>Never had I been more pleasingly surpriz’d, than at the Reading these Lines;
                        I could not imagine the Lady could have any other Reason for seeing me in
                        private, than to confess that her Heart was pre-engag’d, and disswade me
                        from taking the Advantage of her Father’s Authority, a secret Hope too,
                        sprung within my Soul, that my Adorable <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi> might
                        be with her; and after I had dismiss’d the Woman, with an Assurance that I
                        would attend her Lady, I spent my Time in vast Idea’s of approaching
                        Happiness ’till the appointed Hour arriv’d.</p>
                     <p>But how great was my Disappointment, when being admitted, I cou’d
                        distinguish, tho’ the Place was very dark, that I was receiv’d but by one,
                        and accosted by her, in a manner very different from what I expected: I know
                        not, <hi rend="italic">Monsieur</hi>, said she, how you interpret this
                        Freedom I have taken; but whatever we pretend, our Sex, of all Indignities,
                        can the least support those done to our Beauty; I am not vain enough of mine
                        to assure my self of making a Conquest of your Heart; and if the World
                        should know you have <hi rend="italic">seen</hi>, and <hi rend="italic"
                           >refus’d</hi> me, my slighted Charms would be the Theme of <hi
                           rend="italic">Mirth</hi> to those whose <hi rend="italic">Envy</hi> now
                        they are: I therefore beg, that if I am dislik’d, none but my self may know
                        it; when you have seen my Face, which you shall do immediately, give me your
                        Opinion freely; and if it is not to my Advantage, make some pretence to my
                        Father to avoid coming to our House. I protest to you, my Lord that I was so
                        much surpriz’d<pb n="178"/> at this odd kind of proceeding, that I knew not
                        presently how to Reply, which she imagining by my Silence: Come, come, <hi
                           rend="italic">Monsieur</hi>, said she, I am not yet on even Terms with
                        you, having often seen <hi rend="italic">your</hi> Face, and you wholly a
                        Stranger to <hi rend="italic">mine</hi>: But when our Knowledge of each
                        other is Mutual, I hope you will be as free in your Declaration as I have
                        been in my Request. These Words I thought were as proper for my purpose as I
                        cou’d wish, and drawing back a little, as she was about to lead me: Madam,
                        said I, since you have that Advantage, methinks it were but just, you shou’d
                        reveal what sort of Sentiments the sight of me has inspir’d, for I have too
                        much Reason from the Knowledge of my Demerit, to fear, you have no other
                        design in exposing your Charms, than to Triumph in the Captivating a Heart
                        you have already doom’d to Misery; I will tell you nothing, answer’d she, of
                           <hi rend="italic">my</hi> Sentiments ’till I have a perfect knowledge of
                           <hi rend="italic">yours</hi>. As she spoke this, she gave me her Hand to
                        conduct me out of that Place of Darkness; as we went, I had all the Concern
                        at the apprehension of being too much approv’d of by this young Lady, as I
                        shou’d have had for the contrary, if I had imagin’d who it was I had been
                        talking with, for as soon as we came out of the Grotto, I saw by the light
                        of the Moon, which shone that Night, with an uncommon Lustre, the Face which
                        in those Gardens had before so Charm’d me, and which had never since been
                        absent from my Thoughts. What Joy, what a mixture of Extacy and Wonder, then
                        fill’d my raptur’d Soul at this second view, I cou’d not presently trust my
                        Eyes, or think my Happiness was real: I gaz’d, and gaz’d again, in silent
                        Transport, for the big Bliss, surpass’d the reach of Words. What <hi
                           rend="italic">Monsieur</hi>, said she, observing my Confusion, are you
                        yet Dumb, is there any thing so dreadful in the form of <hi rend="italic"
                           >Violetta</hi>, to deprive you of your Speech? No Madam, reply’d I, ’tis
                        not <hi rend="italic">Violetta</hi> has that Power, but she, who unknowing
                        that she did so, caught at first sight the Victory o’re my Soul; she! for
                        whom I have vented so<pb n="179"/> Sighs! she for whom I languish’d and almost dy’d
                        for; while <hi rend="italic">Violetta</hi> was at <hi rend="italic"
                           >Vitterbo</hi>: She! The Divine <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi> only cou’d
                        inspire a Passion such as mine!--Oh Heavens! cry’d she, and that instant I
                        perceiv’d her lovely Face all crimson’d o’re with Blushes; is it then
                        possible that you know me, have seen me before, and that I have been able to
                        make any Impression on you? I then told her of the Visit I had made to <hi
                           rend="italic">Ciamara</hi> with <hi rend="italic">Cittolini</hi>, and how
                        by his leaving me in the Marble-Study, I had been blest with the sight of
                        her; and from his Friend became his Rival: I let her know the Conflicts my
                        Honour and my Obligations to <hi rend="italic">Cittolini</hi> had engag’d me
                        in; the thousand various Inventions Love had suggested to me, to obtain that
                        Happiness I now enjoy’d, the opportunity of declaring my self her Slave; and
                        in short, conceal’d not the least Thought, tending to my Passion, from Her.
                        She, in requital, acquainted me, that she had often seen me from her Window,
                        go into the Convent of St. <hi rend="italic">Francis</hi>, walking in the
                           <hi rend="italic">Collonade</hi> at St. <hi rend="italic">Peter</hi>’s,
                        and in several other Places, and, prompted by an extravagance of good
                        Nature, and Generosity, confess’d, that her Heart felt something at those
                        Views, very prejudicial to her Repose: That <hi rend="italic"
                        >Cittolini</hi>, always disagreeable, was now grown Odious; that the
                        Discourse she had heard of my intended Marriage with his Daughter, had given
                        her an alarm impossible to be express’d, and that, unable longer to support
                        the Pangs of undiscover’d Passion, she had writ to me in that Ladies Name,
                        who she knew I had never seen, resolving, if I lik’d her as <hi
                           rend="italic">Violetta</hi>, to own her self <hi rend="italic"
                           >Camilla</hi>, if not, to go the next Day to a Monastry, and devote to
                        Heaven those Charms which wanted force to make a Conquest where alone she
                        wish’d they shou’d.</p>
                     <p>I must leave it to your Lordship’s imagination to conceive the wild
                        tumultuous hurry of disorder’d Joy which fill’d my ravish’d Soul at this
                        Condescention; for I am now as unable to describe it, as I was then to thank
                        the Dear, the tender Author of it; but what<pb n="180"/>
                        <hi rend="italic">Words</hi> had not Power to do, <hi rend="italic"
                           >Looks</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Actions</hi> testified: I threw myself
                        at her Feet, Embrac’d her Knees, and kiss’d the Hand she rais’d me with,
                        with such a Fervor, as no false Love cou’d feign; while she, all softness,
                        all divinely Kind, yielded to the pressure of my glowing Lips, and suffer’d
                        me to take all the freedom which Honour and Modesty wou’d permit. This
                        interview was too felicitous to be easily broken off, it was almost broad
                        Day when we parted, and nothing but her Promise, that I shou’d be admitted
                        the next Night, cou’d have enabled me to take leave of her.</p>
                     <p>I went away highly satisfy’d, as I had good Reason, with my Condition, and
                        after recollecting all the tender Passages of our Conversation; I began to
                        consider after what manner I shou’d proceed with <hi rend="italic"
                           >Cittolini</hi>: To Visit and Address his Daughter, I thought, wou’d be
                        Treacherous and Deceitful to the last degree; and how to come off, after the
                        Promise I made of seeing her that Evening. I cou’d not tell; at last, since
                        Necessity oblig’d me to one I resolv’d of, the two Evils to chuse the least,
                        and rather to seem <hi rend="italic">Rude</hi>, then <hi rend="italic"
                           >Base</hi>, which I must have been, had I by counterfeiting a Desire to
                        engage <hi rend="italic">Violetta</hi>, left room for a possibility of
                        creating one in her. I therefore, writ, to <hi rend="italic">Cittolini</hi>
                        an Excuse for not waiting on Him and his Daughter, as I had promis’d,
                        telling him that I, on more serious Reflection found it wholly inconsistent,
                        either with my Circumstances, or Inclinations, to think of passing all my
                        Life in <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi>; that I thank’d him for the Honour he
                        intended me, but that it was my Misfortune, not to be capable of accepting
                        it. Thus, with all the Artifice I was Master of, I endeavour’d to sweeten
                        the bitter Pill of Refusal, but in vain; for he was so much Disgusted at it,
                        that he visited me no more: I cannot say, I had Gratitude enough to be much
                        concern’d at being compell’d to use him in this Fashion; for, since I had
                        beheld, and Ador’d <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, I cou’d consider him no
                        longer as a Friend, but as the most dangerous Enemy to my Hopes and<pb n="181"/> me.
                        All this time I spent the best part of the Nights with <hi rend="italic"
                           >Camilla</hi>; and in one of them, after giving, and receiving a thousand
                        Vows of everlasting Faith, I snatch’d a lucking Moment, and obtain’d from
                        the Dear, melting Charmer, all that my Fondest, and most eager Wishes cou’d
                        aspire to. Yes, my Lord, the soft, the trembling Fair, dissolv’d in Love;
                        yielded without Reserve, and met my Transports with an equal Ardor; and I
                        truly protest to your Lordship, that what in others, <hi rend="italic"
                           >palls</hi> Desire, added fresh <hi rend="italic">Force</hi> to mine; the
                        more I knew, the more I was Inflam’d, and in the highest Raptures of
                        Enjoyment, the Bliss was dash’d with Fears, which prov’d alas, but too
                        Prophetick, that some curst Chance might drive me from my Heaven: Therefore,
                        to secure it mine for ever, I press’d the lovely Partner of my Joys, to give
                        me leave to bring a Priest with me the next Night; who by giving a Sanction
                        to our Love, might put it past the Power of Malice to Disunite us: Here, I
                        experienc’d the greatness of her Soul, and her almost unexampled Generosity;
                        for in spite of all her Love, her Tenderness, and the unbounded
                        Condescentions she had made me, it was with all the difficulty in the World,
                        that I persuaded her to think of Marrying me without a Fortune; which by her
                        Father’s <hi rend="italic">Will</hi>, was wholly in the Disposal of <hi

                        it was utterly impossible to find any body fit for such a Business: I pass’d
                        three or four Days more, in Disquietudes too great to be exprest; I
                        saunter’d up and<pb n="187"/> down the Street where she liv’d, in hopes to see her
                        at some of the Windows, but Fortune never was so favourable to me, thus I
                        spent my Days, and left the sight of those dear Walls at Nights, but in
                        obedience to the Charge she had given me of preserving my Life.</p>
                     <p>Thus, my Lord, has the business of my Love engrossed my Hours, ever since

                        from remembring that Circumspection, which <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>
                        had enjoyn’d, and I thought of nothing but revenging the injury I imagin’d
                        you had done me: As I was coming Home, I was attack’d as you saw, when you
                        so generously preserv’d me, the just Indignation I conceiv’d at this base
                        procedure of <hi rend="italic">Cittolini</hi>’s transported me so far, as to
                        make me forget what I owed to my Deliverer, to run in pursuit of those who
                        assaulted me, but soon lost sight of them, and returning, as Gratitude and
                        Honour call’d me, to seek, and thank you for your timely Assistance, I found
                        a Throng of People about the Body of the Villain I had killed, some of them
                        were for Examining me, but finding no Wounds about me, nor any marks of the
                        Engagement I had been in, I was left at my Liberty.</p>
                     <p>Thus, my Lord, have I given you, in as brief a manner as the Changes of my

               all the way he went, a thousand Projects to communicate to <hi rend="italic"
                  >Camilla</hi> for her Escape, he was still extreamly uneasy in his Mind concerning
                  <hi rend="italic">Melliora</hi>, and long’d to be in <hi rend="italic">Paris</hi>
               to know the Truth of that Affair, but thought he cou’d not in Honour leave her
               Brother in this Embarrassment, and resolv’d to make use of all his Wit and Address to
               perswade <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi> to hazard every thing for Love, and was not a

               on <hi rend="italic">Melliora</hi>, as this Service to her Brother wou’d be. Full of
               these Reflections he found himself in the <hi rend="italic">Portico</hi> of that
               magnificent House he was to enter, and seeing a Crowd of Servants about the Door,
               desir’d to be brought to the presence of <hi rend="italic">Donna Camilla
               Fialaso</hi>, one of them, immediately conducted him into a stately Room, and leaving
               him there, told him, the Lady shou’d be made acquainted with his Request; presently
               after came in a Woman, who, tho’ very Young, seem’d to be in the nature of a <hi

               toward her as<pb n="191"/> she enter’d, but hearing somebody behind him, and turning hastily
               about, he observ’d she startled at sight of him, and appear’d so confus’d that he
               knew not what to make of her Behaviour, and when he ask’d if he might speak with <hi

                  rend="italic">Cittolini</hi>, she made no other Answer than several times, with an
               amaz’d Accent, Ecchoing the names of <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi> and <hi
                  rend="italic">Cittolini</hi>, as if not able to comprehend his Meaning; he was
               oblig’d to repeat his Words over and over before she cou’d recollect herself enough
               to tell him, that she wou’d let him know her Lady’s pleasure instantly. She left him
               in a good deal of Consternation, at the Surprize he perceiv’d the Sight of him had
               put her into, he form’d a thousand uncertain Guesses what the occasion shou’d be, but
               the Mistery was too deep for all his Penetration to fathom, and he waited with
               abundance of Impatience for her return, or the appearance of her Lady, either, of
               which, he hop’d, might give a Solution to this seeming Riddle.</p>
            <p>He attended a considerable time, and was beginning to grow excessive uneasy, at this

               approaching: She had now entirely compos’d her Countenance, and with an obliging
               Smile told him, she wou’d conduct him to her Lady. She led him thro’ several Rooms,
               all richly furnish’d and adorn’d, but far inferior to the last he came into, and in

               Embracing her entranc’d <hi rend="italic">Endimion</hi>; here, the God of soft
               Desires himself, wounded with an Arrow of his own, and snatching Kisses from the no
               less enamour’d <hi rend="italic">Psiche</hi>: betwixt every one of these Pieces hung
               a large Looking-Glass, which reach’d to the top of the Room, and out of each sprung
               several crystal Branches, containing great Wax-Tapers, so that the number of Lights
               vy’d with the Sun, and made another, and more glorious Day, than that which lately
               was withdrawn. At the upper End of this magnificent Chamber, there was a Canopy of
               Crimson Velvet, richly emboss’d, and trim’d with Silver, the Corners of which were
               supported by two golden <hi rend="italic">Cupids</hi>, with stretch’d out Wings, as
               if prepar’d to fly; two of their Hands grasp’d the extremity of the <hi rend="italic"
                  >Valen</hi>, and the other, those nearest to each other, joyn’d to hold a wreath
               of Flowers, over a Couch, which stood under the Canopy. But tho’ the Count was very
               much taken at first with what he saw, yet he was too sincere a Lover to be long
               delighted with any thing in the absence of his Mistress: How Heavenly (said he to
               himself Sighing) wou’d be this Place, if I expected <hi rend="italic">Melliora</hi>
               here! But Oh! how preferable were a Cottage blest with her, to all this Pomp and
               Grandeur with any other; this Consideration threw him into a deep Musing, which made
               him forget either where he was, or the Business which brought him there, till rous’d
               from it by the dazling Owner of this sumptuous Apartment. Nothing could be more
               glorious than her Appearance; she was by Nature, a Woman of a most excellent Shape,
               to which, her desire of Pleasing, had made her add all<pb n="193"/> the aids of Art; she was
               drest in a Gold and Silver stuff Petticoat, and a Wastcoat of plain blew Sattin, set
               round the Neck and Sleeves, and down the Seams with Diamonds, and fastned on the
               Breast, with Jewels of a prodigeous largeness and lustre; a Girdle of the same
               encompass’d her Waste; her Hair, of which she had great quantity, was black as Jet,
               and with a studied Negligence, fell part of it on her Neck in careless Ringlets, and
               the other was turn’d up, and fasten’d here and there with Bodkins, which had pendant
               Diamonds hanging to ’em, and as she mov’d, glittered with a quivering Blaze, like
               Stars darting their fires from out a sable Sky; she had a Vail on, but so thin, that
               it did not, in the least, obscure the shine of her Garments, or her Jewels, only she
               had contriv’d to double that part of it which hung over her Face, in so many folds,
               that it serv’d to conceal her as well as a <hi rend="italic">Vizard</hi> Mask.</p>
            <p>The Count made no doubt but this was the Lady for whom he waited, and throwing off
               that melancholly Air he had been in, assum’d one, all gay and easy, and bowing low,
               as he advanc’d to meet her; Madam, said he, if you are that incomparable <hi
                  rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, whose Goodness nothing but her Beauty can equalize,
               you will forgive the intrusion of a Stranger, who confesses himself no other way
               worthy of the Honour of your Conversation, but by his Desires to serve him who is
               much more so: A Friend of <hi rend="italic">Cittolini</hi>’s, answer’d she, can never
               want admittance here, and if you had no other Plea, the Name you come in, is a
               sufficient Warrant for your kind Reception: I hope, resum’d he in a low Voice, and
               looking round to see if there were no Attendants in hearing, I bring a Better, from
                  <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi>, Madam, the adoring <hi rend="italic"
                  >Frankville</hi>, I have these Credentials to Justify my Visit; in speaking this,
               he deliver’d the Letter to her, which she retiring a few Paces from him to read, gave
               him an opportunity of admiring the Majesty of her Walk,<pb n="194"/> and the agreeable
               loftiness of her Mein, much more than he had time to do before.</p>
            <p>She dwelt not long on the Contents of the Letter, but throwing it carelesly down on a
               Table which stood near her, turn’d to the Count, and with an Accent which express’d
               not much Satisfaction; and was it to you, my Lord! said she, that Monsieur <hi
                  rend="italic">Frankville</hi> ow’d his Preservation? I was so happy, reply’d he,
               to have some little hand in it, but since I have known how dear he is to you, think
               my self doubly blest by Fortune for the means of acting any thing conducive to your
               Peace: If you imagine that this is so, resum’d she hastily, you are extreamly
               mistaken, as you will always be, when you believe, where Count <hi rend="italic"
                  >D’elmont</hi> appears, any other Man seems worthy the regard of a discerning
               Woman; but, continu’d she, perceiving he look’d surpriz’d, to spare your suspence,
               and my self the trouble of repeating what you know already, behold who she is, you
               have been talking to, and tell me now, if <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi> has any
               Interest in a Heart to which this Face belongs? With these Words she threw off her
               Vail, and instead of lessening his Amazement, very much encreas’d it, in discovering
               the Features of the Lady, with whom he had discoursed the Night before in the Garden,
               He knew not what to think, or how to reconcile to Reason, that <hi rend="italic"
                  >Camilla</hi>, who so lately lov’d, and had granted the highest Favours to <hi
                  rend="italic">Frankville</hi>, shou’d on a sudden be willing, uncourted, to bestow
               them on another, nor cou’d he comprehend how the same Person shou’d at once live in
               two several Places, for he conceiv’d the House he was in, was far distant from the
               Garden which he had been in the Night before.</p>
            <p>They both remain’d for some Moments in a profound Silence, the Lady expecting when
               the Count shou’d speak, and he endeavouring to recollect himself enough to do so,
               ’till she, at last, possibly guessing at his Thoughts, resum’d her Discourse in this
               manner:<pb n="195"/> My Lord, said she, wonder not at the Power of Love, a Form like yours
               might soften the most rugged Heart, much more one, by Nature so tender as is
               mine.----Think but what you are, continu’d she sighing, and making him sit down by
               her on the Couch, and you will easily excuse whatever my Passion may enforce me to
               commit. I must confess Madam, answer’d he very gravely, I never in my Life wanted
               presence of mind so much as at this juncture, to see before me here, the Person, who,
               I believ’d, liv’d far from hence, who, by Appointment, I was to wait on this Night at
               a different Place.----To find in the Mistress of my Friend, the very Lady, who seems
               unworthily to have bestow’d her Heart on me, are Circumstances so Incoherent, as I
               can neither account for, or make evident to <hi rend="italic">Reason</hi>, tho’ they
               are too truly so to <hi rend="italic">Sense</hi>: It will be easy, reply’d she, to
               reconcile both these seeming Contradictions, when you shall know that the Gardens
               belonging to this House, are of a very large Extent, and not only that, but the
               turning of the Streets are so order’d, as make the Distance between the fore, and
               back Door appear much greater than really it is: And for the other, as I have already
               told you, you ought to be better acquainted with your self, than to be surpriz’d at
               Consequences which must infallibly attend such Charms: In saying this, she turn’d her
               Head a little on one side, and put her Handkerchief before her Face, affecting to
               seem confus’d at what she spoke; but the Count redned in good Earnest, and with a
               Countenance which express’d Sentiments, far different from those she endeavour’d to
               Inspire: Madam, said he, tho’ the good Opinion you have of me is owing entirely to
               the <hi rend="italic">Error</hi> of your <hi rend="italic">Fancy</hi>, which too
               often, especially in your Sex, blinds the <hi rend="italic">Judgment</hi>, yet, ’tis
               certain, that there are not many Men, whom such Praises, coming from a Mouth like
               yours, wou’d not make Happy and Vain; but if I was ever of a Humour to be so, it is
               now wholly mortify’d in me, and ’tis but with the utmost regret, that I must receive
               the Favours you confer on me to the prejudice of my<pb n="196"/> Friend: And is that,
               interrupted she hastily, is that the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> Cause? Does nothing
               but your Friendship to <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi> prevent my Wishes? That, of
               itself, answer’d he, were a sufficient Bar to sunder us for ever, but there’s
               another, if not a greater, a more tender one, which, to restore you to the Path,
               which Honour, Gratitude, and Reason call you to, I must inform you of, yes, I must
               tell you, Madam, all lovely as you are, that were there no such Man as <hi
                  rend="italic">Frankville</hi>, in the World,----were you as free as Air, I have a
               defence within, which all your Charms can never pierce, nor softness melt---I am
               already bound, not with the weak Ties of Vows or formal Obligations, which confine no
               farther than the Body, but Inclination!----the fondest Inclination! That ever swell’d
               a <hi rend="italic">Heart</hi> with Rapturous Hopes: The Lady had much ado to contain
               herself till he had done speaking; she was by Nature extreamly Haughty, Insolent of
               her Beauty, and impatient of any thing she thought look’d like a flight of it, and
               this open Defyance of <hi rend="italic">her</hi> Power, and acknowledging <hi
                  rend="italic">anothers</hi>, had she been less in Love wou’d have been
               insupportable to her: Ungrateful and uncourtly Man, said she, looking on him with
               Eyes that sparkled at once with Indignation and Desire, you might have spar’d
               yourself the trouble of Repeating, and me the Confusion of hearing, in what manner
               you stand Engag’d, it had been enough to have told me you never cou’d be mine,
               without appearing transported at the Ruin which you make; if my too happy Rival
               possesses Charms, I cannot boast, methinks your <hi rend="italic">good Manners</hi>
               might have taught you, not to insult my Wants, and your <hi rend="italic">good
                  Nature</hi>, to have mingled <hi rend="italic">Pity</hi> with your <hi
                  rend="italic">Justice</hi>; with these Words she fell a Weeping, but whether they
               were Tears of Love or Anger, is hard to determine, ’tis certain that both those
               Passions rag’d this Moment in her Soul with equal Violence, and if she had had it in
               her Power, wou’d doubtless have been glad to have hated him, but he was, at all
               times, too lovely to suffer a possibility of that, and much more so at this, for
               in<pb n="197"/> spite of the Shock, that Infidelity he believ’d her guilty of to <hi
                  rend="italic">Frankville</hi>, gave him; he was by Nature so Compassionate, he <hi
                  rend="italic">felt</hi> the Woes he <hi rend="italic">saw</hi>, or <hi
                  rend="italic">heard</hi> of, even of those who were most indifferent to him, and
               cou’d not now behold a Face, in which all the Horrors of Despair were in the most
               lively manner represented, without displaying a Tenderness in his, which in any other
               Man, might have been taken for Love; the dazling Radience of his Eyes, gave place to
               a more dangerous, more bewitching softness, and when he sigh’d, in Pity of her
               Anguish, a Soul Inchanting Languishment diffus’d itself thro’ all his Air, and added
               to his Graces; she presently perceiv’d it, and forming new Hopes, as well from that,
               as from his Silence, took hold of his Hand, and pressing it eagerly to her Bosom, Oh
               my Lord! resum’d she, you cannot be ungrateful if you wou’d,----I feel you
               cannot----Madam, interrupted he, shaking off as much possible that show of
               Tenderness, which he found had given her Incouragement; I wish not to convince you
               how nearly I am touch’d, with what you suffer, lest it shou’d <hi rend="italic"
                  >encrease</hi> an Esteem, which, since prejudicial to your Repose, and the
               Interest of my Friend; I rather ought to endeavour to <hi rend="italic"
               >lessen</hi>.----But, as this is not the Entertainment I expected from <hi
                  rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, I beg to know an Answer of the Business I came upon,
               and what you decree for the unfortunate <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi>: If the
               Lady was agitated with an extremity of Vexation at the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>’s
               Declaration of his Passion for another, what was she now, at this Disappointment of
               the Hopes she was so lately flatter’d with! instead of making any direct reply to
               what he said, she rag’d, stamp’d, tore her Hair, curs’d <hi rend="italic"
                  >Frankville</hi>, all Mankind, the World, and in that height of Fury, scarce
               spar’d Heaven itself; but the violence of her Pride and Resentment being a little
               vented, Love took his turn, again she wept, again she prest his Hand, nay she even
               knelt and hung upon his Feet, as he wou’d have broke from her, and beg’d him with
               Words as eloquent as Wit cou’d Form, and desperate dying Love Suggest, to<pb n="198"/> pity
               and relieve her Misery: But he had now learn’d to dissemble his Concern, lest it
               shou’d a second time beguile her, and after raising her, with as careless and unmov’d
               an Air, as he was capable of putting on: My Presence, Madam, said he, but augments
               your Disorder, and ’tis only by seeing you no more, that I am qualify’d to conduce to
               the recovery of your Peace: With these Words he turn’d hastily from her, and was
               going out of the Room, when she, quick as Thought, sprung from the Place where she
               had stood, and being got between him and the Door, and throwing her self into his
               Arms, before he had time to prevent her; you must not, shall not go, she cry’d, till
               you have left me dead: Pardon me, Madam, answer’d he fretfully, and struggling to get
               loose from her Embrace, to stay after the Discovery you have made of your Sentiments,
               were to be guilty of an Injustice almost equal to your’s, therefore I beg you’d give
               me liberty to pass.----Hear me but speak, resum’d she, grasping him yet harder;
               return but for a Moment,----lovely Barbarian,----Hell has no torments like your
               Cruelty. Here, the different Passions working in her Soul, with such uncommon
               Vehemence, hurry’d her Spirits beyond what Nature cou’d Support; her Voice faulter’d
               in the Accent, her trembling Hands by slow degrees relinquish’d what so eagerly they
               had held, every Sense forgot its Use, and she sunk, in all appearance, lifeless on
               the Floor. The Count was, if possible, more glad to be releas’d, than griev’d at the
               occasion, and contented himself with calling her Women to her Assistance, without
               staying to see when she wou’d recover.</p>
            <p>He went out of that House with Thoughts much more discompos’d than those with which
               he had entered it, and when he came Home, where <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi>
               impatiently waited his Return, he was at the greatest loss in the World, how to
               discover his Misfortune to him; the other observing the trouble of his Mind, which
               was very visible in his Countenance;<pb n="199"/> my Lord, said he, in a melancholly Tone, I
               need not ask you what Success, the gloom which appears on your Brow, tells me, my ill
               Fortune has deny’d you the means of speaking to <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>?
               Accuse not Fortune, answer’d <hi rend="italic">D’elmont</hi>, but the influence of
               malicious Stars which seldom, if ever, suits our Dispositions to our Circumstances; I
               have seen <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, have talk’d to her, and ’tis from that
               Discourse that I cannot forbear reflection on the Miseries of Humanity, which, while
               it mocks us with a show of <hi rend="italic">Reason</hi>, gives us no Power to curb
               our <hi rend="italic">Will</hi>, and guide the erring Appetites to Peace. Monsieur
                  <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi> at these Words first felt a jealous Pang, and as
               ’tis natural to believe every Body admires what we do, he presently imagin’d Count
                  <hi rend="italic">D’elmont</hi> had forgot <hi rend="italic">Melliora</hi> in the
               presence of <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, and that it was from the Consciousness of
               his own Weakness and Inconstancy, that he spoke so feelingly: I wonder not my Lord,
               said he coldly, that the Beauties of <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi> shou’d inspire
               you with Sentiments, which, perhaps, for many Reasons, you wou’d desire to be free
               from, and I ought, in Prudence, to have consider’d, that tho’ you are the most
               excellent of your Kind, you are still a <hi rend="italic">Man</hi>, and not have the
               Passions incident to <hi rend="italic">Man</hi>, and not have expos’d you to those
               Dangers the sight of <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi> must necessarily involve you in:
               I wish to Heaven answer’d the Count, easily guessing what his Thoughts were, no
               greater threatned you, and that you cou’d think on <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>
               with the same indifference as I can, or she of me with more; then, in as brief a
               manner as he cou’d, he gave him the Substance of what had happen’d. <hi rend="italic"
                  >Frankville</hi>, whose only Fault was rashness, grew almost wild at the Recital
               of so unexpected a Misfortune, he knew not for a good while what to believe, loath he
               was to suspect the Count, but loather to suspect <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, yet
               flew into extremities of Rage against both, by turns: The Count pitied, and forgave
               all that the violence of his Passion made him utter, but offer’d not to argue with
               him, ’till he found him<pb n="200"/> capable of admitting his Reasons, and then, that open
               Sincerity, that honest noble Assurance which always accompany’d his Sweetness, and
               made it difficult to doubt the Truth of any thing he said, won the disorder’d Lover
               to an entire Conviction; he now concludes his Mistress false, repents the tenderness
               he has had for her, and tho’ she still appears as lovely to his <hi rend="italic"
                  >Fancy</hi> as ever, she grows odious to his <hi rend="italic">Judgment</hi>, and
               resolves to use his utmost Efforts to banish her Idea from his Heart.</p>
            <p>In this Humour he took leave of the Count, it growing late, and his last Nights
               Adventure taught him the danger of Nocturnal Walks, but how he spent his time till
               Morning, those can only guess, who have loved like him, and like him, met so cruel a
               Disappointment.</p>
            <p>The Count pass’d not the Night in much less Inquietude than <hi rend="italic"
                  >Frankville</hi>, he griev’d the powerful Influence of his own Attractions, and
               had there not been a <hi rend="italic">Melliora</hi> in the World, he wou’d have
               wish’d himself Deform’d, rather than have been the Cause of so much Misery, as his
               Loveliness produc’d.</p>
            <p>The next Morning the Count design’d to visit <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi>, to
               strengthen him in his Resolution of abandoning all Thoughts of the unconstant <hi
                  rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, but before he cou’d get drest, the other came into his
               Chamber: My Lord, said he, assoon as they were alone, my perfidious Mistress, failing
               to make a Conquest of your Heart, is still willing to preserve that she had attain’d
               over mine, but all her Charms and her Delusions are but vain, and to prove to your
               Lordship that they are so, I have brought the Letter I receiv’d from her, scarce an
               Hour past, and the true Copy of my Answer to it.</p>

                           be sensible of mine, yet on examining my Heart, I presently recall’d the
                           hasty Prayer, and found I lov’d with that extravagance of Tenderness,
                           that I had rather you return’d it too little than too much, and methinks
                           cou’d better bear to represent you to my Fancy, careless and calm as

                           fear such Apprehensions are but too un-necessary----You think not of me,
                           and, if in those happy days, when no cross Accident interven’d to part me

            <p>You see, my Lord, said he with a sigh, that I have put it out of her Power to Triumph
               over my Weakness, for I confess my Heart still wears her Chains, but e’er my Eyes or

            <p>When the Count had sent away this little Billet, Monsieur <hi rend="italic"
                  >Frankville</hi> grew very gay on the hopes of his Design succeeding; and
               laughing, my Lord said he, I question whether <hi rend="italic">Melliora</hi> wou’d
               forgive me, for engaging you in this Affair; <hi rend="italic">Ciamara</hi> is
               extreamly handsome, has Wit, and where she attempts to Charm, has doubtless, a
               thousand Artifices to obtain her wish; the Count was not in a temper to relish his
               Raillery, he had a great deal of Compassion for <hi rend="italic">Ciamara</hi>, and
               thought himself inexcusable for deceiving her, and all that <hi rend="italic"
                  >Frankville</hi> cou’d do to dissipate the Gloom that reflection spread about him,
               was but vain.</p>
            <p>They spent the greatest part of this Day together, as they had done the former; and
               when the time came that <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi> thought it proper to take
               Leave, it was with a much more chearful Heart, than he had the Night before; but his
               Happiness was not yet secure, and in a few Hours he found a considerable alteration
               in his Condition.</p>
            <p>As soon as it was dark enough forCamilla to let down her String to the Fellow whom
               she had order’d to wait for it, he receiv’d another Letter fasten’d to it, and
               finding it was Directed as the other, for Monsieur <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi>,
               he immediately brought it to him.</p>
            <p><pb n="209"/></p>
            <p>It was with a mixture of Fear and Joy, that the impatient Lover broke it open, but
               both these Passions gave Place to an adequate Despair, when having un-seal’d it, he
               read these Lines.</p>

                  <p>“>I have been already so much deceiv’d, that I ought not to boast of any skill
                     in the Art of Divination, yet, I fancy, ’tis in my Power to form a juster Guess
                     than I have done, what the Sentiments of your Heart will be when you first open
                     this----Methinks, I see you put on a scornful Smile, resolving to be still
                     unmov’d, either at Upbraidings or Complaints; for to do one of these, I am
                     satisfied, you imagine is the reason of my troubling you with a Letter: But
                     Sir, I am not altogether silly enough to believe the tenderest Supplications
                     the most humble of my Sex cou’d make, has efficacy to restore Desire, once
                     Dead, to Life; or if it cou’d, I am not so mean Spirited as to accept a return
                     thus caus’d; nor wou’d it be less impertinent to Reproach; to tell you that you
                     are Perjur’d---Base---Ungrateful, is what you know already, unless your Memory
                     is so Complaisant as not to remind you of either Vows or Obligations: But, to
                     assure you, that I reflect on this sudden Change of your Humour without being
                     fir’d with Rage, or stupify’d with Grief, is perhaps, what you least
                     expect.----Yet, strange as it may seem, it is most certain, that she, whom you
                     have found the Softest, Fondest, Tenderest of her Kind, is in a moment grown
                     the most Indifferent, for in spight of your Inconstancy, I never shall deny
                     that I have Lov’d you,---Lov’d you, even to Dotage, my Passion took birth long
                     before I knew you had a thought of feigning one for<pb n="210"/> me, which frees me
                     from that Imputation Women too frequently deserve, of <hi rend="italic"
                        >loving</hi> for no other Reason than because they are <hi rend="italic"
                        >beloved</hi>, for if you ne’er had <hi rend="italic">seem’d</hi> to love, I
                     shou’d have continu’d to do so in <hi rend="italic">Reality</hi>. I found a
                     thousand Charms in your Person and Conversation, and believ’d your Soul no less
                     transcending all others in excellent Qualities, than I still confess your Form
                     to be in Beauty; I drest you up in vain Imagination, adorn’d with all the
                     Ornaments of Truth, Honour, good Nature, Generosity, and every Grace that raise
                     mortal Perfection to the highest pitch, and almost reach Divinity,---but you
                     have taken care to prove your self, meer <hi rend="italic">Man</hi>, to like,
                     dislike, and wish you know not what, nor why! If I never had any Merits, how
                     came you to think me worthy the pains you have taken to engage me? And if I
                     had, how am I so suddenly depriv’d of them?---No, I am still the same, and the
                     only reason I appear not so to you, is, that you behold me now, no more, with
                     Lover’s Eyes; the few Charms, I am Mistress of, look’d lovely at a distance,
                     but lose their Lustre, when approach’d too near; your Fancy threw a glittering
                     Burnish o’re me, which free Possession has worn off, and now, the <hi

                     suffer for the guilty Folly of believing that in your Sex Ardors cou’d survive
                     Enjoyment, or if they cou’d, that such a Miracle was reserv’d for me; but thank
                     Heaven my Punishment is past, the Pangs, the Tortures of my bleeding Heart, in
                     tearing your Idea thence, already are no more! The fiery Tryal is over, and I
                     am now arriv’d at the Elizium of perfect Peace, entirely unmolested by any
                     warring Passion; the Fears, the Hopes, the Jealousies, and all the endless
                     Train of Cares which waited on my hours of Love and fond Delusion, serve but to
                     endear re-gain’d Tranquility; and I can cooly <hi rend="italic">Scorn</hi>, not

                     flowing Wit, without an Indignant remembrance how oft it has been employ’d for

                     Curse the borrow’d softness of their Glances, shall think on all your past
                     Endearments, your Sighs, your Vows, your melting Kisses, and the warm Fury of
                     your fierce Embraces, but as a pleasing Dream, while Reason slept, and with not

            <p>The calm and resolute Resentment which appear’d in the Stile of this Letter, gave <hi
                  rend="italic">Frankville</hi> very just Grounds to fear, it would be no small
               Difficulty to obtain a Pardon for what he had so rashly Written; but when he
               reflected on the seeming Reasons, which mov’d him to it, and that he should have an
               Opportunity to let her know them, he was not altogether Inconsolable, he pass’d the
               Night however in a World of Anxiety, and as soon as Morning came, hurried away, to
               communicate to the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> this fresh Occasion of his
               Trouble.</p>
            <p>It was now <hi rend="italic">D’elmont</hi>’s turn to Rally, and he laugh’d as much at
               those Fears, which he imagin’d Causeless, as the other had done, at the Assignation
               he had perswaded him to make with <hi rend="italic">Ciamara</hi>, but tho’ as most of
               his Sex are, he was pretty much of<pb n="212"/> the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>’s Opinion,
               yet, the Re-instating himself in <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>’s Esteem, was a
               Matter of too great Importance to him, to suffer him to take one Moment’s ease ’till
               he was perfectly Assur’d of it.</p>
            <p>At last, the wish’d for Hour arriv’d, and he, disguis’d so, as it was impossible for
               him to be known, attended the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> to that dear Wicket, which
               had so often given him Entrance to <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>; they waited not
               long for Admittance, <hi rend="italic">Brione</hi> was ready there to Receive them;
               the Sight of her, inflam’d the Heart of Monsieur <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi>
               with all the Indignation imaginable, for he knew her to be the Woman, who, by her
               Treachery to <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, had gain’d the Confidence of <hi
                  rend="italic">Ciamara</hi>, and involv’d him in all the Miseries he had endur’d!
               but he contain’d himself, ’till she taking the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> by the
               Hand, in order to lead him to her Lady, bad him wait her Return, which she told him
               should be immediately, in an outer Room which she pointed him to.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time she conducted the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> to the Door of that
               magnificent Chamber, where he had been receiv’d by the suppos’d <hi rend="italic"
                  >Camilla</hi>, and where he now beheld the real <hi rend="italic">Ciamara</hi>,
               drest, if possible, richer than she was the Night before, but loose as wanton Fancy
               cou’d invent; she was lying on the Couch when he enter’d, and affecting to seem as if
               she was not presently Sensible of his being there, rose not to receive him ’till he
               was very near her; they both kept silence for some Moments, she, waiting till he
               should speak, and he, possibly, prevented by the uncertainty after what manner he
               should Form his Address, so as to keep an equal Medium between the two Extreams, of
               being Cruel, or too Kind, till at last the Violence of her impatient Expectation
               burst out in these Words,----Oh that this Silence were the Effect of Love!----and
               then perceiving he made no Answer; tell me, continu’d she, am I forgiven for thus
               intruding on your <hi rend="italic">Pity</hi> for a Grant,<pb n="213"/> which <hi
                  rend="italic">Inclination</hi> would not have allow’d me? Cease Madam, reply’d he,
               to encrease the Confusion which a just Sense of your Favours, and my own Ingratitude
               has cast me in: How can you look with Eyes so tender and so kind, on him who brings
               you nothing in Return? Rather despise me, hate me, drive me from your Sight, believe
               me as I am, unworthy of your Love, nor squander on a Bankrupt Wretch the noble
               Treasure: Oh Inhuman! interrupted she, has then that Mistress of whose Charms you
               boasted, engross’d all your stock of Tenderness? and have you nothing, nothing to
               repay me for all this waste of Fondness,----this lavish Prodigality of Passion, which
               forces me beyond my Sexes Pride, or my own natural Modesty, to sue, to Court, to
               kneel and weep for Pity: Pity, resum’d the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> wou’d be a
               poor Reward for Love like yours, and yet alas! continu’d he Sighing, ’tis all I have
               to give; I have already told you, I am ty’d by Vows, by Honour, Inclination, to
               another, who tho’ far absent hence, I still preserve the dear Remembrance of! My Fate
               will soon recall me back to her, and <hi rend="italic">Paris</hi>; yours fixes you at
                  <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi>, and since we are doom’d to be for ever separated, it
               wou’d be base to Cheat you with a vain Pretence, and lull you with Hopes pleasing
               Dreams a while, when you must quickly wake to added Tortures, and redoubled Woe:
               Heavens, cry’d she, with an Air full of Resentment, are then my Charms so mean, my
               Darts so weak, that near, they cannot intercept those, shot at such a Distance? And
               are you that dull, cold Platonist, which can prefer the visionary Pleasures of an <hi
                  rend="italic">absent</hi> Mistress, to the warm Transports of the Substantial <hi
                  rend="italic">present</hi>: The <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> was pretty much
               surpriz’d at these Words, coming from the Mouth of a Woman of Honour, and began now
               to perceive what her Aim was, but willing to be more confirm’d, Madam, said he, I
               dare not hope your Virtue wou’d permit.----Is this a Time (Interrupted she, looking
               on him with Eyes which sparkled with wild Desires, and left no want of further<pb n="214"/>
               Explanation of her meaning) Is this an Hour to preach of
               Virtue?----Married,----betroth’d, engag’d by Love or Law, what hinders but this
               Moment you may be mine, this Moment, well improv’d, might give us Joys to baffle a
               whole Age of Woe; make us, at once, forget our Troubles past, and by its sweet
               remembrance, scorn those to come; in speaking these Words, she sunk supinely on <hi
                  rend="italic">D’elmont</hi>’s Breast; but tho’ he was not so ill-natur’d, and
               unmannerly as to repel her, this sort of Treatment made him lose all the Esteem, and
               great part of the Pity he had conceiv’d for her.</p>
            <p>The Woes of Love are only worthy Commiseration, according to their Causes; and tho’
               all those kinds of Desire, which the difference of Sex creates, bear in general, the
               name of Love, yet they are as vastly wide, as Heaven and Hell; that Passion which
               aims chiefly at Enjoyment, in Enjoyment ends, the fleeting Pleasure is no more
               remembred, but all the stings of Guilt and Shame remain; but that, where the
               interiour Beauties are consulted, and <hi rend="italic">Souls</hi> are Devotees, is
               truly Noble, Love, <hi rend="italic">there</hi> is a Divinity indeed, because he is
               immortal and unchangeable, and if our earthy part partake the Bliss, and craving
               Nature is in all obey’d; Possession thus desired, and thus obtain’d, is far from
               satiating, <hi rend="italic">Reason</hi> is not here debas’d to <hi rend="italic"
                  >Sense</hi>, but <hi rend="italic">Sense</hi> elevates itself to <hi rend="italic"
                  >Reason</hi>, the different Powers unite, and become pure alike.</p>
            <p>It was plain that the Passion with which <hi rend="italic">Ciamara</hi> was animated,
               sprung not from this last Source; she had seen the Charming Count, was taken with his
               Beauty, and wish’d no farther than to possess his lovely <hi rend="italic"
                  >Person</hi>, his <hi rend="italic">Mind</hi> was the least of her Thoughts, for
               had she the least Ambition to reign there, she wou’d not have so meanly sought to
               obtain the one, after he had assured her, the other, far more noble part of him was
               dispos’d of. The Grief he had been in, that it was not in his Power to return her
               Passion, while<pb n="215"/> he believ’d it meritorious, was now chang’d to the utmost
               Contempt, and her Quality, and the State she liv’d in, did not hinder him from
               regarding of her, in as indifferent a manner, as he wou’d have done a common <hi
                  rend="italic">Courtezan</hi>.</p>
            <p>Lost to all Sense of Honour, Pride or Shame, and wild to gratify her furious Wishes,
               she spoke, without reserve, all they suggested to her, and lying on his Breast,
               beheld, without concern, her Robes fly open, and all the Beauties of her own expos’d,
               and naked to his View: Mad at his Insensibility, at last she grew more bold, she
               kiss’d his Eyes,---his Lips, a thousand times, then press’d him in her Arms with
               strenuous Embraces,----and snatching his Hand and putting it to her Heart, which
               fiercely bounded at his Touch, bid him be witness of his mighty Influence there.</p>
            <p>Tho’ it was impossible for any Soul to be capable of a greater, or more constant
               Passion than his felt for <hi rend="italic">Melliora</hi>, tho’ no Man that ever
               liv’d, was less addicted to loose Desires,----in fine, tho’ he really was, as <hi
                  rend="italic">Frankville</hi> had told him, the most excellent of his Kind, yet,
               he was still a <hi rend="italic">Man!</hi> And, ’tis not to be thought strange, if to
               the force of such united Temptations, Nature and Modesty a little yielded; warm’d
               with her fires, and perhaps, more mov’d by Curiosity, her Behaviour having
               extinguish’d all his respect, he gave his Hands and Eyes a full Enjoyment of all
               those Charms, which had they been answer’d by a Mind worthy of them, might justly
               have inspir’d the highest Raptures, while she, unshock’d, and unresisting, suffer’d
               all he did, and urg’d him with all the Arts she was Mistress of, to more, and it is
               not altogether improbable, that he might not entirely have forgot himself, if a
               sudden Interruption had not restor’d his Reason to the consideration of the Business
               which had brought him here.</p>

            <p>Monsieur <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi> had all this time been employ’d in a far
               different manner of Entertainment; <hi rend="italic">Brione</hi> came to him,
               according to her promise, assoon as she had introduc’d the <hi rend="italic"
                  >Count</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Ciamara</hi>, and having been commanded by that
               Lady to Discourse with the supposed Servant, and get what she cou’d out of him, of
               the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>’s Affairs, she sat down and began to talk to him
               with a great deal of Freedom; but he who was too impatient to lose much time, told
               her he had a Secret to discover, if the place they were in was private enough to
               prevent his being over-heard, and she assuring him that it was, he immediately
               discover’d who he was, and clap’d a Pistol to her Breast, swearing that Moment shou’d
               be the last of her Life, if she made the least Noise, or attempted to intercept his
               passage to <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>: The terror she was in, made her fall on
               her Knees, and conjuring him to spare her Life, beg’d a thousand Pardons for her
               Infidelity, which she told him was not occasion’d by any particular Malice to him;
               but not being willing to leave <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi> herself, the fear of being
               expos’d to the revenge of <hi rend="italic">Ciamara</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                  >Cittolini</hi>, when they shou’d find out that she had been the Instrument of <hi
                  rend="italic">Camilla</hi>’s Escape, prevail’d upon her timerous Soul to that
               Discovery, which was the only means to prevent what she so much dreaded: <hi
                  rend="italic">Frankville</hi> contented himself with venting his Resentment in two
               or three hearty Curses, and taking her roughly by the Arm, bid her go with him to <hi
                  rend="italic">Camilla</hi>’s Apartment, and discover before her what she knew of
                  <hi rend="italic">Ciamara</hi>’s Entertaining Count <hi rend="italic"
                  >D’elmont</hi> in her Name, which she trembling promis’d to obey, and they both
               went up a pair of back Stairs which led a private way to <hi rend="italic"
                  >Camilla</hi>’s Chamber; when they enter’d, she was sitting in her night Dress on
               the Bed-side, and the unexpected sight of <hi rend="italic">Brione</hi>, who, till
               now, had never ventured to appear before her, since her Infidelity, and a Man with
               her whom she thought a Stranger, fill’d her with such a surprize, that it depriv’d
               her of her<pb n="217"/> Speech, and gave <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi> time to throw off
               his Disguise, and catch her in his Arms, with all the Transports of unfeign’d
               Affection, before she cou’d enough recover her self to make any resistance, but when
               she did, it was with all the Violence imaginable, and indeavouring to tear herself
               away; Villain, said she, comest thou again to triumph o’re my Weakness,----again to
               Cheat me into fond Belief? There needed no more to make this obsequious Lover
               relinquish his Hold, and falling at her Feet, was beginning to speak something in his
               Vindication; when she, quite lost in Rage, prevented him, by renewing her Reproaches
               in this manner; have you not given me up my Vows? Resum’d she, have you not abandon’d
               me to ruin,---to Death--to Infamy,----to all the stings of self-accusing Conscience
               and Remorse? And come you now, by your detested Presence, to alarm Remembrance, and
               new point my Tortures?-----That Woman’s Treachery, continu’d she, looking on <hi
                  rend="italic">Brione</hi>, I freely Pardon, since by that little Absence it
               occasion’d, I have discovered the wavering disposition of your Soul, and learn’d to
               scorn what is below my Anger. Hear me but speak, cry’d <hi rend="italic"
                  >Frankville</hi>, or if you doubt my Truth, as I confess you have almighty Cause,
               let her inform you, what seeming Reasons, what Provocations urg’d my hasty Rage to
               write that fatal,----that accursed Letter. I will hear nothing, reply’d <hi
                  rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, neither from you nor her,----I see the base Design,
               and scorn to joyn in the Deceit,--You had no Cause,----not even the least Pretence
               for your Inconstancy but one, which, tho’ you all are guilty of, you all Disown, and
               that is, being lov’d too well.----I Lavish’d all the fondness of my Soul, and you,
               unable to reward, despiz’d it:--But think not that the rage, you now behold me in,
               proceeds from my Despair--No, your Inconstancy is the Fault of Nature, a Vice which
               all your Sex are prone to, and ’tis we, the fond Believers only, are to blame, <hi
                  rend="italic">that</hi> I forgave, my Letter told you that I did----but thus to
               come----thus Insolent in Imagination, to dare to hope I were that mean Soul’d<pb n="218"/>
               Wretch, whose easy Tameness, and whose doating Love, with Joy would welcome your
               return, clasp you again in my deluded Arms, and swear you were as dear as ever, is
               such an affront to my Understanding, as merits the whole Fury of Revenge! as she
               spoke these Words, she turn’d disdainfully from him with a Resolution to leave the
               Room, but she could not make such hast to go away, as the despairing, the distracted
                  <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi> did to prevent her, and catching hold of her
               Garments, stay Madam, said he, wildly, either permit me to clear my self of this
               barbarous Accusation, or, if you are resolv’d, Unhearing, to Condemn me, behold me,
               satiate all your Rage can wish, for by Heaven, continued he, holding the Pistol to
               his own Breast, as he had done a little before to <hi rend="italic">Brione</hi>’s, by
               all the Joys I have Possest, by all the Hell I now endure, this Moment I’ll be
               receiv’d your <hi rend="italic">Lover</hi>, or expire your <hi rend="italic"
                  >Martyr</hi>. These Words pronounc’d so passionately, and the Action that
               accompany’d them, made a visible alteration in <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>’s
               Countenance, but it lasted not long, and Resuming her fierceness; your Death, cry’d
               she, this way would give me little Satisfaction, the World would judge more Noble of
               my Resentment, if by my Hand you fell----Yet, continu’d she, snatching the Pistol
               from him, and throwing it out of the Window, which happen’d to be open, I will
               not---cannot be the Executioner.--No, Live! And let thy Punishment be, in <hi
                  rend="italic">Reality</hi>, to endure what thou well <hi rend="italic"
                  >Dissemblest</hi>, the Pangs, the racking Pangs, of hopeless, endless
               Love!--May’st thou <hi rend="italic">indeed</hi>, Love <hi rend="italic">Me</hi>, as
               thou a thousand Times hast falsely sworn,---for ever <hi rend="italic">Love</hi>, and
               I, for ever <hi rend="italic">Hate!</hi> In this last Sentence, she flew like
               Lightning to her Closet, and shut her self in, leaving the amaz’d Lover still on his
               Knees, stupify’d with Grief and Wonder, all this while <hi rend="italic">Brione</hi>
               had been casting about in her Mind, how to make the best use of this Adventure with
                  <hi rend="italic">Ciamara</hi>, and encourag’d by <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>’s
               Behaviour and taking advantage of <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi>’s Confusion, made
               but one Step to the Chamber Door, and running out into the Gallery, and down<pb n="219"/>
               Stairs, cry’d Murder,----Help, a Rape----Help, or <hi rend="italic">Donna
                  Camilla</hi> will be carry’d away.---She had no occasion to call often, for the
               Pistol which <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi> threw out of the Window chanc’d to go off
               in the fall, and the report it made, had alarm’d some of the Servants who were in an
               out-House adjoyning to the Garden, and imagining there were Thieves, were gathering
               to search: some arm’d with Staves, some with Iron Bars, or any thing they could get
               in the Hurry they were in, as they were running confusedly about, they met Monsieur
                  <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi> pursuing <hi rend="italic">Brione</hi>, with a
               design to stop her Mouth, either by Threatnings or Bribes, but she was too nimble for
               him, and knowing the ways of the House much better than he did, went directly to the
               Room where <hi rend="italic">Ciamara</hi> was Caressing the Count in the manner
               already mention’d: Oh Madam, said she, you are impos’d on, the Count has deceiv’d
               your Expectations, and brought Monsieur <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi> in Disguise
               to rob you of <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>. These Words made them both, tho’ with
               very different Sentiments, start from the posture they were in, and <hi rend="italic"
                  >Ciamara</hi> changing her Air of Tenderness for one all Fury, Monster! Cry’d she
               to <hi rend="italic">D’elmont</hi>, have you then betray’d me? This is no time,
               reply’d he, hearing a great Bustle, and <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi>’s Voice
               pretty loud without, for me to answer you, my Honour calls me to my Friend’s
               assistance; and drawing his Sword, run as the Noise directed him to the Place where
                  <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi> was defending himself against a little Army of
                  <hi rend="italic">Ciamara</hi>’s Servants, she was not much behind him, and
               enrag’d to the highest degree, cry’d out, kill, kill them both! But that was not a
               Task for a much greater Number of such as them to Accomplish, and tho’ their Weapons
               might easily have beat down, or broke the Gentlemens Sword; yet their Fears kept them
               from coming too near, and <hi rend="italic">Ciamara</hi> had the Vexation to see them
               both Retreat with Safety, and her self disappointed, as well in her Revenge, as in
               her Love.</p>
            <p><pb n="220"/></p>
            <p>Nothing cou’d be more surpriz’d, than Count <hi rend="italic">D’elmont</hi> was, when
               he got Home, and heard from <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi> all that had pass’d
               between him and <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, nor was his Trouble less, that he had
               it not in his Power to give him any Advice in any Exigence so uncommon: He did all he
               cou’d to comfort and divert his Sorrows, but in vain, the Wounds of bleeding Love
               admit no Ease, but from the Hand which gave them; and he, who was naturally rash and
               fiery, now grew to that height of Desparation and violence of Temper, that the Count
               fear’d some fatal Catastrophe, and wou’d not suffer him to stir from him that Night,
               nor the next Day, till he had oblig’d him to make a Vow, and bind it with the most
               solemn Imprecations, not to offer any thing against his Life.</p>
            <p>But, tho’ plung’d into the lowest depth of Misery, and lost, to all Humane
               probability, in an inextricable Labyrinth of Woe, <hi rend="italic">Fortune</hi> will
               find, at last some way, to raise, and disentangle those, whom she is pleas’d to make
               her Favourites, and that Monsieur <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi> was one, an
               unexpected Adventure made him know.</p>
            <p>The third Day from that, in which he had seen <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, as he
               was sitting in his Chamber, in a melancholly Conversation with the Count, who was
               then come to Visit him, his Servant brought him a Letter, which he said had been just
               left, by a Woman of an extraordinary Appearance, and who the Moment she had given it
               into his Hand, got from the Door with so much speed, that she seem’d rather to vanish
               than to walk.</p>
            <p>While the Servant was speaking, <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi> look’d on the Count
               with a kind of a pleas’d Expectation in his Eye, but then casting them on the
               Direction of the Letter, Alas! Said he, how vain was my Imagination, this is not <hi
                  rend="italic">Camilla’s</hi>, but a Hand, to which I am utterly a Stranger; these
               Words were clos’d with a sigh, and he open’d it with Negligence which wou’d have been
               unpardonable, cou’d he have guess’d at<pb n="221"/> the Contents, but assoon as he saw the
               Name of Violetta at the bottom, a flash of Hope re-kindled in his Soul, and trembling
               with Impatience he Read.</p>

            <p>The time in which they had done Writing, immediately brought on that of <hi
                  rend="italic">Violetta</hi>’s Appointment, and the Count wou’d needs accompany
               Monsieur <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi> in this Assignation, saying, he had an
               acknowledgment to pay to that Lady, which he thought himself oblig’d, in good Manners
               and Gratitude, to take this Opportunity to do; and the other being of the same
               Opinion, they went together to St. <hi rend="italic">Peter</hi>’s.</p>
            <p>When Prayers were done, which, ’tis probable, <hi rend="italic">One</hi> of these
               Gentlemen, if not <hi rend="italic">Both</hi>, might think too tedious, they stood
               up, and looking round, impatiently expected when the promis’d Signal shou’d be given;
               but among the great Number of Ladies, which pass’d by them, there were very few, who
               did not stop a little to gaze on these two Accomplish’d <hi rend="italic"
                  >Chevaliers</hi>, and they were several times Tantaliz’d with an <hi rend="italic"
                  >imaginary</hi> Violetta, before the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> one appear’d. But
               when the Crowd were almost dispers’d, and they began to fear some Accident had
               prevented her coming, the long expected Token was let fall, and she who threw it,
               trip’d hastily away to the farther end of the <hi rend="italic">Collonade</hi>, which
               hapned to be entirely void of Company: The Count and his Companion, were not long
               behind her, and Monsieur <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi> being the Person chiefly
               concern’d, address’d himself to her in this manner; With what Words, Madam, said he,
               can a Man so infinitely Oblig’d, and so desirous to be Grateful, as <hi rend="italic"
                  >Frankville</hi>, sufficiently make<pb n="225"/> known his admiration of a Generosity like
               yours? Such an unbounded Goodness, shames all Discription! Makes Language vile, since
               it affords no Phrase to suit your Worth, or speak the mighty Sense my Soul has of it.
               I have no other Aim, reply’d she, in what I have done, than Justice; and ’tis only in
               the proof of your sincerity to <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, that I am to be
               thank’d. <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi> was about to answer with some assurances
               of his Faith, when the Count stepping forward, prevented him: My Friend, Madam, said
               he bowing, is most happy in having it in his Power to obey a Command, which is the
               utmost of his Wishes; but how must I acquit my self of any part of that Return which
               is due to you, for that generous Care you have been pleas’d to express for the
               preservation of my Life? There needs no more, interrupted she, with a perceivable
               alteration in her Voice, than to have <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> Count <hi
                  rend="italic">D’elmont</hi>, to be interested in his Concerns--she paus’d a little
               after speaking these Words, and then, as if she thought she had said too much, turn’d
               hastily to <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi>, the Letter, <hi rend="italic"
                  >Monsieur</hi>, continu’d she, the Letter,---’tis not impossible but we may be
               observ’d,---I tremble with the apprehension of a Discovery: <hi rend="italic"
                  >Frankville</hi> immediately deliver’d it to her, but saw so much Disorder in her
               Gesture, that it very much surpriz’d him: She trembled indeed, but whether occasioned
               by any danger she perceiv’d of being taken notice of, or some other secret Agitation
               she felt within, was then unknown to any but herself, but whatever it was, it
               transported her so far, as to make her quit the Place, without being able to take any
               other Leave than a hasty <hi rend="italic">Curtisie</hi>, and bidding <hi
                  rend="italic">Frankville</hi> meet her the next Morning at <hi rend="italic"
                  >Mattins</hi>.</p>
            <p>Here was a new Cause of Disquiet to <hi rend="italic">D’elmont</hi>; the Experience
               he had of the too fatal influence of his dangerous Attractions, gave him sufficient
               Reason to fear this young Lady was not insensible of them, and that his Presence was
               the sole Cause of her Disorder; however, he said nothing of it to <hi rend="italic"
                  >Frankville</hi> ’till the<pb n="226"/> other mentioning it to him, and repeating her
               Words, they both joyn’d in the Opinion, that Love had been too busy in her Heart, and
               that it was the feeling the Effects of it in herself, had inclined her to so much
               Compassion for the Miseries she saw it inflicted upon others. The Count very well
               knew that when Desires of this Kind are springing in the Soul, every Sight of the
               beloved Object, encreases their growth, and therefore, tho’ her generous manner of
               Proceeding had created in him a very great Esteem, and he wou’d have been pleas’d
               with her Conversation, yet he ceas’d to wish a farther Acquaintance with her, lest it
               should render her more Unhappy, and forbore going the next Day to Church with <hi
                  rend="italic">Frankville</hi>, as else he wou’d have done.</p>
            <p>Violetta fail’d not to come as she had promis’d, but instead of dropping her
               Handkerchief, as she had done the Evening before, she knelt as close to him as she
               cou’d, and pulling him gently by the Sleeve, oblig’d him to regard her, who else, not
               knowing her, wou’d not have suspected she was so near, and slip’d a Note into his
               Hand, bidding him softly, not take any farther notice of her: He obey’d, but ’tis
               reasonable to believe, was too impatient to know what the Contents were, to listen
               with much Attention and Devotion to the remainder of the Ceremony; as soon he was
               releas’d, he got into a Corner of the <hi rend="italic">Cathedral</hi>, where,
               unobserv’d he might satisfy a Curiosity, which none who Love, will condemn him for,
               any more than they will for the thrilling Extacy which fill’d his Soul at the Reading
               these Lines.</p>

                           thus: As she was walking in the Fields, behind the Cloyster Gardens,
                           accompanied by some young Lady’s, Pensioners there as well as her self,
                           four Men well mounted, but Disguis’d and Muffled, rode up to them, three
                           of them jump’d off their Horses, and while one seiz’d on the defenceless
                           Prey; and bore her to his Arms, who was not alighted, the other two
                           caught hold of her Companions, and prevented the Out-cries they would
                           have made, ’till she was carry’d out of sight, then Mounting again their
                           Horses, immediately lost the amaz’d Virgins all Hopes of recovering

            <p>Count <hi rend="italic">D’elmont</hi> and his longing Companion, were the first at

               and the Moment he had sight of them, Oh Heaven (cry’d he to <hi rend="italic"
                  >D’elmont</hi>) yonder she comes, that,----that my Lord, is the divine <hi

                  <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, was turning on one Side, in order to go to the
               Grate where she expected the <hi rend="italic">Nun</hi>. Hold! Hold <hi rend="italic"
                  >Donna Camilla</hi>, cry’d <hi rend="italic">Violetta</hi>, I cannot suffer you
               shou’d pass by your Friends with an Air so unconcern’d, if Monsieur <hi rend="italic"
                  >Frankville</hi> has done any thing to merit your Displeasure, my Lord the Count
               certainly deserves your Notice, in the Pains he has taken to undeceive you. One so

               well excuse my Thanks for an explanation, which had he been acquainted with me he

                  >Frankville</hi>, is then the knowledge of my Innocence unwelcome?---Am I become
               so hateful, or are you so chang’d, that you wish me guilty, for a justification of
               your Rigour? If it be so, I have no Remedy but Death, which tho’ you depriv’d me of,
               the last time I saw you, I now can find a Thousand means to compass; he pronounc’d
               these Words in so Tender, yet so resolv’d an Accent; that <hi rend="italic"
                  >Camilla</hi> cou’d not conceal part of the Impression they made on her, and
               putting her Handkerchief to her Eyes, which in spite of all she had done to prevent
               it, overflow’d with Tears; talk not of Death, said she, I am not Cruel to that
               degree, Live <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi>, Live!----but Live without <hi
                  rend="italic">Camilla!</hi> Oh, ’tis impossible! Resum’d he, the latter part of
               your Command entirely destroys the first.---Life without your Love, would be a Hell,
               which I confess my Soul’s a Coward, but to think of.</p>
            <p>The Count and <hi rend="italic">Violetta</hi> were Silent all this Time, and
               perceiving they were in a fair way of Reconciliation,<pb n="231"/> thought the best they
               cou’d do to forward it, was to leave ’em to themselves, and walking a few Paces from
               them; You suffer my Lord, said the, for your Generosity in accompanying your Friend,
               since it condemns you to the Conversation of a Person, who has neither <hi
                  rend="italic">Wit</hi>, nor <hi rend="italic">Gaiety</hi> sufficient to make her
               self Diverting. Those, reply’d he, who wou’d make the Excellent <hi rend="italic"
                  >Violetta</hi> a Subject of Diversion, ought never to be blest with the Company of
               any, but such Women who merit not a serious Regard: But you indeed, were your Soul
               capable of descending to the Follies of your Sex, wou’d be extreamly at a Loss in
               Conversation so little Qualify’d as mine, to please the Vanities of the Fair; and you
               stand in need of all those more than <hi rend="italic">Manly</hi> Virtues you
               possess, to pardon a <hi rend="italic">Chagreen</hi>, which even your Presence cannot
               Dissipate: If it cou’d, interrupted she, I assure your Lordship, I shou’d much more
                  <hi rend="italic">rejoice</hi> in the happy Effects of it on you, than <hi
                  rend="italic">Pride</hi> my self in the Power of such an Influence--And yet
               continu’d she with a Sigh, I am a very Woman, and if free from the usual Affectations
               and Vanities of my Sex, I am not so from Faults, perhaps, less worthy of forgiveness:
               The Count cou’d not presently resolve what reply to make to these Words; he was
               unwilling she should believe he wanted Complaisance, and afraid of saying any thing
               that might give room for a Declaration of what he had no Power of answering to her
               wish; but after the consideration of a Moment or two, Madam, said he, tho’ I dare not
               Question your Sincerity in any other Point, yet you must give me leave to disbelieve
               you in this, not only, because, in my Opinion, there is nothing so contemptibly
               ridiculous as that self sufficiency, and vain desire of pleasing, commonly known by
               the Name of <hi rend="italic">Coquetry</hi>, but also, because she who escapes the
               Contagion of this Error, will not without much difficulty be led into any other: Alas
               my Lord, cry’d <hi rend="italic">Violetta</hi>, how vastly wide of Truth is this
               Affection? That very foible, which is most pernicious to our Sex, is chiefly by <hi
                  rend="italic">Coquetry</hi> prevented: I need not tell you that ’tis Love I
               mean,<pb n="232"/> and as blamable as you think the <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, I believe the
                  <hi rend="italic">other</hi> wou’d find less favour from a Person of your
               Lordship’s Judgment: How Madam, interrupted the Count, pretty warmly, have I the
               Character of a Stoick?---Or do you, imagine that my Soul, is compos’d that course
               Stuff, not to be capable of receiving, or approving a Passion, which, all the Brave,
               and generous think it their glory to Profess, and which can only give refin’d
               delight, to Minds enobled.----But I perceive, continu’d he growing more cool, I am
               not happy enough in your Esteem, to be thought worthy the Influence of that God.
               Still you mistake my Meaning, said <hi rend="italic">Violetta</hi>, I doubt not of
               your Sensibility, were there a possibility of finding a Woman worthy of Inspiring you
               with soft Desires; and if that shou’d ever happen, Love wou’d be so far from being a
               weakness, that it wou’d serve rather as an Embelishment to your other Graces; it’s
               only when we stoop to Objects below our Consideration, or vainly wing our wishes to
               those above our Hopes, that makes us appear ridiculous or contemptible; but either of
               these is a Folly which,----which the incomparable <hi rend="italic">Violetta</hi>,
               interrupted <hi rend="italic">D’elmont</hi>, never can be guilty of: You have a very
               good Opinion of my Wit resum’d she, in a melancholly Tone, but I shou’d be much
               happier than I am, if I were sure I cou’d secure my self from doing any thing to
               forfeit it: I believe, reply’d the Count there are not many things you have less
               Reason to apprehend than such a Change; and I am confident were I to stay in <hi
                  rend="italic">Rome</hi> as many <hi rend="italic">Ages</hi>, as I am determin’d to
               do but <hi rend="italic">Hours</hi>, I shou’d, at last, leave it, with the same
               Esteem and Admiration of your singular Vertues, as I now shall do. <hi rend="italic"
                  >Violetta</hi> cou’d not prevent the Disorder these Words put her into, from
               discovering it self in the Accent of her Voice, when, How! My Lord, said she, are we
               then to lose you?---Lose you in so short a Time? As the Count was about to answer,
                  <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi> joyn’d them,
               and looking on <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi>, if any Credit, said he, may be
               given to the Language of the Eyes, I am certain<pb n="233"/> yours speak Success, and I may
               congratulate a Happiness you lately cou’d not be persuaded to hope; had I a thousand
               Eyes, cry’d the transported Lover, a thousand Tongues, they all wou’d be but
               insignificant to express the Joy!----the unbounded Extacy, my Soul is full of,----but
               take the mighty Meaning in one Word,----<hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>’s mine---for
               ever mine!---the Storm is past, and all the sunny Heaven of Love returns to bless my
               future Days with ceaseless Raptures: Now, my Lord, I am ready to attend you in your
               Journey, this Bright! This beauteous Guardian Angel, will partake our Flight! And we
               have nothing now to do, but to prepare with secrecy and speed fit means for our
               Escape. As soon as <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi> had left off speaking, Count <hi
                  rend="italic">D’elmont</hi> addressing himself to <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>,
               made her abundance of Retributions, for the happiness she gave his Friend, which she
               receiving with a becoming Chearfulness, and unaffected Gaiety, I am afraid said she,
               your Lordship will think a Woman’s Resolution is, henceforth, little worth regarding;
               but, continu’d she, taking <hi rend="italic">Violetta</hi> by the Hand, I see well,
               that this unfaithful Creature, has betray’d me, and to punish her Infidelity, will,
               by leaving her, put it out of her Power to deceive my Confidence again: <hi
                  rend="italic">Violetta</hi> either did not hear, or was not in a condition to
               return her <hi rend="italic">Raillery</hi>, nor the Praises which the Count and
               Monsieur <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi> concurr’d in of her Generosity, but stood
               motionless and lost in Thought, till <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi> seeing it grow
               towards Night, told the Gentlemen, she thought it best to part, not only to avoid any
               Suspicion at Home of their being out so long, but also that the others might order
               every thing proper for their Departure, which it was agreed on between <hi
                  rend="italic">Frankville</hi> and her, should be the next Night, to prevent the
               Success of those mischievous Designs she knew <hi rend="italic">Ciamara</hi> and <hi
                  rend="italic">Cittolini</hi> were forming, against both the Count and Monsieur <hi
                  rend="italic">Frankville</hi>.</p>
            <p>Matters being thus adjusted to the entire Satisfaction of the Lovers, and not in a
               much less proportion<pb n="234"/> to the Count, they all thought it best to avoid making any
               more Appointments till they met to part no more; which was to be at the Wicket at
               dead of Night. When the Count took leave of <hi rend="italic">Violetta</hi>, this
               being the last time he cou’d expect to see her; she was hardly able to return his
               Civilities, and much less to answer those which <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi>
               made her, after the Count had turn’d from her to give him way; both of them guess’d
               the Cause of her Confusion, and <hi rend="italic">D’elmont</hi> felt a concern in
               observing it, which nothing but that for <hi rend="italic">Melliora</hi> cou’d
               surpass.</p>
            <p>The next Day found full Employment for them all; but the Count, as well as <hi
                  rend="italic">Frankville</hi>, was too impatient to be gone, to neglect any thing
               requisite for their Departure, there was not the least particular wanting, long
               before the time they were to wait at the Wicket for <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>’s
               coming forth: The Count’s Lodging being the nearest, they stay’d there, watching for
               the long’d for Hour; but a little before it arriv’d, a Youth, who seem’d to be about
               13 or 14 Years of Age, desir’d to be admitted to the Count’s presence, which being
               granted, pulling a Letter out of his Pocket, and blushing as he approach’d him: I
               come my Lord, said he, from <hi rend="italic">Donna Violetta</hi>, the Contents of
               this will inform you on what Business; but lest the Treachery of others, shou’d
               render me suspected, permit me to break it open, and prove it carries no Infection:
               The Count look’d earnestly on him while he spoke, and was strangely taken with the
               uncommon Beauty and Modesty which he observ’d in him: You need not give your self the
               trouble of that Experiment, answer’d he, <hi rend="italic">Donna Violetta</hi>’s
               Name, and your own engaging Aspect, are sufficient Credentials, if I were liable to
               doubt; in saying this, he took the Letter, and full of Fears that some Accident had
               happen’d to <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, which might retard their Journey, hastily
               read over these Lines.</p>

            <p>The Young <hi rend="italic">Fidelio</hi>, for so he was call’d, cou’d not wish to be
               receiv’d with greater Demonstrations of Kindness than those the Count gave him: And
               perceiving that <hi rend="italic">Violetta</hi> had trusted him with the whole Affair
               of their leaving <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi> in private, doubted not of his Conduct,
               and consulted with him, who they found knew the Place perfectly well, after what
               manner they should Watch, with the least danger of being discover’d, for <hi
                  rend="italic">Camilla</hi>’s opening the Wicket: <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi>
               was for going alone, lest if any of the Servants shou’d happen to be about, one
               Person would be<pb n="236"/> less liable to suspicion, than it a Company were seen; the Count
               thought it most proper to go all together, remembring <hi rend="italic"
                  >Frankville</hi> of the danger he had lately scap’d, and might again be brought
               into; but <hi rend="italic">Fidelio</hi> told them, he wou’d advise that they two
               should remain conceal’d in the <hi rend="italic">Portico</hi>, of the Convent of St.
                  <hi rend="italic">Francis</hi>, while himself wou’d watch alone at the Wicket for
                  <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, and lead her to them, and then afterwards they
               might go altogether to that Place where the Horses and Servants shou’d attend them;
               the Page’s Counsel was approv’d by both of them, and the time being arriv’d, what
               they had contriv’d was immediately put in Execution.</p>
            <p>Every thing happen’d according to their Desire, <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi> got
               safely to the Arms of her impatient Lover, and they all taking Horse, rode with such
               Speed, as some of them wou’d have been little able to bear, if any thing less than
               Life and Love had been at Stake.</p>
            <p>Their eager wishes, and the goodness of their Horses brought them, before Day-break
               many Miles from <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi>; but tho’ they avoided all high Roads,
               and travell’d cross the Country to prevent being met, or overtook by any that might
               know them, yet their desire of seeing themselves in a Place of Security was so great
               that they refus’d to stop to take any Refreshment ’till the next Day was almost
               spent; but when they were come into the House where they were to lye that Night, not
               all the fatigue they had endur’d, kept the Lovers from giving and receiving all the
               Testimonies imaginable of mutual Affection.</p>
            <p>The sight of their Felicity added new Wings to Count <hi rend="italic"
               >D’elmont</hi>’s impatience to recover <hi rend="italic">Melliora</hi>, but when he
               consider’d the little probability of that hope, he grew inconsolable, and his new
               Page <hi rend="italic">Fidelio</hi>, who lay on a <hi rend="italic">Pallet</hi> in
               the same Room with him, put all his Wit, of which he had no small Stock, upon
               the<pb n="237"/> stretch to divert his Sorrows, he talk’d to him, sung to him, told him a
               hundred pretty Stories, and, in fine, made good the Character <hi rend="italic"
                  >Violetta</hi> had given him so well, that the Count look’d on him as a Blessing
               sent from Heaven to lessen his Misfortunes, and make his Woes sit easy.</p>
            <p>They continu’d Travelling with the same Expedition as when they first set out, for
               three or four Days, but then, believing themselves secure from any Pursuit, began to
               slacken their Pace, and make the Journey more delightful to <hi rend="italic"
                  >Camilla</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Fidelio</hi>, who not being accustomed to ride
               in that manner, wou’d never have been able to support it, if the strength of their
                  <hi rend="italic">Minds</hi>, had not by far, exceeded that of their <hi
                  rend="italic">Bodies</hi>.</p>
            <p>They had gone so much about, in seeking the By-roads, that they made it three times
               as long before they arriv’d at <hi rend="italic">Avigno</hi>, a small Village on the
               Borders of <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>, as any, that had come the direct way wou’d
               have done; but the Caution they had observ’d, was not altogether needless, as they
               presently found.</p>
            <p>A Gentleman who had been a particular Acquaintance of Monsieur <hi rend="italic"
                  >Frankville</hi>’s, overtook them at this Place, and after expressing some
               Amazement to find ’em no farther on their Journey, told Monsieur <hi rend="italic"
                  >Frankville</hi> he believ’d he cou’d inform him of some things which had happen’d
               since his Departure, and cou’d not yet have reach’d his Knowledge, which the other
               desiring him to do, the Gentleman began in this manner.</p>
            <p>It was no sooner Day, said he, than it was nois’d over all the City, that Donna <hi
                  rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, Count <hi rend="italic">D’elmont</hi>, and your self,
               had privately left <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi>; every Body spoke of it, according to
               their Humour; but the Friends of <hi rend="italic">Ciamara</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                  >Cittolini</hi> were outragious, a Complaint was immediately made to the <hi
                  rend="italic">Consistory</hi>, and all imaginable Deligence us’d, to overtake, or
               stop<pb n="238"/> you, but you were so happy as to Escape, and the Pursuers return’d without
               doing any thing of what they went about: Tho’ <hi rend="italic">Cittolini</hi>’s
               disappointment to all appearance, was the greatest, yet <hi rend="italic"
                  >Ciamara</hi> bore it with the least Patience, and having vainly rag’d, offer’d
               all the Treasure she was Mistress of, and perhaps spent the best part of it in
               fruitless means to bring you back, at last she swallow’d Poison, and in the raving
               agonies of Death, confess’d, that it was not the loss of <hi rend="italic"
                  >Camilla</hi>, but Count <hi rend="italic">D’elmont</hi> which was the Cause of
               her Despair: Her Death gave a fresh occasion of Grief to <hi rend="italic"
                  >Cittolini</hi>, but the Day in which she was interr’d, brought him yet a nearer;
               he had sent to his <hi rend="italic">Villa</hi> for his Daughter <hi rend="italic"
                  >Violetta</hi> to assist at the Funeral, and the Messenger return’d with the
               surprizing Account of her not having been there as she pretended she was, nothing was
               ever equal to the Rage, the Grief, and the Amazement of this distracted Father, when
               after the strictest Enquiry, and Search that cou’d be made, she was no where to be
               found or heard of, it threw him into a Fever, of which he linger’d but a small Time,
               and dy’d the same Day on which I left <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi>.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman who made this recital, was entirely a Stranger to any of the Company
               but Monsieur <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi>, and they were retired into a private
               Room during the time of their Conversation, which lasted not long; <hi rend="italic"
                  >Frankville</hi>, was impatient to communicate to Camilla and <hi rend="italic"
                  >D’elmont</hi> what he had heard, and as soon as Civility wou’d permit, took leave
               of the Gentleman.</p>
            <p>The Count had too much Compassion in his Nature not to be extreamly troubled when he
               was told this melancholly Catastrophe; but <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi> said
               little; the ill usage of <hi rend="italic">Ciamara</hi>, and the impudent, and
               interested Pretensions of <hi rend="italic">Cittolini</hi> to her, kept her from
               being so much <hi rend="italic">concern’d</hi> at their Misfortunes, as she wou’d
               have been at any other Persons, and the generosity of her Temper, or some other
               Reason which<pb n="239"/> the Reader will not be ignorant of, hereafter, from expressing any
                  <hi rend="italic">Satisfaction</hi> in the Punishment they had met: But when the
               Count, who most of all lamented <hi rend="italic">Violetta</hi>, express’d his
               Astonishment and Affliction, at her Elopement, she joyn’d with him in the Praises of
               that young Lady, with an eagerness which testify’d, she had no part in the Hatred she
               bore her Father.</p>
            <p>While they were discoursing, <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi> observ’d, that <hi
                  rend="italic">Fidelio</hi> who was all this while in the Room, grew very pale, and
               at last saw him drop on the Ground, quite Senseless, she run to him, as did his Lord,
               and Monsieur <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi>, and after, by throwing Water in his
               Face, they brought him to himself again, he appear’d in such an Agony that they
               fear’d his Fit wou’d return, and order’d him to be laid on a Bed, and carefully
               attended.</p>
            <p>After they had taken a short Repast, they began to think of setting forward on their
               Journey, designing to reach <hi rend="italic">Piedmont</hi> that Night: The Count
               went himself to the Chamber where his Page was laid, and finding he was very ill,
               told him he thought it best for him to remain in that Place, that he wou’d order
               Physicians to attend him, and that when he was fully recover’d, he might follow them
               to <hi rend="italic">Paris</hi> with Safety. <hi rend="italic">Fidelio</hi> was ready
               to faint a second time at the hearing these Words, and with the most earnest
               Conjurations, accompany’d with Tears, begg’d that he might not be left behind: I can
               but die, said he, if I go with you, but I am sure, that nothing if I stay can <hi
                  rend="italic">save</hi> me: The Count seeing him so pressing, sent for a <hi
                  rend="italic">Litter</hi>, but there was none to be got, and in spite of what <hi
                  rend="italic">Camilla</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi> cou’d say to
               diswade him, having his Lord’s Leave, he ventured to attend him as he had done the
               former part of the Journey.</p>
            <p>They Travell’d at an easy rate, because of <hi rend="italic">Fidelio</hi>’s
               Indisposition, and it being later than they imagin’d, Night came upon ’em before they
               were aware of it,<pb n="240"/> Usher’d in, by one of the most dreadful Storms that ever was;
               the Rain, the Hail; the Thunder, and the Lightning, was so Violent that it oblig’d
               ’em to mend their Pace to get into some Place of shelter, for there was no House
               near: But to make their Misfortune the greater, they miss’d the Road, and rode
               considerably out of their way, before they perceiv’d that they were wrong; the
               darkness of the Night, which had no Illumination than, now and then, a horrid flash
               of Lightning, the wildness of the Desart, which they had stray’d into, and the little
               Hopes they had of being able to get out of it, at least till Day, were sufficient to
               have struck Terror in the boldest Heart: <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi> stood in need
               of all her Love, to Protect her from the Fears which were beginning to Assault her;
               but poor <hi rend="italic">Fidelio</hi> felt an inward Horror, which, by this
               dreadful Scene encreas’d, made him appear wholly desparate: Wretch that I am, cry’d
               he, ’tis for me the Tempest rises! I justly have incurr’d the wrath of Heaven,---and
               you who are Innocent, by my accurs’d Presence are drawn to share a Punishment only
               due to Crimes like Mine! In this manner he exclaim’d wringing his Hands in bitter
               Anguish, and rather <hi rend="italic">Exposing</hi> his lovely Face to all the Fury
               of the Storm, than any way endeavouring to <hi rend="italic">Defend</hi> it: His
               Lord, and the two generous Lovers, tho’ Harass’d almost to Death themselves, said all
               they cou’d to comfort him; the Count and Monsieur <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi>
               consider’d his Words, rather as the Effects of his Indisposition, and the fatigue he
               endur’d, than remorse for any Crime he cou’d have been guilty of, and the pity they
               had for one so young and innocent, made the cruelty of the Weather more insupportable
               to them.</p>
            <p>At last, after long wandring, and the Tempest still encreasing, one of the Servants,
               who was before, was happy enough to explore a Path, and cry’d out to his Lord with a
               great deal of Joy, of the Discovery he had made; they were all of Opinion that it
               must lead to some House, because the<pb n="241"/> Ground was beat down, as if with the Feet
               of Passengers, and entirely free from Stubble, Stones and stumps of Trees, as the
               other part of the Desart they come thro’ was Encumber’d with.</p>
            <p>They had not rode very far before they discern’d Lights, the Reader may imagine the
               Joy this Sight produc’d, and that they were not slow in making their approach,
               Encourag’d by such a wish’d for Signal of Success: When they came pretty near, they
               saw by the Number of Lights, which were dispers’d in several Rooms distant from each
               other, that it was a very large and magnificent House, and made no doubt, but that it
               was the Country-Seat of some Person of great Quality: The wet Condition they were in,
               made them almost asham’d of appearing, and they agreed not to Discover who they were,
               if they found they were unknown.</p>
            <p>They had no sooner knock’d, than the Gate was immediately open’d by a Porter, who
               asking their Business, the Count told him they were Gentlemen, who had been so
               Unfortunate to mistake the Road to <hi rend="italic">Piedmont</hi>, and desir’d the
               Owners leave for Refuge in his House, for that Night; that is a Curtesy, said the
               Porter, which my Lord never refuses; and in Confidence of his Assent, I may venture
               to desire you to alight, and bid you welcome: They all accepted the Invitation, and
               were conducted into a stately Hall, where they waited not long before the Marquess
                  <hi rend="italic">De Saguillier</hi>, having been inform’d they appear’d like
               People of Condition, came himself to confirm the Character his Servant had given of
               his Hospitality. He was a Man perfectly well Bred, and in spite of the Disadvantages
               their Fatigue had subjected them to, he saw something in the Countenance of these
               Travellers, which commanded his Respect, and engag’d him to receive them with a more
               than ordinary Civility.</p>
            <p><pb n="242"/></p>
            <p>Almost the first thing the Count desir’d, was, that his Page might be taken care of;
               he was presently carry’d to Bed, and <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi> (to whom the
               Marquess made a thousand Apologies, that being a Batchellor, he cou’d not Accommodate
               her, as he cou’d the Gentlemen) was show’d to a Chamber, where some of the Maid
               Servants attended to put her on dry Cloaths.</p>
            <p>They were splendidly Entertain’d that Night, and when Morning came, and they were
               preparing to take Leave, the Marquess, who was strangely Charm’d with their
               Conversation, Entreated them to stay two or three Days with him, to recover
               themselves of the Fatigue they had suffer’d: The Count’s impatience to be at <hi
                  rend="italic">Paris</hi>, to enquire after his Dear <hi rend="italic"
                  >Melliora</hi>, wou’d never have permitted him to consent, if he had not been
               oblig’d to it, by being told, that <hi rend="italic">Fidelio</hi> was grown much
               worse, and not in a Condition to Travel; <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi> and <hi
                  rend="italic">Camilla</hi> had said nothing, because they wou’d not Oppose the <hi
                  rend="italic">Count</hi>’s Inclination, but were extreamly glad of an Opportunity
               to rest a little longer, tho sorry for the Occasion.</p>
            <p>The Marquess omitted nothing that might make their Stay agreeable; but tho’ he had a
               longing Inclination to know the Names, and Quality of his Guests, he forbore to ask,
               since he found they were not free to discover themselves: The Conversation between
               these accomplish’d Persons was extreamly Entertaining, and <hi rend="italic"
                  >Camilla</hi>, tho’ an <hi rend="italic">Italian</hi>, spoke <hi rend="italic"
                  >French</hi> well enough to make no inconsiderable part of it; the Themes of their
               Discourse were various, but at last happning to mention Love, the Marquess spoke of
               that Passion so feelingly, and express’d himself so vigorously when he attempted to
               excuse any of those Errors, it leads its Votaries into, that it was easy to Discover,
               he felt the Influence he endeavour’d to represent.</p>
            <p><pb n="243"/></p>
            <p>Night came on again, <hi rend="italic">Fidelio</hi>’s Distemper encreas’d to that
               degree, that they all began to despair of his Recovery, at least they cou’d not hope
               it for a long Time, if at all, and Count <hi rend="italic">D’elmont</hi> fretted
               beyond measure at this unavoidable delay of the progress of his Journey to that
               Place, where he thought there was only a possibility of hearing of <hi rend="italic"
                  >Melliora</hi>: As he was in Bed, forming a thousand various Idea’s, tho’ all
               tending to one Object, he heard the Chamber Door unlock, and opening his Curtains
               perceiv’d somebody come in; a Candle was burning in the next Room, and gave Light
               enough at the opening the Door, to show it was a Woman, but what Sort of one he cou’d
               not Discern, nor did he give himself the trouble of asking who was there, believing
               it might be one of the Servants come in to fetch something she wanted, ’till coming
               pretty near the Bed, she cry’d twice in a low Voice, are you a Sleep, no, answer’d
               he, a little surpriz’d at this Disturbance; what wou’d you have? I come said she, to
               talk to you, and I hope you are more a <hi rend="italic">Chevalier</hi>, than to
               prefer a little Sleep, to the Conversation of a Lady, tho’ she Visits you at
               Midnight: These words made <hi rend="italic">D’elmont</hi> believe he had met with a
               second <hi rend="italic">Ciamara</hi>, and lest he shou’d find the same Trouble with
               this as he had done with the former, he resolv’d to put a stop to it at once, and
               with an Accent as peevish as he cou’d turn his Voice to, the Conversation of Ladies
               reply’d he, is a Happiness I neither Deserve, nor much Desire at any Time, especially
               at this; therefore whoever you are, to oblige me, you must leave me to the freedom of
               my Thoughts, which at present afford me matter of Entertainment more suitable to my
               Humour than any thing I can find here! Oh Heavens! Said the Lady, is this the
               Courtly, the Accomplish’d Count <hi rend="italic">D’elmont</hi>? So fam’d for
               Complaisance and Sweetness? Can it be he, who thus rudely Repels a Lady, when she
               comes to make him a Present of her Heart? The Count was very much amaz’d to find he
               was known in a Place<pb n="244"/> where he thought himself wholly a Stranger, I perceive,
               answer’d he, with more Ill-humour if possible, than before, you are very well
               acquainted with my Name, which I shall never deny (tho’ for some Reasons I conceal’d
               it) but not at all with my Character, or you wou’d know, I can esteem the Love of a
               Woman, only when ’tis <hi rend="italic">Granted</hi>, and think it little worth
               acceptance, <hi rend="italic">Proffer’d</hi>. Oh unkind! Said she, but perhaps the
               sight of me, may inspire you with Sentiments less Cruel: With these Words she went
               hastily out of the Room to fetch the Candle she had left within; and the Count was so
               much surpriz’d and vex’d at the Immodesty and Imprudence he believ’d her Guilty of,
               that he thought he cou’d not put a greater affront upon her, than her Behaviour
               deserv’d, and turn’d himself with his Face the other way, designing to deny her the
               satisfaction even of a look; she return’d immediately, and having set down the Candle
               pretty near the Bed, came close to it her self, and seeing how he was laid; this is
               unkind indeed, said she, ’tis but one look I ask, and if you think me unworthy of
               another, I will for ever shun your Eyes: The Voice in which these Words were
               deliver’d, for those she spoke before were in a feign’d Accent, made the
               Heart-ravish’d <hi rend="italic">D’elmont</hi> turn to her indeed, with much more
               hast, than he had done to avoid her; those Dear, those well-remember’d sounds infus’d
               an Extacy, which none but <hi rend="italic">Melliora</hi>’s cou’d create; he
               hear’d---he saw,---’twas she, that very she, whose Loss he had so much deplor’d, and
               began almost to despair of ever being able to Retrieve! Forgetting all Decorum, he
               flew out of the Bed, catch’d her in his Arms, and almost stifl’d her with Kisses;
               which she returning with pretty near an equal eagerness, you will not chide me from
               you now she cry’d? Those who have Experienc’d any part of that Transport, <hi
                  rend="italic">D’elmont</hi> now was in, will know it was impossible for him to
               give her any other Answer, than repeating his Caresses; Words were too poor to
               Express what ’twas he felt, nor had he time to spare for Speech, employ’d in a far
               dearer,<pb n="245"/> softer Oratory, than all the force of Language cou’d come up to!</p>
            <p>But, when at last, to gaze upon her with more freedom, he releas’d her from that
               strict Embrace he had held her in, and she blushing, with down cast Eyes, began to
               reflect on the Effects of her unbounded passion, a sudden pang seiz’d on his Soul,
               and trembling, and convuls’d between extremity of <hi rend="italic">Joy</hi>, and
               extremity of <hi rend="italic">Anguish</hi>, I find thee <hi rend="italic"
                  >Melliora</hi>, cry’d he; but Oh, my Angel! Where is it thou art found?---in the
               House of the young Amorous <hi rend="italic">Marquess D’Sanguillier!</hi> Cease,
               cease, interrupted she, your causeless Fears,----where ever I am found, I am,----I
               can be only yours.----And if you will return to Bed, I will Inform you, not only what
               Accident brought me hither, but also every particular of my Behaviour since I
               came.</p>
            <p>These Words first put the Count in mind of the Indecency his Transport had made him
               Guilty of, in being seen in that manner, and was going hastily to throw on his Night
               Gown, when <hi rend="italic">Melliora</hi> perceiving his Intent, and fearing he
               wou’d take cold, told him she wou’d not stay a Moment, unless he granted her Request
               of returning to his Bed, which he, after having made her sit down on the Side of it,
               at last consented to: And contenting himself with taking one of her Hands, and
               pressing it between his, close Prisoner in his Bosom, gave her Liberty to begin in
               this Manner, the Discovery she had Promis’d.</p>
            <p>After the sad Accident of <hi rend="italic">Alovysa</hi>’s Death, said she, at my
               return to the Monastry I found a new <hi rend="italic">Pensioner</hi> there; it was
               the young <hi rend="italic">Madamoselle Charlotta D’Mezray</hi>, who being lately
               left an Orphan, was entrusted to the Care of our <hi rend="italic">Abbess</hi>, being
               her near Relation ’till her time of Mourning was expir’d, and she shou’d be married
               to this Marquess <hi rend="italic">D’Sanguillier</hi>, at whose House we are; they
               were Contracted by their Parents in their Infancy, and nothing but the sudden Death
               of<pb n="246"/> her Mother, had put a stop to the Consummation of what, <hi rend="italic"
                  >then</hi>, they both wish’d with equal Ardour: But alas! Heaven which decreed the
               little Beauty I am Mistress of, shou’d be pernicious to my own repose, ordain’d it
               so, that this unfaithful Lover, seeing me one Day at the <hi rend="italic">Grate</hi>
               with <hi rend="italic">Charlotta</hi>, shou’d fancy he found something in <hi
                  rend="italic">Me</hi> more worthy of creating a Passion, than he had in her, and
               began to wish himself releas’d from his Engagement with her, that he might have
               Liberty to enter into another, which he imagin’d wou’d be more pleasing: Neither she,
               nor I had the least suspicion of his Sentiments, and we having commenc’d a very great
               Friendship, she wou’d for the most part, desire me to partake in the Visits he made
               her: He still continu’d to make the same protestations of Affection to her as ever;
               but if on any occasion, she but turn’d her Head, or cast her Eyes another way, he
               wou’d give me such looks, as, tho’ I then but little regarded, I have since
               understood the meaning of, but too well; in this manner he proceeded for some Weeks,
               ’till at last he came one Day extreamly out of Humour, and told <hi rend="italic"
                  >Charlotta</hi> the occasion of it was, that he had heard she gave Encouragement
               to some other Lover; she, amaz’d, as well she might, Avow’d her Innocence, and
               endeavour’d to Undeceive him, but he, who resolv’d not to be convinc’d, at least not
               to seem as if he was, pretended to be more enrag’d at what he call’d weak Excuses;
               said, he was satisfy’d she was more Guilty, even than he wou’d speak,----that he knew
               not if it were consistent with his Honour, ever to see her more.---And in short,
               behav’d himself in so unaccountable a manner, that there was no room to Doubt that he
               was either the most <hi rend="italic">Impos’d</hi> on, or most <hi rend="italic"
                  >Base</hi> of Men: It wou’d be endless for me to endeavour to represent poor <hi
                  rend="italic">Charlotta</hi>’s affliction. So I shall only say, it was answerable
               to the Tenderness she had for him, which, cou’d by nothing be exceeded, but by that,
               continu’d she Sighing, and looking Languishingly on him, which contrary to all the
               Resolutions I had made, brings <hi rend="italic">me</hi><pb n="247"/> to seek the Arms of my
               Enchanting <hi rend="italic">D’elmont</hi>, to rouze Remembrance of his former
               Passion! To strengthen my Idea in his Heart! And Influence him a new with Love and
               Softness! This kind Digression made the Count give Truce to his <hi rend="italic"
                  >Curiosity</hi>, that he might Indulge the Raptures of his <hi rend="italic"
                  >Love</hi>, and raising himself in Bed, and pressing her slender fine proportioned
               Body close to his, wou’d permit her no otherwise, than in this Posture to continue
               her Discourse.</p>
            <p>Several Days resum’d <hi rend="italic">Melliora</hi>, were past, and we heard nothing
               of the Marquess, all which, as he has since told me, were spent in fruitless
               Projections to steal me from the Monastry; but at last, by the means of a <hi
                  rend="italic">Lay Sister</hi>, he found means to convey a Letter to me; the
               Contents of it, as near as I can remember, were these.</p>

            <p>’Tis impossible for me to express the Grief, and Vexation this Letter gave me, but I
               forbore showing it to <hi rend="italic">Charlotta</hi>, knowing how much it would
               encrease her Anguish, and resolv’d when next I saw him, as I made no doubt but I
               should quickly do, to use him in such a fashion, as in spite of his Vanity, shou’d
               make him know I was not to be won in such a manner; for I confess, my dear <hi
                  rend="italic">D’elmont</hi>, that his Timerity gave no less a shock to my <hi
                  rend="italic">Pride</hi>, than his Infidelity to her I really lov’d, did to my <hi
                  rend="italic">Friendship</hi>. The next Day I was told, a Gentleman enquir’d for
               me, I presently imagin’d it was he, and went to the Grate, with a Heart full of
               Indignation; I was not deceiv’d in my Conjecture, it was indeed the Marquess, who
               appear’d on the other side, but with so much Humility in his Eyes, and awful fear,
               for what he saw in Mine, as half disarm’d my Anger for what concern’d my self, and
               had his Passion not proceeded from his Inconstancy, I might have been drawn to <hi
                  rend="italic">pity</hi> what was not in my Power to Reward; but his base Usage of
               a Woman so deserving as <hi rend="italic">Charlotta</hi>, made me Express my self in
               Terms full of Disdain and Detestation, and without allowing him to Reply, or make any
               Excuses, pluck’d the Letter he had sent me out of my Pocket, with a design to return
               it him, just at that Moment when a <hi rend="italic">Nun</hi> came hastily to call me
               from the Grate: Some body had over-heard the beginning of what I said, and had told
               the <hi rend="italic">Abbess</hi>, who, tho’ she was not displeas’d at what she heard
               of my Behaviour to him, yet she thought it improper for me to hold any Discourse with
               a Man, who declar’d<pb n="249"/> himself my Lover: I did not, however, let her know who the
               Person was, fearing it might come to <hi rend="italic">Charlotta</hi>’s Ears, and
               encrease an Affliction, which was already too violent: I was vext to miss the
               Opportunity of giving back his Letter, but kept it still about me, not in the least
               Questioning, but that boldness which had encourag’d him to make a discovery of his
               Desires, wou’d again lead him to the Prosecution of them in the same manner, but I
               was deceiv’d, his Passion prompted him to take other, as he believ’d, more effectual
               Measures: One Day, at least a Fortnight after I had seen the <hi rend="italic"
                  >Marquess</hi>, as I was walking in the Garden with <hi rend="italic"
                  >Charlotta</hi>, and another young <hi rend="italic">Pensioner</hi>, a Fellow who
               was imploy’d in taking away Rubbish, told us there were some Statues carry’d by the
               Gate, which open’d into the Fields, which were the greatest Master-pieces of Art that
               had ever been seen: They are going, said he, to be plac’d in the <hi rend="italic"
                  >Seiur Valiers</hi> Garden, if you step but out, you may get a Sight of them: We,
               who little suspected any Deceit, run without Consideration, to satisfie our
               Curiosity, but instead of the Statues we expected to see, four Living Men disguis’d,
               muffl’d, and well Mounted, came Galloping up to us, and, as it were surrounded us,
               before we had Time to get back to the Gate we came out at: Three of them alighting,
               seiz’d me and my Companions, and I, who was the destin’d Prey, was in a Moment thrown
               into the Arms of him who was on Horseback, and who no sooner receiv’d me, than as if
               we had been mounted on a <hi rend="italic">Pegasus</hi>, we seem’d rather to <hi
                  rend="italic">fly</hi> than <hi rend="italic">Ride</hi>; in vain I struggl’d,
               shriek’d, and cry’d to Heaven for help, my Prayers were lost in Air, as quickly was
               my Speech, surprize, and rage, and dread, o’rewhelm’d my sinking Spirits, and unable
               to sustain the Rapidity of such violent Emotions, I fell into a Swoon, from which I
               recover’d not, till was at the Door of some House, but where I yet am ignorant; the
               first thing I saw, when I open’d my Eyes, was one of those Men who had been Assistant
               in my carrying away, and was now about to lift<pb n="250"/> me from the Horse: I had not yet
               the power to Speak, but when I had, I vented all the Passions of my Soul in terms
               full of Distraction and Despair: By what means the People of the House were gain’d to
               my Ravishers Interest, I know not, but they took little Notice of the Complaints I
               made, or my Implorations for Succour: I had now, not the least shadow of a Hope, that
               any thing but Death cou’d save me from Dishonour, and having vainly Rag’d, I at last
               sate down meditating by what means I shou’d Compass that only Relief from the worse
               Ruin which seem’d to threaten me: While my Thoughts were thus employ’d, he who
               appear’d the chief of that insolent Company, making a Sign that the rest shou’d
               withdraw, fell on his Knees before me, and plucking off his Vizard, discover’d to me
               the Face of the Marquess <hi rend="italic">D’Sanguillier</hi>. Heavens! How did this
               Sight inflame me? Mild as I am, by Nature, I that Moment was all Fury!----Till now I
               had not the least Apprehension who he was, and believ’d ’twas rather my <hi
                  rend="italic">Fortune</hi> than my <hi rend="italic">Person</hi>, which had
               prompted some daring Wretch to take this Method to obtain it; but now, my Woes
               appear’d, if possible, with greater Horror, and his Quality and Engagement with <hi
                  rend="italic">Charlotta</hi> made the Act seem yet more Base. I blame you not,
               said he, Oh Divinest <hi rend="italic">Melliora!</hi> The Presumption I am guilty of,
               is of so high a Nature, as justly may deserve your utmost Rigour!-----I know, and
               confess my Crime; Nay, hate my self for thus offending you.--But Oh? ’Tis
               unavoidable.---be then, like Heaven, who when Injured most, takes most delight to
               pardon: Crimes unrepented, answer’d I, can have no plea for Mercy, still to persist,
               and still to ask forgiveness, is <hi rend="italic">Mocking</hi> of the Power we seem
               to <hi rend="italic">Implore</hi>, and but encreases Sin.----Release me from this
               Captivity, which you have betray’d me into, Restore me to the Monastry----And for the
                  <hi rend="italic">future</hi>, cease to shock my Ears with Tales of violated
               Faith, detested Passion! Then, I perhaps, <hi rend="italic">may</hi> pardon what is
                  <hi rend="italic">past</hi>. His reply to all this was very little to the Purpose,
               only I perceiv’d he was so far from<pb n="251"/> complying with my Request, or repenting what
               he had done, that he resolv’d to proceed yet further, and one of his Associates
               coming in, to tell him that his Chariot, which it seems he had order’d to meet him
               there, was ready, he offer’d to take me by the Hand to lead me to it, which I
               refusing, with an Air which testify’d the Indignation of my Soul, Madam, said he, you
               are not here less in my Power, than you will be in a Place, where I can Accommodate
               you in a manner more suitable to your Quality, and the Adoration I have for you: If I
               were capable of a base Design on you, what hinders but I now might perpetrate it? But
               be assur’d, your Beauties are not of that kind, which inspire Sentiments
               dishonourable; nor shall you ever find any other Treatment from me, than what might
               become the humblest of your Slaves; my Love, fierce as it is, shall know it’s Limits,
               and never dare to Breath an Accent less Chast than your own Virgin Dreams, and
               Innocent as your Desires.</p>
            <p>Tho’ the boldness he had been guilty of, and still persisted in, made me give but
               little Credit to the latter part of his Speech, yet the Beginning of it awak’d my
               Consideration to a reflection, that I cou’d not indeed be any where in a greater
               danger of the Violence I fear’d, than where I was; but on the contrary, it might so
               happen, that in leaving that Place, I might possibly meet some Persons who might know
               me, or at least be carry’d somewhere, whence I might with more likelihood, make my
               Escape: In this last Hope, I went into the Chariot, and indeed, to do him justice,
               neither in our Journey, nor since I came into his House, has he ever violated the
               Promise he made me; nothing can be with more Humility than his Addresses to me, never
               Visiting me without first having obtain’d my leave! But to return to the particulars
               of my Story, I had not been here many Days, before a Servant-Maid of the House, being
               in my Chamber doing something about me, ask’d me if it were possible I cou’d forget
               her; the Question<pb n="252"/> surpriz’d me, but I was much more so, when looking earnestly
               in her Face, which I had never done before, I perfectly distinguish’d the Features of
                  <hi rend="italic">Charlotta</hi>: Oh Heavens! cry’d I, <hi rend="italic"
                  >Charlotta</hi>! The very same, said she, but I dare not stay now to unfold the
               Mistery, lest any of the Family take Notice; at Night when I undress you, you shall
               know the History of my Transformation.</p>
            <p>Never any Day seem’d so long to me as that, and I feign’d my self indispos’d, and
               rung my Bell for some body to come up, several Hours before the time I us’d to go to
               Bed, <hi rend="italic">Charlotta</hi> guessing my impatience, took care to be in the
               way, and as soon as she was with me, not staying for my Requesting it of her, begun
               the Information she had promis’d, in this manner.</p>
            <p>You see, said she, forcing her self to put on a half smile, your unhappy Rival
               follows to interrupt the Triumph of your Conquest; but I protest to you, that if I
               thought you esteem’d my perjur’d Lover’s Heart an offering worthy your Acceptance, I
               never wou’d have disturb’d your happiness, and ’tis as much the Hopes of being able
               to be Instrumental in serving you in your Releasment, as the prevention of that
               Blessing the injurious <hi rend="italic">D’Sanguillier</hi> aims at, which has
               brought me here: Of all the Persons that bewail’d your being carry’d away, I was the
               only one who had any Guess at the Ravisher, nor had I been so wise, but that the very
               Day on which it happen’d, you drop’d a Letter, which I took up, and knowing it the
                  <hi rend="italic">Marquess</hi>’s Hand, made no scruple of Reading it. I had no
               opportunity to upbraid you for the concealment of his falshood, but the manner of
               your being seiz’d, convinc’d me you were Innocent of favouring his Passion, and his
               Vizard flipping a little on one Side, as he took you in his Arms, discover’d enough
               of that Face, I have so much ador’d, for me to know who it was, that had took this
               Method to gain you: I will<pb n="253"/> not continu’d she, weeping, trouble you with any
               Recital of what I endur’d from the Knowledge of my Misfortune, but you may judge it
               by my Love, however, I bore up against the Oppressive weight, and resolv’d to
               struggle with my Fate, even to the Last; I made an Excuse for leaving the Monastry
               the next Day, without giving any suspicion of the Cause, or letting any body into the
               Secret of the Marquess, and Disguis’d as you see, found means to be receiv’d by the
               House-keeper, as a Servant, I came here in three Days after you, and have had the
               opportunity of being confirm’d by your Behaviour, of what I before believ’d, that you
               were far from being an Assistant in his Design.</p>
            <p>Here the sorrowful <hi rend="italic">Charlotta</hi> finish’d her little Account, and
               I testify’d the Joy I felt in seeing her, by a thousand Embraces, and all the
               Protestations of Eternal Friendship to her, that I could make: All the times we had
               any opportunity of Talking to each other, were spent in forming Schemes for my
               Escape, but none of them appear’d feasible; however the very Contrivance was a kind
               of Pleasure to me, for tho’ I began to banish all my Fears of the Marquess’s offering
               any violence to my Virtue, yet I found his Passion wou’d not permit him to suffer my
               Departure, and I was almost Distracted when I had no Hopes of being in a Capacity of
               hearing from you, or writing to you: In this fashion, my dearest <hi rend="italic"
                  >D’elmont</hi> have I liv’d, sometimes flattering my self with vain Projects,
               sometimes desponding of being ever free: But last Night, <hi rend="italic"
                  >Charlotta</hi> coming up, according to her Custom, told me in a kind of Rapture,
               that you, and my Brother were in the House, she, it seems knew you at <hi
                  rend="italic">Paris</hi> while her Mother was yet Living, and to make her entirely
               easy as to the Marquess, I had now made her the Confidant of my Sentiments concerning
               you: I need not tell you the Extacy this News gave me, you are too well acquainted
               with my Heart, not to be able to conceive it more justly than<pb n="254"/> Language can
               Express; but I cannot forbear Informing you of one thing, of which you are ignorant,
               tho’ had Prudence any share in this Love-directed Soul, I shou’d conceal it: My
               impatience to behold you, was almost equal to my Joy to think you were so near, and
               transported with my eager wishes, by <hi rend="italic">Charlotta</hi>’s Assistance, I
               last Night found the way into your Chamber: I saw you, Oh <hi rend="italic"
                  >D’elmont</hi>! My longing Eyes enjoy’d the satisfaction they so much desir’d, but
               yours were clos’d, the Fatigue of your Journey had laid you fast a Sleep, so fast,
               that even Fancy was unactive, and no kind Dream, alarm’d you with one Thought of <hi
                  rend="italic">Melliora</hi>!</p>
            <p>She cou’d not pronounce these last Words very Intelligibly, the greedy Count devour’d
               ’em as she spoke, and tho’ Kisses had made many a Parenthesis in her Discourse, yet
               he restrain’d himself as much as possible, for the Pleasure of hearing her; but
               perceiving she was come to a Period, he gave a loose to all the furious Transports of
               his ungovern’d Passion: A while their Lips were Cemented! Rivetted together with
               Kisses, such Kisses! As Collecting every Sence in one, exhale the very Soul, and
               mingle Spirits! Breathless with bliss, then wou’d they pause and gaze, then joyn
               again, with Ardour still encreasing, and Looks, and Sighs, and straining Grasps were
               all the Eloquence that either cou’d make use of: Fain wou’d he now have obtain’d the
               aim of all his Wishes, strongly he press’d, and faintly she repuls’d: Dissolv’d in
               Love, and melting in his Arms, at last she found no Words to form Denials, while he,
               all fire, improv’d the lucky Moment, a thousand Liberties he took.----A thousand Joys
               he reap’d, and had infallibly been possest of all, if <hi rend="italic"
                  >Charlotta</hi>, who seeing it broad Day, had not wonder’d at <hi rend="italic"
                  >Melliora</hi>’s stay, and come and knock’d at the Chamber Door, which not being
               fasten’d, gave way to her Entrance, but she made not such hast, but that they had
               time enough to Disengage themselves from that close Embrace they had held each<pb n="255"/>
               other in: Heavens! <hi rend="italic">Melliora</hi>, cry’d the careful Interrupter,
               what mean you by this stay, which may be so prejudicial to our Designs; the Marquess
               is already stirring, and if he shou’d come into this Room, or send to yours, what
               might be the Consequence: I come, I come, said <hi rend="italic">Melliora</hi>,
               alarm’d at what she heard, and rising from the Bed-side: Oh, you will not, said the
               Count in a Whisper, and tenderly pressing her Hand, you must not leave me thus! A few
               Hours hence, answer’d she aloud, I hope to have the Power to own my self all yours,
               nor can the Scheme we have laid fail of the Effects we wish, if no Discovery happens
               to Postpone it: She was going with <hi rend="italic">Charlotta</hi> out of the
               Chamber, with these Words, but remembring her self, she turn’d hastily back, let not
               my Brother, Resum’d she, know my Weakness, and when you see me next, feign a surprize
               equal to his own.</p>
            <p>It is not to be suppos’d that after she was gone, <hi rend="italic">D’elmont</hi>,
               tho’ kept awake all Night, cou’d suffer any Sleep to enter his Eyes; excess of Joy of
               all the Passions, hurries the Spirits most, and keeps ’em longest busied: <hi
                  rend="italic">Anger</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Grief</hi>, rage violently at first,
               but quickly flag, and sink at last into a Lethargy, but <hi rend="italic"
                  >Pleasure</hi> warms, exhillerates the Soul, and every rapturous Thought infuses
               new Desires, new Life, and added Vigour.</p>
            <p>The Marquess <hi rend="italic">D’Sanguillier</hi> was no less happy in imagination
               than the Count, and it was the force of that Passion which had rouz’d him so early
               that Morning, and made him wait impatiently for his Guests coming out of their
               Chambers, for he wou’d not disturb them: As soon as they were all come into the
               Drawing-Room, I know not Messiures, said he, with a Voice and Eyes wholly chang’d
               from those he wore the Day before, whether you have ever Experienc’d the force of
               Love to that Degree that I have, but I dare believe you have Generosity enough to
               rejoyce in the good Fortune I am going to be<pb n="256"/> possess’d of; and when I shall
               inform you how I have long languish’d in a Passion, perhaps, the most extravagant
               that ever was, you will confess the Justice of that God, who soon or late, seldom
               suffers his faithful Votaries to miss their Reward: The Count cou’d not force himself
               to a Reply to these Words, but <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi> and <hi
                  rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, who were entirely Ignorant of the Cause of them,
               heartily Congratulated him. I am Confident, resum’d the Marquess, that Despair has no
               Existance but in weak and timerous Minds, all Women may be won by Force or Stratagem,
               and tho’ I had, almost, invincible Difficulties to struggle with, Patience,
               Constancy, and a bold and artful Management has at length surmounted them: Hopeless
               by Distant Courtship to obtain the <hi rend="italic">Heart</hi> of my Adorable, I
               found means to make my self Master of her <hi rend="italic">Person</hi>, and by
               making no other use of the Power I had over her, than humbly Sighing at her Feet,
               convinc’d her my Designs were far from being Dishonourable; and last Night, looking
               on me, with more kindness than she had ever done before: My Lord, said she, your
               Usage of me has been too Noble, not to vanquish what ever Sentiments I may have been
               possest with to your Prejudice, therefore since you have Company in the House, who
               may be Witness of what I do, I think I cannot chuse a fitter time, than this, to
               bestow my self, before them, on him who most Deserves me: I will not now, continu’d
               he, delay the Confirmation of my Happiness so long, as to go about to describe the
               Extacy I felt, for this so wish’d, and so unhop’d a Condescension, but when,
               hereafter, you shall be told the whole History of my Passion, you will be better able
               to conceive it; the Marquess had scarce done speaking, when his Chaplain came into
               the Room, saying, he believ’d it was the Hour his Lordship order’d him to attend; it
               is! it is, cry’d the transported Marquess. Now my worthy Guests you shall behold the
               lovely Author of my Joys; with these Words he left them, but immediately return’d,
               leading the intended Bride: Monsieur<pb n="257"/>
               <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi>, tho’ he had not seen his Sister in some Years,
               knew her at the first Glimpse, and the Surprize of meeting her----Meeting her in so
               unexpected a manner was so great, that his Thoughts were quite confounded with it,
               and he cou’d no otherwise Express it, than by throwing his Eyes wildly, sometimes on
               her, sometimes on the Count, and sometimes on the Marquess; the Count tho’ appris’d
               of this, felt a Consternation for the Consequence little inferior to his, and both
               being kept silent by their different Agitations, and the Marquess, by the sudden
               Change, which he perceiv’d in their Countenances, <hi rend="italic">Melliora</hi> had
               liberty to explain her self in this manner. I have kept my Word, my Lord, said she to
               the Marquess, this Day shall give me to him who best deserves me; but who that is, my
               Brother and Count <hi rend="italic">D’elmont</hi> must determine, since Heaven has
               restor’d them to me, all Power of disposing of my self must cease; ’tis they must,
               henceforth, rule the will of <hi rend="italic">Melliora</hi>, and only their consent
               can make me yours; all Endeavours wou’d be vain to represent the Marquess’s confusion
               at this sudden Turn, and ’tis hard to say whether his Astonishment, or Vexation was
               greatest; her Brother he wou’d little have regarded, not doubting but his Quality,
               and the Riches he was possest of, wou’d easily have gain’d his Compliance; but Count
                  <hi rend="italic">D’elmont</hi>, tho’ he knew him not (having, for some disgust he
               receiv’d at Court, been many Years absent from <hi rend="italic">Paris</hi>,) yet he
               had heard much talk of him; and the Passion he had for <hi rend="italic"
                  >Melliora</hi>, by the Adventure of <hi rend="italic">Alovysa</hi>’s Death, had
               made too great a Noise in the World not to have reach’d his Ears; he stood Speechless
               for some time, but when he had a little recover’d himself, have you then Deceiv’d me,
               Madam, Said he? No, answer’d she, I am still ready to perform my promise, whenever
               these Gentlemen shall command me.----The one my Brother, the other my Guardian,
               obtain but their Consent, and----Mine, he can never have, Interrupted <hi
                  rend="italic">Frankville</hi> hastily, and laying his Hand on his Sword. Nor<pb n="258"/>
               mine, cry’d the Count, while I have Breath to form Denials, or my Arm strength to
               Guard my Beauteous Charge; hold Brother,----Hold, my Lord, said <hi rend="italic"
                  >Melliora</hi>, fearing their Fury wou’d produce some fatal Effects, the <hi
                  rend="italic">Marquess</hi> has been so truly Noble, that you rather ought to
               Thank, than resent his Treatment of me, and tho’ I see Rage in <hi rend="italic"
                  >your</hi> Eyes, and all the Stings of disappointment glowing fierce in <hi
                  rend="italic">his</hi>, yet I have Hopes, a general Content may Crown the
               End.----Appear! Continu’d she, raising her Voice, appear! Thou lovely faithful Maid!
               Come forth and Charm thy roving Lovers Heart again to Constancy, to Peace, and thee!
               She had no sooner spoke, then <hi rend="italic">Charlotta</hi> entred, drest like a
               Bride indeed, in a Suit of Cloaths, which she had brought with her, in case any happy
               Opportunity shou’d arise for her to discover herself: If the <hi rend="italic"
                  >Marquess</hi> was before confounded, how much more so was he now? That injur’d
               Ladies Presence, just at this juncture, and the Surprize by what means she came
               there, made him utterly unable to resolve on any thing, which she observing, and
               taking advantage of his Confusion, run to him, and catching hold of his Hand; wonder
               not my Lord, said she, to see <hi rend="italic">Charlotta</hi> here, nothing is
               impossible to Love like mine, tho’ slighted and abandon’d by you, still I pursue your
               Steps with Truth, with Tenderness, and Constancy untir’d!---Then, perceiving he still
               was silent, come, my Lord, continu’d she, you must at last take Pity on my
               Sufferings, my Rival, Charming as she is, wants a just sensibility of your Deserts,
               and is by that, less worthy even than I; Oh, then remember, if not to me, what ’tis
               you owe your self your own exhalted Merits, and you will soon determine in my Favour,
               and confess that she, who knows you best, ought most to have you; she spoke these
               Words in so moving an Accent, and they were accompany’d with so many Tears, that the
               most rocky Heart must have relented, and that the Marquess was sensibly touch’d with
               ’em, his Countenance Testify’d, when sighing, and turning his Head a little away, not
               with disdain, but Remorse,<pb n="259"/> for the Infidelity he had been guilty of: Oh, cease,
               said he, this Flood of Softness, it gives me Pains I never felt before, for ’tis
               impossible you can forgive---Oh Heaven! cry’d the transported <hi rend="italic"
                  >Charlotta</hi>, all you have done, or ever can do of Unkindness, is by one tender
               Word made full amends for; see at your Feet, (continued she, falling on her Knees)
               thus in this humble Posture, which best becomes my prostrate Soul, I beg you to
               accept the Pardon which I bring, to banish from your Mind all Thoughts that you have
               injured me, and leave it free from all the generous Joys, the making others happy,
               must create: This Action of <hi rend="italic">Charlotta</hi>’s, join’d to the
               Reflection, how strangely every Thing happen’d to prevent his Designs on the other,
               won him entirely, and raising her with a tender Embrace, put it out of her Power to
               regret his ever being False, since his Return gave her a Taste of Joys, which are
               not, but in Reconciliation to be found.</p>
            <p>The Count, Monsieur <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi>, and the two Ladies who had
               waited all this while in an impatient Expectation for the end of this Affair, now
               paid their several Congratulations, all highly applauding the Constancy of <hi
                  rend="italic">Charlotta</hi>, and the timely Repentance of the Marquess: These
               Ceremonies being over, the Marquess desir’d <hi rend="italic">Charlotta</hi> to
               acquaint him by what means she had gain’d Admittance to his House unknown to him;
               which Curiosity she immediately satisfying, engag’d a new, the Praises of the whole
               Company, and more endear’d herself to her belov’d Marquess’s Affections.</p>
            <p>Tranquility now reign’d in those Hearts, which lately heav’d with various and
               disturb’d Emotions, and Joy sate smiling upon every Cheek, entirely happy in their
               several Wishes: They could now talk of past Woes with Pleasure, and began to enter
               into a very delightful Conversation, when <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi> on a
               sudden missing <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, and asking for her, one<pb n="260"/> of the
               Servants told him she was gone to the Sick Page’s Chamber, this News gave him some
               little alarm, and the rather, because he had observ’d she expressed a more than
               ordinary Tenderness and Care for this Page, all the Time of their Journey; he ran
               immediately to the Room where he heard she was, and found her lying on the Bed, with
               her Arms round <hi rend="italic">Fidelio</hi>’s Neck, and her Face close to his; this
               shocking Sight had certainly driven the Rashness of his Temper to commit some Deed of
               Horror, if the Amazement he was in had not prevented it; he drew his Sword half out,
               but then, as if some Spell had charm’d his Arm, remain’d in that Posture, fix’d and
               motionless as Marble: <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi> half blinded with the Tears
               which fell from her Eyes, saw not the Confusion he was in, nor considered the seeming
               Reason he had to be so, but raising her Head a little to see who it was that came
               into the Chamber, Oh <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi>! said she, see here the Ruins
               of Love, behold the Tyranny of that fatal Passion in this expiring Fair! But haste,
               contin’d she, finding him ready to faint, let Count <hi rend="italic">D’elmont</hi>
               know, the faithful, generous <hi rend="italic">Violetta</hi>! Dies---she dies for
               him, and asks no other Recompence, than a last Farewell--<hi rend="italic"
                  >Violetta</hi>! interrupted <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi>, what means <hi
                  rend="italic">Camilla</hi>? This, this is <hi rend="italic">Violetta</hi>, resum’d
               she, who like a Page disguis’d, has followed the too lovely Count, and lost herself:
               The Rage which at his first Entrance had possest the Heart of <hi rend="italic"
                  >Frankville</hi>, now gave Way to Grief, and coming near the Bed, he began to
               testify it, by all the Marks which an unfeign’d Concern cou’d give; but this
               unfortunate Languisher, finding her Strength decay, prevented him from making any
               long Speeches, by renewing that Request which <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi> had
               already made known, of seeing her dear Lord before she dy’d, which <hi rend="italic"
                  >Frankville</hi> making haste to fulfil, she call’d to him as loud as her Weakness
               would permit to come back, and as soon as he was, <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>,
               said she, has inform’d me of my Lord’s good Fortune in meeting with the Charmer of
               his Soul, I would not deprive him of a<pb n="261"/> Moments Happiness. I therefore beg she’d
               give a dying Rival, leave to wish her Joy, and as neither my Death, nor the Cause of
               it can be a Secret to any of the Company here, I desire they all may be Witnesses,
               with what Pleasure I welcome it; <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi>, Fiery as he was,
               had a vast deal of Compassion in his Nature, and could not see so beautiful a young
               Lady, and one whom he had so many Obligations to, on the Account of his Affair with
                  <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, in this despairing and dying Condition, without
               being seiz’d with an Anguish inexpressible; but all the Pangs he felt were nothing
               when compar’d to those he gave <hi rend="italic">D’elmont</hi> in the Delivery of her
               Message; he ran into the Room like a Man distracted, and in the Hurry of his Grief
               forgot even the Complaisance he ow’d to <hi rend="italic">Melliora</hi>, but she was
               too generous to disapprove his Concern, immediately followed with her Brother, the
               Marquess and <hi rend="italic">Charlotta</hi>: What is it that I hear Madam, cry’d
               the Count, throwing himself on the Bed by her? Can it be possible that the admir’d
                  <hi rend="italic">Violetta</hi> cou’d forsake her
               Father,---Country,---Friends,---forego her Sexes Pride,---the Pomp of Beauty,---gay
               Dresses, and all the Equipage of State and Grandeur; to follow in a mean Disguise, a
               Man unworthy her Thoughts? Oh! no more, said she, weeping, you are but too, too
               worthy Adoration; nor do I yet believe my Love a Crime, tho’ the Consequence is so: I
               might in <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi>, with Honour and Innocence have died, but by my
               shameful Flight, I was the Murderer of my Father---that---that’s a Guilt, which all
               these Floods of Penitence can never wash away---Yet, bear me Witness Heaven, how
               little I suspected the sad Event, when first, unable to support your Absence, I
               contriv’d this Way, unknown, to keep for ever in your Sight; I lov’d, ’tis true, but
               if one unchaste Wish, or an impure Desire e’er stain’d my Soul, then may the purging
               Fire to which I am going, miss its Effect, my Spots remain, and not one Saint
               vouchsafe to own me: Here the Force of her Passion, agitating her Spirits with too
               much<pb n="262"/> Violence for the Weakness of her Body, she sunk fainting in the Bed: And
               tho’ the Count and <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi> felt the most deeply her
               Afflictions, the one because they proceeded from her Love to him, and the other as
               having long been her Friend, and Partner of her Secrets, yet those in the Company who
               were most Strangers to her, participated in her Sufferings, and commiserated the Woes
               they could not heal; and as soon as she recovered from her Swoon, the generous <hi
                  rend="italic">Melliora</hi> (not in the least possest with any of those little
               Jealousies, which Women of narrow Souls harbour on such Occasions) came nearer to the
               Bed, and taking her kindly by the Hand, Live and be comforted, said she, a Love so
               innocent shall never give me any Disquiet.---Live and Enjoy the Friendship of my
               Lord, and if you please to favour me with yours, I shall esteem it as it deserves, a
               Blessing. No Madam, answered the now almost Expiring <hi rend="italic">Violetta</hi>,
               Life, after this shameful Declaration, wou’d be the worst of Punishments, but, not to
               be Ungrateful to so generous an Offer, for a few Moments I accept it, and like
               Children, placing their darling Play things on their Pillow, and then contented to go
               to Sleep, so I would keep your Lord, would view him still while I awake to Life, then
               drop insensibly into a Slumber of eternal Peace. This mournful Tenderness pierc’d <hi
                  rend="italic">D’elmont</hi>, to the very Soul, and putting his Arm gently under
               her Head, which, he perceiv’d she was too weak to raise when she endeavoured it, and
               laying his Face on one of her Hands, cou’d not forbear washing it in Tears, she felt
               the cordial Drops, and, as if they gave her a new Vigour, exerting her Voice to the
               utmost of her Strength; this is too kind, said she, I now can feel none of those
               Agonies which render Death the King of Terrors, and thus, thus happy in your
               Sight,------your Touch------your tender Pity, I can but be Translated from one Heaven
               to another, and yet, forgive me Heaven, if it be a Sin, I cou’d wish, methinks, to
               know no other Paradise than you, to<pb n="263"/> be permitted to hover round you, to Form
               your Dreams, to sit upon your Lips all Day, to mingle with your Breath, and glide in
               unfelt Air into your Bosom: She wou’d have proceeded, but her Voice faultered in the
               Accent, and all she spoke distinguishable was, Oh <hi rend="italic">D’elmont</hi>!
               receive in this one Sigh, my latest Breath-----it was indeed her last, she died that
               Moment, died in his Arms, whom more than Life she priz’d, and sure there are none who
               have liv’d in the Anxieties of Love, who wou’d not envy such a Death!</p>
            <p>There was not in this noble Company, one whose Eyes were dry, but Count <hi
                  rend="italic">D’elmont</hi> was for some Time inconsolable, even by <hi
                  rend="italic">Melliora</hi>; he forbore the celebrating of his so eagerly desired
               Nuptials, as did the Marquess and Monsieur <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi> theirs,
               in Complaisance to him, ’till after <hi rend="italic">Violetta</hi> was interr’d,
               which the Count took Care should be in a Manner becoming her Quality, her Merit, and
               the Esteem he profess’d to have born her: But when this melancholly Scene was past, a
               Day of Joy succeeded, and one happy Hour confirm’d the Wishes of the three longing
               Bridegrooms; the Weddings were all kept in a splendid Manner at the Marquess’s, and
               it was not with out a great deal of Reluctance, that he and <hi rend="italic"
                  >Charlotta</hi> suffered the Count, Monsieur <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi>,
               and their Ladies to take leave of them. When they came to <hi rend="italic"
                  >Paris</hi>, they were joyfully received by the Chevalier <hi rend="italic"
                  >Brillian</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ansellina</hi>, and those, who in the Count’s
               Absence had taken a Liberty of censuring and condemning his Actions, aw’d by his
               Presence, and in Time, won by his Virtues, now swell his Praises with an equal
               Vehemence: Both he and <hi rend="italic">Frankville</hi> are still living, blest with
               a numerous and hopeful Issue, and continue with their fair Wives, great and lovely
               Examples of conjugal Affection.</p>
