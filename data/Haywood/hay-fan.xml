                  />Playhouses during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in England organized
                  seating according to price and social status. Boxes were the most expensive of
                  seating areas, and could hold several people in style. The image included here,

                  person to whom a company is requested to drink; often one who is the reigning
                  belle of the season" (n2.1).</note>, she perceived several Gentlemen extremely

                  resp="TH">The "pit" was a mixed-sex seating area in the eighteenth-century,
                  notable for its energy and activity. According to <hi rend="italic">The Oxford
                     Companion to Theatre and Performance</hi>, the "pit occupied the floor of the
                  theatre at a lower level than the stage and, unlike the standing pit of earlier
                  public theatres, contained rows of backless benches set on a raked floor. Seats in
                  the pit were half the price of a seat in the box and attracted a mixed audience of
                  men and women. The activity of the audience in the pit and the behaviour of the
                  occupants of the boxes, especially with the King present, were part of the
                  theatregoing spectacle." Prostitutes, wits, and rakes frequented the pit and the
                  middle galleries. For more information, see Douglas Canfield's introduction to <hi
                     rend="italics">The Broadview Anthology of Restoration and Early
                     Eighteenth-Century Drama</hi> (vxiii).</note>, and, by her Air and Manner of
               receiving them, might easily be known to be one of those who come there for no other
               Purpose, than to create Acquaintance with as many as seem desirous of it. She could
               not help testifying her Contempt of Men, who, regardless either of the Play, or
               Circle, threw away their Time in such a Manner, to some Ladies that sat by her: But
               they, either less surprised by being more accustomed to such Sights, than she who had
               been bred for the most Part in the Country, or not of a Disposition to consider any
               Thing very deeply, took but little Notice of it. She still thought of it, however;
               and the longer she reflected on it, the greater was her Wonder, that Men, some of
               whom she knew were accounted to have Wit, should have Tastes so <pb n="258"
                  facs="images/HF-258.jpg"/> very Depraved. â This excited a Curiosity in her to
               know in what Manner these Creatures were address'd:â She was young, a Stranger to the
               World, and consequently to the Dangers of it; and having no Body in Town, at that
               Time, to whom she was oblig'd to be accountable for her Actions, did in every Thing
               as her Inclinations or Humours render'd most agreeable to her: Therefore thought it
               not in the least a Fault to put in practice a little Whim which came immediately into
               her Head, to dress herself as near as she could in the Fashion of those Women who
               make sale of their Favours, and set herself in the Way of being accosted as such a
               one, having at that Time no other Aim, than the Gratification of an innocent
               Curiosity.â She had no sooner design'd this Frolick, than she put it in Execution;

               counterfeited the Part of one, and taken so much Pains to engage him, should lament a
               Consequence which she could not but expect, and till the last Test, seem'd inclinable
               to grant; and was both surpris'd and troubled at the Mystery. â He omitted nothing
               that he thought might make her easy; and still retaining an Opinion that the Hope of
               Interest had been the chief Motive which had led her to act in the Manner she had
               done, and believing that she might know so little of him, as to suppose, now she had
               nothing left to give, he might not make that Recompense she expected for her Favours:
               To put her out of that Pain, he pulled out of his Pocket a Purse of Gold, entreating
               her to accept of that as an Earnest of what he intended to do for her; assuring her,
               with ten thousand Protestations, that he would spare nothing, which his whole Estate
               could purchase, to procure her Content and Happiness. This Treatment made her quite
               forget the Part she had assum'd, and throwing it from her with an Air of Disdain,
                  <said>Is this a Reward (said she) for Condescensions, such as I have yeilded to? â

                  â Oh! no, I am undone beyond the Power of Heaven itself to help me!</said> â She
               uttered many more such Exclamations; which the amaz'd Beauplaisir heard without being
               able to reply to, till by Degrees sinking <pb n="264" facs="images/HF-264.jpg"/> from
               that Rage of Temper, her Eyes resumed their softning Glances, and guessing at the
               Consternation he was in, <said>No, my dear Beauplaisir, (added she,) your Love alone
                  can compensate for the Shame you have involved me in; be you sincere and constant,
                  and I hereafter shall, perhaps, be satisfy'd with my Fate, and forgive myself the
                  Folly that betray'd me to you.</said></p>

            <p> BEAUPLAISIR thought he could not have a better Opportunity than these Words gave him
               of enquiring who she was, and wherefore she had feigned herself to be of a Profession
               which he was now convinc'd she was not; and after he had made her thousand Vows of an
               Affection, as inviolable and ardent as she could wish to find in him, entreated she
               would inform him by what Means his Happiness has been brought about, and also to whom
               he was indebted for the Bliss he had enjoy'd. â Some remains of yet unextinguished
               Modesty, and Sense of Shame, made her Blush exceedingly at this Demand; but
               recollecting herself in a little Time, she told him so much of the Truth, as to what
               related to the Frolick she had taken of satisfying her Curiosity in what Manner
               Mistresses, of the Sort she appeared to be, were treated by those who addressed them;
               but forbore discovering her true Name and Quality, for the Reasons she had done
               before, resolving, if he boasted of this Affair, he should not have it in his Power
               to touch her Character: She therefore said she was the Daughter of a Country

            <p> SHE knew that Beauplaisir came alone in his Chariot to the Bath, and in the Time of
               her being Servant in the House where he lodg'd, heard nothing of any Body that was to
               accompany him to London, and hop'd he wou'd return in the same Manner he had gone:
               She therefore hir'd Horses and a Man to attend her to an Inn about ten Miles on this
               side Bath, where having discharg'd them, she waited till the Chariot should come by;
               which when it did, and she saw that he was alone in it, she call'd to him that drove
               it to stop a Moment, and going to the Door saluted the Master with these Words:</p>

            <p>
               <said>THE Distress'd and Wretched, Sir, (said she,) never fail to excite Compassion
                  in a generous Mind; and I hope I am not deceiv'd in my Opinion that yours is such:
                  â You have the Appearance of a Gentleman, and cannot, when you hear my Story,
                  refuse that Assistance which is in your Power to give to an unhappy Woman, who
                  without it, may be rendered the most miserable of all created Beings.</said></p>

            <p> IT would not be very easy to represent the Surprise, so odd an Address created in
               the Mind of him to whom it was made. â She had not the Appearance of one who wanted
               Charity; and what other Favour she requir'd he cou'd not conceive: But telling her,
               she might command any Thing in his Power, gave her Encouragement to declare herself
               in this Manner: <said>You may judge, (resumed she,) by the melancholy Garb I am in,
                  that I have lately lost all that ought to be valuable to Womankind; but it is
                  impossible for you to guess the Greatness of my Misfortune, unless you had known
                  my Husband, who was Master of every Perfection to endear him to a Wife's
                  Affections. â But, notwithstanding, I look on myself as the most unhappy of my Sex
                  in out-living him, I must so far obey the Dictates of my Discretion, as to take
                  care of the little Fortune he left behind him, which being in the hands of a
                  Brother of his in London, will be all carried off to Holland, where he is going to

                  travelling any long Journey on Horseback, I have no Way to go to London, and must
                  be inevitably ruin'd in the Loss of all I have on Earth, without you have good
                  Nature enough to admit me to take Part of your Chariot.</said></p>

            <p> HERE the feigned Widow ended her sorrowful Tale, which had been several Times
               interrupted by a Parenthesis of Sighs and Groans; and Beauplaisir, with a complaisant
               and tender Air, assur'd her of his Readiness to serve her in Things of much greater
               Consequence than what she desir'd of him; and told her, <said>it would be an
                  Impossibility of denying a Place in his Chariot to a Lady, who he could not behold
                  without yielding one in his Heart</said>. She answered the Compliments he made her
               but with Tears, which seem'd to stream in such abundance from her Eyes, that she
               could not keep her Handkerchief from her Face one Moment. Being come into the
               Chariot, Beauplaisir said a thousand handsome Things to perswade her from giving way
               to so violent a Grief, which, he told her, would not only be distructive to her
               Beauty, but likewise her Health. But all his Endeavours for Consolement appear'd
               ineffectual, and he began to think he should have but a dull Journey, in the Company
               of one who seem'd so obstinately devoted to the Memory of her dead Husband, that
               there was no getting a Word from her on any other Theme: â But bethinking himself of

               </note>, it came into his Head to make Tryal, she who seem'd equally susceptible of
               Sorrow, might not also be so too of Love; and having begun a Discourse on almost
               every other Topick, and finding her still incapable of answering, resolv'd to put it
               to the Proof, if this would have no more Effect to rouze her sleeping Spirits: â With
               a gay Air, therefore, though accompany'd with <pb n="273" facs="images/HF-273.jpg"/>
               the greatest Modesty and Respect, he turned the Conversation, as though without
               Design, on that Joy-giving Passion, and soon discover'd that was indeed the Subject
               she was best pleas'd to be entertained with; for on his giving her a Hint to begin
               upon, never any Tongue run more voluble than hers, on the prodigious Power it had to
               influence the Souls of those posses'd of it, to Actions even the most distant from
               their Intentions, Principles, or Humours. â From that she pass'd to a Description of
               the Happiness of mutual Affection; â the unspeakable Extasy of those who meet with
               equal Ardency; and represented it in Colours so lively, and disclos'd by the Gestures
               with which her Words were accompany'd, and the Accent of her Voice so true a Feeling
               of what she said, that Beauplaisir, without being as stupid, as he was really the
               contrary, could not avoid perceiving there were Seeds of Fire, not yet extinguish'd,
               in this fair Widow's Soul, which wanted but the kindling Breath of tender Sighs to
               light into a Blaze. â He now thought himself as fortunate, as some Moments before he
               had the Reverse; and doubted not, but, that before they parted, he should find a Way
               to dry the Tears of this lovely Mourner, to the Satisfaction of them both. He did
               not, however, offer, as he had done to Fantomina and Celia, to urge his Passion
               directly to her, but by a thousand little softning Artifices, which he well knew how
               to use, gave her leave to guess he was enamour'd. When they came to the Inn where
               they were to lie, he declar'd himself somewhat more freely, and perceiving she did
               not resent it past Forgiveness, grew more encroaching still: â He now took the
               Liberty of kissing away her Tears, and catching the Sighs as they issued from her
               Lips; telling her if Grief was infectious, he was resolv'd to have his Share;
               protesting he would gladly exchange Passions with her, and be content to bear her
               Load of Sorrow, if she would as willingly ease the Burden of his Love. â She said
               little in answer to the strenuous Pressures with which at last he <pb n="274"
                  facs="images/HF-274.jpg"/> ventur'd to enfold her, but not thinking it Decent, for
               the Character she had assum'd, to yield so suddenly, and unable to deny both his and
               her own Inclinations, she counterfeited a fainting, and fell motionless upon his
               Breast. â He had no great Notion that she was in a real Fit, and the Room they supp'd
               in happening to have a Bed in it, he took her in his Arms and laid her on it,
               believing, that whatever her Distemper was, that was the most proper Place to convey
               her to. â He laid himself down by her, and endeavour'd to bring her to herself; and
               she was too grateful to her kind Physician at her returning Sense, to remove from the

               swear it is an Impossibility, and that no Disguise could hinder them from knowing a
               Woman they had once enjoy'd. In answer to these Scruples, I can only say, that
               besides the Alteration which the Change of Dress made in her, she was so admirably
               skill'd in the Art of feigning, that she had the Power of putting on almost what Face
               she pleas'd, and knew so exactly how to form her Behaviour to the Character she
               represented, that all the Comedians at both Playhouses are infinitely short of her
               Performances: She could vary her very Glances, tune her Voice to Accents the most
               different imaginable from those in which she spoke when she appear'd herself. â These
               Aids from Nature, join'd to the Wiles of Art, and the Distance between the Places
               where the imagin'd Fantomina and Celia were, might very well prevent his having any
               Thought that they were the same, or that the fair Widow was either of them: It never
               so much as enter'd his Head, and though he did fancy he observed in the Face of the
               latter, Features which were not altogether unknown to him, yet he could not recollect
               when or where he had known them; â and being told by her, that from her Birth, she
               had <pb n="275" facs="images/HF-275.jpg"/> never remov'd from Bristol, a Place where
               he never was, he rejected the Belief of having seen her, and suppos'd his Mind had
               been deluded by an Idea of some other, whom she might have a Resemblance of.</p>

            <p> THEY pass'd the Time of their Journey in as much Happiness as the most luxurious
               Gratification of wild Desires could make them; and when they came to the End of it,
               parted not without a mutual Promise of seeing each other often. â He told her to what
               Place she should direct a Letter to him; and she assur'd him she would send to let
               him know where to come to her, as soon as she was fixed in Lodgings.</p>

            <p> SHE kept her Promise; and charm'd with the Continuance of his eager Fondness, went
               not home, but into private Lodgings, whence she wrote to him to visit her the first

                  silly, fond, believing Sex are serv'd when they put Faith in Man: So had I been
                  deceiv'd and cheated, had I like the rest believ'd, and sat down mourning in
                  Absence, and vainly waiting recover'd Tendernesses. â How do some Women,
                  (continued she) make their Life a Hell, burning in fruitless Expectations, and
                  dreaming out their Days in Hopes and Fears, then wake at last to all the Horror of
                  Dispair? â But I have outwitted even the most Subtle of the deceiving Kind, and
                  while he thinks to fool me, is himself the only beguiled Person.</said></p>

            <p> SHE made herself, most certainly, extremely happy in the Reflection on the Success
               of her Stratagems; and while the Knowledge of his Inconstancy and Levity of Nature
               kept her from having that real Tenderness for him she would else have had, she found
               the Means of gratifying the Inclination she had for his agreeable Person, in as full
               a Manner as she could wish. She had all the Sweets of Love, but as yet had tasted
               none of the Gall<ref target="a048" corresp="n048"/><note xml:id="n048" target="a048"

               might be envy'd by the more Delicate.</p>

            <p> WHEN the expected Hour arriv'd, she found that her Lover had lost no part of the
               Fervency with which he had parted from her; but when the next Day she receiv'd him as
               Fantomina, she perceiv'd a prodigious Difference; which led her again into
               Reflections on the Unaccountableness of Men's Fancies, who still prefer the last
               Conquest, only because it is the last. â Here was an evident Proof of it; for there
               could not be a Difference in Merit, because they were the same Person; but the Widow
               Bloomer was a more new Acquaintance than Fantomina, and therefore esteem'd more
               valuable. This, indeed, must be said of Beauplaisir, that he had a <pb n="278"
                  facs="images/HF-278.jpg"/> greater Share of good Nature than most of his Sex, who,
               for the most part, when they are weary of an Intreague, break it entirely off,
               without any Regard to the Despair of the abandon'd Nymph<ref target="a049"

                  "nymph" is a mythological nature spirit, usually depicted as a young woman
                  disporting, semi-nude, in woodlands or near water. The word is often used
                  allegorically or metaphorically to refer to elegant, flirtatious young women. The

               rather a Penance than a Pleasure.</p>

            <p> THE Widow Bloomer triumph'd some Time longer over the Heart of this Inconstant, but
               at length her Sway was at an End, and she sunk in this Character, to the same Degree
               of Tastelessness, as she had done before in that of Fantomina and Celia. â She
               presently perceiv'd it, but bore it as she had always done; it being but what she
               expected, she had prepar'd herself for it, and had another Project in embrio<ref

               which she soon ripen'd into Action. She did not, indeed, compleat it altogether so
               suddenly as she had done the others, by reason there must be Persons employ'd in it;
               and the Aversion she had to any Confidents in her Affairs, and the Caution with which
               she had hitherto acted, and which she was still determin'd to continue, made it very
               difficult for her to find a Way without breaking thro' that Resolution to compass
               what she wish'd. â She got over the Difficulty at last, however, by proceeding in a
               Manner, if possible, more extraordinary than all her former Behaviour: â Muffling
               herself up in her Hood one Day, she went into the Park<ref target="a051"

                  visiting the park to acquire the services of some young men down on their luck and
                  willing to be hired for a variety of services. Edmund Waller, whom Haywood quotes

                  unrewarded, and that those of the best Pretentions meet with the least
                  Encouragement: â I ask your Pardon, (continued she,) perceiving they seem'd
                  surpris'd, if I am mistaken in the Notion, that you two may, perhaps, be of the
                  Number of those who have Reason to complain of the Injustice of Fate; but if you
                  are such as I take you for, have a Proposal to make you, which may be of some

                  such a Manner as you cannot be known, if hereafter seen by the Person on whom you
                  are to impose. â In fine, the Business is only an innocent Frolick, but if blaz'd
                  abroad, might be taken for too great a Freedom in me: â Therefore, if you resolve
                  to assist me, here are five Pieces to Drink my Health, and assure you, that I have
                  not discours'd you on an Affair, I design not to proceed in; and when it is

               Beginning of their Employment: But things were not yet ripe for Execution; and she
               told them, that the next Day they should be let into the Secret, charging them to
               meet her in the same Place at an hour she appointed. 'Tis hard to say, which of these
               Parties went away best pleas'd; they, that Fortune had sent them so unexpected a
               Windfall; or she, that she had found Persons, who appeared so well qualified to serve

                  <p> I imagine not that 'tis a new Thing to you, to be told, you are the greatest
                     Charm in Nature to our Sex: I shall therefore, not to fill up my Letter with
                     any impertinent Praises on your Wit or Person, only tell you, that I am
                     infinite in Love with both, and if you have a Heart not too deeply engag'd,
                     should think myself the happiest of my Sex in being capable of inspiring it
                     with some Tenderness. â There is but one Thing in my Power to refuse you, which
                     is the Knowledge of my Name, which believing the Sight of my Face will render
                     no Secret, you must not take it ill that I conceal from you. â The Bearer of
                     this is a Person I can trust; send by him your Answer; but endeavour not to
                     dive into the Meaning of this Mystery, which will be impossible for you to
                     unravel, and at the same Time very much disoblige me: â But that you may be in
                     no Apprehensions of being impos'd on by a Woman unworthy of your Regard, I will
                     venture to assure you, the first and greatest Men in the Kingdom, would think
                     themselves blest to have that Influence over me you have, though unknown to
                     yourself acquir'd. â But I need not go about to raise your Curiosity, by giving
                     you any Idea of what my Person is; if you think fit to be satisfied, resolve to
                     visit me To-morrow about Three in the Afternoon; and though my Face is hid, you
                     shall not want sufficient Demonstration, that she who takes these unusual
                     Measures to commence a Friendship with you, is neither Old, nor Deform'd. Till

               Encounter, resolv'd to rest satisfy'd till he was inform'd of every Thing from
               herself, not imagining this Incognita varied so much from the Generality of her Sex,

               Transcendency of Passion she profess'd, and which his many Successes with the Ladies
               gave him Encouragement enough to believe. He therefore took Pen and Paper, and

            <p> NOTHING could be more pleas'd than she, to whom it was directed, at the Receipt of
               this Letter; but when she was told how inquisitive he had been concerning her
               Character and Circumstances, she could not forbear laughing heartily to think of the
               Tricks she had play'd him, and applauding her own Strength of Genius, and Force of
               Resolution, which by such unthought-of Ways could triumph over her Lover's
               Inconstancy, and render that very Temper, which to other Women is the greatest Curse,
               a Means to make herself more bless'd. â <said>Had he been faithful to me, (said she,
                  to herself,) either as Fantomina, or Celia, or the Widow Bloomer, the most violent
                  Passion, if it does not change its Object, in Time will wither: Possession
                  naturally abates the Vigour of Desire, and I should have had, at best, but a cold,
                  insipid, husband-like Lover in my Arms; but by these Arts of passing on him as a
                  new Mistress whenever the Ardour, which alone makes Love a Blessing, begins to
                  diminish, for the former one, I have him always raving, wild, impatient, longing,
                  dying. â O that all neglected Wives, and fond abandon'd Nymphs would take this
                  Method! â Men would be caught in their own Snare, and have no Cause to scorn our
                  easy, weeping, wailing Sex!</said> Thus did she pride herself as if secure she

               greatest Care and Exactness. Her fine Shape, and Air, and Neck, appear'd to great
               Advantage; and by that which was to be seen of her, one might believe the rest to be
               perfectly agreeable. Beauplaisir was prodigiously charm'd, as well with her
               Appearance, as with the Manner she entertain'd him: But though he was wild with
               Impatience for the Sight of a Face which belong'd to so exquisite a Body, yet he
               would not immediately press for it, believing before he left her he should easily
               obtain that Satisfaction. â A noble Collation being over, he began to sue for the
               Performance of her Promise of granting every Thing he could ask, excepting the Sight
               of her Face, and Knowledge of her Name. It would have been a ridiculous Piece of
               Affection in her to have seem'd coy in complying with what she herself had been the
               first in desiring: She yielded without even a Shew of Reluctance: And if there be any
               true Felicity in an Armour such as theirs, both here enjoy'd it to the full. But not
               in the Height of all their mutual Raptures, could he prevail on her to satisfy his
               Curiosity with the Sight of her Face: She told him that she hop'd he knew so much of
               her, as might serve to convince him, she was not unworthy of his tenderest Regard;
               and if he cou'd not content himself with that which she was willing to reveal, and
               which was the Conditions of their meeting, dear as he was to her, she would rather
               part with him for ever, than consent to gratify an Inquisitiveness, which, in her
               Opinion, had no Business with his Love. It was in vain that he endeavour'd to make
               her sensible of her Mistake; and that this Restraint was the greatest Enemy
               imaginable to the Happiness of them both: She was not to be perswaded, and he was
               oblig'd to desist his Solicitations, though determin'd in his Mind to compass what he
               so ardently desir'd, before he left the House. He then turned the Discourse wholly on
               the Violence of <pb n="285" facs="images/HF-285.jpg"/> the Passion he had for her;
               and express'd the greatest Discontent in the World at the Apprehensions of being
               separated; â swore he could dwell for ever in her Arms, and with such an undeniable
               Earnestness pressed to be permitted to tarry with her the whole Night, that had she
               been less charm'd with his renew'd Eagerness of Desire, she scarce would have had the
               Power of refusing him; but in granting this Request, she was not without a Thought
               that he had another Reason for making it besides the Extremity of his Passion, and
               had it immediately in her Head how to disappoint him.</p>

            <p> THE Hours of Repose being arriv'd, he begg'd she would retire to her Chamber; to
               which she consented, but oblig'd him to go to Bed first; which he did not much
               oppose, because he suppos'd she would not lie in her Mask, and doubted not but the
               Morning's Dawn would bring the wish'd Discovery. â The two imagin'd Servants usher'd
               him to his new Lodging; where he lay some Moments in all the Perplexity imaginable at
               the Oddness of this Adventure. But she suffer'd not these Cogitations to be of any
               long Continuance: She came, but came in the Dark; which being no more than he
               expected by the former Part of her Proceedings, he said nothing of; but as much
               Satisfaction as he found in her Embraces, nothing ever long'd for the Approach of Day
               with more Impatience than he did. At last it came; but how great was his
               Disappointment, when by the Noises he heard in the Street, the hurry of the Coaches,

               least Chink was left to let in the Day. â He complain'd of her Behaviour in Terms
               that she would not have been able to resist yielding to, if she had not been certain
               it would have been the Ruin of her Passion: â She, therefore, answered him only as
               she had done before; and getting out of the Bed from him, <pb n="286"
                  facs="images/HF-286.jpg"/> flew out of the Room with too much Swiftness for him to
               have overtaken her, if he had attempted it. The Moment she left him, the two
               Attendants enter'd the Chamber, and plucking down the Implements which had skreen'd
               him from the Knowledge of that which he so much desir'd to find out, restored his
               Eyes once more to Day: â They attended to assist him in Dressing, brought him Tea,
               and by their Obsequiousness, let him see there was but one Thing which the Mistress
               of them would not gladly oblige him in. â He was so much out of Humour, however, at
               the Disappointment of his Curiosity, that he resolv'd never to make a second Visit. â
               Finding her in an outer Room, he made no Scruples of expressing the Sense he had of
               the little Trust she reposed in him, and at last plainly told her, he could not
               submit to receive Obligations from a Lady, who thought him uncapable of keeping a
               Secret, which she made no Difficulty of letting her Servants into. â He resented, â
               he once more entreated, â he said all that Man could do, to prevail on her to unfold
               the Mystery; but all his Adjurations were fruitless; and he went out of the House
               determin'd never to re-enter it, till she should pay the Price of his Company with
               the Discovery of her Face and Circumstances. â She suffer'd him to go with this
               Resolution, and doubted not but he would recede from it, when he reflected on the
               happy Moments they had pass'd together; but if he did not, she comforted herself with
               the Design of forming some other Stratagem, with which to impose on him a fourth
               Time.</p>

            <p> SHE kept the House, and her Gentlemen-Equipage for about a Fortnight, in which Time
               she continu'd to write to him as Fantomina and the Widow Bloomer, and received the
               Visits he sometimes made to each; but his Behaviour to both was grown so cold, that
               she began to grow as weary of receiving his now insipid Caresses as he was of
               offering them: She was beginning to think in what Manner she <pb n="287"
                  facs="images/HF-287.jpg"/> should drop these two Characters, when the sudden
               Arrival of her Mother, who had been some Time in a foreign Country, oblig'd her to
               put an immediate Stop to the Course of her whimsical Adventures. â That Lady, who was
               severely virtuous, did not approve of many Things she had been told of the Conduct of
               her Daughter; and though it was not in the Power of any Person in the World to inform
               her of the Truth of what she had been guilty of, yet she heard enough to make her
               keep her afterwards in a Restraint, little agreeable to her Humour, and the Liberties
               to which she had been accustomed.</p>

            <p> BUT this Confinement was not the greatest Part of the Trouble of this now afflicted
               Lady: She found the Consequences of her amorous Follies would be, without almost a
               Miracle, impossible to be concealed: â She was with Child; and though she would
               easily have found Means to have skreen'd even this from the Knowledge of the World,
               had she been at liberty to have acted with the same unquestionable Authority over
               herself, as she did before the coming of her Mother, yet now all her Invention was at
               a Loss for a Stratagem to impose on a Woman of her Penetration: â By eating little,

                  in diameter, and with the addition of panniers, court dress like

                     shows--could be notably voluminous.</note>, however, her Bigness was not
               taken notice of, and, perhaps, she would not have been suspected till the Time of her
               going into the Country, where her Mother design'd to send her, and from whence she
               intended to make her escape to some Place where she might be delivered with Secrecy,
               if the Time of it had not happen'd much Sooner than she expected. â A Ball being at
               Court, the good Old Lady was willing she should partake of the Diversion of it as a
               Farewel to the Town. â It was there she was seiz'd with those Pangs, which none in
               her Condition are exempt from: â She could not conceal the sudden Rack which all at
               once invaded her; or had her Tongue been mute, her wildly rolling Eyes, the
               Distortion of her Features, and the Convulsions <pb n="288" facs="images/HF-288.jpg"
               />which shook her whole Frame, in spite of her, would have reveal'd she labour'd
               under some terrible Shock of Nature. â Every Body was surpris'd, every Body was
               concern'd, but few guessed at the Occasion. â Her Mother griev'd beyond Expression,
               doubted not but she was struct with the Hand of Death; and order'd her to be carried
               Home in a Chair, while herself follow'd in another. â A Physician was immediately
               sent for: But he was presently perceiving what was her Distemper, call'd the old Lady
               aside, and told her, it was not a Doctor of his Sex, but one of her own<ref

                  resp="TH">Until the mid to late eighteenth century, childbirth was an almost
                  exclusively female domain. Midwives were women who had experience in both giving
                  birth and attending at other births. During the eighteenth century, midwifery was
                  becoming professionalized and as a result masculinized into obsetetric science.
                  For more information on the shift in the science of childbirth from a feminine
                  tradition to a masculine profession, see <ref

                  Midwifery"</ref>.</note>, her Daughter stood in need of. â Never was Astonishment
               and Horror greater than that which seiz'd the Soul of this afflicted Parent at these
               Words: She could not for a Time believe the Truth of what she heard; but he insisting
               on it, and conjuring her to send for a Midwife, she was at length convinc'd if it. â
               All the Pity and Tenderness she had been for some Moment before possess'd of, now
               vanish'd, and were succeeded by an adequate Shame and Indignation: â She flew to the
               Bed where her Daughter was lying, and telling her what she had been inform'd of, and
               which she was now far from doubting, commanded her to reveal the Name of the Person
               whose Insinuations had drawn her to this Dishonour. â It was a great while before she
               could be brought to confess any Thing, and much longer before she could be prevailed
               on to name the Man whom she so fatally had lov'd; but the Rack of Nature growing more
               fierce, and the enraged old Lady protesting no Help should be afforded her while she
               persisted in her Obstinacy, she, with great Difficulty and Hesitation in her Speech,
               at last pronounc'd the Name of Beauplaisir. She had no sooner satisfy'd her weeping
               Mother, than that sorrowful Lady sent Messengers at the same Time, for a Midwife, and
               for that Gentleman who had occasion'd the other's being wanted. â He happen'd by
               Accident to be at home, and immediately obey'd the Summons, though prodigiously <pb
                  n="289" facs="images/HF-289.jpg"/> surpris'd what Business a Lady so much a
               Stranger to him could have to impart. â But how much greater was his Amazement, when
               taking him into her Closet, she there acquainted him with her Daughter's Misfortune,
               of the Discovery she had made, and how far he was concern'd in it? â All the Idea one
               can form of wild Astonishment, was mean to what he felt: â He assur'd her, that the
               young Lady her Daughter was a Person who he had never, more than at a Distance,
               admir'd: â That he had indeed, spoke to her in publick Company, but that he never had
               a Thought which tended to her Dishonour. â His Denials, if possible, added to the
               Indignation she was before enflam'd with: â She had no longer Patience; and carrying
               him into the Chamber, where she was just deliver'd of a fine Girl, cry'd out, <said>I
                  will not be impos'd on: The Truth by one of you shall be reveal'd.</said>
               âBeauplaisir being brought to the Bed side, was beginning to address himself to the
               Lady in it, to beg she would clear the Mistake her Mother was involv'd in; when she,
               covering herself with the Cloaths, and ready to die a second Time with the inward
               Agitations of her Soul, shriek'd out, O<said>h, I am undone! â I cannot live, and
                  bear this Shame</said>! â But the old Lady believing that now or never was the
               Time to dive into the Bottom of this Mystery, forcing her to rear her Head, told her,
               she should not hope to Escape the Scrutiny of a Parent she had dishonour'd in such a
               Manner, and pointing to Beauplaisir, <said>Is this the Gentleman, (said she,) to whom
                  you owe your Ruin? or have you deceiv'd me by a fictitious Tale?</said>
               <said>Oh! no, (resum'd the trembling Creature,) he is, indeed, the innocent Cause of
                  my Undoing: â Promise me your Pardon, (continued she,) and I will relate the
                  Means.</said> Here she ceas'd, expecting what she would reply, which, on hearing
               Beauplaisir cry <pb n="290" facs="images/HF-290.jpg"/> out, <said>What mean you
                  Madam? I your Undoing, who never harbour'd the least Design on you in my
                  Life,</said> she did in these Words, <said>Though the Injury you have done your
                  Family, (said she,) is of a Nature which cannot justly hope Forgiveness, yet be
                  assur'd, I shall much sooner excuse you when satisfied of the Truth, than while I
                  am kept in a Suspence, if possible, as vexatious as the Crime itself is to
                  me.</said> Encouraged by this she related the whole Truth. And 'tis difficult to
               determine, if Beauplaisir, or the Lady, were most surpris'd at what they heard; he,
               that he should have been blinded so often by her Artifices; or she, that so young a
               Creature should have the Skill to make use of them. Both sat for some Time in a
               profound Revery; till at length she broke it first in these Words: <said>Pardon, Sir,
                  (said she,) the Trouble I have given you: I must confess it was with a Design to
                  oblige you to repair the supposed Injury you had done this unfortunate Girl, by
                  marrying her, but now I know not what to say; â The Blame is wholly her's, and I
                  have nothing to request further of you, than that you will not divulge the
                  distracted Folly she has been guilty of.</said> â He answered her in Terms
               perfectly polite; but made no Offer of that which, perhaps, she expected, though
               could not, now inform'd of her Daughter's Proceedings, demand. He assured her,
               however, that if she would commit the new-born Lady to his Care, he would discharge
               it faithfully. But neither of them would consent to that; and he took his Leave, full
               of Cogitations, more confus'd than ever he had known in his whole Life. He continued
               to visit there, to enquire after her Health every Day; but the old Lady perceiving
               there was nothing likely to ensue from these Civilities, but, perhaps, a Renewing of
               the Crime, she entreated him to refrain; and as soon as <pb n="291"
                  facs="images/HF-291.jpg"/> her Daughter was in a Condition, sent her to a
               Monastery in France, the Abbess of which had been her particular Friend<ref

                  resp="TH">The role of the French convent in English literary and cultural
                  imagination is complex. Elite young women might be educated in a convent before
                  their marriage; the convent might also be a house of reformation; for some women,
                  the convent offered an intellectual alternative alternative to marriage in the
                  company of other women. In the English protestant imagination, the French convent
                  was often seen as an erotically-charged place. <ref
                     target="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/413815/summary">As Ana Acosta writes in
                     "Hotbeds of Popery: Convents in the English Literary Imagination,"</ref> the
                  convent "provided a site for amorous encounters, forced and broken vows,
                  sacrificed youth, and unrequited love" (619). Yet, the convent is also a
                  specifically female community, where women lived, worked, studied, and conversed
                  with other women outside of the male gaze. For futher information, see Elizabeth
