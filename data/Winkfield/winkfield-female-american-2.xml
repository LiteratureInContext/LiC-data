						This engraving by Netherlandish artist Theodoor Galle imitates

						Vespucci. In this allegorical image, Vespucci is shown 'awakening' 
						a woman who personifies America. The caption, 'Americen Americus 
						retexit, semel vocauit inde semper excitam,' roughly translates to 
						'Americus rediscovers America, once awakened, always aroused,' 
						further underscoring the sexualized and racialized ideology of 
						conquest. Like many depictions from this period, it visualizes 
						the so-called discovery of the Americas as an act of European male 
						dominance over feminized, exoticized, and passive land and peoples.

					<hi rend="dropcap">I</hi> HAD matter enough to employ my thoughts

					upon my hands: I now set about preparing a better convenience for my 
					rest by night, and busied myself the remainder of the day, as soon as 
					I perceived the people were gone off the island, with gathering leaves 
					and other things to make my bed, which at last I made pretty tolerable. 
					The next day I removed all the things I had concealed into the subterraneous 
					apartments, bestowing some in one and some in another. I found it necessary 
					also to provide myself with more fat, that I might now want light, and 
					indeed with some meat; for these purposes I was obliged to kill a couple 
					of goats, a task always very disagreeable to me. As my habitation was very 
					gloomy and melancholy, I spent what leisure time I had, in walking up and

						The absurd nature of the fictious animal described in this passage implies

						It was of the size of a large
					<pb n="4" facs="pageImages/004.png"/>
					dog, as to its body, but its legs, which were very long, were by no means 
					proportioned to the bulk of this strange animal, being so slender as to bend 
					under him, insomuch that it could move only with the utmost slowness. I wondered 
					within myself how this creature could either defend, or provide for itself; but 
					observing it more closely, I took notice that its eyes were uncommonly large, for 
					an animal of that size, projecting far from the head, and so frightful as to 
					excite fear in me; and I should have fled from it, only that I perceived it 
					could not overtake me, had I walked ever so slow. The mouth of it was no less 
					dreadful; it kept the lips of it almost constantly drawn

				<pb n="5" facs="pageImages/005.png"/>
				<p>It was at this time labouring to get into a kind of pasture. 
					I determined to watch its motions, thinking it might be seeking 
					its prey; for I did not doubt but that the goodness and wisdom of  
					<ref target="providence_" corresp="providence">providence</ref>
					<note xml:id="providence" target="rowled_" type="gloss" 
					resp="editors.xml#UOStudStaff">God's divine plan</note>, 
					which had thus wonderfully provided for its security, had 
					doubtless taken no less care for its support. It was a long time in 
					getting to the place it seemed designed to reach. As it walked or 
					rather limped along, several animals passed it, many much bigger than 
					itself, who no sooner saw it than they ran from it, as if afraid of 
					being destroyed by it. I took notice that as any of these approached him, 
					he <ref target="rowled_" corresp="rowled">rowled</ref>
					<note xml:id="rowled" target="rowled_" type="gloss" 
					resp="editors.xml#UOStudStaff">rolled</note> his eyes,

					</p>
				<pb n="6" facs="pageImages/006.png"/>
				<p>At length he got into the grass, and then laid himself down, 
					extended as if dead. I came up to him behind, for his looks were 
					too terrifying to face him, and sitting down at some distance, was 
					resolved to watch, that I might discover whether he chose this place 
					merely for rest, or with some other view. He soon changed his posture 
					a little, so that I could perceive that his eyes were shut, and his lips 
					closed; I therefore concluded that he was going to sleep; however, I 
					still continued in my place. The hair on his body was very thick and 
					long, perhaps five or six inches; the extremities of every cluster of 
					them formed a kind of bunch, or small tuft, as large as an hasel-nut. 
					Having sat about a quarter of an hour, I saw a great number of field-mice
				<pb n="7" facs="pageImages/007.png"/>
					come up to him, who presently began to nibble at these tufts, 
					the animal continuing to lie still; but after a very considerable 
					number of mice had thus employed themselves, he got up, and shook 
					himself violently; when, to my great astonishment, I found these mice, 
					some way or other so fastened and secured to these tufts, that very 
					few of them could disengage themselves. And now, his neck being very 
					long, he turned his head, and devoured them very greedily, one after 
					another. I dare say that in a few minutes, he ate near three hundred 
					of them; for his body was almost covered with them.
					</p>
				<p>My curiosity was amply gratified, if an human being may say so, of
					<pb n="8" facs="pageImages/008.png"/>
					the sudden destruction of such a number of innocent animals; but the 
					divine being has been pleased to permit animals to support themselves 
					by devouring one another. I say permit; for I cannot think that it was 
					the original design of the Almighty, that animals should at all 
					destroy one another. I suppose it rather to be one of the unhappy 
					consequences of the general corruption of nature. I know it may be 
					replied, that some animals seem by their make to be designed to subsist 
					on animal food only, and are accordingly provided with teeth and claws, 
					unadapted for feeding on<ref target="herbage_" corresp="herbage">herbage</ref>
					<note xml:id="herbage" target="herbage_" type="gloss"

					and with stomachs evidently made for digesting animal substances; 
					whilst those parts in animals who eat no animal food, are
					<pb n="9" facs="pageImages/009.png"/>
					quite differently formed. I know and grant this; but yet my opinion 
					is not by this concession destroyed. For it is highly reasonable to 
					suppose, that these kind of creatures were so formed to prey upon dead 
					animals, that by their feeding upon them, they might remove what would 
					otherwise be an hurtful nuisance, in more senses than one. However, 
					it is not my intention, here, to display the naturalist; otherwise I think,

						The phrase "though a woman" serves as a brief but significant 
						acknowledgment of gendered restrictions on knowledge in eighteenth-century 
						England. Although Unca Eliza is  depicted as a strong and smart 
						individual who challenges traditional gender roles, she establishes 
						her credibility by referencing foundational male philosophers, 
						indicating her awareness of cultural expectations regarding women's 
						intellectual ability. Scholar Jill Conway asserts that "European 
						women intellectuals were either declasse, or else they lived a 
						contemplative life in a religious community." Unca Eliza's isolation 
						on the  island literalizes the social exile faced by intellectual 
						women at the time. See Conway, "Perspectives on the History of Women's 
						Education in the United States."

						This moment reflects the complex changing attitudes
						towards the capabilities of women during the Enlightenment. Unca Eliza both
						establishes her womanhood as something inferior to male intellectuals
						and simultaneously places herself above classical scholars. While women
						at the time were becoming increasingly established in intellectual fields
						they were still seen as inferior to men. In

						<hi rend="italic">Women and Enlightenment in Eighteenth Century Britain</hi>
						</ref>(Cambridge University Press, 2009), Karen O'Brien writes that, while the
						progress of women in eighteenth-century Britain cannot be likened to feminism
						as we know it, the Enlightenment "created a framework and a language for
						understanding the gendered structures of society without which nineteenth-century
						feminism would not have been possible" (2).

					I stopt at every convenient pause, two or three minutes, that I might not weary 
					their attention, and give them opportunity to reflect, as it were step by step, 
					upon what I said.				
					</p>
				<p>As I was well acquainted with the manners of the Indians, I adapted my discourse
					to their own way of reason ing, and avoided all such terms, and modes of speech,
					as are intelligible only to Europeans. When I had discoursed near three hours in
					this manner, I desisted, desiring them to take some
					<pb n="21" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_022.png"/>
					<!--note: page breaks after 're-'-->
					refreshment, with which I saw they had provided themselves, and that afterwards
					I would call to them; and then the priests, or any of the people, might ask what
					questions they should please concerning what I had delivered. I ordered them to
					retire to some distance from where they were. This I did, that I might not be
					heard, as I intended to withdraw for a little time out of the statue, to take
					some refreshment myself.				
					</p>
				<p>As soon as I had taken my place as before, I called to my audience, who
					respectfully returned to their former station. I repeated the leave I had given
					to them, to ask any questions relative to my discourse. All the priests, in
					their turns, asked me
					<pb n="22" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_023.png"/>
					<!--note="page breaks after 'se-'"-->
					several pertinent and sensible questions; to which I replied as well as I was able 
					and I believe to their satisfaction. But observing that the laity still kept silence,
					I endeavoured to encourage them to propose their questions also, and was
					answered, by some, "We know nothing; our priests know all; teach our priests, and
					they will teach us." From this I concluded, that the priests had dealt in private
					with them, and had forbid their asking any questions, that they might preserve
					their superiority among them.				
					</p>
				<p>I therefore addressed myself to them with some sharpness, reminding them of what
					I had told them before, "that I would not teach them only;
					<pb n="23" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_024.png"/>
					but that I would teach the people also."
					</p>
				<p>Upon this the priests submissively bowed, and declared their readiness to obey my
					commands. I then proceeded, as well as I could, further to explain what I had
					delivered in the fore part of the day; and concluded with telling them, I should
					be ready to continue my instructions to them, for that I had much more to say,
					once a week, provided the priests would attend that day week, and so on, with as
					many of the people as should choose to come; but as the high-priest was very
					aged and infirm, he might come, or not, as he pleased. To this the
					<pb n="24" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_025.png"/>
					high-priest said he would conform. I then told them they might return home as
					soon as they pleased; and it was not long before they all quitted the island.

					This was as difficult to answer, as how to go on. As I knew something of
					the manner of the Indians,I did not doubt of their docibility; but I was very
					suspicious of the priests. I foresaw they would never easily suffer themselves
					to become useless to the people, and nothing less could be the consequence of my
					instructing them. And supposing this to be got over, how was I to proceed to
					continue teaching them from the statue, if I hoped to make any tolerable
					progress, as it would render their attendance more frequent than might be
					convenient to them? and in the wet season they could not come at all; and
					further, how could I, with any possible degree of comfort, continue to live
					under ground even in the summer? and in the winter I
					<pb n="27" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_028.png"/>

					going to live among the	Indians, whatever my success in teaching, or reception,
					might prove. I determined to trust in providence for a discharge of the first;
					and no less to rely on its protection, as to my personal security. Though I had
					thus determined the part I was to take, there yet remained a great difficulty,
					how to introduce myself among them. They might at present conceive of me as 
					more than mortal, reverence me, and pay an implicit faith to all my teachings;but
					how would their opinion of my change, when they should discover me to be a mere
					mortal, a destitute stranger, even needing their support! What

					this I put on, formed
					of the same materials, and in the same manner, a gown, sprinkled all over with

					colours; one on the top particularly large, which emitted from all parts of it a
					light greater than that of either of my lamps. In my right hand I held a golden
					staff, or rod, with a small image of the sun on the top of it. On one of my
					fingers I wore the ring, and on each arm a rich bracelet, all which I found at
					the same time I discovered all these other things.				
					</p>
				<p>I had made myself a kind of wicker basket, which I filled with a great

				<p>When I left my subterraneous dwelling, I not only bolted the door, but covered it
					over with earth. Being come to the statue I sat down on the highest step, in all

				<pb n="42" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_043.png"/>

					at some distance lay my bundle, which, being wrapt up in one of the gold 
					vestments, glittered as the sun shone very bright.				
					</p>
				<p>Thus I sat, with my bow and arrows hung over my shoulders, waiting for the
					important interview, my mind not a little agitated between hope and fear.
					However, I very solemnly recommended myself and my 
					<ref target="undertaking_" corresp="undertaking">undertaking</ref>
					<note xml:id="undertaking" target="undertaking_" type="gloss" 
					resp="editors.xml#UOStudStaff">a pledge or promise</note> to God; and then

					I might not discover the least symptom of fear; for I knew on this much
					depended.				
					</p>
				<pb n="43" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_044.png"/>
				<p>I had sat near an hour before they approached; but at last saw them advance in
					the same order as at their first coming. At the first sight of them my heart
					leapt, and every limb trembled, and for a moment I wished myself within my
					subterraneous habitation. But as they advanced slowly, I had time enough to
					recover myself, and, before they came near enough to distinguish my

					</p>
				<p>As they came near, led by the highpriest and the others, they bowed almost to the
					ground at every step; I still kept my seat looking firmly at them. When they
					were come near enough to hold a conversation, they halted, and the priests and
					all the company, who were about

					</p>
				<p>They did so; when, observing that they held a profound silence, I thus addressed
					them, with as much	<ref target="affability_" corresp="affability">affability</ref>
					<note xml:id="affability" target="affability_" type="gloss"

					</p>
				<p>"I suppose you are come to invite me to reside in your country?"
				</p>
				<p>To this the high-priest answered, "Yes;" which was presently ecchoed throughout the
					whole multitude.				
					</p>
				<pb n="45" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_046.png"/>
				<p>I then desired the high-priest to sit down at my right hand, which he did, not
					without some mannerly reluctance; I then placed the other priests on the steps a
					little lower on the right and left hand.				
					</p>
				<p>sitting with the priests in this manner, I again addressed them:
					</p>
				<p>"I suppose most of you were here three days ago, and heard, or know, 
					what was then delivered from above,"				
					</p>
				<p>pointing up to the statue. "In consequence of what was then promised you, and to
					which you who were then present agreed, I am come to live among you, at least
					for some time, and to instruct you; observe what was then enjoined you."				
					</p>
				<pb n="46" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_047.png"/>
				<p>"You must obey my commands, observe my instructions, never ask who I am, from
					whence I come, or whether, or when, I will leave you."				
					</p>
				<p>"Though if at any time you should desire me to quit your country, you may tell me
					so, and I will leave you. And further, you are never to oppose my coming here,
					as I shall do from time to time, nor any of you presume to follow me

					and in the ways of his religion; which will make you happy for ever."				
					</p>
				<pb n="47" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_048.png"/>
				<p>Here I paused; when the high-priest arose up with great 
				<ref target="reverence_" corresp="reverence">reverence</ref>
					<note xml:id="reverence" target="reverence_" type="gloss" 
					resp="editors.xml#UOStudStaff">Respect</note>, and having
					bowed three times, almost to the ground, said, "Holy woman, we heard, with great
					attention what the oracle said, and when we returned into our country we called,
					the next day, all our countrymen together, and told them every thing that the
					oracle had delivered. Our countrymen rejoiced to hear the good news, and all
					desire you will come and live among them; they will love you, obey all your
					commands, and will make you their queen, for our king is lately dead, and as he
					had no children, we have not as yet chosen a new king. Will you therefore go
					home with us, and be our queen?"				
					</p>
				<pb n="48" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_049.png"/>
				<!--italic for "Answer"-->
				<p>Answer. "I thank you for your kind offer; but I will not be your queen, therefore
					you may choose whom you please. But, as you desire it, I will come and live
					among you, and will be only your instructor."				
					</p>
				<p>I had scarcely finished my answer, before the whole company made the greatest
					acclamations of joy, crying out,				
					</p>
				<p>"Come! Come! Come! and make us happy."
					</p>
				<p>I arose up, and, after their manner, made three respectful bows to them; which
					were returned with new acclamations of joy.				
					</p>
				<pb n="49" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_050.png"/>
				<p>As soon as all were silent again, I sat down, and taking out of my twig- basket
					two of the best rings, I presented them to the high-priest, and to each of the
					priests two others, near in goodness to those of the high-priest's; when,
					finding that I had a sufficient number of rings, I desired the people to come to
					me one by one, and I presented each with a ring, which they all received with
					great expressions of joy.				
					</p>
				<p>I soon found that they yet were confounded in their ideas about me, and conceived
					of me, as one more than mortal; for the high-priest, with great reverence, asked
					me if I ever ate and drank?				
					</p>
				<pb n="50" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_051.png"/>
				<p>I chearfully replied "Yes; and if you have brought any 
				<ref target="provisions_" corresp="provisions">provisions</ref>
					<note xml:id="provisions" target="provisions_" type="gloss" 
					resp="editors.xml#UOStudStaff">Food and drink</note>, I will eat and 
					drink with you." At this he seemed both pleased and surprised. He then called to
					some of the people, who came forwards, bringing a kind of wicker baskets. 
					The contents of them were dried fish, goats flesh, and other animal food, various
					kinds of fruit, dried corn, and a liquor like wine.				
					</p>
				<p>Before I began to eat, I stood up and said grace, at which they seemed much
					surprised. Then the priests and I took a comfortable

					the whole time. When we had finished, I again surprised them with
				<pb n="51" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_052.png"/>
					<!--page breaks after 're-'-->returning
					thanks, according to the manner of christians.				
					</p>
				<p>The high-priest, hearing me conclude with the name of 
				<persName type="lcnaf" key="n79084784">Jesus Christ</persName>, 
				asked me very submissively who he was? I answered the son of God,

				up a sacrifice to his father, for mankind; therefore we ought to 
				praise God in his name, and in his name to ask for whatever it is

					would understand that I was

					carry my bundle. I then set out in company with all the priests, followed by the
					multitude to the sea-side, were I saw a great number of canoes. I entered into
					one of them, and immediately the whole company entered into theirs. During our

					a Bible, I, at my leisure, translated that also, beginning with the plainest
					parts first, till I had finished the whole.				
					</p>
				<p>I from time to time read the Bible in public to them, and, as I was able,
					explained it. I cannot but say I found myself very happy, among these plain,
					illiterate, honest people. There was nothing that they could do to please me,
					but they did it; and often expressed their hope, of my never leav­ ing them. I
					found the manner of introducing myself among them was highly serviceable to me:
					for though,

					not but observe that I was like them; yet it was easy to discover, that they

					more than my interest, to undeceive them, as this opinion secured to me that
					respect and authority which were necessary for me to preserve, in order to carry
					on the great work among them, in which I was engaged.				
					</p>
				<p>I sometimes amused myself in shooting with my bow and arrows, in which I exceeded
					any of them. But even this circumstance,

					 as it was, raised their
					opinion of me. In the summer season, I now and then went to visit my old island;
					but henever I did so, I always ordered the Indians who
					<pb n="60" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_061.png"/>
					rowed me over, to wait with the canoe by
					the sea-side; or to return home and fetch me in the evening, whilst I roamed
					about at my own pleasure.				
					</p>
				<p>When the same time returned next year, at which season they used to visit the
					oracle, the priests asked me, in the name of the people, if they should go to
					visit the oracle. I answered by no means, for that they would never more hear
					any answers from it.

					the translation of the Bible, as well as that of the Catechism, but indeed of

					These writers laboured to prove, that Christianity was repugnant to plain 
					uncorrupted reason. Yet I found this assertion intirely false; for, 
					here a people, who had no other guide but their reason, no sooner heard 
					Christianity plainly and simply expounded to them, but they soon embraced it. 
					And I am fully persuaded that whenever any unprejudiced person tries the 
					religion of Christ by his reason, though he may find it in some measure above 
					his reason, he yet will not find it contrary to it, and that it is worthy of 
					his assenting to it.				
					</p>
				<p>But to continue my history. In the beginning of the third summer of my being
					here, not having been for a long time at my old island, on account
				<pb n="63" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_064.png"/>
					of the late rainy season, answerable to winter in					
					<placeName type="tgn" key="1000003">Europe</placeName>, I ordered
					some Indians to row me thither, early in the morning. I told the Indians they
					might return back, and come again in the evening.				
					</p>
				<p>Every time I made this visit, I always went into my subterraneous apartments, to
					get some rings to distribute among the Indians. I suppose they wondered how I
					came by them, but never asked me. And, that they might have no suspicion that I
					brought them from the island, I never gave them any on my return to them; but
					always a few days before I intended a visit to my old habitation.

					Nor might the evil stop thus; their
					country might be discovered, and probably invaded, and numbers of the people be
					carried away into slavery, and other injuries committed. Thus did my busy
					imagination create, as in a moment, evils that happily never came into
					existence: for these strangers soon came forwards, as I supposed, to view the
					statue, and being come near enough to be heard, one of them said to another, "We
					have indeed found a strange thing; what can this huge statue be designed for?"				
					</p>
				<p>"I know not," replied one who stood by him, "nor can I take pleasure in any
					discovery in a place where, no doubt, my dear cousin was starved to death or
					devoured by beasts."				
					</p>
			<pb n="67" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_068.png"/>
				<p>These words, and the voice, alarmed me. "sure," cried I within myself, 
					"he speaks of me, and it is my cousin Winkfield."				
					</p>
				<p>As he came nearer, I thought more certainly it was he. I listened attentively to
					their conversation, in hopes to hear something that might confirm my suspicion.
					They stood still, I suppose, to examined the statue, when as often as one of
					them spoke, I was the more confirmed, by hearing and seeing him, that it was my
					uncle's son. "But how," cried I, "should he come here? how know
					I was left on this island?"				
					</p>
				<p>These reflections destroyed my first suspicions, and my former fears began
				<pb n="68" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_069.png"/>
					to revive; when he who I supposed was my
					cousin, said, "Let us stand here no longer; but as this seems undoubtedly to be
					an uninhabited island, let us continue our search, and perhaps we may yet find
					the bones of my dear Unca Winkfield; and by burying them
					pay the last, and only, respect we can to her unhappy memory; for if some beast
					destroyed her, he hardly ate her bones."				
					</p>
				<p>I heard these last words, including my name, too distinctly any longer to doubt,
					whether the speaker was my cousin, or not, and perceiving the company, was
					walking away cried out, "Winkfield, stay!"				
					</p>
			<pb n="69" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_070.png"/>
				<p>At these words my cousin started violently, and turning round, as they all did,
					said to his companion, "surely, Charles, I was called!" "No doubt," replied his
					companion Charles, "but it must be some of our companions who called you; for
					this island is uninhabited: we have been over it enough to see its bounds."				
					</p>
				<p>Mr.Winkfield "No, Charles; it was too loud a voice to be human. Did not you hear
					it, gentlemen?" speaking to his company.				
					</p>
				<p>Company. "Yes, indeed; and it was like thunder."
					</p>
				<p>The joy of finding my cousin raised my spirits, and I was determined to indulge
			<pb n="70" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_71.png"/>
					an adventure which promised much pleasure, and continued as follows.				
					</p>
				<p>Mr.Winkfield. "sure it must be the spirit of my dear cousin! My father, who you
					know is far from being superstitious, has often said, he believes, that upon
					very important occasions, departed spirits are suffered to appear again: O that
					I could hear the voice again!"				
					</p>
				<p>Unca Winkfield."Is your father alive?"
					</p>
				<p>Mr.Winkfield. "Hark! it speaks again, like thunder! amazing!— shall I answer? Yes
					I will. I hope so, he was alive a few months ago."				
					</p>
			<pb n="71" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_72.png"/>
				<p>One of the company. "This is strange, indeed! But it may be dangerous to stay; you
					know not with whom you may be conversing, it may be an evil spirit, and may hurt
					us. I have heard of such; let us go."				
					</p>
				<p>Another of the company. "I think the same; and never heard that any departed
					spirit, if it did return upon any particular occasion, spoke with a thundering
					voice as this. Besides, look at that statue, it brings to my mind the oracles
					that we read of in ancient history; and, to my appreension, the voice seemed to
					come from thence; and, perhaps, it may be true, as we have read, that devils
					speak from such kind of statues."				
					</p>
			<pb n="72" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_73.png"/>
				<p>Mr. Winkfield. "You speak with reason; but, I think, I could be almost content to
					speak to the devil to hear news of my cousin."				
					</p>
				<p>Charles. "Fie, talk not so; let us commit ourselves to God, and wait a little to
					hear if it will speak again, and listen if the sound comes really from the
					statue; but do not speak any more to it."				
					</p>
				<p>I could not help being much diverted at their fears; but unwilling yet to
					discover myself, I however determined to dissipate their terrors; and beginning
					a midnight hymn of my uncle's composing, which my cousin had set notes to, and
					taught me to sing, they started when I begun; but as
				<pb n="73" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_74.png"/>
					soon as my cousin distinguished the tune, and understood the words, he was calm, 
					and made a motion to the company to be silent, and when I had done, said,				
					</p>
				<p>"An evil spirit would not sing such holy words. My father composed them, and I
					taught my cousin to sing them."				
					</p>
				<p>One of the company. "Thus is not to be accounted for; yet we read that Satan can transform
					himself into an angel of light."				
					</p>
				<p>Mr.Winkfield. Away! I have no fears; I will speak to it.—Does my cousin
					Unca live?"
					</p>
			<pb n="74" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_075.png"/>
				<p>Unca."she lives, and is happy."
					</p>
				<p>Mr.Winkfield. "Perhaps, in heaven."
					</p>
				<p>Unca. "No; she lives upon earth."
				</p>
				<p>Mr. Winkfield. "Shall I ever see her?"
					</p>
				<p>Unca. "You may."
					</p>
				<p>Mr.Winkfield. "But when and where?"
					</p>
				<p>Mr.Winkfield. "Let me see her then."
					</p>
				<p>Unca. "You shall, if you will do one thing."
					</p>
			<pb n="75" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_076.png"/>
				<p>Mr.Winkfield. "I will do any thing that"--

				<p>Charles "Stop, be not rash; ask what you are to do before you promise. I am myself
					not without my suspicions."				
					</p>
				<p>Mr.Winkfield. "I was going to say, I would do any thing not unworthy of a

				<p>Charles. "I am satisfied."
					</p>
				<p>Mr. Winkfield. "If I may see my cousin I will do any thing not unworthy of a

				<p>I had found among my clothes a small parcel of brass wire, which I had to mend my

				<pb n="78" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_079.png"/>carrying over some
					curious birds to <placeName type="tgn" key="7002445">England</placeName>. After
					I came to live among the Indians, I made a strange kind of musical instrument. 
					It was a long narrow box, made of thin wood, with holes cut in it, and several
					pieces of brass wire, placed in a particular manner. This I used to place in a
					tree, and when the wind blew properly upon it, it would send out certain soft
					pleasant notes.

				</p>
				<p>I had a mind to try what effect it would have in the statue. I found out a method
					to fix it, opposite to the mouth, withinside of the statue, and when the
				<pb n="79" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_080.png"/>wind sat right to blow into it, the sounds
					were very delightful, and might be heard I believe almost over the whole island.
					After I had made this discovery I always brought it with me, and placed it in
					the statue, and, if the wind stood properly, I was greatly entertained with its

					</p>
				<p>As I found the wind sat full against the statue, I placed the instrument before
					it, and heard it play with a loudness that I could not have borne long. This no
					doubt could not but give my visitors a new alarm; yet, from the nature of it,
					was less terrifying than my speaking had been, with such a magnifying voice, as
					the mechanism of the statue occasioned: and indeed they
				<pb n="80" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_081.png"/>
					were greatly alarmed, which gave birth to
					the following dialogue, just as my cousin began to sing, as I was afterwards
					informed.				
					</p>
				<p>Mr.Winkfield. "Ha! how sweet, but strange are these sounds!"</p>

				<p>Their conversation was so earnest, that they did not perceive me advancing,
					taking a slope till I got behind them, though at some distance, just
				<pb n="82" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_083.png"/>as my cousin began his hymn. I stood
					still till he had done, in hopes they would see me before I walked up quite
					close to them; for I was afraid of alarming them too much. As soon as as my
					cousin had finished his hymn, and all, looking at the statue, had stood silent
					some minutes, my cousin exclaimed,				
					</p>
				<p>"I have sung the hymn, but where is 
				<persName type="lcnaf" key="n84027119">Unca</persName>?"</p>
				<p>As he said these words, I moved gently towards the left, and then walked
					forwards, till I came upon a line with them. The musick still sounding, I then
					stopped, holding my staff so that the image of the sun, on the top of it,
					prevented a full view of my face. Presently					
				<pb n="83" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_084.png"/>
					Presently, he who was called Charles saw me; when starting, aside he cried,				
					</p>
				<p>"Bless me! what is that?"
				</p>
				<p>Upon this all turned and saw me, to their great surprize. They stood still and
					silent like mutes. I now bowed my staff as saluting them, and exposed my face to
					their full view, not very far from them, when my cousin, in his turn, 
					exclaimed,				
					</p>
				<p>"It is my cousin's face! but can it be her?"
				</p>
				<p>Unca. "It is."
				</p>
				<p>Mr.Winkfield. "And living too?"
				</p>

				 and must I make the first advance?"				
				 </p>
				<p>Having said this, I began, slowly, to step forward, when one of the company cried
					out,				
					</p>
				<p>"Nay, if you all have a mind to stay till the devil comes to you, I will not; and
					ran away as fast as he could."				
					</p>
				<p>I still kept slowly moving on, whilst my cousin, and the rest, stood amazed, half
					leaning back, as if in doubt whether to stay or run after their companion. Their
					great amazement confounded me. I was at a loss what to say
				<pb n="85" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_086.png"/>
					or do. I stopt short, and all of us stood
					silently gazing, them at me, and I at them. At last recovering from the
					confusion their great surprize had thrown me into, I addressed my cousin in
					these words:				
					</p>
				<p>Unca. "Dear Cousin Winkfield, be not so much alarmed, 
				I am really your cousin<persName type="lcnaf" key="n84027119">Unca Eliza

				</p>
				<p>Mr. Winkfield. "You indeed appear to be such; but the strange things which I
				 	have seen and heard to-day, and your no less extraordinary appearance, scarce
					leave me sufficiently master of my senses to form a right judgment of what I see
					and hear."				
					</p>
				<pb n="86" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_087.png"/>
				<p>By this time I was got close up to him, for he stood like a statue, and giving my
					hand said,				
					</p>
				<p>"Cousin Winkfield, be composed, and satisfied, that 
				it is your cousin Unca who speaks to you."
				</p>
				<p>He then took me in his arms, embraced and kissed me, 
				and as soon as his transports, at finding me, a little subsided he said,				
					</p>
				<p>"But, pray my dear Unca, what mean the huge statue; 
				the monstrous voice, loud like thunder, that talked to me and sung; 
				this loud musick, which I still hear; the strange rich dress I see you in, and

				<p>Unca. "Stop, dear cousin; you have asked too many questions, 
				and such as cannot be answered in a hurry: and I have, on my part, 
				my questions to ask you, for your appearance here is very surprizing

					</p>
				<p>My cousin now briefly informed me, that one of the gentlemen in company, whom he

					<placeName type="tgn" key="7002445">England</placeName>,

					thought, from the account that the captain had given him, he could find the

					the island				
				<pb n="90" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_91.png"/>
					behind the statue, or whatever
					it is, and if you please I will conduct you on board; for by this time they will
					expect us to dinner, and I reckon are not a little uneasy about what may have
					befallen us; for I suppose our companion has made a dreadful report.				
					</p>
				<p>I answered that I was entirely at his disposal for a few hours. "For a few
					hours!"" returned he briskly, "why, must my dear Unca 
					and I ever part again? You talk strangely; and once more make me almost doubt the
					reality of what I see and hear."				
					</p>
				<p>"Yes, we must part for a little," answered I, "but I will soon
					satisfy					
				<pb n="91" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_092.png"/>you on that head. But let us pass
					on; I attend you."				
					</p>
				<p>As we walked along I told him, that I had come over on a visit to the island that
					morning, and that at night I was obliged to return back to the island on which I
					had lived above two years; or otherwise my friends there would be under great
					uneasiness at my absence. Thus we went on talking, till we came to the shore,
					when my cousin was greatly surprised at not seeing the boat.				
					</p>
				<p>"I ordered the boat," said he, "to wait for me here; and though Mr. Lock in his

					been time enough for its return."

					called to them as loud as he could, and waved his handkerchief. He then said,
					"they made a signal that they see me." In a little time after he saw the boat

				<p>"Mr. Lock said right, this is certainly some inchanted island, and I would not row

				</p>
				<p>Third sailor. "Aye; and don't you see that she-devil there

					no more to sea."				
					</p>
				<p>Fifth sailor. "You fool, if you had them in your hand, they would all turn to dust."
				</p>
				<p>We were obliged to hear this strange dialogue before captain shore, could put in
					a word. At last, with much ado, he made them hear him; but neither threats nor
					fair words could prevail upon them to come nearer the shore, whilst I stayed
					there. One of them said, that Mr.					
					<pb n="95" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_096.png"/>Lock
					came on board in a terrible fright, and said, he had seen a monster as tall as
					the moon, that it talked and sung louder than thunder, and that if he had not
					run away, a she-devil would have run away with him; and as one of our men was
					rowing him back, they said, they saw a hundred devils fly away with you all into
					the air, whilst they saw a great devil playing upon the bag-pipes, and he said,
					that for that matter he played much better than ever he heard a					
					<persName type="lcnaf" key="87832903">scotchman</persName>in his

					</p>
				<p>We therefore called a council, and had agreed to sail directly, if captain
					shore had not called to us.				
					</p>
				<pb n="96" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_097.png"/>
				<p>As soon as the sailor had done talking, I told my cousin that I would leave them,
					that they might go on board their ship, and try to undeceive the crew, and that
					I would meet him the next morning at the steps. My cousin was much concerned at
					this unexpected sudden separation; but it appeared absolutely necessary, and
					there was no time for deliberation; for the men threatened every moment to row
					back to the ship.				</p>

					discovered myself in a less alarming manner. As soon as I was got out of sight,
					the sailors set up a shout of joy, whilst I pensively walked on to my
					subterraneous apartments. I hastened up into the statue, to remove the occasion,
					which had had no little effect in the late unlucky incident. Here I sat musing
					on what might be the consequences of this					
					<pb n="98" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_099.png"/>
					affair. They may perhaps, cried I, murder my cousin, or force him to return back
					immediately, and not suffer him to go aboard again; or, if they do, may fail
					away, and take him with them. Better had it been never to have seen him again,
					than thus to prove the occasion of his death, or of new vexation to myself. I
					might have concluded my life with ease and pleasure among the Indians; but if I
					see him no more, I shall have laid a fresh cause for uneasiness as long as I
					live, and drag out the remainder of my life in misery; a burden to myself, and
					useless to all around me. What, continued I, is human life? As a wave destroys
					in a moment the wave that preceded it, so often does the arising moment the joys
					of the last; never more to return.					
					<pb n="99" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_100.png"/>Thus
					destroyed, perhaps, is all my past happiness! The sun, which in the morning saw
					me happy, now beholds me mourning; shedding tears which perhaps must flow, till
					death stops the current. Nor shall mine flow alone; an aged father, with his
					afflicted consort, may mourn a lost son, and curse the hour in which they first
					knew me, the unhappy means of bringing their gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.				
					</p>
				<p>I had taken no refreshment, since I came upon the island, in the morning; and my
					grief was too great to let me think of any, till at last, fatigued with weeping
					and fasting, I grew faint. I then thought I would leave the place, and take some
					refreshment; but not till I had sought comfort of him who
					<pb n="100" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_101.png"/>
					only can give it. Now finding my mind
					more composed, and having determined to banish every anxious thought, till I saw
					what the returning day might produce (for I purposed to come again the next
					morning) I made haste to get above ground.				
					</p>
				<p>I did so, and was walking to the place where I had put some provisions, till I
					might want them, when I found part of the evils that my mind foreboded but too
					true; for who should I see walking solitarily along towards the statue, but my
					poor cousin! He did not see me till I called to him.				
					</p>
				<p>"Cousin Winkfield,said I, what have my fears proved true? will they not receive
					you on board?"				
					</p>
				<pb n="101" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_102.png"/>

					</p>
				<p>Unca. "But will not your father and mother be alarmed at your delay?"				
					 </p>
				<p>Mr. Winkfield. "They will not: for as I supposed it would be uncertain how long I
					might be searching for you, if I ever found you, I desired two years absence."				
					</p>
				<p>Unca. "I am so far satisfied. But relate what happened after I left 
				you on the shore."				
					 </p>
				<pb n="102" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_103.png"/>
				<p>Mr. Winkfield. "As soon as you had left us, the sailors waited till you was got
					out of sight, and then set up a great shout, which possibly you heard."				
					</p>
				<p>Unca. "I did hear it, and from
				     that moment was filled with fears, lest they should murder you, 
					 or leave you on shore, as they have done."				
					 </p>
				<p>Mr.Winkfield. "Weep not for me, my dear Unca, for to live
					with you I should be contented if he never returns."				
					</p>
				<p>Unca. "I feel the tenderness of your expression. But my 
				manner of living, length of time hath rendered agreeable to me; 
				but it would be
					<pb n="103" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_104.png"/>
					very disgusting to you. Rather may you

					</p>
				<p>Mr. Winkfield. "Stop, dear cousin! nor talk of leaving you;

					, and I must soon leave this island. Let us consider how you are to
					 be disposed of. In the interim, will you partake of such mean 
					 fare as I have here? for, I suppose, you have had no refreshment since 
					 morning any more than myself."				
					 </p>
				<p>We then walked to where I had stored my provisions, and there sat
					<pb n="104" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_105.png"/>
					down to our repast. I now desired him to continue his relation.				
					</p>
				<p>Mr.Winkfield. "I said the sailors shouted when you were out of sight, and instead
					of rowing up to us, as we expected, boldly told the captain, that they had sworn
					before they set out, not to bring me on board; being determined never to sail in
					company with, a man, who, as Mr. Locke told them, had talked and sang songs with
					the devil: and had it not been for us, you know, captain, said one of them, he
					would have brought a she-devil on board with him, and as soon as she was on
					board, to besure captain, she would have sunk the ship, and flown away with us
					all—No, no, good captain, we are bad enough, indeed; but we won't
					<pb n="105" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_106.png"/>keep the devil company neither; nor any

					her; for I saw her fly into the air. Did not you, Jack?"				
					</p>
				<p>Jack. "Yes, that I did. And she has left a terrible stink of brimstone behind.
					Don't you all smell it?"				
					</p>
				<p>All. "Smell it! aye to be sure; do you think we have no noses?"
					</p>
				<p>Captain shore was in a great passion. He told them "they were 
				<ref target="mutineer_" corresp="mutineer">mutineers</ref>
					<note xml:id="mutineer" target="mutineer_" type="gloss" 
					resp="editors.xml#UOStudStaff">someone who revolts against or openly resists

					supposed, wanted to run away with the ship." To this they replied,				
					</p>
				<pb n="106" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_107.png"/>
				<p>"No, no, captain, though we don't like the devil's company, we are honest fellows;
					 we don't want to run away with the ship; that would be going to the devil
					 another way, and I warrant he would trim us for using his lady so ill. You are
					 our captain, and we will take you on board, if you please; but Mr. Winkfield is
					 only a passenger, and we are not obliged to take him."				
					 </p>
				<p>Finding there was no good to be done with them, I whispered the captain that I
					would stay on shore all night, at all events; but desired he would come to me in
					the morning, and let me know if he had brought them to reason. However, as I had
					not					
					<pb n="107" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_108.png"/>
					spoken to the sailors, I was willing to try what I could do with them. 
					"Gentlemen,"" said I, "you are really under a
					great mistake; that genwoman, whom you call a she-devil, is my cousin she was
					three years ago left upon this island by a rogue of a captain, who ran away with
					her ship."				
					</p>
				<p>sailor. "Well, sir, if she is not a devil, I suppose she is a witch, and that is
					as bad; and that made the captain set her on shore. And pray was that tall
					monster who sung and played upon the bag-pipes your cousin too? You know, sir,
					we heard him play ourselves, and the devil could not play louder."				
					</p>
				<pb n="108" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_109.png"/>
				<p>Mr. Winkfield. "I was confounded at this question, not knowing myself how to
					account for what I had heard. They saw my confusion, and laughed: I therefore
					once more told the captain I would leave them, and hoped to see him in the
					morning. so we shook hands, and parted; he looking at me with great concern. I
					remembered you said, you should not leave this place till night. I was therefore
					walking up to the statue, in order to wait there some time, in hopes of seeing
					you thereabouts; if not, I intended walking up and down in quest of you: but as

					to the seaside, where a canoe will soon be ready to carry us where you shall pass
					the night in safety. In the morning we will return here, and I hope we shall see

					<note xml:id="repast" target="repast_" type="gloss"

					word that my cousin said, and most highly					
					<pb n="115" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_116.png"/>
					so as often as they could make themselves understood. When it was time to go to
					rest, the priests took care to provide a proper place for my cousin.				
					</p>
				<p>We were up the next day very early, breakfasted, and then set out for the island.
					During our voyage, the night before, I was the chief speaker; but now, in his
					turn, my cousin briefly told me how he came to know where I was; of which
					hereafter.				
					</p>
				<p>Nor did he omit any opportunity in the course of his narration to give me to
					understand, that he had all along preserved that affection for me that he had
					formerly

					<note xml:id="professed" target="professed_" type="gloss"

					But as often as he dropped such expressions, I took care to
					show no particular regard to 
					<pb n="116" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_117.png"/>
					them, but only a general attention to the thread of his discourse.				
					</p>
				<p>When we had reached the island, I ordered the Indians not to return as usual, not
					knowing what sudden occasion I might have for them; but strictly charged them
					not to advance a foot forward into the island, nor to row to any other part of
					it. My cousin and I now crossed the island to the place where we expected the
					boat to come to. We sat and walked up and down here, by turns, till noon, but
					saw no boat. We then took some of the provisions we had brought, and dined. In
					short, we passed the whole afternoon, till it was time to think of returning
					home, without seeing any signs of a boat: we therefore feared the crew had
					mutinied,					
					<pb n="117" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_118.png"/>and run away with the ship,
					and may be murdered the captain and the other passengers; at least, that they
					would not suffer the captain to come on shore again. The evening being far
					advanced, we were obliged to return home, not a little

					<note xml:id="chagrined" target="chagrined_" type="gloss" 
					resp="editors.xml#UOStudStaff">troubled, vexed, worried, grieved</note>

				<p>My concern, indeed, arose upon my cousin's account, for had the ship arrived I
					would not have gone away in it, being determined to live and die amongst my dear
					<persName type="lcnaf" key="sh85065022">Indians</persName>. 
					Nor, indeed, was it his intention to have gone home in her, but to have
					sent word to his parents that he had found me, and was determined to live and
					die with me; which, however, as often as he mentioned it, I most strongly
					opposed.				
					</p>
				<pb n="118" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_119.png"/>
				<p>My cousin insisted upon his going without me the next morning, to which I was
					forced to agree; but was greatly surprised to see him return before noon. "What
					means this quick return? cried I; I cannot conjecture the occasion."				
					</p>
				<p>Mr. Winkfield. "It seems,said he, as if providence, though by a somewhat adverse
					stroke, designs that I shall carry my resolution to teach the					
					<persName type="lcnaf" key="sh85065022">Indians</persName>into
					practice, and spend my days with my dear					
					<persName type="lcnaf" key="n84027119">Unca</persName>,
					whether she will or no; for as I drew near, this morning, to the part of the shore 
					where we yesterday waited for the boat, I saw, as I thought, several chests, and 
					casks, and such, indeed, they were: and when I came up to
					<pb n="119" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_120.png"/>
					them, I beheld a stick fixed in the ground, to the top of which was tied a letter. 
					This I took, and found it directed to me. Here it is."

				<p>I was heartily sorry at reading of this; but my cousin smiled, and said he should
					now live with me whether I would, or not. "I am," added he, "only uneasy for my
					father and mother; but I know when they are assured that you are living, and
					that we are together, their concern will be greatly lessened, and they will
					comfort themselves with the pleasing hope of hearing of us both next year. And
					it is in your power, my dear Unca,
					greatly to add to their pleasure, by enabling me to acquaint them, that you have
					become their daughter. Let us then be united in the glorious work you have begun;
					teach me the Indian language, and I will join the glorious task you have commenced,and
					<pb n="123" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_124.png"/>
					tread, with you, the path that leads to
					glory and happiness by well doing. One motive for my seeking you was, that, if
					we should meet, we might be for ever united. Consider one thing more, that if
					you refuse me, we cannot enjoy those hours of privacy together, I at least shall
					wish for, without offence to those around us; at least I know your delicacy will
					be hurt by them."				
					</p>
				<p>This last remark had some weight with me, yet I declined a direct answer; for
					though I loved him as a friend and relation, I had never considered him as a
					lover; nor any other person. It appeared to me, indeed, as if it must be as he
					would have it, yet					
					<pb n="124" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_125.png"/>
					the reflection gave
					me no pleasure; for though the	Indians, I believed, would not entertain any ill
					suspicions of my conduct, yet I could not satisfy myself with the reflection of
					being much alone with a man, as it hurt my modesty. However, postponing the
					matter for further consideration, my immediate care was to provide a sufficient
					number of canoes, the largest that could be got, to fetch my cousin's baggage.

				<p>I was very much pleased to see a basket with about a dozen live fowls, cocks and

					<pb n="137" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_138.png"/>"bad, I ordered the Indian to be
					immediately taken down, and his wounds to be dressed. Being determined to make

					Indian to be carried, for indeed he could not walk, to go down into the cabin

					bleeding, who seemed to start with horror at the sight of the captain. Having
					imposed silence on the captain, I ordered the women to give me an account of
					what had happened, which, as well as their fright and weakness would permit,
					they did; and the poor Indian, in a few words,"
					<pb n="138" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_139.png"/>

				<p>Mr.Winkfield senior. "May be yet living! you talk mysteriously. I thought you came

					</p>
				<p>Mr. Winkfield junior. "Honoured sir, don't be in such a hurry, you will offend the

				<p>Merchant Captain. "Sir I take no offence, I attribute your father's

					</p>
				<p>Mr.Winkfield senior. "I am of a warm temper, sir, the subject is very interesting,

					</p>
				<p>Merchant Captain. "I am satisfied. I left off I think, with saying that

				<p>"However, I was determined, if possible, to make the captain confess his guilt:

					<persName type="lcnaf" key="sh85055517">God?</persName> 
					I was so sensibly struck with these words, that I started
					up, as in a fright, from my seat. What, cried I to myself, am I doing? is such a
					wicked wretch as I am a proper person to set in judgment upon another? I have
					not murdered indeed, but how many robberies have I not committed? My heart was
					changed, as it were in a moment, I saw my own wickedness, abhorred myself, and

					</p>
				<p>"I then ordered that he should be secured, and all his men, and to make the best
					of our way with both ships to our island. When we arrived there, I ordered all
					possible care to be taken of the three Indians. But the poor Indian who had been
					hung up, died in a few days. Whilst he lived, he greatly lamented the fate of

				<pb n="148" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_149.png"/>
				<p>"The day after we reached our island, I told my mate what had passed in my mind

					ourselves? Where go to live with safety?"				
					</p>
				<p>"To this I replied, that I was determined to save my soul, if I could not my body,
					and would sooner get, by some means or other, to
					<placeName type="tgn" key="7002445">England</placeName>and be hanged, than

					<pb n="149" facs="pageImages/fa_Page_150.png"/>"of
					<persName type="lcnaf" key="sh85055517">God</persName>. To this my mate replied,

					resolution; and may

					a repentance not to be repented of. But	what shall we do with our men?"				
					</p>
				<p>"I answered, I have not been without my thoughts concerning them. You know
					they all love me much, and are not such wicked men as most of their profession
					commonly are. And I have at times heard them lament their long absence from
					their families, and now and then express some dislike at the unhappy way they

					much greater distress will come upon us, unless we most seriously repent of our
					sins?"

					</p>
				<p>"From that moment it was, I hope, given me to repent, and I am determined to break

					</p>
				<p>"I answered, that since they were come to this resolution, our immediate business
					was to watch for the opportunity, and that when it offered, I told them, that

					"sailed. We had a

					where he had first landed out of the ship that brought him, he saw no cannon,
					nor any body upon the island; he continued walking along the shore, yet saw no
					ship. At last he spied a cannon; having always a tinderbox ready about him for
					the expected occcasion, he struck a light, and fired the cannon. It was not long
					before he saw a boat making for the shore, and soon discovered that captain

					ready charged before he returned on board. My husband went on board the
					captain's ship, and dined with him, when they agreed that captain shore should
					come with my husband to our island, and spend three days with us. We were both

				<p>In return to captain shore's relation, we acquainted him with every thing that we
					had done in his absence, and satisfied his curiosity about the wonderful things

						--a historically inaccurate label often used in European literature to describe

						The destruction of the idol possibly suggests Unca Eliza's 'confirmation of Christian
