                     performed, theatres used a mechanism known as a thunder machine, which was
                     essentially a long wooden box balanced like a seesaw, containing a large cannon
                     ball that when rolled around produced a loud noise resembling thunder. To
                     create the effect of lightening, stage hands would prepare powdered resin which
                     would be thrown onto a flame. Lighting a firecracker attached to a wire
                     extending from the roof of the stage to the floor would create the illusion of
                     a lightening bolt (<ref

However, the verb "stanch" also suggests satisfying a desire (OED v3a), and it derives from the Old French that also means to make a ship watertight.</note>. </l>

                  <l>Having first seized his books, or with a log</l>
                  <l>Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,</l>
                  <l>Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember</l>
                  <l>First to possess his books; for without them</l>
                  <l>He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not</l>
                  <l>One spirit to command: they all do hate him</l>
                  <l>As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.</l>
                  <l>He has brave utensils,--for so he calls them--</l>
                  <l>Which when he has a house, he'll deck withal</l>
                  <l>And that most deeply to consider is</l>
                  <l>The beauty of his daughter; he himself</l>
                  <l>Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman,</l>
                  <l>But only Sycorax my dam and she;</l>
                  <l>But she as far surpasseth Sycorax</l>

                  <l>Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou</l>

                  <l>As dreams are made on, and our little life</l>

                  <l>For kissing of their feet; yet always bending</l>
                  <l>Towards their project. Then I beat my tabour;</l>
                  <l>At which, like unback'd colts, they prick'd</l>

                  <l>Now does my project gather to a head:</l>
                  <l>My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and time</l>

                  <l>I did say so,</l>

                  <l>In the same fashion as you gave in charge,</l>
                  <l>Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,</l>
                  <l>In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;</l>
                  <l>They cannot budge till your release. The king,</l>
                  <l>His brother and yours, abide all three distracted</l>
                  <l>And the remainder mourning over them,</l>

                  <l>His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops</l>

                  <l>Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,</l>

                  <l>Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him</l>
                  <l>When he comes back; you demi-puppets that</l>
                  <l>By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,</l>
                  <l>Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime</l>
                  <l>Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice</l>
                  <l>To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,</l>
                  <l>Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'd</l>
                  <l>The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,</l>
                  <l>And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault</l>
                  <l>Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder</l>
                  <l>Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak</l>

                     they all enter the circle which Prospero had made, and there stand charmed;
                     which Prospero observing, speaks:</stage>
                  <l>A solemn air and the best comforter</l>
                  <l>To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,</l>

                  <l>Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,</l>
                  <l>Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,</l>
                  <l>Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,</l>
                  <l>And as the morning steals upon the night,</l>
                  <l>Melting the darkness, so their rising senses</l>
                  <l>Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle</l>
                  <l>Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,</l>
                  <l>My true preserver, and a loyal sir</l>
                  <l>To him you follow'st! I will pay thy graces</l>

                  <l>Thou art pinch'd fort now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,</l>

                  <l>Would here have kill'd your king; I do forgive thee,</l>

                  <l>To be the lord on't. No more yet of this;</l>

                  <l>Sir, I invite your highness and your train</l>
                  <l>To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest</l>
                  <l>For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste</l>
                  <l>With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it</l>
                  <l>Go quick away; the story of my life</l>
                  <l>And the particular accidents gone by</l>
                  <l>Since I came to this isle: and in the morn</l>
                  <l>I'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples,</l>
                  <l>Where I have hope to see the nuptial</l>
                  <l>Of these our dear-beloved solemnized;</l>
                  <l>And thence retire me to my Milan, where</l>
                  <l>Every third thought shall be my grave.</l>

               <l>Now my charms are all o'erthrown,</l>
               <l>And what strength I have's mine own,</l>
               <l>Which is most faint: now, 'tis true,</l>
               <l>I must be here confined by you,</l>
               <l>Or sent to Naples. Let me not,</l>
               <l>Since I have my dukedom got</l>
               <l>And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell</l>
               <l>In this bare island by your spell;</l>
               <l>But release me from my bands</l>
               <l>With the help of your good hands:</l>
               <l>Gentle breath of yours my sails</l>
               <l>Must fill, or else my project fails,</l>
               <l>Which was to please. Now I want</l>
               <l>Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,</l>
               <l>And my ending is despair,</l>
               <l>Unless I be relieved by prayer,</l>
               <l>Which pierces so that it assaults</l>
               <l>Mercy itself and frees all faults.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi rend="indent">As you from crimes would pardon'd be,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi rend="indent">Let your indulgence set me free.</hi>
