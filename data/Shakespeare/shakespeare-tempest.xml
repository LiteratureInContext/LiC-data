<speaker>Boatswain</speaker>
<l>Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!</l>

<l>I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<l>He'll be hang'd yet,</l>
<l>Though every drop of water swear against it</l>

<l>Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an</l>

<sp>
<speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<l>If by your art, my dearest father, you have</l>
<l>Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.</l>
<l>The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,</l>
<l>But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,</l>
<l>Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered</l>
<l>With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,</l>
   <pb n="2" facs="pageImages/002.png"/>
<l>Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,</l>
<l>Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock</l>
<l>Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.</l>
<l>Had I been any god of power, I would</l>
<l>Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere</l>
<l>It should the good ship so have swallow'd and</l>
<l>The fraughting souls within her.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>Be collected:</l>
<l>No more amazement: tell your piteous heart</l>
<l>There's no harm done.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<l>O, woe the day!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>No harm.</l>
<l>I have done nothing but in care of thee,</l>
<l>Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who</l>
<l>Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing</l>
<l>Of whence I am, nor that I am more better</l>
<l>Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,</l>
<l>And thy no greater father.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<l>More to know</l>
<l>Did never meddle with my thoughts.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>'Tis time</l>
<l>I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,</l>
<l>And pluck my magic garment from me. So:</l>
<stage>Lays down his mantle</stage>
<l>Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.</l>
<l>The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd</l>
<l>The very virtue of compassion in thee,</l>
<l>I have with such provision in mine art</l>
<l>So safely ordered that there is no soul--</l>
<l>No, not so much perdition as an hair</l>
<l>Betid to any creature in the vessel</l>
<l>Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;</l>
<l>For thou must now know farther.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<l>You have often</l>
<l>Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd</l>
<l>And left me to a bootless inquisition,</l>
<l>Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>The hour's now come;</l>
<l>The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;</l>
<l>Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember</l>
<l>A time before we came unto this cell?</l>
<l>I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not</l>
<l>Out three years old.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<l>Certainly, sir, I can.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>By what? by any other house or person?</l>
<l>Of any thing the image tell me that</l>
<l>Hath kept with thy remembrance.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<l>'Tis far off</l>
<l>And rather like a dream than an assurance</l>
<l>That my remembrance warrants. Had I not</l>
<l>Four or five women once that tended me?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it</l>
<l>That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else</l>
<l>In the dark backward and abysm of time?</l>
<l>If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here,</l>
<l>How thou camest here thou mayst.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<l>But that I do not.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,</l>
<l>Thy father was the Duke of Milan and</l>
<l>A prince of power.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<l>Sir, are not you my father?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and</l>
<l>She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father</l>
<l>Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir</l>
<l>And princess no worse issued.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<l>O the heavens!</l>
<l>What foul play had we, that we came from thence?</l>
<l>Or blessed was't we did?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>Both, both, my girl:</l>
<l>By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,</l>
<l>But blessedly holp hither.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<l>O, my heart bleeds</l>
<l>To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,</l>
<l>Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio--</l>
<l>I pray thee, mark me--that a brother should</l>
<l>Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself</l>
<l>Of all the world I loved and to him put</l>
<l>The manage of my state; as at that time</l>
<l>Through all the signories it was the first</l>
<l>And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed</l>
<l>In dignity, and for the liberal arts</l>
<l>Without a parallel; those being all my study,</l>
<l>The government I cast upon my brother</l>
<l>And to my state grew stranger, being transported</l>
<l>And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--</l>
<l>Dost thou attend me?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<l>Sir, most heedfully.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>Being once perfected how to grant suits,</l>
<l>How to deny them, who to advance and who</l>
<l>To trash for over-topping, new created</l>
<l>The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,</l>
<l>Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key</l>
<l>Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state</l>
<l>To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was</l>
<l>The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,</l>
<l>And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<l>O, good sir, I do.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>I pray thee, mark me.</l>
<l>I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated</l>
<l>To closeness and the bettering of my mind</l>
<l>With that which, but by being so retired,</l>
<l>O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother</l>
<l>Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,</l>
<l>Like a good parent, did beget of him</l>
<l>A falsehood in its contrary as great</l>
<l>As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,</l>
<l>A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,</l>
<l>Not only with what my revenue yielded,</l>
<l>But what my power might else exact, like one</l>
<l>Who having into truth, by telling of it,</l>
<l>Made such a sinner of his memory,</l>
<l>To credit his own lie, he did believe</l>
<l>He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution</l>
<l>And executing the outward face of royalty,</l>
<l>With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing--</l>
<l>Dost thou hear?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<l>Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>To have no screen between this part he play'd</l>
<l>And him he play'd it for, he needs will be</l>
<l>Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library</l>
<l>Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties</l>
<l>He thinks me now incapable; confederates--</l>
<l>So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of Naples</l>
<l>To give him annual tribute, do him homage,</l>
<l>Subject his coronet to his crown and bend</l>
<l>The dukedom yet unbow'd--alas, poor Milan!--</l>
<l>To most ignoble stooping.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<l>O the heavens!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>Mark his condition and the event; then tell me</l>
<l>If this might be a brother.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<l>I should sin</l>
<l>To think but nobly of my grandmother:</l><pb n="3" facs="pageImages/003.png"/>
<l>Good wombs have borne bad sons.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>Now the condition.</l>
<l>The King of Naples, being an enemy</l>
<l>To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;</l>
<l>Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises</l>
<l>Of homage and I know not how much tribute,</l>
<l>Should presently extirpate me and mine</l>
<l>Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan</l>
<l>With all the honours on my brother: whereon,</l>
<l>A treacherous army levied, one midnight</l>
<l>Fated to the purpose did Antonio open</l>
<l>The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,</l>
<l>The ministers for the purpose hurried thence</l>
<l>Me and thy crying self.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<l>Alack, for pity!</l>
<l>I, not remembering how I cried out then,</l>
<l>Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint</l>
<l>That wrings mine eyes to't.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>Hear a little further</l>
<l>And then I'll bring thee to the present business</l>
<l>Which now's upon's; without the which this story</l>
<l>Were most impertinent.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<l>Wherefore did they not</l>
<l>That hour destroy us?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>Well demanded, wench:</l>
<l>My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,</l>
<l>So dear the love my people bore me, nor set</l>
<l>A mark so bloody on the business, but</l>
<l>With colours fairer painted their foul ends.</l>
<l>In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,</l>
<l>Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared</l>
<l>A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,</l>
<l>Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats</l>
<l>Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,</l>
<l>To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh</l>
<l>To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,</l>
<l>Did us but loving wrong.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<l>Alack, what trouble</l>
<l>Was I then to you!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>O, a cherubim</l>
<l>Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile.</l>
<l>Infused with a fortitude from heaven,</l>
<l>When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,</l>
<l>Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in me</l>
<l>An undergoing stomach, to bear up</l>
<l>Against what should ensue.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<l>How came we ashore?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>By Providence divine.</l>
<l>Some food we had and some fresh water that</l>
<l>A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,</l>
<l>Out of his charity, being then appointed</l>
<l>Master of this design, did give us, with</l>
<l>Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,</l>
<l>Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,</l>
<l>Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me</l>
<l>From mine own library with volumes that</l>
<l>I prize above my dukedom.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<l>Would I might</l>
<l>But ever see that man!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>Now I arise:</l>
<stage>Resumes his mantle</stage>
<l>Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.</l>
<l>Here in this island we arrived; and here</l>
<l>Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit</l>
<l>Than other princesses can that have more time</l>
<l>For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<l>Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir,</l>
<l>For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason</l>
<l>For raising this sea-storm?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>Know thus far forth.</l>
<l>By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,</l>
<l>Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies</l>
<l>Brought to this shore; and by my prescience</l>
<l>I find my zenith doth depend upon</l>
<l>A most auspicious star, whose influence</l>
<l>If now I court not but omit, my fortunes</l>
<l>Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions:</l>
<l>Thou art inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness,</l>
<l>And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.</l>
<stage>MIRANDA sleeps</stage>
<l>Come away, servant, come. I am ready now.</l>
<l>Approach, my Ariel, come.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Enter ARIEL</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<l>All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come</l>
<l>To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,</l>
<l>To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride</l>
<l>On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task</l>
<l>Ariel and all his quality.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>Hast thou, spirit,</l>
<l>Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<l>To every article.</l>
<l>I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,</l>
<l>Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,</l>
<l>I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide,</l>
<l>And burn in many places; on the topmast,</l>
<l>The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,</l>
<l>Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursors</l>
<l>O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary</l>
<l>And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks</l>
<l>Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune</l>
<l>Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,</l>
<l>Yea, his dread trident shake.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>My brave spirit!</l>
<l>Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil</l>
<l>Would not infect his reason?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<l>Not a soul</l>
<l>But felt a fever of the mad and play'd</l>
<l>Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners</l>
<l>Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,</l>
<l>Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,</l>
<l>With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--</l>
<l>Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty</l>
<l>And all the devils are here.'</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>Why that's my spirit!</l>
<l>But was not this nigh shore?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<l>Close by, my master.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>But are they, Ariel, safe?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<l>Not a hair perish'd;</l>
<l>On their sustaining garments not a blemish,</l>
<l>But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,</l>
<l>In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.</l>
<l>The king's son have I landed by himself;</l>
<l>Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs</l>
<l>In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,</l>
<l>His arms in this sad knot.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>Of the king's ship</l>
<l>The mariners say how thou hast disposed</l>
<l>And all the rest o' the fleet.</l>
</sp>
   <pb n="4" facs="pageImages/004.png"/>
<sp>
<speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<l>Safely in harbour</l>
<l>Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once</l>
<l>Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew</l>
<l>From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:</l>
<l>The mariners all under hatches stow'd;</l>
<l>Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,</l>
<l>I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet</l>
<l>Which I dispersed, they all have met again</l>
<l>And are upon the Mediterranean flote,</l>
<l>Bound sadly home for Naples,</l>
<l>Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd</l>
<l>And his great person perish.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>Ariel, thy charge</l>
<l>Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.</l>
<l>What is the time o' the day?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<l>Past the mid season.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now</l>
<l>Must by us both be spent most preciously.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<l>Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,</l>
<l>Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,</l>
<l>Which is not yet perform'd me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>How now? moody?</l>
<l>What is't thou canst demand?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<l>My liberty.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>Before the time be out? no more!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<l>I prithee,</l>
<l>Remember I have done thee worthy service;</l>
<l>Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served</l>
<l>Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise</l>
<l>To bate me a full year.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>Dost thou forget</l>
<l>From what a torment I did free thee?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<l>No.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze</l>
<l>Of the salt deep,</l>
<l>To run upon the sharp wind of the north,</l>
<l>To do me business in the veins o' the earth</l>
<l>When it is baked with frost.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<l>I do not, sir.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot</l>
<l>The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy</l>
<l>Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<l>No, sir.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<l>Sir, in Argier.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>O, was she so? I must</l>
<l>Once in a month recount what thou hast been,</l>
<l>Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax,</l>
<l>For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible</l>
<l>To enter human hearing, from Argier,</l>
<l>Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did</l>
<l>They would not take her life. Is not this true?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<l>Ay, sir.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child</l>
<l>And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,</l>
<l>As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;</l>
<l>And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate</l>
<l>To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,</l>
<l>Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,</l>
<l>By help of her more potent ministers</l>
<l>And in her most unmitigable rage,</l>
<l>Into a cloven pine; within which rift</l>
<l>Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain</l>
<l>A dozen years; within which space she died</l>
<l>And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans</l>
<l>As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island--</l>
<l>Save for the son that she did litter here,</l>
<l>A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd with</l>
<l>A human shape.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<l>Yes, Caliban her son.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban</l>
<l>Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st</l>
<l>What torment I did find thee in; thy groans</l>
<l>Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts</l>
<l>Of ever angry bears: it was a torment</l>
<l>To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax</l>
<l>Could not again undo: it was mine art,</l>
<l>When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape</l>

<l>Pardon, master;</l>

</sp>

<speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<l>I must eat my dinner.</l>
<l>This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,</l>
<l>Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first,</l>
<l>Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me</l>
<l>Water with berries in't, and teach me how</l>
<l>To name the bigger light, and how the less,</l>
<l>That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee</l>
<l>And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle,</l>
<l>The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:</l>
<l>Cursed be I that did so! All the charms</l>
<l>Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!</l>
<l>For I am all the subjects that you have,</l>
<l>Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me</l>
<l>In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me</l>
<l>The rest o' the island.</l>

<l>Thou most lying slave,</l>
<l>Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,</l>
<l>Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged thee</l>
<l>In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate</l>
<l>The honour of my child.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<l>O ho, O ho! would't had been done!</l>

<l>Abhorred slave,</l>
<l>Which any print of goodness wilt not take,</l>
<l>Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,</l>
<l>Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour</l>
<l>One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,</l>
<l>Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like</l>
<l>A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes</l>
<l>With words that made them known. But thy vile race,</l>
<l>Though thou didst learn, had that in't which</l>
<l>good natures</l>
<l>Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou</l>
<l>Deservedly confined into this rock,</l>
<l>Who hadst deserved more than a prison.</l>

<l>What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,</l>

<l>Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth?</l>
<l>It sounds no more: and sure, it waits upon</l>

<l>Weeping again the king my father's wreck,</l>
<l>This music crept by me upon the waters,</l>
<l>Allaying both their fury and my passion</l>
<l>With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,</l>
<l>Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.</l>
<l>No, it begins again.</l>
<stage>ARIEL sings</stage>
<l>Full fathom five thy father lies;</l>
<l>Of his bones are coral made;</l>
<l>Those are pearls that were his eyes:</l>

<l>It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses</l>
<l>As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest</l>
<l>Was in the wreck; and, but he's something stain'd</l>
<l>With grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him</l>
<l>A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows</l>
<l>And strays about to find 'em.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<l>I might call him</l>
<l>A thing divine, for nothing natural</l>

<speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<l>Most sure, the goddess</l>
<l>On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer</l>
<l>May know if you remain upon this island;</l>
<l>And that you will some good instruction give</l>
<l>How I may bear me here: my prime request,</l>
<l>Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!</l>
<l>If you be maid or no?</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>No wonder, sir;</l>

<l>How? the best?</l>
<l>What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<l>A single thing, as I am now, that wonders</l>
<l>To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;</l>
<l>And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,</l>
<l>Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld</l>

The Duke of Milan
</l>
<l>And his more braver daughter could control thee,</l>

<stage>To FERDINAND</stage>
<l>A word, good sir;</l>
<l>I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<l>Why speaks my father so ungently? This</l>
<l>Is the third man that e'er I saw, the first</l>
<l>That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father</l>
<l>To be inclined my way!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<l>O, if a virgin,</l>
<l>And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you</l>
<l>The queen of Naples.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>Soft, sir! one word more.</l>
<stage>Aside</stage>
<l>They are both in either's powers; but this swift business</l>
<l>I must uneasy make, lest too light winning</l>
<l>Make the prize light.</l>
<stage>To FERDINAND</stage>
<l>One word more; I charge thee</l>
<l>That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp</l>
<l>The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself</l>
<l>Upon this island as a spy, to win it</l>
<l>From me, the lord on't.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<l>No, as I am a man.</l>

<sp>

<l>What? I say,</l>
<l>My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor;</l>
<l>Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience</l>

<l>Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,</l>

<l>My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,</l>

<l>Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,</l>

<l>Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe</l>
<l>Is common; every day some sailor's wife,</l>

<l>When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,</l>
<l>Comes to the entertainer--</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>A dollar.</l>

<l>Well, I have done: but yet,--</l>

<l>He will be talking.</l>

<l>It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate</l>

<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>Temperance was a delicate wench.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>True; save means to live.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>Of that there's none, or little.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<l>How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>The ground indeed is tawny.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>With an eye of green in't.</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<l>But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost</l>
<l>beyond credit,--</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>As many vouched rarities are.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<l>That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in</l>
<l>the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and</l>
<l>glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with</l>
<l>salt water.</l>
</sp>

<l>If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not</l>
<l>say he lies?</l>

<l>the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.</l>

<l>Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to</l>
<l>their queen.</l>

<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord,</l>
<l>how you take it!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ADRIAN</speaker>
<l>'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that:</l>
<l>she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<l>This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ADRIAN</speaker>
<l>Carthage?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<l>I assure you, Carthage.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>His word is more than the miraculous harp; he hath</l>
<l>raised the wall and houses too.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>What impossible matter will he make easy next?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>I think he will carry this island home in his pocket</l>
<l>and give it his son for an apple.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring</l>
<l>forth more islands.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<l>Ay.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>Why, in good time.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<l>Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now</l>
<l>as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage</l>
<l>of your daughter, who is now queen.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>And the rarest that e'er came there.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<l>Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I</l>
<l>wore it? I mean, in a sort.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>That sort was well fished for.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<l>When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<l>You cram these words into mine ears against</l>
<l>The stomach of my sense. Would I had never</l>
<l>Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,</l>
<l>My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,</l>
<l>Who is so far from Italy removed</l>
<l>I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir</l>
<l>Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish</l>
<l>Hath made his meal on thee?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FRANCISCO</speaker>
<l>Sir, he may live:</l>
<l>I saw him beat the surges under him,</l>
<l>And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,</l>
<l>Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted</l>
<l>The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head</l>
<l>'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd</l>
<l>Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke</l>
<l>To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,</l>
<l>As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt</l>
<l>He came alive to land.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<l>No, no, he's gone.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,</l>
<l>That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,</l>
<l>But rather lose her to an African;</l>
<l>Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,</l>
<l>Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<l>Prithee, peace.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise</l>
<l>By all of us, and the fair soul herself</l>
<l>Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at</l>
<l>Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your</l>
<l>son,</l>
<l>I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have</l>
<l>More widows in them of this business' making</l>
<l>Than we bring men to comfort them:</l>
<l>The fault's your own.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<l>So is the dear'st o' the loss.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<l>My lord Sebastian,</l>
<l>The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness</l>
<l>And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,</l>
<l>When you should bring the plaster.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>Very well.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>And most chirurgeonly.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<l>It is foul weather in us all, good sir,</l>
<l>When you are cloudy.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>Foul weather?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>Very foul.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<l>Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>He'ld sow't with nettle-seed.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>Or docks, or mallows.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<l>And were the king on't, what would I do?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>'Scape being drunk for want of wine.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<l>I' the commonwealth I would by contraries</l>
<l>Execute all things; for no kind of traffic</l>
<l>Would I admit; no name of magistrate;</l>
<l>Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,</l>
<l>And use of service, none; contract, succession,</l>
<l>Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;</l>
<l>No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;</l>
<l>No occupation; all men idle, all;</l>
<l>And women too, but innocent and pure;</l>
<l>No sovereignty;--</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>Yet he would be king on't.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the</l>
<l>beginning.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<l>All things in common nature should produce</l>
<l>Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,</l>
<l>Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,</l>
<l>Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,</l>
<l>Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,</l>
<l>To feed my innocent people.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>No marrying 'mong his subjects?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<l>I would with such perfection govern, sir,</l>
<l>To excel the golden age.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>God save his majesty!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>Long live Gonzalo!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<l>And,--do you mark me, sir?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<l>Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<l>I do well believe your highness; and</l>
<l>did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen,</l>
<l>who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that</l>
<l>they always use to laugh at nothing.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>'Twas you we laughed at.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<l>Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing</l>
<l>to you: so you may continue and laugh at</l>
<l>nothing still.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>What a blow was there given!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>An it had not fallen flat-long.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<l>You are gentlemen of brave metal; you would lift</l>
<l>the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue</l>
<l>in it five weeks without changing.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Enter ARIEL, invisible, playing solemn music</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>Nay, good my lord, be not angry.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<l>No, I warrant you; I will not adventure</l>
<l>my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh</l>
<l>me asleep, for I am very heavy?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>Go sleep, and hear us.</l>
</sp>
<stage>All sleep except ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<l>What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes</l>
<l>Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find</l>
<l>They are inclined to do so.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>Please you, sir,</l>
<l>Do not omit the heavy offer of it:</l>
<l>It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,</l>
<l>It is a comforter.</l>
</sp>

<l>We two, my lord,</l>

<l>Thank you. Wondrous heavy.</l>
</sp>
<stage>ALONSO sleeps. Exit ARIEL</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>What a strange drowsiness possesses them!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>It is the quality o' the climate.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>Why</l>
<l>Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not</l>
<l>Myself disposed to sleep.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>Nor I; my spirits are nimble.</l>
<l>They fell together all, as by consent;</l>
<l>They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,</l>
<l>Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:--</l>
<l>And yet me thinks I see it in thy face,</l>
<l>What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and</l>
<l>My strong imagination sees a crown</l>
<l>Dropping upon thy head.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>What, art thou waking?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>Do you not hear me speak?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>I do; and surely</l>
<l>It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st</l>
<l>Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?</l>
<l>This is a strange repose, to be asleep</l>
<l>With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,</l>
<l>And yet so fast asleep.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>Noble Sebastian,</l>
<l>Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'st</l>
<l>Whiles thou art waking.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>Thou dost snore distinctly;</l>
<l>There's meaning in thy snores.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>I am more serious than my custom: you</l>
<l>Must be so too, if heed me; which to do</l>
<l>Trebles thee o'er.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>Well, I am standing water.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>I'll teach you how to flow.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>Do so: to ebb</l>
<l>Hereditary sloth instructs me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>O,</l>
<l>If you but knew how you the purpose cherish</l>
<l>Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,</l>
<l>You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,</l>
<l>Most often do so near the bottom run</l>
<l>By their own fear or sloth.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>Prithee, say on:</l>
<l>The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim</l>
<l>A matter from thee, and a birth indeed</l>
<l>Which throes thee much to yield.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>Thus, sir:</l>
<l>Although this lord of weak remembrance, this,</l>
<l>Who shall be of as little memory</l>
<l>When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuade,--</l>
<l>For he's a spirit of persuasion, only</l>
<l>Professes to persuade,--the king his son's alive,</l>
<l>'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd</l>
<l>And he that sleeps here swims.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>I have no hope</l>
<l>That he's undrown'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>O, out of that 'no hope'</l>
<l>What great hope have you! no hope that way is</l>
<l>Another way so high a hope that even</l>
<l>Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,</l>
<l>But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me</l>
<l>That Ferdinand is drown'd?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>He's gone.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>Then, tell me,</l>
<l>Who's the next heir of Naples?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>Claribel.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells</l>
<l>Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from Naples</l>
<l>Can have no note, unless the sun were post--</l>
<l>The man i' the moon's too slow--till new-born chins</l>
<l>Be rough and razorable; she that--from whom?</l>
<l>We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again,</l>
<l>And by that destiny to perform an act</l>
<l>Whereof what's past is prologue, what to come</l>
<l>In yours and my discharge.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>What stuff is this! how say you?</l>
<l>'Tis true, my brother's daughter's queen of Tunis;</l>
<l>So is she heir of Naples; 'twixt which regions</l>
<l>There is some space.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>A space whose every cubit</l>
<l>Seems to cry out, 'How shall that Claribel</l>
<l>Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,</l>
<l>And let Sebastian wake.' Say, this were death</l>
<l>That now hath seized them; why, they were no worse</l>
<l>Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples</l>
<l>As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate</l>
<l>As amply and unnecessarily</l>
<l>As this Gonzalo; I myself could make</l>
<l>A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore</l>
<l>The mind that I do! what a sleep were this</l>
<l>For your advancement! Do you understand me?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>Methinks I do.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>And how does your content</l>
<l>Tender your own good fortune?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>I remember</l>
<l>You did supplant your brother Prospero.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>True:</l>
<l>And look how well my garments sit upon me;</l>
<l>Much feater than before: my brother's servants</l>
<l>Were then my fellows; now they are my men.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>But, for your conscience?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>Ay, sir; where lies that? if 'twere a kibe,</l>
<l>'Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not</l>
<l>This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,</l>
<l>That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be they</l>
<l>And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,</l>
<l>No better than the earth he lies upon,</l>
<l>If he were that which now he's like, that's dead;</l>
<l>Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,</l>
<l>Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,</l>
<l>To the perpetual wink for aye might put</l>
<l>This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who</l>
<l>Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,</l>
<l>They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;</l>
<l>They'll tell the clock to any business that</l>
<l>We say befits the hour.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>Thy case, dear friend,</l>
<l>Shall be my precedent; as thou got'st Milan,</l>
<l>I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke</l>
<l>Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest;</l>

<l>Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but</l>

<l>Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me</l>

<l>as once I was, and had but this fish painted,</l>
<l>not a holiday fool there but would give a piece</l>

<l>The master, the swabber, the boatswain and I,</l>
<l>The gunner and his mate</l>
<l>Loved Mall, Meg and Marian and Margery,</l>
<l>But none of us cared for Kate;</l>
<l>For she had a tongue with a tang,</l>
<l>Would cry to a sailor, Go hang!</l>
<l>She loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch,</l>
<l>Yet a tailor might scratch her where'er she did itch:</l>
<l>Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!</l>
<l>This is a scurvy tune too: but here's my comfort.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<l>What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do you put</l>
<l>tricks upon's with savages and men of Ind, ha? I</l>
<l>have not scaped drowning to be afeard now of your</l>
<l>four legs; for it hath been said, As proper a man as</l>
<l>ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground;</l>
<l>and it shall be said so again while Stephano</l>
<l>breathes at's nostrils.</l>

<speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<l>The spirit torments me; Oh!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<l>This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who</l>
<l>hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil</l>
<l>should he learn our language? I will give him some</l>
<l>relief, if it be but for that. if I can recover him</l>
<l>and keep him tame and get to Naples with him, he's a</l>
<l>present for any emperor that ever trod on neat's leather.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<l>Do not torment me, prithee; I'll bring my wood home faster.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<l>He's in his fit now and does not talk after the</l>
<l>wisest. He shall taste of my bottle: if he have</l>
<l>never drunk wine afore will go near to remove his</l>
<l>fit. If I can recover him and keep him tame, I will</l>
<l>not take too much for him; he shall pay for him that</l>
<l>hath him, and that soundly.</l>

<speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<l>Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon, I</l>

<sp>
<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<l>Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is that</l>
<l>which will give language to you, cat: open your</l>
<l>mouth; this will shake your shaking, I can tell you,</l>
<l>and that soundly: you cannot tell who's your friend:</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<l>Four legs and two voices: a most delicate monster!</l>
<l>His forward voice now is to speak well of his</l>
<l>friend; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches</l>
<l>and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle will</l>
<l>recover him, I will help his ague. Come. Amen! I</l>
<l>will pour some in thy other mouth.</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<l>Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me and</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<l>If thou beest Trinculo, come forth: I'll pull thee</l>

<l>these are they. Thou art very Trinculo indeed! How</l>
<l>camest thou to be the siege of this moon-calf? can</l>
<l>he vent Trinculos?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<l>I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke. But</l>
<l>art thou not drowned, Stephano? I hope now thou art</l>
<l>not drowned. Is the storm overblown? I hid me</l>
<l>under the dead moon-calf's gaberdine for fear of</l>
<l>the storm. And art thou living, Stephano? O</l>
<l>Stephano, two Neapolitans 'scaped!</l>

<l>How didst thou 'scape? How camest thou hither?</l>
<l>swear by this bottle how thou camest hither. I</l>
<l>escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors</l>

<l>I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee:</l>

<l>By this good light, this is a very shallow monster!</l>

<l>Come on then; down, and swear.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<l>I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed</l>
<l>monster. A most scurvy monster! I could find in my</l>

<sp>
<speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<l>There be some sports are painful, and their labour</l>
<l>Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness</l>
<l>Are nobly undergone and most poor matters</l>
<l>Point to rich ends. This my mean task</l>
<l>Would be as heavy to me as odious, but</l>
<l>The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead</l>
<l>And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is</l>
<l>Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed,</l>
<l>And he's composed of harshness. I must remove</l>
<l>Some thousands of these logs and pile them up,</l>
<l>Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress</l>
<l>Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness</l>
<l>Had never like executor. I forget:</l>
<l>But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,</l>
<l>Most busy lest, when I do it.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<l>Alas, now, pray you,</l>

<l>Pray, set it down and rest you: when this burns,</l>

<l>If you'll sit down,</l>

<l>I'll carry it to the pile.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<l>No, precious creature;</l>
<l>I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,</l>
<l>Than you should such dishonour undergo,</l>
<l>While I sit lazy by.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<l>It would become me</l>

<speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<l>No, noble mistress;'tis fresh morning with me</l>
<l>When you are by at night. I do beseech you--</l>
<l>Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers--</l>
<l>What is your name?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<l>Miranda.--O my father,</l>
<l>I have broke your hest to say so!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<l>Admired Miranda!</l>
<l>Indeed the top of admiration! worth</l>
<l>What's dearest to the world! Full many a lady</l>
<l>I have eyed with best regard and many a time</l>
<l>The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage</l>
<l>Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues</l>
<l>Have I liked several women; never any</l>
<l>With so fun soul, but some defect in her</l>
<l>Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed</l>
<l>And put it to the foil: but you, O you,</l>
<l>So perfect and so peerless, are created</l>
<l>Of every creature's best!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<l>I do not know</l>
<l>One of my sex; no woman's face remember,</l>
<l>Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen</l>
<l>More that I may call men than you, good friend,</l>
<l>And my dear father: how features are abroad,</l>
<l>I am skilless of; but, by my modesty,</l>
<l>The jewel in my dower, I would not wish</l>
<l>Any companion in the world but you,</l>
<l>Nor can imagination form a shape,</l>
<l>Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle</l>
<l>Something too wildly and my father's precepts</l>
<l>I therein do forget.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<l>I am in my condition</l>
<l>A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king;</l>
<l>I would, not so!--and would no more endure</l>
<l>This wooden slavery than to suffer</l>
<l>The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:</l>
<l>The very instant that I saw you, did</l>
<l>My heart fly to your service; there resides,</l>
<l>To make me slave to it; and for your sake</l>
<l>Am I this patient log--man.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<l>Do you love me?</l>

<l>O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound</l>
<l>And crown what I profess with kind event</l>
<l>If I speak true! if hollowly, invert</l>
<l>What best is boded me to mischief! I</l>
<l>Beyond all limit of what else i' the world</l>
<l>Do love, prize, honour you.</l>

<speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<l>Wherefore weep you?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<l>At mine unworthiness that dare not offer</l>
<l>What I desire to give, and much less take</l>
<l>What I shall die to want. But this is trifling;</l>
<l>And all the more it seeks to hide itself,</l>
<l>The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!</l>
<l>And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!</l>
<l>I am your wife, it you will marry me;</l>
<l>If not, I'll die your maid: to be your fellow</l>
<l>You may deny me; but I'll be your servant,</l>
<l>Whether you will or no.</l>

<l>Thou liest.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<l>Do I so? take thou that.</l>
<stage>Beats TRINCULO</stage>
<l>As you like this, give me the lie another time.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<l>I did not give the lie. Out o' your</l>
<l>wits and bearing too? A pox o' your bottle!</l>
<l>this can sack and drinking do. A murrain on</l>
<l>your monster, and the devil take your fingers!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<l>Ha, ha, ha!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<l>Now, forward with your tale. Prithee, stand farther</l>
<l>off.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<l>Beat him enough: after a little time</l>
<l>I'll beat him too.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<l>Stand farther. Come, proceed.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<l>Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him,</l>
<l>I' th' afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,</l>
<l>Having first seized his books, or with a log</l>
<l>Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,</l>
<l>Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember</l>
<l>First to possess his books; for without them</l>
<l>He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not</l>
<l>One spirit to command: they all do hate him</l>
<l>As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.</l>
<l>He has brave utensils,--for so he calls them--</l>
<l>Which when he has a house, he'll deck withal</l>
<l>And that most deeply to consider is</l>
<l>The beauty of his daughter; he himself</l>
<l>Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman,</l>
<l>But only Sycorax my dam and she;</l>
<l>But she as far surpasseth Sycorax</l>
<l>As great'st does least.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<l>Is it so brave a lass?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<l>Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant.</l>
<l>And bring thee forth brave brood.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<l>Monster, I will kill this man: his daughter and I</l>
<l>will be king and queen--save our graces!--and</l>
<l>Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou</l>
<l>like the plot, Trinculo?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<l>Excellent.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<l>Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee; but,</l>
<l>while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<l>Within this half hour will he be asleep:</l>
<l>Wilt thou destroy him then?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<l>Ay, on mine honour.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<l>This will I tell my master.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<l>Thou makest me merry; I am full of pleasure:</l>
<l>Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch</l>
<l>You taught me but while-ere?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<l>At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any</l>
<l>reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.</l>
<stage>Sings</stage>
<l>Flout 'em and scout 'em</l>
<l>And scout 'em and flout 'em</l>
<l>Thought is free.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<l>That's not the tune.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Ariel plays the tune on a tabour and pipe</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<l>What is this same?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<l>This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture</l>
<l>of Nobody.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<l>If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness:</l>
<l>if thou beest a devil, take't as thou list.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<l>O, forgive me my sins!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<l>He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy upon us!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<l>Art thou afeard?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<l>No, monster, not I.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<l>Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,</l>
<l>Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.</l>
<l>Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments</l>
<l>Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices</l>
<l>That, if I then had waked after long sleep,</l>
<l>Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,</l>
<l>The clouds methought would open and show riches</l>
<l>Ready to drop upon me that, when I waked,</l>
<l>I cried to dream again.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<l>This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall</l>
<l>have my music for nothing.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<l>When Prospero is destroyed.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<l>That shall be by and by: I remember the story.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<l>The sound is going away; let's follow it, and</l>
<l>after do our work.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<l>Lead, monster; we'll follow. I would I could see</l>
<l>this tabourer; he lays it on.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l>Wilt come? I'll follow, Stephano.</l>

<head type="sub">SCENE III. Another part of the island.</head>
<stage>Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<l>By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir;</l>
<l>My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed</l>
<l>Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,</l>
<l>I needs must rest me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<l>Old lord, I cannot blame thee,</l>
<l>Who am myself attach'd with weariness,</l>
<l>To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest.</l>
<l>Even here I will put off my hope and keep it</l>
<l>No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd</l>
<l>Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks</l>
<l>Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>
<stage>Aside to SEBASTIAN</stage>
I am right glad that he's so
</l>
<l>out of hope.</l>
<l>Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose</l>
<l>That you resolved to effect.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>
<stage>Aside to ANTONIO</stage>
The next advantage
</l>
<l>Will we take throughly.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>
<stage>Aside to SEBASTIAN</stage>
Let it be to-night;
</l>
<l>For, now they are oppress'd with travel, they</l>
<l>Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance</l>
<l>As when they are fresh.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>
<stage>Aside to ANTONIO</stage>
I say, to-night: no more.
</l>
</sp>
<stage>Solemn and strange music</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<l>What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<l>Marvellous sweet music!</l>
</sp>
<stage>Enter PROSPERO above, invisible. Enter several strange Shapes, bringing in a banquet; they dance about it with gentle actions of salutation; and, inviting the King, &amp;c. to eat, they depart</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<l>Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>A living drollery. Now I will believe</l>
<l>That there are unicorns, that in Arabia</l>
<l>There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix</l>
<l>At this hour reigning there.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>I'll believe both;</l>
<l>And what does else want credit, come to me,</l>
<l>And I'll be sworn 'tis true: travellers ne'er did</l>
<l>lie,</l>
<l>Though fools at home condemn 'em.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<l>If in Naples</l>
<l>I should report this now, would they believe me?</l>
<l>If I should say, I saw such islanders--</l>
<l>For, certes, these are people of the island--</l>
<l>Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,</l>
<l>Their manners are more gentle-kind than of</l>
<l>Our human generation you shall find</l>
<l>Many, nay, almost any.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>
<stage>Aside</stage>
Honest lord,
</l>
<l>Thou hast said well; for some of you there present</l>
<l>Are worse than devils.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<l>I cannot too much muse</l>
<l>Such shapes, such gesture and such sound, expressing,</l>
<l>Although they want the use of tongue, a kind</l>
<l>Of excellent dumb discourse.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>
<stage>Aside</stage>
Praise in departing.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FRANCISCO</speaker>
<l>They vanish'd strangely.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>No matter, since</l>
<l>They have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.</l>
<l>Will't please you taste of what is here?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<l>Not I.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<l>Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,</l>
<l>Who would believe that there were mountaineers</l>
<l>Dew-lapp'd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at 'em</l>
<l>Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men</l>
<l>Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find</l>
<l>Each putter-out of five for one will bring us</l>
<l>Good warrant of.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<l>I will stand to and feed,</l>
<l>Although my last: no matter, since I feel</l>
<l>The best is past. Brother, my lord the duke,</l>
<l>Stand to and do as we.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Thunder and lightning. Enter ARIEL, like a harpy; claps his wings upon the table; and, with a quaint device, the banquet vanishes</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<l>You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,</l>
<l>That hath to instrument this lower world</l>
<l>And what is in't, the never-surfeited sea</l>
<l>Hath caused to belch up you; and on this island</l>
<l>Where man doth not inhabit; you 'mongst men</l>
<l>Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;</l>
<l>And even with such-like valour men hang and drown</l>
<l>Their proper selves.</l>
<stage>ALONSO, SEBASTIAN &amp;c. draw their swords</stage>
<l>You fools! I and my fellows</l>
<l>Are ministers of Fate: the elements,</l>
<l>Of whom your swords are temper'd, may as well</l>
<l>Wound the loud winds, or with bemock'd-at stabs</l>
<l>Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish</l>
<l>One dowle that's in my plume: my fellow-ministers</l>
<l>Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,</l>
<l>Your swords are now too massy for your strengths</l>
<l>And will not be uplifted. But remember--</l>
<l>For that's my business to you--that you three</l>
<l>From Milan did supplant good Prospero;</l>
<l>Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,</l>
<l>Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed</l>
<l>The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have</l>
<l>Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,</l>
<l>Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,</l>
<l>They have bereft; and do pronounce by me:</l>
<l>Lingering perdition, worse than any death</l>
<l>Can be at once, shall step by step attend</l>
<l>You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from--</l>
<l>Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls</l>
<l>Upon your heads--is nothing but heart-sorrow</l>
<l>And a clear life ensuing.</l>
</sp>
<stage>He vanishes in thunder; then, to soft music enter the Shapes again, and dance, with mocks and mows, and carrying out the table</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou</l>
<l>Perform'd, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring:</l>
<l>Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated</l>
<l>In what thou hadst to say: so, with good life</l>
<l>And observation strange, my meaner ministers</l>
<l>Their several kinds have done. My high charms work</l>
<l>And these mine enemies are all knit up</l>
<l>In their distractions; they now are in my power;</l>
<l>And in these fits I leave them, while I visit</l>
<l>Young Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drown'd,</l>
<l>And his and mine loved darling.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Exit above</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<l>I' the name of something holy, sir, why stand you</l>
<l>In this strange stare?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<l>O, it is monstrous, monstrous:</l>
<l>Methought the billows spoke and told me of it;</l>
<l>The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder,</l>
<l>That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced</l>
<l>The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.</l>
<l>Therefore my son i' the ooze is bedded, and</l>
<l>I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded</l>
<l>And with him there lie mudded.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Exit</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>

<speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<l>All three of them are desperate: their great guilt,</l>
<l>Like poison given to work a great time after,</l>
<l>Now 'gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you</l>
<l>That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly</l>
<l>And hinder them from what this ecstasy</l>

<stage>Enter PROSPERO, FERDINAND, and MIRANDA</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>If I have too austerely punish'd you,</l>
<l>Your compensation makes amends, for I</l>
<l>Have given you here a third of mine own life,</l>
<l>Or that for which I live; who once again</l>
<l>I tender to thy hand: all thy vexations</l>
<l>Were but my trials of thy love and thou</l>
<l>Hast strangely stood the test here, afore Heaven,</l>
<l>I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,</l>
<l>Do not smile at me that I boast her off,</l>
<l>For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise</l>
<l>And make it halt behind her.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<l>I do believe it</l>
<l>Against an oracle.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>Then, as my gift and thine own acquisition</l>
<l>Worthily purchased take my daughter: but</l>
<l>If thou dost break her virgin-knot before</l>
<l>All sanctimonious ceremonies may</l>
<l>With full and holy rite be minister'd,</l>
<l>No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall</l>
<l>To make this contract grow: but barren hate,</l>
<l>Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew</l>
<l>The union of your bed with weeds so loathly</l>
<l>That you shall hate it both: therefore take heed,</l>
<l>As Hymen's lamps shall light you.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<l>As I hope</l>
<l>For quiet days, fair issue and long life,</l>
<l>With such love as 'tis now, the murkiest den,</l>

<l>Makes this place Paradise.</l>

<stage>Juno and Ceres whisper, and send Iris on employment</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>Sweet, now, silence!</l>
<l>Juno and Ceres whisper seriously;</l>
<l>There's something else to do: hush, and be mute,</l>
<l>Or else our spell is marr'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>IRIS</speaker>
<l>You nymphs, call'd Naiads, of the windring brooks,</l>
<l>With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks,</l>
<l>Leave your crisp channels and on this green land</l>
<l>Answer your summons; Juno does command:</l>
<l>Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate</l>
<l>A contract of true love; be not too late.</l>
<stage>Enter certain Nymphs</stage>
<l>You sunburnt sicklemen, of August weary,</l>
<l>Come hither from the furrow and be merry:</l>
<l>Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on</l>
<l>And these fresh nymphs encounter every one</l>
<l>In country footing.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Enter certain Reapers, properly habited: they join with the Nymphs in a graceful dance; towards the end whereof PROSPERO starts suddenly, and speaks; after which, to a strange, hollow, and confused noise, they heavily vanish</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>
<stage>Aside</stage>
I had forgot that foul conspiracy
</l>
<l>Of the beast Caliban and his confederates</l>
<l>Against my life: the minute of their plot</l>
<l>Is almost come.</l>
<stage>To the Spirits</stage>
<l>Well done! avoid; no more!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<l>This is strange: your father's in some passion</l>
<l>That works him strongly.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<l>Never till this day</l>
<l>Saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>You do look, my son, in a moved sort,</l>
<l>As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir.</l>
<l>Our revels now are ended. These our actors,</l>
<l>As I foretold you, were all spirits and</l>
<l>Are melted into air, into thin air:</l>
<l>And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,</l>
<l>The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,</l>
<l>The solemn temples, the great globe itself,</l>
<l>Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve</l>
<l>And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,</l>
<l>Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff</l>
<l>As dreams are made on, and our little life</l>
<l>Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex'd;</l>
<l>Bear with my weakness; my, brain is troubled:</l>
<l>Be not disturb'd with my infirmity:</l>
<l>If you be pleased, retire into my cell</l>
<l>And there repose: a turn or two I'll walk,</l>
<l>To still my beating mind.</l>

<l>Spirit,</l>
<l>We must prepare to meet with Caliban.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<l>Ay, my commander: when I presented Ceres,</l>
<l>I thought to have told thee of it, but I fear'd</l>
<l>Lest I might anger thee.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<l>I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking;</l>
<l>So fun of valour that they smote the air</l>
<l>For breathing in their faces; beat the ground</l>
<l>For kissing of their feet; yet always bending</l>
<l>Towards their project. Then I beat my tabour;</l>
<l>At which, like unback'd colts, they prick'd</l>
<l>their ears,</l>
<l>Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses</l>
<l>As they smelt music: so I charm'd their ears</l>
<l>That calf-like they my lowing follow'd through</l>
<l>Tooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns,</l>
<l>Which entered their frail shins: at last I left them</l>
<l>I' the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,</l>
<l>There dancing up to the chins, that the foul lake</l>
<l>O'erstunk their feet.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>This was well done, my bird.</l>
<l>Thy shape invisible retain thou still:</l>

<sp>
<speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<l>Monster, I do smell all horse-piss; at</l>
<l>which my nose is in great indignation.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<l>So is mine. Do you hear, monster? If I should take</l>
<l>a displeasure against you, look you,--</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<l>Thou wert but a lost monster.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<l>Good my lord, give me thy favour still.</l>
<l>Be patient, for the prize I'll bring thee to</l>
<l>Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly.</l>
<l>All's hush'd as midnight yet.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<l>Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool,--</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<l>There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that,</l>
<l>monster, but an infinite loss.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<l>That's more to me than my wetting: yet this is your</l>
<l>harmless fairy, monster.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<l>I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er ears</l>
<l>for my labour.</l>

<speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<l>Prithee, my king, be quiet. Seest thou here,</l>
<l>This is the mouth o' the cell: no noise, and enter.</l>
<l>Do that good mischief which may make this island</l>
<l>Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban,</l>
<l>For aye thy foot-licker.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<l>Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody thoughts.</l>

<l>O king Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano! look</l>

<l>Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.</l>

<l>Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I'll have</l>
<l>that gown.</l>

<l>Thy grace shall have it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<l>The dropsy drown this fool I what do you mean</l>
<l>To dote thus on such luggage? Let's alone</l>
<l>And do the murder first: if he awake,</l>
<l>From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches,</l>
<l>Make us strange stuff.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<l>Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line,</l>
<l>is not this my jerkin? Now is the jerkin under</l>
<l>the line: now, jerkin, you are like to lose your</l>
<l>hair and prove a bald jerkin.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<l>Do, do: we steal by line and level, an't like your grace.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<l>I thank thee for that jest; here's a garment for't:</l>
<l>wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this</l>
<l>country. 'Steal by line and level' is an excellent</l>
<l>pass of pate; there's another garment for't.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<l>Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers, and</l>
<l>away with the rest.</l>
</sp>

<speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<l>I will have none on't: we shall lose our time,</l>

<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>

<stage>Enter PROSPERO in his magic robes, and ARIEL</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>Now does my project gather to a head:</l>
<l>My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and time</l>
<l>Goes upright with his carriage. How's the day?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<l>On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,</l>
<l>You said our work should cease.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>I did say so,</l>
<l>When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,</l>
<l>How fares the king and's followers?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<l>Confined together</l>
<l>In the same fashion as you gave in charge,</l>
<l>Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,</l>
<l>In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;</l>
<l>They cannot budge till your release. The king,</l>
<l>His brother and yours, abide all three distracted</l>
<l>And the remainder mourning over them,</l>
<l>Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly</l>
<l>Him that you term'd, sir, 'The good old lord Gonzalo;'</l>
<l>His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops</l>
<l>From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works 'em</l>
<l>That if you now beheld them, your affections</l>
<l>Would become tender.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>Dost thou think so, spirit?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<l>Mine would, sir, were I human.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>And mine shall.</l>
<l>Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling</l>
<l>Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,</l>
<l>One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,</l>
<l>Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?</l>
<l>Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,</l>
<l>Yet with my nobler reason 'gaitist my fury</l>
<l>Do I take part: the rarer action is</l>
<l>In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,</l>
<l>The sole drift of my purpose doth extend</l>
<l>Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel:</l>
<l>My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore,</l>
<l>And they shall be themselves.</l>

<l>Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,</l>
<l>And ye that on the sands with printless foot</l>
<l>Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him</l>
<l>When he comes back; you demi-puppets that</l>
<l>By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,</l>
<l>Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime</l>
<l>Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice</l>
<l>To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,</l>
<l>Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'd</l>
<l>The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,</l>
<l>And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault</l>
<l>Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder</l>
<l>Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak</l>
<l>With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory</l>
<l>Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up</l>
<l>The pine and cedar: graves at my command</l>
<l>Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forth</l>
<l>By my so potent art. But this rough magic</l>
<l>I here abjure, and, when I have required</l>
<l>Some heavenly music, which even now I do,</l>
<l>To work mine end upon their senses that</l>
<l>This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,</l>
<l>Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,</l>
<l>And deeper than did ever plummet sound</l>

<stage>Solemn music</stage>
<stage>Re-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO, with a frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO; SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner, attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO they all enter the circle which PROSPERO had made, and there stand charmed; which PROSPERO observing, speaks:</stage>
<l>A solemn air and the best comforter</l>
<l>To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,</l>
<l>Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,</l>
<l>For you are spell-stopp'd.</l>
<l>Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,</l>
<l>Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,</l>
<l>Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,</l>
<l>And as the morning steals upon the night,</l>
<l>Melting the darkness, so their rising senses</l>
<l>Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle</l>
<l>Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,</l>
<l>My true preserver, and a loyal sir</l>
<l>To him you follow'st! I will pay thy graces</l>
<l>Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly</l>

<l>Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,</l>
<l>Would here have kill'd your king; I do forgive thee,</l>

<l>My dear son Ferdinand.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>I am woe for't, sir.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<l>Irreparable is the loss, and patience</l>
<l>Says it is past her cure.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>I rather think</l>
<l>You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace</l>
<l>For the like loss I have her sovereign aid</l>
<l>And rest myself content.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<l>You the like loss!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>As great to me as late; and, supportable</l>
<l>To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker</l>
<l>Than you may call to comfort you, for I</l>

<l>O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,</l>

<l>Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>In this last tempest. I perceive these lords</l>
<l>At this encounter do so much admire</l>
<l>That they devour their reason and scarce think</l>
<l>Their eyes do offices of truth, their words</l>
<l>Are natural breath: but, howsoe'er you have</l>
<l>Been justled from your senses, know for certain</l>
<l>That I am Prospero and that very duke</l>
<l>Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely</l>
<l>Upon this shore, where you were wreck'd, was landed,</l>
<l>To be the lord on't. No more yet of this;</l>
<l>For 'tis a chronicle of day by day,</l>
<l>Not a relation for a breakfast nor</l>
<l>Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir;</l>
<l>This cell's my court: here have I few attendants</l>
<l>And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.</l>
<l>My dukedom since you have given me again,</l>
<l>I will requite you with as good a thing;</l>
<l>At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye</l>
<l>As much as me my dukedom.</l>

</sp>
<stage>Kneels</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<l>Now all the blessings</l>
<l>Of a glad father compass thee about!</l>
<l>Arise, and say how thou camest here.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<l>O, wonder!</l>
<l>How many goodly creatures are there here!</l>
<l>How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,</l>
   <pb n="18" facs="pageImages/018.png"/>
<l>That has such people in't!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>'Tis new to thee.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<l>What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?</l>
<l>Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours:</l>
<l>Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us,</l>
<l>And brought us thus together?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<l>Sir, she is mortal;</l>
<l>But by immortal Providence she's mine:</l>
<l>I chose her when I could not ask my father</l>
<l>For his advice, nor thought I had one. She</l>
<l>Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,</l>
<l>Of whom so often I have heard renown,</l>
<l>But never saw before; of whom I have</l>
<l>Received a second life; and second father</l>
<l>This lady makes him to me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<l>I am hers:</l>
<l>But, O, how oddly will it sound that I</l>
<l>Must ask my child forgiveness!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>There, sir, stop:</l>
<l>Let us not burthen our remembrance with</l>
<l>A heaviness that's gone.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<l>I have inly wept,</l>
<l>Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you god,</l>
<l>And on this couple drop a blessed crown!</l>
<l>For it is you that have chalk'd forth the way</l>
<l>Which brought us hither.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<l>I say, Amen, Gonzalo!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<l>Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue</l>
<l>Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice</l>
<l>Beyond a common joy, and set it down</l>
<l>With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage</l>
<l>Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,</l>
<l>And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife</l>
<l>Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom</l>
<l>In a poor isle and all of us ourselves</l>
<l>When no man was his own.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<l>
<stage>To FERDINAND and MIRANDA</stage>
Give me your hands:
</l>
<l>Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart</l>
<l>That doth not wish you joy!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<l>Be it so! Amen!</l>
<stage>Re-enter ARIEL, with the Master and Boatswain amazedly following</stage>
<l>O, look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us:</l>
<l>I prophesied, if a gallows were on land,</l>
<l>This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,</l>
<l>That swear'st grace o'erboard, not an oath on shore?</l>
<l>Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Boatswain</speaker>
<l>The best news is, that we have safely found</l>
<l>Our king and company; the next, our ship--</l>
<l>Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split--</l>
<l>Is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as when</l>
<l>We first put out to sea.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<l>
<stage>Aside to PROSPERO</stage>
Sir, all this service
</l>
<l>Have I done since I went.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>
<stage>Aside to ARIEL</stage>
My tricksy spirit!
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<l>These are not natural events; they strengthen</l>
<l>From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Boatswain</speaker>
<l>If I did think, sir, I were well awake,</l>
<l>I'ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,</l>
<l>And--how we know not--all clapp'd under hatches;</l>
<l>Where but even now with strange and several noises</l>
<l>Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,</l>
<l>And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,</l>
<l>We were awaked; straightway, at liberty;</l>
<l>Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld</l>
<l>Our royal, good and gallant ship, our master</l>
<l>Capering to eye her: on a trice, so please you,</l>
<l>Even in a dream, were we divided from them</l>
<l>And were brought moping hither.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<l>
<stage>Aside to PROSPERO</stage>
Was't well done?
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>
<stage>Aside to ARIEL</stage>
Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.
</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<l>This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod</l>
<l>And there is in this business more than nature</l>
<l>Was ever conduct of: some oracle</l>
<l>Must rectify our knowledge.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>Sir, my liege,</l>
<l>Do not infest your mind with beating on</l>
<l>The strangeness of this business; at pick'd leisure</l>
<l>Which shall be shortly, single I'll resolve you,</l>
<l>Which to you shall seem probable, of every</l>
<l>These happen'd accidents; till when, be cheerful</l>
<l>And think of each thing well.</l>
<stage>Aside to ARIEL</stage>
<l>Come hither, spirit:</l>
<l>Set Caliban and his companions free;</l>
<l>Untie the spell.</l>
<stage>Exit ARIEL</stage>
<l>How fares my gracious sir?</l>
<l>There are yet missing of your company</l>
<l>Some few odd lads that you remember not.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Re-enter ARIEL, driving in CALIBAN, STEPHANO and TRINCULO, in their stolen apparel</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<l>Every man shift for all the rest, and</l>
<l>let no man take care for himself; for all is</l>
<l>but fortune. Coragio, bully-monster, coragio!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<l>If these be true spies which I wear in my head,</l>
<l>here's a goodly sight.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<l>O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!</l>
<l>How fine my master is! I am afraid</l>
<l>He will chastise me.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>Ha, ha!</l>
<l>What things are these, my lord Antonio?</l>
<l>Will money buy 'em?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<l>Very like; one of them</l>
<l>Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,</l>
<l>Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave,</l>
<l>His mother was a witch, and one so strong</l>
<l>That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,</l>
<l>And deal in her command without her power.</l>
<l>These three have robb'd me; and this demi-devil--</l>
<l>For he's a bastard one--had plotted with them</l>
<l>To take my life. Two of these fellows you</l>
<l>Must know and own; this thing of darkness!</l>
<l>Acknowledge mine.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<l>I shall be pinch'd to death.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<l>Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>He is drunk now: where had he wine?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<l>And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they</l>
<l>Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em?</l>
<l>How camest thou in this pickle?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<l>I have been in such a pickle since I</l>
<l>saw you last that, I fear me, will never out of</l>
<l>my bones: I shall not fear fly-blowing.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>Why, how now, Stephano!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<l>O, touch me not; I am not Stephano, but a cramp.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>You'ld be king o' the isle, sirrah?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<l>I should have been a sore one then.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<l>This is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Pointing to Caliban</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>He is as disproportion'd in his manners</l>
<l>As in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell;</l>
<l>Take with you your companions; as you look</l>
<l>To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<l>Ay, that I will; and I'll be wise hereafter</l>
   <pb n="19" facs="pageImages/019.png"/>
<l>And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass</l>
<l>Was I, to take this drunkard for a god</l>
<l>And worship this dull fool!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>Go to; away!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<l>Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<l>Or stole it, rather.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Exeunt CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>Sir, I invite your highness and your train</l>
<l>To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest</l>
<l>For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste</l>
<l>With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it</l>
<l>Go quick away; the story of my life</l>
<l>And the particular accidents gone by</l>
<l>Since I came to this isle: and in the morn</l>
<l>I'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples,</l>
<l>Where I have hope to see the nuptial</l>
<l>Of these our dear-beloved solemnized;</l>
<l>And thence retire me to my Milan, where</l>
<l>Every third thought shall be my grave.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<l>I long</l>
<l>To hear the story of your life, which must</l>
<l>Take the ear strangely.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<l>I'll deliver all;</l>
<l>And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales</l>
<l>And sail so expeditious that shall catch</l>
<l>Your royal fleet far off.</l>
<stage>Aside to ARIEL</stage>
<l>My Ariel, chick,</l>
<l>That is thy charge: then to the elements</l>
<l>Be free, and fare thou well! Please you, draw near.</l>

<sp>
<speaker>[PROSPERO]</speaker>
<l>Now my charms are all o'erthrown,</l>
<l>And what strength I have's mine own,</l>
<l>Which is most faint: now, 'tis true,</l>
<l>I must be here confined by you,</l>
<l>Or sent to Naples. Let me not,</l>
<l>Since I have my dukedom got</l>
<l>And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell</l>
<l>In this bare island by your spell;</l>
<l>But release me from my bands</l>
<l>With the help of your good hands:</l>
<l>Gentle breath of yours my sails</l>
<l>Must fill, or else my project fails,</l>
<l>Which was to please. Now I want</l>
<l>Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,</l>
<l>And my ending is despair,</l>
<l>Unless I be relieved by prayer,</l>
<l>Which pierces so that it assaults</l>
<l>Mercy itself and frees all faults.</l>
<l>As you from crimes would pardon'd be,</l>
<l>Let your indulgence set me free.</l>
