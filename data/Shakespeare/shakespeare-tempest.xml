                  Island</ref><note xml:id="island" target="island_" resp="editors.xml#TH">During
                  the early modern period, knowledge of the world was expanding greatly. It is
                  likely, given the plot of the tale, that the fictional Island Prospero is stranded
                  on is somewhere in the Mediterranean sea. Throughout the play, you will note
                  references to many places across the globe, including Tunisia, Algeria, the Island
                  of Bermuda, and "Arabia." By 1611, when <hi rend="italic">The Tempest</hi> was
                  first performed, England had established colonies in the Americas; the Spanish and
                  Portuguese were the most powerful imperial force in Western Europe, until the 1588
                  defeat of the Spanish Armada, which marked the rise of the early British Empire.
                  The 16th and 17th centuries are often thought of as an age of exploration;
                  explorers traveled the world, bringing back strange objects and stories to spur
                  scientific discovery and commerce, including the traffic in human beings. People
                  during Shakespeare’s time lived during an era that also saw the wide dissemination
                  of maps helped by the invention of the printing press. Through cartography, people
                  could visually comprehend the geographical layout of lands familiar and new. To
                  learn more about exploration and map-making in the early modern period, see the

                     essentially a long wooden box balanced like a seesaw, containing a large cannon
                     ball that when rolled around produced a loud noise resembling thunder. To
                     create the effect of lightening, stage hands would prepare powdered resin which
                     would be thrown onto a flame. Lighting a firecracker attached to a wire
                     extending from the roof of the stage to the floor would create the illusion of

                        devoid of any habitation by indigenous groups before it was discovered by
                        accident by the Spanish sailor Juan Bermúdez in 1503. A flotilla from
                        England, includng the Sea Venture, was shipwrecked here on their way to
                        restock the Jamestown Colony in Virginia (Virginia was named after Elizabeth
                        I, the "Virgin Queen," and Jamestown, after King James I). The wreck of the
                        Sea Venture in 1609, is thought to be a contemporary inspiration for <hi
                           rend="italic">The Tempest</hi>. After almost a year, the crew was largely
                        able to leave the Island with ships they built during that time. The Island
                        wasn’t colonized until the seventeenth century, after the crew of the Sea
                        Venture returned to England with their tale. Enslaved people were first
                        brought to the Island in 1617. The image included here shows a 17th century

                     chief sea port of Algeria in North Africa, on the Mediterranean coast.
                     Invaded throughout its history, Algiers rose to prominence under the Berber
                     dynasties in the 10th century. Algiers became became home to many Muslim and
                     Jewish refugees escaping Spain in the begining of the 16th century. At the
                     time <hi rend="italic">The Tempest</hi> was written, Algiers was under
                     Ottoman rule, and it became associated with piracy (<ref>Britannica</ref>).

                        may be a reference to the sea creatures that were often depicted in the
                        oceans of early modern maps. While in earlier periods, when little was known
                        about the shapes of land masses, these sea creatures were signs of danger
                        and the unknown; however, by the late 16th and 17th centuries, sea travel
                        and exploration was on the rise, and this led to more and more complete
                        maps. As the unknown declined, so too did representationos of sea monsters.
                        They transitioned into less threatening and more whimsical fish or whales,
                        and in the modern world, they all but disappeared cartographically. To learn

                           plans to use his magic to create the fantastic entertainment of a masque
                           for the young couple. According to <ref
                              target="https://www.hrp.org.uk/banqueting-house/history-and-stories/the-masque/"
                              >material hosted by the Royal Historic Palaces</ref>, masques were
                           elaborate court entertainments staged for and often by nobility. They
                           involved a variety of performance types--ballet, opera, music, and
                           theater--combined in a highly visual and stylized manner. By the early
                           17th century, when Shakespeare wrote and performed The Tempest, they had
                           become highly elaborate. The Royal Banqueting House, designed by Inigo
                           Jones and completed in 1622, was purpose-built for the staging of
                           masques. The most popular early court masques were developed by Jones in
                           partnership with Ben Jonson.</p>
                        <p> Thematically, masques represented and reinforced the divinity of the
                           monarchy and symbolized a world of order in opposition to the baseness
                           and disorder that reigned before the emergence of the Stuart Court. In
                           The Tempest, Prospero conjures the masque as a gift for the young couple,
                           Miranda and Ferdinand, who will marry upon their return to Naples and
                           return order to the throne. This masque, like all masques, then, is a
                           statement of political power. </p>

                           fiery spirit--this character, like the nymphs and reapers in Prospero’s
                           masque, would likely have been a dancing role rather than a more
                           important speaking role. </p>

                  epilogue serves as a conclusionary poem or speech to a play, with the main purpose
                  of tying up the many subplots and providing some closure for the characters at the
                  end of the tale. It is usually performed in the form of a monologue in which
                  applause is sought, addressed directly to the audience.</note>
