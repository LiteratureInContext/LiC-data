<l n="22">That never set a squadron in the field,</l>
<l n="23">Nor the division of a battle knows</l>
<l n="24">More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,</l>
<l n="25">Wherein the toged consuls can propose</l>
<l n="26">As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,</l>
<l n="27">Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:</l>
<l n="28">And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof</l>
<l n="29">At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds</l>
<l n="30">Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd</l>
<l n="31">By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,</l>
<l n="32">He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,</l>
<l n="33">And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<l n="34">By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="35">Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,</l>
<l n="36">Preferment goes by letter and affection,</l>
<l n="37">And not by old gradation, where each second</l>
<l n="38">Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself</l>
<l n="39">Whether I in any just term am affined</l>
<l>To love the Moor.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<l n="40">I would not follow him then.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="41">O, sir, content you;</l>
<l n="42">I follow him to serve my turn upon him:</l>
<l n="43">We cannot all be masters, nor all masters</l>
<l n="44">Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark</l>
<l n="45">Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,</l>
<l n="46">That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,</l>
<l n="47">Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,</l>
<l n="48">For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:</l>
<l n="49">Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are</l>
<l n="50">Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,</l>
<l n="51">Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,</l>
<l n="52">And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,</l>
<l n="53">Do well thrive by them and when they have lined</l>
<l>their coats</l>
<l n="54">Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;</l>
<l n="55">And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,</l>
<l n="56">It is as sure as you are Roderigo,</l>
<l n="57">Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:</l>
<l n="58">In following him, I follow but myself;</l>
<l n="59">Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,</l>
<l n="60">But seeming so, for my peculiar end:</l>
<l n="61">For when my outward action doth demonstrate</l>
<l n="62">The native act and figure of my heart</l>
<l n="63">In compliment extern, 'tis not long after</l>
<l n="64">But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve</l>
<l n="65">For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.</l>

<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="76">Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,</l>
<l n="77">My very noble and approved good masters,</l>
<l n="78">That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,</l>
<l n="79">It is most true; true, I have married her:</l>
<l n="80">The very head and front of my offending</l>
<l n="81">Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,</l>
<l n="82">And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:</l>
<l n="83">For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,</l>
<l n="84">Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used</l>
<l n="85">Their dearest action in the tented field,</l>
<l n="86">And little of this great world can I speak,</l>
<l n="87">More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,</l>
<l n="88">And therefore little shall I grace my cause</l>
<l n="89">In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,</l>
<l n="90">I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver</l>
<l n="91">Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,</l>
<l n="92">What conjuration and what mighty magic,</l>
<l n="93">For such proceeding I am charged withal,</l>
<l n="94">I won his daughter.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Brabantio</speaker>
<l>A maiden, never bold;</l>

<l n="96">Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature,</l>
<l n="97">Of years, of country, credit, every thing,</l>
<l n="98">To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!</l>
<l n="99">It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect</l>
<l n="100">That will confess perfection so could err</l>
<l n="101">Against all rules of nature, and must be driven</l>
<l n="102">To find out practises of cunning hell,</l>
<l n="103">Why this should be. I therefore vouch again</l>
<l n="104">That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,</l>
<l n="105">Or with some dram conjured to this effect,</l>
<l n="106">He wrought upon her.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Duke</speaker>
<l>To vouch this, is no proof,</l>

<l n="150">Devour up my discourse: which I observing,</l>

<l n="153">That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,</l>
<l n="154">Whereof by parcels she had something heard,</l>
<l n="155">But not intentively: I did consent,</l>
<l n="156">And often did beguile her of her tears,</l>
<l n="157">When I did speak of some distressful stroke</l>
<l n="158">That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,</l>
<l n="159">She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:</l>
<l n="160">She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,</l>
<l n="161">'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:</l>

<l n="163">That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,</l>
<l n="164">And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,</l>
<l n="165">I should but teach him how to tell my story.</l>
<l n="166">And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:</l>

<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four</l>
<l n="">times seven years; and since I could distinguish</l>
<l n="">betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man</l>
<l n="">that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, I</l>
<l n="">would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, I</l>
<l n="316">would change my humanity with a baboon.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="prose">
<speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<l n="">What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so</l>
<l n="">fond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="prose">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus</l>
<l n="320">or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which</l>
<l n="">our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant</l>
<l n="">nettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up</l>
<l n="">thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or</l>
<l n="">distract it with many, either to have it sterile</l>
<l n="">with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the</l>
<l n="325">power and corrigible authority of this lies in our</l>
<l n="">wills. If the balance of our lives had not one</l>
<l n="">scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the</l>
<l n="">blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us</l>
<l n="">to most preposterous conclusions: but we have</l>
<l n="330">reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal</l>
<l n="">stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that</l>
<l n="">you call love to be a sect or scion.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="prose">
<speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<l n="">It cannot be.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="prose">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of</l>
<l n="335">the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drown</l>
<l n="">cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy</l>
<l n="">friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with</l>
<l n="">cables of perdurable toughness; I could never</l>
<l n="">better stead thee than now. Put money in thy</l>
<l n="340">purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with</l>
<l n="">an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It</l>
<l n="">cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her</l>
<l n="">love to the Moor,-- put money in thy purse,--nor he</l>
<l n="">his to her: it was a violent commencement, and thou</l>
<l n="">shalt see an answerable sequestration:--put but</l>
<l n="345">money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in</l>
<l n="">their wills: fill thy purse with money:--the food</l>
<l n="">that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be</l>
<l n="">to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must</l>
<l n="">change for youth: when she is sated with his body,</l>
<l n="350">she will find the error of her choice: she must</l>
<l n="">have change, she must: therefore put money in thy</l>
<l n="">purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a</l>
<l n="">more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money</l>
<l n="">thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt</l>
<l n="355">an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not</l>
<l n="">too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou</l>
<l n="">shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of</l>
<l n="">drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek</l>
<l n="">thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than</l>
<l n="361">to be drowned and go without her.</l>
</sp>

<l n="">Thou art sure of me:--go, make money:--I have told</l>

<l n="">hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no</l>
<l n="">less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge</l>
<l n="">against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost</l>
<l n="">thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many</l>

<l n="">And when I told thee he was of my counsel</l>

<l n="">My lord, you know I love you.</l>
</sp>

<l n="">I think thou dost;</l>
<l n="">And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty,</l>
<l n="">And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,</l>
<l n="">Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:</l>
<l n="">For such things in a false disloyal knave</l>
<l n="">Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just</l>
<l n="">They are close delations, working from the heart</l>
<l n="">That passion cannot rule.</l>

<l n="">For Michael Cassio,</l>

<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">What dost thou mean?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,</l>
<l n="">Is the immediate jewel of their souls:</l>
<l n="">Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;</l>
<l n="">'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands:</l>
<l n="">But he that filches from me my good name</l>
<l n="">Robs me of that which not enriches him</l>
<l n="">And makes me poor indeed.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;</l>
<l n="">Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">Ha!</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;</l>
<l n="">It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock</l>
<l n="">The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss</l>
<l n="">Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;</l>
<l n="">But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er</l>
<l n="">Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">O misery!</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">Poor and content is rich and rich enough,</l>
<l n="">But riches fineless is as poor as winter</l>
<l n="">To him that ever fears he shall be poor.</l>
<l n="">Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend</l>
<l n="">From jealousy!</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">Why, why is this?</l>
<l n="">Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy,</l>
<l n="">To follow still the changes of the moon</l>
<l n="">With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt</l>
<l n="">Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,</l>
<l n="">When I shall turn the business of my soul</l>
<l n="">To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,</l>
<l n="">Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous</l>
<l n="">To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,</l>
<l n="">Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;</l>
<l n="">Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:</l>
<l n="">Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw</l>
<l n="">The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;</l>
<l n="">For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago;</l>
<l n="">I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;</l>
<l n="">And on the proof, there is no more but this,--</l>
<l n="">Away at once with love or jealousy!</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason</l>
<l n="">To show the love and duty that I bear you</l>
<l n="">With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,</l>
<l n="">Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.</l>
<l n="">Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;</l>
<l n="">Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:</l>
<l n="">I would not have your free and noble nature,</l>
<l n="">Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to't:</l>
<l n="">I know our country disposition well;</l>
<l n="">In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks</l>
<l n="">They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience</l>
<l n="">Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">Dost thou say so?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">She did deceive her father, marrying you;</l>
<l n="">And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,</l>
<l n="">She loved them most.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">And so she did.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">Why, go to then;</l>
<l n="">She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,</l>
<l n="">To seal her father's eyes up close as oak-</l>
<l n="">He thought 'twas witchcraft--but I am much to blame;</l>
<l n="">I humbly do beseech you of your pardon</l>
<l n="">For too much loving you.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">I am bound to thee for ever.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">Not a jot, not a jot.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">I' faith, I fear it has.</l>
<l n="">I hope you will consider what is spoke</l>
<l n="">Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved:</l>
<l n="">I am to pray you not to strain my speech</l>
<l n="">To grosser issues nor to larger reach</l>
<l n="">Than to suspicion.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">I will not.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">Should you do so, my lord,</l>
<l n="">My speech should fall into such vile success</l>
<l n="">As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend--</l>
<l n="">My lord, I see you're moved.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">No, not much moved:</l>
<l n="">I do not think but Desdemona's honest.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">Long live she so! and long live you to think so!</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">And yet, how nature erring from itself,--</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">Ay, there's the point: as--to be bold with you--</l>
<l n="">Not to affect many proposed matches</l>
<l n="">Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,</l>
<l n="">Whereto we see in all things nature tends--</l>
<l n="">Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank,</l>
<l n="">Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural.</l>
<l n="">But pardon me; I do not in position</l>
<l n="">Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear</l>
<l n="">Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,</l>
<l n="">May fall to match you with her country forms</l>
<l n="">And happily repent.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">Farewell, farewell:</l>
<l n="">If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;</l>

My lord, I would I might entreat your honour</l>
<l n="">To scan this thing no further; leave it to time:</l>
<l n="">Though it be fit that Cassio have his place,</l>
<l n="">For sure, he fills it up with great ability,</l>
<l n="">Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,</l>
<l n="">You shall by that perceive him and his means:</l>
<l n="">Note, if your lady strain his entertainment</l>
<l n="">With any strong or vehement importunity;</l>
<l n="">Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,</l>
<l n="">Let me be thought too busy in my fears--</l>
<l n="">As worthy cause I have to fear I am--</l>
<l n="">And hold her free, I do beseech your honour.</l>

<l n="">This fellow's of exceeding honesty,</l>

<l n="">Your dinner, and the generous islanders</l>

<l n="">I am glad I have found this napkin:</l>
<l n="">This was her first remembrance from the Moor:</l>
<l n="">My wayward husband hath a hundred times</l>
<l n="">Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,</l>
<l n="">For he conjured her she should ever keep it,</l>
<l n="">That she reserves it evermore about her</l>

<l n="">To have a foolish wife.</l>

<l n="">What handkerchief?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Emilia</speaker>
<l n="">What handkerchief?</l>
<l n="">Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona;</l>
<l n="">That which so often you did bid me steal.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">Hast stol'n it from her?</l>

<l n="">I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,</l>
<l n="">And let him find it. Trifles light as air</l>
<l n="">Are to the jealous confirmations strong</l>
<l n="">As proofs of holy writ: this may do something.</l>
<l n="">The Moor already changes with my poison:</l>
<l n="">Dangerous conceits are, in their natures, poisons.</l>
<l n="">Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,</l>
<l n="">But with a little act upon the blood.</l>
<l n="">Burn like the mines of Sulphur. I did say so:</l>
<l n="">Look, where he comes!</l>
<stage>Re-enter Othello</stage>
<l n="">Not poppy, nor mandragora,</l>
<l n="">Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,</l>

<sp style="verse">

<l n="">How now, my lord!</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?</l>
<l n="">I saw't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me:</l>

<l n="">I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips:</l>
<l n="">He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n,</l>

<l n="">Farewell the tranquil mind! farewell content!</l>
<l n="">Farewell the plumed troop, and the big wars,</l>

<l n="">Is't come to this?</l>

<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">My noble lord,--</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">If thou dost slander her and torture me,</l>
<l n="">Never pray more; abandon all remorse;</l>
<l n="">On horror's head horrors accumulate;</l>

<l n="">That livest to make thine honesty a vice!</l>
<l n="">O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,</l>
<l n="">To be direct and honest is not safe.</l>
<l n="">I thank you for this profit; and from hence</l>
<l n="">I'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">Nay, stay: thou shouldst be honest.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">I should be wise, for honesty's a fool</l>

<l n="">By the world,</l>

<l n="">As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,</l>

<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">And may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord?</l>
<l n="">Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on--</l>

<l n="">It were a tedious difficulty, I think,</l>

<l n="">If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster</l>
<l n="">More than their own! What then? how then?</l>
<l n="">What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?</l>
<l n="">It is impossible you should see this,</l>
<l n="">Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,</l>
<l n="">As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross</l>
<l n="">As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,</l>
<l n="">If imputation and strong circumstances,</l>
<l n="">Which lead directly to the door of truth,</l>
<l n="">Will give you satisfaction, you may have't.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>

<l n="">I do not like the office:</l>
<l n="">But, sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,</l>

<l n="">I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately;</l>
<l n="">And, being troubled with a raging tooth,</l>
<l n="">I could not sleep.</l>
<l n="">There are a kind of men so loose of soul,</l>
<l n="">That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:</l>
<l n="">One of this kind is Cassio:</l>
<l n="">In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona,</l>
<l n="">Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;'</l>
<l n="">And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,</l>
<l n="">Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard,</l>
<l n="">As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots</l>
<l n="">That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg</l>
<l n="">Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then</l>
<l n="">Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!'</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">O monstrous! monstrous!</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">Nay, this was but his dream.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">

<l n="">'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">

<l n="">And this may help to thicken other proofs</l>
<l n="">That do demonstrate thinly.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">I'll tear her all to pieces.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;</l>
<l n="">She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,</l>
<l n="">Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief</l>
<l n="">Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?</l>

<l n="">I know not that; but such a handkerchief--</l>
<l n="">I am sure it was your wife's--did I to-day</l>

<l n="">If it be that--</l>

<l n="">Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on</l>
<l n="">To the Propontic and the Hellespont,</l>
<l n="">Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,</l>

<l n="">Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Clown</speaker>
<l n="">I dare not say he lies any where.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Desdemona</speaker>
<l n="">Why, man?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Clown</speaker>
<l n="">He's a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies,</l>
<l n="">is stabbing.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Desdemona</speaker>
<l n="">Go to: where lodges he?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Clown</speaker>
<l n="">To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Desdemona</speaker>
<l n="">Can any thing be made of this?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Clown</speaker>
<l n="">I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a</l>
<l n="">lodging and say he lies here or he lies there, were</l>
<l n="">to lie in mine own throat.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Desdemona</speaker>
<l n="">Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Clown</speaker>
<l n="">I will catechise the world for him; that is, make</l>
<l n="">questions, and by them answer.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">

<l n="">Seek him, bid him come hither: tell him I have</l>
<l n="">moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.</l>
</sp>

<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Desdemona</speaker>
<l n="">Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse</l>
<l n="">Full of crusadoes: and, but my noble Moor</l>
<l n="">Is true of mind and made of no such baseness</l>
<l n="">As jealous creatures are, it were enough</l>
<l n="">To put him to ill thinking.</l>

<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Emilia</speaker>
<l n="">Is he not jealous?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Desdemona</speaker>
<l n="">Who, he? I think the sun where he was born</l>
<l n="">Drew all such humours from him.</l>

<l n="">Look, where he comes.</l>

</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>

<stage>Aside</stage>
<l n="">O, hardness to dissemble!--</l>
<l n="">How do you, Desdemona?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Desdemona</speaker>
<l n="">Well, my good lord.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">Give me your hand: this hand is moist, my lady.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Desdemona</speaker>
<l n="">It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:</l>
<l n="">Hot, hot, and moist: this hand of yours requires</l>
<l n="">A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,</l>
<l n="">Much castigation, exercise devout;</l>
<l n="">For here's a young and sweating devil here,</l>
<l n="">That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand,</l>
<l n="">A frank one.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Desdemona</speaker>
<l n="">You may, indeed, say so;</l>
<l n="">For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;</l>
<l n="">But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Desdemona</speaker>
<l n="">I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">What promise, chuck?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Desdemona</speaker>
<l n="">I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;</l>
<l n="">Lend me thy handkerchief.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Desdemona</speaker>
<l n="">Here, my lord.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">That which I gave you.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Desdemona</speaker>
<l n="">I have it not about me.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">Not?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Desdemona</speaker>
<l n="">No, indeed, my lord.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">That is a fault.</l>
<l n="">That handkerchief</l>
<l n="">Did an Egyptian to my mother give;</l>
<l n="">She was a charmer, and could almost read</l>
<l n="">The thoughts of people: she told her, while</l>
<l n="">she kept it,</l>
<l n="">'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father</l>
<l n="">Entirely to her love, but if she lost it</l>
<l n="">Or made gift of it, my father's eye</l>
<l n="">Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt</l>
<l n="">After new fancies: she, dying, gave it me;</l>
<l n="">And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,</l>
<l n="">To give it her. I did so: and take heed on't;</l>
<l n="">Make it a darling like your precious eye;</l>
<l n="">To lose't or give't away were such perdition</l>
<l n="">As nothing else could match.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Desdemona</speaker>
<l n="">Is't possible?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">'Tis true: there's magic in the web of it:</l>
<l n="">A sibyl, that had number'd in the world</l>
<l n="">The sun to course two hundred compasses,</l>
<l n="">In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;</l>
<l n="">The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk;</l>
<l n="">And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful</l>
<l n="">Conserved of maidens' hearts.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Desdemona</speaker>
<l n="">Indeed! is't true?</l>

<l n="">Something, sure, of state,</l>
<l n="">Either from Venice, or some unhatch'd practise</l>
<l n="">Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,</l>
<l n="">Hath puddled his clear spirit: and in such cases</l>
<l n="">Men's natures wrangle with inferior things,</l>
<l n="">Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so;</l>
<l n="">For let our finger ache, and it indues</l>
<l n="">Our other healthful members even to that sense</l>
<l n="">Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,</l>
<l n="">Nor of them look for such observances</l>
<l n="">As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,</l>

<l n="">With her, on her; what you will.</l>

<sp style="verse">

<l n="">Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when</l>

<l n="">--Handkerchief--confessions--handkerchief!--To</l>
<l n="">confess, and be hanged for his labour;--first, to be</l>
<l n="">hanged, and then to confess.--I tremble at it.</l>
<l n="">Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing</l>

<sp style="verse">

<l n="">Work on,</l>

<l n="">My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy:</l>

<l n="">No, forbear;</l>

<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">A horned man's a monster and a beast.</l>

<l n="">There's many a beast then in a populous city,</l>

<l n="">Good sir, be a man;</l>

<l n="">That nightly lie in those unproper beds</l>
<l n="">Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.</l>
<l n="">O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,</l>
<l n="">To lip a wanton in a secure couch,</l>
<l n="">And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know;</l>

<l n="">Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief--</l>
<l n="">A passion most unsuiting such a man--</l>
<l n="">Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,</l>
<l n="">And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy,</l>
<l n="">Bade him anon return and here speak with me;</l>
<l n="">The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,</l>
<l n="">And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,</l>
<l n="">That dwell in every region of his face;</l>
<l n="">For I will make him tell the tale anew,</l>
<l n="">Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when</l>
<l n="">He hath, and is again to cope your wife:</l>
<l n="">I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience;</l>
<l n="">Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,</l>
<l n="">And nothing of a man.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">Dost thou hear, Iago?</l>
<l n="">I will be found most cunning in my patience;</l>

</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">That's not amiss;</l>
<l n="">But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?</l>
<stage>Othello retires</stage>
<l n="">Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,</l>
<l n="">A housewife that by selling her desires</l>
<l n="">Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature</l>
<l n="">That dotes on Cassio; as 'tis the strumpet's plague</l>
<l n="">To beguile many and be beguiled by one:</l>
<l n="">He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain</l>
<l n="">From the excess of laughter. Here he comes:</l>
<stage>Re-enter Cassio</stage>
<l n="">As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;</l>
<l n="">And his unbookish jealousy must construe</l>
<l n="">Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures and light behavior,</l>
<l n="">Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Cassio</speaker>
<l n="">The worser that you give me the addition</l>

<l n="">Do you hear, Cassio?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">

<l n="">When they change us for others? Is it sport?</l>

<l n="">Behold, I have a weapon;</l>
<l n="">A better never did itself sustain</l>
<l n="">Upon a soldier's thigh: I have seen the day,</l>
<l n="">That, with this little arm and this good sword,</l>
<l n="">I have made my way through more impediments</l>
<l n="">Than twenty times your stop: but, O vain boast!</l>
<l n="">Who can control his fate? 'tis not so now.</l>
<l n="">Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;</l>
<l n="">Here is my journey's end, here is my butt,</l>
<l n="">And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.</l>
<l n="">Do you go back dismay'd? 'tis a lost fear;</l>
<l n="">Man but a rush against Othello's breast,</l>
<l n="">And he retires. Where should Othello go?</l>
<l n="">Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!</l>
<l n="">Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt,</l>
<l n="">This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,</l>
<l n="">And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!</l>
<l n="">Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!</l>
<l n="">Whip me, ye devils,</l>
<l n="">From the possession of this heavenly sight!</l>
<l n="">Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur!</l>
<l n="">Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!</l>
<l n="">O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead!</l>
<l n="">Oh! Oh! Oh!</l>

<stage>Enter Lodovico. Montano, Cassio carried in a chair, and Officers with Iago, prisoner</stage>

<speaker>Lodovico</speaker>
<l n="">Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">That's he that was Othello: here I am.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Lodovico</speaker>
<l n="">Where is that viper? bring the villain forth.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.</l>
<l n="">If that thou best a devil, I cannot kill thee.</l>

<stage>Wounds Iago</stage>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Lodovico</speaker>
<l n="">Wrench his sword from him.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">I bleed, sir; but not kill'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">I am not sorry neither: I'ld have thee live;</l>
<l n="">For, in my sense, 'tis happiness to die.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Lodovico</speaker>
<l n="">O thou Othello, thou wert once so good,</l>
<l n="">Fall'n in the practise of a damned slave,</l>
<l n="">What shall be said to thee?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">Why, any thing:</l>
<l n="">An honourable murderer, if you will;</l>
<l n="">For nought I did in hate, but all in honour.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Lodovico</speaker>
<l n="">This wretch hath part confess'd his villany:</l>
<l n="">Did you and he consent in Cassio's death?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">Ay.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Cassio</speaker>
<l n="">Dear general, I never gave you cause.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.</l>
<l n="">Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil</l>
<l n="">Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:</l>
<l n="">From this time forth I never will speak word.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Lodovico</speaker>
<l n="">What, not to pray?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Gratiano</speaker>
<l n="">Torments will ope your lips.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">Well, thou dost best.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Lodovico</speaker>
<l n="">Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n,</l>
<l n="">Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter</l>
<l n="">Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo;</l>
<l n="">And here another: the one of them imports</l>
<l n="">The death of Cassio to be undertook</l>
<l n="">By Roderigo.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">O villain!</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Cassio</speaker>
<l n="">Most heathenish and most gross!</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Lodovico</speaker>
<l n="">Now here's another discontented paper,</l>
<l n="">Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,</l>
<l n="">Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain;</l>
<l n="">But that belike Iago in the interim</l>
<l n="">Came in and satisfied him.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">O the pernicious caitiff!</l>
<l n="">How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief</l>
<l n="">That was my wife's?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Cassio</speaker>
<l n="">I found it in my chamber:</l>
<l n="">And he himself confess'd but even now</l>
<l n="">That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose</l>
<l n="">Which wrought to his desire.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">O fool! fool! fool!</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Cassio</speaker>
<l n="">There is besides in Roderigo's letter,</l>
<l n="">How he upbraids Iago, that he made him</l>
<l n="">Brave me upon the watch; whereon it came</l>
<l n="">That I was cast: and even but now he spake,</l>
<l n="">After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,</l>
<l n="">Iago set him on.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Lodovico</speaker>
<l n="">You must forsake this room, and go with us:</l>
<l n="">Your power and your command is taken off,</l>
<l n="">And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,</l>
<l n="">If there be any cunning cruelty</l>
<l n="">That can torment him much and hold him long,</l>
<l n="">It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,</l>
<l n="">Till that the nature of your fault be known</l>
<l n="">To the Venetian state. Come, bring him away.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">Soft you; a word or two before you go.</l>
<l n="">I have done the state some service, and they know't.</l>
<l n="">No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,</l>
<l n="">When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,</l>
<l n="">Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,</l>
<l n="">Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speak</l>
<l n="">Of one that loved not wisely but too well;</l>
<l n="">Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought</l>
<l n="">Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,</l>
<l n="">Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away</l>
<l n="">Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,</l>
<l n="">Albeit unused to the melting mood,</l>
<l n="">Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees</l>
<l n="">Their medicinal gum. Set you down this;</l>
<l n="">And say besides, that in Aleppo once,</l>
<l n="">Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk</l>
<l n="">Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,</l>
<l n="">I took by the throat the circumcised dog,</l>
<l n="">And smote him, thus.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Stabs himself</stage>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Lodovico</speaker>
<l n="">O bloody period!</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Gratiano</speaker>
<l n="">All that's spoke is marr'd.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee: no way but this;</l>
<l n="">Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.</l>

<l n="">This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon;</l>

O Spartan dog,
</l>
<l n="">More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea!</l>
<l n="">Look on the tragic loading of this bed;</l>
<l n="">This is thy work: the object poisons sight;</l>
<l n="">Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house,</l>
<l n="">And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,</l>
<l n="">For they succeed on you. To you, lord governor,</l>
<l n="">Remains the censure of this hellish villain;</l>
<l n="">The time, the place, the torture: O, enforce it!</l>
<l n="">Myself will straight aboard: and to the state</l>
<l n="">This heavy act with heavy heart relate.</l>
