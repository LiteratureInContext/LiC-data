<l n="">Wherein the toged consuls can propose</l>
<l n="">As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,</l>
<l n="">Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:</l>
<l n="">And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof</l>
<l n="">At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds</l>
<l n="">Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd</l>
<l n="">By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,</l>
<l n="">He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,</l>
<l n="">And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<l n="">By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,</l>
<l n="">Preferment goes by letter and affection,</l>
<l n="">And not by old gradation, where each second</l>
<l n="">Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,</l>
<l n="">Whether I in any just term am affined</l>
<l n="">To love the Moor.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<l n="">I would not follow him then.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">O, sir, content you;</l>
<l n="">I follow him to serve my turn upon him:</l>
<l n="">We cannot all be masters, nor all masters</l>
<l n="">Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark</l>
<l n="">Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,</l>
<l n="">That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,</l>
<l n="">Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,</l>
<l n="">For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:</l>
<l n="">Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are</l>
<l n="">Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,</l>
<l n="">Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,</l>
<l n="">And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,</l>
<l n="">Do well thrive by them and when they have lined</l>
<l n="">their coats</l>
<l n="">Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;</l>
<l n="">And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,</l>
<l n="">It is as sure as you are Roderigo,</l>
<l n="">Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:</l>
<l n="">In following him, I follow but myself;</l>
<l n="">Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,</l>
<l n="">But seeming so, for my peculiar end:</l>
<l n="">For when my outward action doth demonstrate</l>
<l n="">The native act and figure of my heart</l>
<l n="">In compliment extern, 'tis not long after</l>
<l n="">But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve</l>
<l n="">For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.</l>

<l n="">Call up her father,</l>

<l n="">Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,</l>
<l n="">And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,</l>
<l n="">Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,</l>

<l n="">As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,</l>
<l n="">At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,</l>
<l n="">Transported, with no worse nor better guard</l>

<l n="">If this be known to you and your allowance,</l>
<l n="">We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;</l>
<l n="">But if you know not this, my manners tell me</l>
<l n="">We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe</l>
<l n="">That, from the sense of all civility,</l>
<l n="">I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:</l>
<l n="">Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,</l>
<l n="">I say again, hath made a gross revolt;</l>
<l n="">Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes</l>
<l n="">In an extravagant and wheeling stranger</l>
<l n="">Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:</l>
<l n="">If she be in her chamber or your house,</l>
<l n="">Let loose on me the justice of the state</l>
<l n="">For thus deluding you.</l>

<l n="">With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,</l>

<l n="">Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,</l>

<l n="">We are very sorry for't.</l>

<stage>To Othello</stage>
What, in your own part, can you say to this?
</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Brabantio</speaker>
<l n="">Nothing, but this is so.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,</l>
<l n="">My very noble and approved good masters,</l>
<l n="">That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,</l>
<l n="">It is most true; true, I have married her:</l>
<l n="">The very head and front of my offending</l>
<l n="">Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,</l>
<l n="">And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:</l>
<l n="">For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,</l>
<l n="">Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used</l>
<l n="">Their dearest action in the tented field,</l>
<l n="">And little of this great world can I speak,</l>
<l n="">More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,</l>
<l n="">And therefore little shall I grace my cause</l>
<l n="">In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,</l>
<l n="">I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver</l>
<l n="">Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,</l>
<l n="">What conjuration and what mighty magic,</l>
<l n="">For such proceeding I am charged withal,</l>
<l n="">I won his daughter.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Brabantio</speaker>
<l n="">A maiden never bold;</l>
<l n="">Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion</l>
<l n="">Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature,</l>
<l n="">Of years, of country, credit, every thing,</l>
<l n="">To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!</l>
<l n="">It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect</l>
<l n="">That will confess perfection so could err</l>
<l n="">Against all rules of nature, and must be driven</l>
<l n="">To find out practises of cunning hell,</l>
<l n="">Why this should be. I therefore vouch again</l>
<l n="">That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,</l>
<l n="">Or with some dram conjured to this effect,</l>
<l n="">He wrought upon her.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Duke</speaker>
<l n="">To vouch this, is no proof,</l>
<l n="">Without more wider and more overt test</l>
<l n="">Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods</l>
<l n="">Of modern seeming do prefer against him.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<l n="">But, Othello, speak:</l>
<l n="">Did you by indirect and forced courses</l>

</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">I do beseech you,</l>

    <pb n="314"/>
    
<l n="">How I did thrive in this fair lady's love,</l>

</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Duke</speaker>
<l n="">Say it, Othello.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">Her father loved me; oft invited me;</l>
<l n="">Still question'd me the story of my life,</l>
<l n="">From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,</l>
<l n="">That I have passed.</l>
<l n="">I ran it through, even from my boyish days,</l>
<l n="">To the very moment that he bade me tell it;</l>
<l n="">Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,</l>
<l n="">Of moving accidents by flood and field</l>
<l n="">Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,</l>
<l n="">Of being taken by the insolent foe</l>
<l n="">And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence</l>
<l n="">And portance in my travels' history:</l>
<l n="">Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,</l>
<l n="">Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven</l>
<l n="">It was my hint to speak,--such was the process;</l>
<l n="">And of the Cannibals that each other eat,</l>
<l n="">The Anthropophagi and men whose heads</l>
<l n="">Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear</l>
<l n="">Would Desdemona seriously incline:</l>
<l n="">But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:</l>
<l n="">Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,</l>
<l n="">She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear</l>
<l n="">Devour up my discourse: which I observing,</l>
<l n="">Took once a pliant hour, and found good means</l>
<l n="">To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart</l>
<l n="">That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,</l>
<l n="">Whereof by parcels she had something heard,</l>
<l n="">But not intentively: I did consent,</l>
<l n="">And often did beguile her of her tears,</l>
<l n="">When I did speak of some distressful stroke</l>
<l n="">That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,</l>
<l n="">She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:</l>
<l n="">She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,</l>
<l n="">'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:</l>
<l n="">She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd</l>
<l n="">That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,</l>
<l n="">And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,</l>
<l n="">I should but teach him how to tell my story.</l>
<l n="">And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:</l>
<l n="">She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,</l>
<l n="">And I loved her that she did pity them.</l>
<l n="">This only is the witchcraft I have used:</l>
<l n="">Here comes the lady; let her witness it.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Enter Desdemona, Iago, and Attendants</stage>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Duke</speaker>
<l n="">I think this tale would win my daughter too.</l>
<l n="">Good Brabantio,</l>
<l n="">Take up this mangled matter at the best:</l>
<l n="">Men do their broken weapons rather use</l>
<l n="">Than their bare hands.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Brabantio</speaker>
<l n="">I pray you, hear her speak:</l>
<l n="">If she confess that she was half the wooer,</l>
<l n="">Destruction on my head, if my bad blame</l>
<l n="">Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress:</l>
<l n="">Do you perceive in all this noble company</l>
<l n="">Where most you owe obedience?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Desdemona</speaker>
<l n="">My noble father,</l>
<l n="">I do perceive here a divided duty:</l>
<l n="">To you I am bound for life and education;</l>
<l n="">My life and education both do learn me</l>
<l n="">How to respect you; you are the lord of duty;</l>
<l n="">I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband,</l>
<l n="">And so much duty as my mother show'd</l>
<l n="">To you, preferring you before her father,</l>
<l n="">So much I challenge that I may profess</l>
<l n="">Due to the Moor my lord.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Brabantio</speaker>
<l n="">God be wi' you! I have done.</l>
<l n="">Please it your grace, on to the state-affairs:</l>
<l n="">I had rather to adopt a child than get it.</l>
<l n="">Come hither, Moor:</l>
<l n="">I here do give thee that with all my heart</l>
<l n="">Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart</l>
<l n="">I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel,</l>
<l n="">I am glad at soul I have no other child:</l>
<l n="">For thy escape would teach me tyranny,</l>
<l n="">To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Duke</speaker>
<l n="">Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,</l>
<l n="">Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers</l>
<l n="">Into your favour.</l>
<l n="">When remedies are past, the griefs are ended</l>
<l n="">By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.</l>
<l n="">To mourn a mischief that is past and gone</l>
<l n="">Is the next way to draw new mischief on.</l>
<l n="">What cannot be preserved when fortune takes</l>
<l n="">Patience her injury a mockery makes.</l>
<l n="">The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;</l>
<l n="">He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Brabantio</speaker>
<l n="">So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;</l>
<l n="">We lose it not, so long as we can smile.</l>
<l n="">He bears the sentence well that nothing bears</l>
<l n="">But the free comfort which from thence he hears,</l>
<l n="">But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow</l>
<l n="">That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.</l>
<l n="">These sentences, to sugar, or to gall,</l>
<l n="">Being strong on both sides, are equivocal:</l>
<l n="">But words are words; I never yet did hear</l>
<l n="">That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.</l>
<l n="">I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Duke</speaker>
<l n="">The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for</l>
<l n="">Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is best</l>
<l n="">known to you; and though we have there a substitute</l>
<l n="">of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a</l>
<l n="">sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer</l>
<l n="">voice on you: you must therefore be content to</l>
<l n="">slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this</l>
<l n="">more stubborn and boisterous expedition.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">The tyrant custom, most grave Senators,</l>
<l n="">Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war</l>
<l n="">My thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnise</l>
<l n="">A natural and prompt alacrity</l>
<l n="">I find in hardness, and do undertake</l>
<l n="">These present wars against the Ottomites.</l>
<l n="">Most humbly therefore bending to your state,</l>
<l n="">I crave fit disposition for my wife.</l>
<l n="">Due reference of place and exhibition,</l>

<l n="">O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four</l>

<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus</l>
<l n="">or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which</l>
<l n="">our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant</l>
<l n="">nettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up</l>
<l n="">thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or</l>
<l n="">distract it with many, either to have it sterile</l>
<l n="">with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the</l>
<l n="">power and corrigible authority of this lies in our</l>
<l n="">wills. If the balance of our lives had not one</l>
<l n="">scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the</l>
<l n="">blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us</l>
<l n="">to most preposterous conclusions: but we have</l>
<l n="">reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal</l>
<l n="">stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that</l>
<l n="">you call love to be a sect or scion.</l>

<sp style="prose">

<l n="">It cannot be.</l>

<l n="">It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of</l>

<l n="">cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy</l>
<l n="">friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with</l>
<l n="">cables of perdurable toughness; I could never</l>
<l n="">better stead thee than now. Put money in thy</l>
<l n="">purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with</l>
<l n="">an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It</l>
<l n="">cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her</l>
<l n="">love to the Moor,-- put money in thy purse,--nor he</l>
<l n="">his to her: it was a violent commencement, and thou</l>
<l n="">shalt see an answerable sequestration:--put but</l>
<l n="">money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in</l>
<l n="">their wills: fill thy purse with money:--the food</l>
<l n="">that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be</l>
<l n="">to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must</l>
<l n="">change for youth: when she is sated with his body,</l>
<l n="">she will find the error of her choice: she must</l>
<l n="">have change, she must: therefore put money in thy</l>
<l n="">purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a</l>
<l n="">more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money</l>
<l n="">thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt</l>
<l n="">an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not</l>
<l n="">too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou</l>
<l n="">shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of</l>
<l n="">drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek</l>
<l n="">thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than</l>
<l n="">to be drowned and go without her.</l>

<l n="">But men are men; the best sometimes forget:</l>
<l n="">Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,</l>
<l n="">As men in rage strike those that wish them best,</l>
<l n="">Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received</l>
<l n="">From him that fled some strange indignity,</l>
<l n="">Which patience could not pass.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">I know, Iago,</l>
<l n="">Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,</l>
<l n="">Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee</l>
<l n="">But never more be officer of mine.</l>
<stage>Enter Desdemona, attended</stage>
<l n="">Look, if my gentle love be not raised up!</l>
<l n="">I'll make thee an example.</l>

<speaker>Desdemona</speaker>
<l n="">What's the matter?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="">All's well now, sweeting; come away to bed.</l>
<l n="">Sir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon:</l>
<l n="">Lead him off.</l>
<stage>To Montano, who is led off</stage>
<l n="">Iago, look with care about the town,</l>
<l n="">And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.</l>
<l n="">Come, Desdemona: 'tis the soldiers' life</l>

<stage>Exeunt all but Iago and Cassio</stage>
<sp style="prose">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">What, are you hurt, lieutenant?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="prose">
<speaker>Cassio</speaker>
<l n="">Ay, past all surgery.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="prose">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">Marry, heaven forbid!</l>

<sp style="prose">
<speaker>Cassio</speaker>
<l n="">Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost</l>
<l n="">my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of</l>
<l n="">myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation,</l>
<l n="">Iago, my reputation!</l>
</sp>
<sp style="prose">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">As I am an honest man, I thought you had received</l>
<l n="">some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than</l>
<l n="">in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false</l>
<l n="">imposition: oft got without merit, and lost without</l>
<l n="">deserving: you have lost no reputation at all,</l>
<l n="">unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man!</l>
<l n="">there are ways to recover the general again: you</l>
<l n="">are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in</l>
<l n="">policy than in malice, even so as one would beat his</l>
<l n="">offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sue</l>
<l n="">to him again, and he's yours.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="prose">
<speaker>Cassio</speaker>
<l n="">I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so</l>
<l n="">good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so</l>
<l n="">indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot?</l>
<l n="">and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse</l>
<l n="">fustian with one's own shadow? O thou invisible</l>
<l n="">spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by,</l>
<l n="">let us call thee devil!</l>
</sp>
<sp style="prose">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">What was he that you followed with your sword? What</l>
<l n="">had he done to you?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="prose">
<speaker>Cassio</speaker>
<l n="">I know not.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="prose">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">Is't possible?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="prose">
<speaker>Cassio</speaker>
<l n="">I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly;</l>
<l n="">a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men</l>
<l n="">should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away</l>
<l n="">their brains! that we should, with joy, pleasance</l>
<l n="">revel and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!</l>
</sp>
<sp style="prose">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">Why, but you are now well enough: how came you thus</l>
<l n="">recovered?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="prose">
<speaker>Cassio</speaker>
<l n="">It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place</l>
<l n="">to the devil wrath; one unperfectness shows me</l>
<l n="">another, to make me frankly despise myself.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="prose">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">Come, you are too severe a moraler: as the time,</l>
<l n="">the place, and the condition of this country</l>
<l n="">stands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen;</l>
<l n="">but, since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="prose">
<speaker>Cassio</speaker>
<l n="">I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me</l>
<l n="">I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra,</l>
<l n="">such an answer would stop them all. To be now a</l>
<l n="">sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a</l>
<l n="">beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is</l>
<l n="">unblessed and the ingredient is a devil.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="prose">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature,</l>
<l n="">if it be well used: exclaim no more against it.</l>
<l n="">And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="prose">
<speaker>Cassio</speaker>
<l n="">I have well approved it, sir. I drunk!</l>
</sp>
<sp style="prose">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">You or any man living may be drunk! at a time, man.</l>
<l n="">I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife</l>
<l n="">is now the general: may say so in this respect, for</l>
<l n="">that he hath devoted and given up himself to the</l>
<l n="">contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and</l>
<l n="">graces: confess yourself freely to her; importune</l>
<l n="">her help to put you in your place again: she is of</l>
<l n="">so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition,</l>
<l n="">she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more</l>
<l n="">than she is requested: this broken joint between</l>
<l n="">you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and, my</l>
<l n="">fortunes against any lay worth naming, this</l>
<l n="">crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="prose">
<speaker>Cassio</speaker>
<l n="">You advise me well.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="prose">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="prose">
<speaker>Cassio</speaker>
<l n="">I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will</l>
<l n="">beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me:</l>
<l n="">I am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="prose">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant; I</l>
<l n="">must to the watch.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="prose">
<speaker>Cassio</speaker>
<l n="">Good night, honest Iago.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Exit</stage>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">And what's he then that says I play the villain?</l>
<l n="">When this advice is free I give and honest,</l>
<l n="">Probal to thinking and indeed the course</l>
<l n="">To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy</l>
<l n="">The inclining Desdemona to subdue</l>
<l n="">In any honest suit: she's framed as fruitful</l>
<l n="">As the free elements. And then for her</l>
<l n="">To win the Moor--were't to renounce his baptism,</l>
<l n="">All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,</l>
<l n="">His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,</l>
<l n="">That she may make, unmake, do what she list,</l>
<l n="">Even as her appetite shall play the god</l>
<l n="">With his weak function. How am I then a villain</l>
<l n="">To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,</l>
<l n="">Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!</l>
<l n="">When devils will the blackest sins put on,</l>
<l n="">They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,</l>
<l n="">As I do now: for whiles this honest fool</l>
<l n="">Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes</l>
<l n="">And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,</l>
<l n="">I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,</l>
<l n="">That she repeals him for her body's lust;</l>
<l n="">And by how much she strives to do him good,</l>
<l n="">She shall undo her credit with the Moor.</l>
<l n="">So will I turn her virtue into pitch,</l>
<l n="">And out of her own goodness make the net</l>
<l n="">That shall enmesh them all.</l>
<stage>Re-enter Roderigo</stage>
<l n="">How now, Roderigo!</l>
</sp>
<sp style="prose">
<speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<l n="">I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that</l>
<l n="">hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is</l>
<l n="">almost spent; I have been to-night exceedingly well</l>
<l n="">cudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall</l>
    
    <pb n="322"/>
    
<l n="">have so much experience for my pains, and so, with</l>
<l n="">no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">How poor are they that have not patience!</l>
<l n="">What wound did ever heal but by degrees?</l>
<l n="">Thou know'st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft;</l>
<l n="">And wit depends on dilatory time.</l>
<l n="">Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee.</l>
<l n="">And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier'd Cassio:</l>
<l n="">Though other things grow fair against the sun,</l>
<l n="">Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:</l>
<l n="">Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;</l>
<l n="">Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.</l>
<l n="">Retire thee; go where thou art billeted:</l>
<l n="">Away, I say; thou shalt know more hereafter:</l>
<l n="">Nay, get thee gone.</l>
<stage>Exit Roderigo</stage>
<l n="">Two things are to be done:</l>
<l n="">My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress;</l>
<l n="">I'll set her on;</l>
<l n="">Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,</l>
<l n="">And bring him jump when he may Cassio find</l>
<l n="">Soliciting his wife: ay, that's the way</l>
<l n="">Dull not device by coldness and delay.</l>
