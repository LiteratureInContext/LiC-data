<l n="22">That never set a squadron in the field,</l>
<l n="23">Nor the division of a battle knows</l>
<l n="24">More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,</l>
<l n="25">Wherein the toged consuls can propose</l>
<l n="26">As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,</l>
<l n="27">Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:</l>
<l n="28">And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof</l>
<l n="29">At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds</l>
<l n="30">Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd</l>
<l n="31">By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,</l>
<l n="32">He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,</l>
<l n="33">And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<l n="34">By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="35">Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,</l>
<l n="36">Preferment goes by letter and affection,</l>
<l n="37">And not by old gradation, where each second</l>
<l n="38">Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself</l>
<l n="39">Whether I in any just term am affined</l>
<l>To love the Moor.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<l n="40">I would not follow him then.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="41">O, sir, content you;</l>
<l n="42">I follow him to serve my turn upon him:</l>
<l n="43">We cannot all be masters, nor all masters</l>
<l n="44">Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark</l>
<l n="45">Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,</l>
<l n="46">That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,</l>
<l n="47">Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,</l>
<l n="48">For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:</l>
<l n="49">Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are</l>
<l n="50">Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,</l>
<l n="51">Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,</l>
<l n="52">And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,</l>
<l n="53">Do well thrive by them and when they have lined</l>
<l>their coats</l>
<l n="54">Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;</l>
<l n="55">And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,</l>
<l n="56">It is as sure as you are Roderigo,</l>
<l n="57">Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:</l>
<l n="58">In following him, I follow but myself;</l>
<l n="59">Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,</l>
<l n="60">But seeming so, for my peculiar end:</l>
<l n="61">For when my outward action doth demonstrate</l>
<l n="62">The native act and figure of my heart</l>
<l n="63">In compliment extern, 'tis not long after</l>
<l n="64">But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve</l>
<l n="65">For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.</l>

<speaker>Othello</speaker>
<l n="76">Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,</l>
<l n="77">My very noble and approved good masters,</l>
<l n="78">That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,</l>
<l n="79">It is most true; true, I have married her:</l>
<l n="80">The very head and front of my offending</l>
<l n="81">Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,</l>
<l n="82">And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:</l>
<l n="83">For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,</l>
<l n="84">Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used</l>
<l n="85">Their dearest action in the tented field,</l>
<l n="86">And little of this great world can I speak,</l>
<l n="87">More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,</l>
<l n="88">And therefore little shall I grace my cause</l>
<l n="89">In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,</l>
<l n="90">I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver</l>
<l n="91">Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,</l>
<l n="92">What conjuration and what mighty magic,</l>
<l n="93">For such proceeding I am charged withal,</l>
<l n="94">I won his daughter.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Brabantio</speaker>
<l>A maiden, never bold;</l>

<l n="96">Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature,</l>
<l n="97">Of years, of country, credit, every thing,</l>
<l n="98">To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!</l>
<l n="99">It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect</l>
<l n="100">That will confess perfection so could err</l>
<l n="101">Against all rules of nature, and must be driven</l>
<l n="102">To find out practises of cunning hell,</l>
<l n="103">Why this should be. I therefore vouch again</l>
<l n="104">That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,</l>
<l n="105">Or with some dram conjured to this effect,</l>
<l n="106">He wrought upon her.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Duke</speaker>
<l>To vouch this, is no proof,</l>

<l n="150">Devour up my discourse: which I observing,</l>

<l n="153">That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,</l>
<l n="154">Whereof by parcels she had something heard,</l>
<l n="155">But not intentively: I did consent,</l>
<l n="156">And often did beguile her of her tears,</l>
<l n="157">When I did speak of some distressful stroke</l>
<l n="158">That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,</l>
<l n="159">She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:</l>
<l n="160">She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,</l>
<l n="161">'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:</l>

<l n="163">That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,</l>
<l n="164">And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,</l>
<l n="165">I should but teach him how to tell my story.</l>
<l n="166">And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:</l>

<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four</l>
<l n="">times seven years; and since I could distinguish</l>
<l n="">betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man</l>
<l n="">that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, I</l>
<l n="">would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, I</l>
<l n="316">would change my humanity with a baboon.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="prose">
<speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<l n="">What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so</l>
<l n="">fond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="prose">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus</l>
<l n="320">or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which</l>
<l n="">our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant</l>
<l n="">nettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up</l>
<l n="">thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or</l>
<l n="">distract it with many, either to have it sterile</l>
<l n="">with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the</l>
<l n="325">power and corrigible authority of this lies in our</l>
<l n="">wills. If the balance of our lives had not one</l>
<l n="">scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the</l>
<l n="">blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us</l>
<l n="">to most preposterous conclusions: but we have</l>
<l n="330">reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal</l>
<l n="">stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that</l>
<l n="">you call love to be a sect or scion.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="prose">
<speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<l n="">It cannot be.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="prose">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of</l>
<l n="335">the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drown</l>
<l n="">cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy</l>
<l n="">friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with</l>
<l n="">cables of perdurable toughness; I could never</l>
<l n="">better stead thee than now. Put money in thy</l>
<l n="340">purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with</l>
<l n="">an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It</l>
<l n="">cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her</l>
<l n="">love to the Moor,-- put money in thy purse,--nor he</l>
<l n="">his to her: it was a violent commencement, and thou</l>
<l n="">shalt see an answerable sequestration:--put but</l>
<l n="345">money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in</l>
<l n="">their wills: fill thy purse with money:--the food</l>
<l n="">that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be</l>
<l n="">to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must</l>
<l n="">change for youth: when she is sated with his body,</l>
<l n="350">she will find the error of her choice: she must</l>
<l n="">have change, she must: therefore put money in thy</l>
<l n="">purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a</l>
<l n="">more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money</l>
<l n="">thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt</l>
<l n="355">an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not</l>
<l n="">too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou</l>
<l n="">shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of</l>
<l n="">drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek</l>
<l n="">thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than</l>
<l n="361">to be drowned and go without her.</l>
</sp>

<l n="">Thou art sure of me:--go, make money:--I have told</l>

<l n="">hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no</l>
<l n="">less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge</l>
<l n="">against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost</l>
<l n="">thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many</l>

<l n="351">When devils will the blackest sins put on,</l>
<l n="352">They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,</l>
<l n="353">As I do now: for whiles this honest fool</l>
<l n="354">Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes</l>
<l n="355">And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,</l>
<l n="356">I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,</l>
<l n="357">That she repeals him for her body's lust;</l>
<l n="358">And by how much she strives to do him good,</l>
<l n="359">She shall undo her credit with the Moor.</l>
<l n="360">So will I turn her virtue into pitch,</l>
<l n="361">And out of her own goodness make the net</l>
<l n="362">That shall enmesh them all.</l>

<l n="370">How poor are they that have not patience!</l>
<l n="371">What wound did ever heal but by degrees?</l>
<l n="372">Thou know'st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft;</l>
<l n="373">And wit depends on dilatory time.</l>
<l n="374">Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee.</l>
<l n="375">And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier'd Cassio:</l>
<l n="376">Though other things grow fair against the sun,</l>
<l n="377">Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:</l>
<l n="378">Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;</l>

Two things are to be done:</l>
<l n="383">My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress;</l>
<l n="384">I'll set her on;</l>
<l n="385">Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,</l>
<l n="386">And bring him jump when he may Cassio find</l>
<l n="387">Soliciting his wife: ay, that's the way</l>
<l n="388">Dull not device by coldness and delay.</l>
