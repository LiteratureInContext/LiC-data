<l n="">Wherein the toged consuls can propose</l>
<l n="">As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,</l>
<l n="">Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:</l>
<l n="">And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof</l>
<l n="">At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds</l>
<l n="">Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd</l>
<l n="">By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,</l>
<l n="">He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,</l>
<l n="">And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<l n="">By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,</l>
<l n="">Preferment goes by letter and affection,</l>
<l n="">And not by old gradation, where each second</l>
<l n="">Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,</l>
<l n="">Whether I in any just term am affined</l>
<l n="">To love the Moor.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<l n="">I would not follow him then.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">O, sir, content you;</l>
<l n="">I follow him to serve my turn upon him:</l>
<l n="">We cannot all be masters, nor all masters</l>
<l n="">Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark</l>
<l n="">Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,</l>
<l n="">That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,</l>
<l n="">Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,</l>
<l n="">For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:</l>
<l n="">Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are</l>
<l n="">Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,</l>
<l n="">Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,</l>
<l n="">And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,</l>
<l n="">Do well thrive by them and when they have lined</l>
<l n="">their coats</l>
<l n="">Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;</l>
<l n="">And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,</l>
<l n="">It is as sure as you are Roderigo,</l>
<l n="">Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:</l>
<l n="">In following him, I follow but myself;</l>
<l n="">Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,</l>
<l n="">But seeming so, for my peculiar end:</l>
<l n="">For when my outward action doth demonstrate</l>
<l n="">The native act and figure of my heart</l>
<l n="">In compliment extern, 'tis not long after</l>
<l n="">But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve</l>
<l n="">For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<l n="">What a full fortune does the thicklips owe</l>
<l n="">If he can carry't thus!</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">Call up her father,</l>
<l n="">Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,</l>
<l n="">Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,</l>
<l n="">And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,</l>
<l n="">Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,</l>
<l n="">Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,</l>
<l n="">As it may lose some colour.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<l n="">Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell</l>
<l n="">As when, by night and negligence, the fire</l>
<l n="">Is spied in populous cities.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<l n="">What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!</l>
<l n="">Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!</l>
<l n="">Thieves! thieves!</l>
</sp>
<stage>Brabantio appears above, at a window.</stage>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Brabantio</speaker>
<l n="">What is the reason of this terrible summons?</l>
<l n="">What is the matter there?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<l n="">Signior, is all your family within?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">Are your doors lock'd?</l>

<l n="">'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on your gown;</l>    
    <pb n="311"/>
<l n="">Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;</l>
<l n="">Even now, now, very now, an old black ram</l>
<l n="">Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise;</l>
<l n="">Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,</l>
<l n="">Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:</l>
<l n="">Arise, I say.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Brabantio</speaker>
<l n="">What, have you lost your wits?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<l n="">Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Brabantio</speaker>
<l n="">Not I what are you?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<l n="">My name is Roderigo.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Brabantio</speaker>
<l n="">The worser welcome:</l>
<l n="">I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:</l>
<l n="">In honest plainness thou hast heard me say</l>
<l n="">My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,</l>
<l n="">Being full of supper and distempering draughts,</l>
<l n="">Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come</l>
<l n="">To start my quiet.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<l n="">Sir, sir, sir,--</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Brabantio</speaker>
<l n="">But thou must needs be sure</l>
<l n="">My spirit and my place have in them power</l>
<l n="">To make this bitter to thee.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<l n="">Patience, good sir.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Brabantio</speaker>
<l n="">What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;</l>
<l n="">My house is not a grange.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<l n="">Most grave Brabantio,</l>
<l n="">In simple and pure soul I come to you.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="prose">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not</l>
<l n="">serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to</l>
<l n="">do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll</l>
<l n="">have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;</l>
<l n="">you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have</l>
<l n="">coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Brabantio</speaker>
<l n="">What profane wretch art thou?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter</l>
<l n="">and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Brabantio</speaker>
<l n="">Thou art a villain.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">You are--a senator.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Brabantio</speaker>
<l n="">This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<l n="">Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,</l>
<l n="">If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,</l>
<l n="">As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,</l>
<l n="">At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,</l>
<l n="">Transported, with no worse nor better guard</l>
<l n="">But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,</l>
<l n="">To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor--</l>
<l n="">If this be known to you and your allowance,</l>
<l n="">We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;</l>
<l n="">But if you know not this, my manners tell me</l>
<l n="">We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe</l>
<l n="">That, from the sense of all civility,</l>
<l n="">I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:</l>
<l n="">Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,</l>
<l n="">I say again, hath made a gross revolt;</l>
<l n="">Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes</l>
<l n="">In an extravagant and wheeling stranger</l>
<l n="">Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:</l>
<l n="">If she be in her chamber or your house,</l>
<l n="">Let loose on me the justice of the state</l>
<l n="">For thus deluding you.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Brabantio</speaker>
<l n="">Strike on the tinder, ho!</l>
<l n="">Give me a taper! call up all my people!</l>
<l n="">This accident is not unlike my dream:</l>
<l n="">Belief of it oppresses me already.</l>
<l n="">Light, I say! light!</l>
</sp>
<stage>Exit above.</stage>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Iago</speaker>
<l n="">Farewell; for I must leave you:</l>
<l n="">It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,</l>
<l n="">To be produced--as, if I stay, I shall--</l>
<l n="">Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state,</l>
<l n="">However this may gall him with some cheque,</l>
<l n="">Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd</l>
<l n="">With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,</l>
<l n="">Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,</l>
<l n="">Another of his fathom they have none,</l>
<l n="">To lead their business: in which regard,</l>
<l n="">Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.</l>
<l n="">Yet, for necessity of present life,</l>
<l n="">I must show out a flag and sign of love,</l>
<l n="">Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,</l>
<l n="">Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;</l>
<l n="">And there will I be with him. So, farewell.</l>
</sp>
<stage>Exit.</stage>
<stage>Enter, below, Brabantio, and Servants with torches.</stage>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Brabantio</speaker>
<l n="">It is too true an evil: gone she is;</l>
<l n="">And what's to come of my despised time</l>
<l n="">Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,</l>
<l n="">Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!</l>
<l n="">With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father!</l>
<l n="">How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives me</l>
<l n="">Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers:</l>
<l n="">Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<l n="">Truly, I think they are.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Brabantio</speaker>
<l n="">O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!</l>
<l n="">Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds</l>
<l n="">By what you see them act. Is there not charms</l>
<l n="">By which the property of youth and maidhood</l>
<l n="">May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,</l>
<l n="">Of some such thing?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<l n="">Yes, sir, I have indeed.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Brabantio</speaker>
<l n="">Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!</l>
<l n="">Some one way, some another. Do you know</l>
<l n="">Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Roderigo</speaker>
<l n="">I think I can discover him, if you please,</l>
<l n="">To get good guard and go along with me.</l>
</sp>
<sp style="verse">
<speaker>Brabantio</speaker>
<l n="">Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;</l>
<l n="">I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!</l>
<l n="">And raise some special officers of night.</l>
<l n="">On, good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains.</l>
