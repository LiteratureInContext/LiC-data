                            <note>Shelley's poem "Ozymandias" was first published in a weekly newspaper called <hi rend="italic">The Examiner</hi> on January 11, 1818. <hi rend="italic">The Examiner</hi> was published in London by the brothers Leigh and John Hunt, who regularly published poetry. Our edition is transcribed from that first printing. It does have a typographical error: the open quotation in the second line is never closed, and only the first line of what seems to be Ozymandias speaking is in another set of quotation marks. But this is, however, the poem as it appeared to its first readers. The image is taken from Wikimedia Commons.</note>

(Remarkably, Mary Shelley's novel <ref target="https://anthology.lib.virginia.edu/work/Shelley/shelley-frankenstein-1818"><hi rend="italic">Frankenstein: or, the Modern Prometheus</hi></ref>, had been published less than two weeks earlier, on January 1.) Percy Shelley's pet name for Mary was (for reasons unknown) "dormouse." "Glirastes" is a compound word that Shelley made up, combining the the Latin word "gliradae," the scientific name for dormice, and the Greek "erastes," meaning "lover of." Hence "lover of dormouse"--an affectionate, coded gesture to Mary.</note></signed>
