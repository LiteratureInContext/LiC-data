                  with whom she had a close relationship before it turned acrimonious. Montagu was a
                  member of the aristocracy, daughter of the Earl of Kingston and Lady Mary Fielding
                  (yes, she was related to the Henry Fielding of <hi rend="italic">Tom Jones</hi>
                  fame!). She fled an arranged marriage and eloped with Edward Wortley Montagu. Most
                  remember her as a letter-writer, whose letters were designed for posthumous
                  publication. Most significant in these letters are those typically referred to as
                  the "Turkish Embassy" letters, because they discuss her experience traveling to
                  and living in Contantinople (now Istanbul) with her husband, who served as
                  ambassador to Turkey from 1716-1718.</p>
                        <p>Her "Town Eclogues," from which this
                  selection is taken, are a series of six adaptations of the Roman poet Virgil’s
                  Eclogues, written in 37BCE. An "eclogue" is a kind of poem that presents a snippet
                  (or a "selection") of life. In Virgil’s eclogues—a series of 10 poems—rural
                  herdsman sing and discuss their experiences, often relating to the turbulent time
                  in Rome just as the Roman Empire was emerging. In the early 18th century,
                  "Augustan" British poets saw themselves as modern inheritors of a Roman tradition
                  inaugurated by Augustus, the first Emperor of Rome.</p> 
                        <p>Montagu’s eclogues focus
                  similarly on a turbulent, transitional era characterized by the social, political,
                  and economic structures of rapid commercialization in the England and the United
                  Kingdom. These "Town Eclogues" offer a series of six poems, which you can read in
                  their entirety on <ref

                     >Eighteenth-Century Poetry Archive.</ref> The poems are organized by days of
                  the week and discuss themes of sexuality, relationships between men and women,
                  illness, and fashionable society. In this poem, "Saturday; or the Small-Pox," the
                  poetic speaker recounts the character Flavia’s thoughts about her smallpox scars,
                  which were shared by Mary Wortley Montagu herself—Montagu suffered from smallpox
                  in her youth, which marked her for the rest of her life. During her travels to
                  Turkey, she witnessed the act of inoculation for smallpox, which she employed to
                  inoculate her children. She brought word of the innovation back to England, though
                  she is not credited with its popularization. To read more about Montagu’s
                  connection with the smallpox vaccine, read <ref

                        <p>In
                  1736, Montagu fell in love with an Italian writer, and she left her husband and
                  family to live with him on the Continent, under cover of traveling for health
                  reasons. He never caught up with her in Italy, however, and she traveled through
                  France and Italy in the 40s and 50s, living for a decade with an Italian Count.
                  After her husband died in 1761, she returned to London, and died of cancer shortly
                  after. Her letters were published in 1763, but the first complete modern edition
                  was published in the 1960s. The portrait of Montagu included here was painted in
                  1725 by Jonathan Richardson. It is currently in the collection of the Earl of
                  Harrowby, Stafford (<ref

                  resp="editors.xml#BehnBurney19">Smallpox is an infectious disease caused by the
                  variola virus, which ravaged many parts of the world until its eradication in
                  1980. Throughout the eighteenth century, over 400,000 people died in Europe from
                  the disease. It is characterized by pus-filled blisters that form on the skin,
                  before hardening and falling off; smallpox often caused severe scarring and even
                  blindness among those who survived. The virus was used as a biological weapon,
                  notably by the British against Native Americans in Pontiac's War of the 1760s. The
                  disease was 90% fatal among the Amerindian population, causing mass destruction.
                  Before a vaccine was developed, the virus was managed through a process of
                  inoculation--also called variolation--whereby a small amount of infected fluid,
                  often from a cow, was introduced to a healthy person's body, causing an immune
                  response. This process of inoculation was practiced in Asia and Africa, before
                  appearing in the Ottoman Empire, where Mary Wortley Montagu witnessed the
                  procedure. To read more, see <ref

                     a fashionable entertainment past-time in the eighteenth century. Opera stars
                     were celebrities, often extravagantly-compensated, and also the subject of some
                     criticism, as <ref target="https://journals.openedition.org/1718/409">Michael
                        Burden</ref> describes in "Opera, Excess, and the Discourse of Luxury in
                     Eighteenth-Century England." Here, Flavia claims that "opera-tickets pour'd
                     before [her] feet," which would have been an extravagance, indeed. According to
                     Judith Milhous and Robert Hume, throughout much of the period ticket prices
                     were fixed at 1s 6d or 5s, for pit/boxes or gallery seating, respectively. "A
                     season subscription for fifty nights," they note, "was 15 [guineas]" (<ref
                        target="http://www.jstor.org/stable/831805">79</ref>). For more information

In the 17th and 18th centuries, it was common for fasionable people to wear "patches," or small pieces of black silk or velvet, sometimes cut into shapes. These patches--called "les mouches" in French, because they resembled a fly--would be worn on the face, sometimes to cover a blemish or simply for fashionable purposes, as an artificial beauty mark. Patches were also sometimes used to declare a particular loyalty or party.
