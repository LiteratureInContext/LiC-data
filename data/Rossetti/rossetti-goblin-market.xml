              <l n="105">‘Come buy, come buy,’ was still their cry.</l>
              <l n="106">Laura stared but did not stir,</l>
              <l n="107">Longed but had no money.</l>
              <l n="108">The whisk-tailed merchant bade her taste</l>
              <l n="109">In tones as smooth as honey,</l>
              <l n="110">The cat-faced purr’d,</l>
              <l n="111">The rat-faced spoke a word</l>
              <l n="112">Of welcome, and the snail-paced even was heard;</l>
              <l n="113">One parrot-voiced and jolly</l>
              <pb n="7" facs="pageImages/GM-7.jpg"/>
              <l n="114">Cried ‘Pretty Goblin’ still for ‘Pretty Polly;’</l>
              <l n="115">One whistled like a bird.</l>
              <l n="116">But sweet-tooth Laura spoke in haste:</l>
              <l n="117">‘Good folk, I have no coin;</l>
              <l n="118">To take were to purloin:</l>
              <l n="119">I have no copper in my purse,</l>
              <l n="120">I have no silver either,</l>
              <l n="121">And all my gold is on the furze</l>
              <l n="122">That shakes in windy weather</l>
              <l n="123">Above the rusty heather.’</l>
              <l n="124">‘You have much gold upon your head,’</l>
              <l n="125">They answered all together:</l>
              <l n="126">‘Buy from us with a golden curl.’</l>
              <l n="127">She clipped a precious golden lock,</l>
              <l n="128">She dropped a tear more rare than pearl,</l>
              <l n="129">Then sucked their fruit globes fair or red:</l>
              <l n="130">Sweeter than honey from the rock,</l>
              <l n="131">Stronger than man-rejoicing wine,</l>
              <l n="132">Clearer than water flowed that juice;</l>
              <pb n="8" facs="pageImages/GM-8.jpg"/>
              <l n="133">She never tasted such before,</l>
              <l n="134">How should it cloy with length of use?</l>
              <l n="135">She sucked and sucked and sucked the more</l>
              <l n="136">Fruits which that unknown orchard bore;</l>
              <l n="137">She sucked until her lips were sore;</l>
              <l n="138">Then flung the emptied rinds away,</l>
              <l n="139">But gathered up one kernel stone,</l>
              <l n="140">And knew not was it night or day</l>
              <l n="141">As she turned home alone.</l>
              <l n="142">Lizzie met her at the gate</l>
              <l n="143">Full of wise upbraidings:</l>
              <l n="144">‘Dear, you should not stay so late,</l>
              <l n="145">Twilight is not good for maidens;</l>
              <l n="146">Should not loiter in the glen</l>
              <l n="147">In the haunts of goblin men.</l>
              <l n="148">Do you not remember Jeanie,</l>
              <l n="149">How she met them in the moonlight,</l>
              <l n="150">Took their gifts both choice and many,</l>
              <l n="151">Ate their fruits and wore their flowers</l>
              <pb n="9" facs="pageImages/GM-9.jpg"/>
              <l n="152">Plucked from bowers</l>
              <l n="153">Where summer ripens at all hours?</l>
              <l n="154">But ever in the moonlight</l>
              <l n="155">She pined and pined away;</l>
              <l n="156">Sought them by night and day,</l>
              <l n="157">Found them no more, but dwindled and grew gray;</l>
              <l n="158">Then fell with the first snow,</l>
              <l n="159">While to this day no grass will grow</l>
              <l n="160">Where she lies low:</l>
              <l n="161">I planted daisies there a year ago</l>
              <l n="162">That never blow.</l>

              <l n="164">Nay, hush,’ said Laura:</l>
              <l n="165">Nay, hush, my sister:</l>
              <l n="166">I ate and ate my fill,</l>
              <l n="167">Yet my mouth waters still;</l>
              <l n="168">Tomorrow night I will</l>
              <l n="169">Buy more;’ and kissed her:</l>

              <l n="193">Moon and stars gazed in at them,</l>
              <l n="194">Wind sang to them lullaby,</l>
              <l n="195">Lumbering owls forbore to fly,</l>
              <l n="196">Not a bat flapped to and fro</l>
              <l n="197">Round their rest:</l>
              <l n="198">Cheek to cheek and breast to breast</l>
              <l n="199">Locked together in one nest.</l>
              <l n="200">Early in the morning</l>
              <l n="201">When the first cock crowed his warning,</l>
              <l n="202">Neat like bees, as sweet and busy,</l>
              <l n="203">Laura rose with Lizzie:</l>

              <l n="207">Cakes for dainty mouths to eat,</l>
              <l n="208">Next churned butter, whipped up cream,</l>
              <l n="209">Fed their poultry, sat and sewed;</l>
              <pb n="12" facs="pageImages/GM-12.jpg"/>
              <l n="210">Talked as modest maidens should:</l>
              <l n="211">Lizzie with an open heart,</l>
              <l n="212">Laura in an absent dream,</l>
              <l n="213">One content, one sick in part;</l>
              <l n="214">One warbling for the mere bright day’s delight,</l>
              <l n="215">One longing for the night.</l>
              <l n="216">At length slow evening came:</l>
              <l n="217">They went with pitchers to the reedy brook;</l>
              <l n="218">Lizzie most placid in her look,</l>
              <l n="219">Laura most like a leaping flame.</l>
              <l n="220">They drew the gurgling water from its deep;</l>
              <l n="221">Lizzie plucked purple and rich golden flags,</l>
              <l n="222">Then turning homeward said: ‘The sunset flushes</l>
              <l n="223">Those furthest loftiest crags;</l>
              <l n="224">Come, Laura, not another maiden lags,</l>
              <l n="225">No wilful squirrel wags,</l>
              <l n="226">The beasts and birds are fast asleep.’</l>
              <l n="227">But Laura loitered still among the rushes</l>
              <l n="228">And said the bank was steep.</l>
              <pb n="13" facs="pageImages/GM-13.jpg"/>
              <l n="229">And said the hour was early still</l>
              <l n="230">The dew not fall’n, the wind not chill:</l>
              <l n="231">Listening ever, but not catching</l>
              <l n="232">The customary cry,</l>
              <l n="233">‘Come buy, come buy,’</l>
              <l n="234">With its iterated jingle</l>
              <l n="235">Of sugar-baited words:</l>
              <l n="236">Not for all her watching</l>
              <l n="237">Once discerning even one goblin</l>
              <l n="238">Racing, whisking, tumbling, hobbling;</l>
              <l n="239">Let alone the herds</l>
              <l n="240">That used to tramp along the glen,</l>
              <l n="241">In groups or single,</l>
              <l n="242">Of brisk fruit-merchant men.</l>
              <l n="243">Till Lizzie urged, ‘O Laura, come;</l>
              <l n="244">I hear the fruit-call but I dare not look:</l>
              <l n="245">You should not loiter longer at this brook:</l>
              <l n="246">Come with me home.</l>
              <l n="247">The stars rise, the moon bends her arc,</l>

              <l n="248">Each glowworm winks her spark,</l>
              <l n="249">Let us get home before the night grows dark:</l>
              <l n="250">For clouds may gather</l>
              <l n="251">Though this is summer weather,</l>
              <l n="252">Put out the lights and drench us through;</l>
              <l n="253">Then if we lost our way what should we do?’</l>
              <l n="254">Laura turned cold as stone</l>
              <l n="255">To find her sister heard that cry alone,</l>
              <l n="256">That goblin cry,</l>
              <l n="257">‘Come buy our fruits, come buy.’</l>
              <l n="258">Must she then buy no more such dainty fruit?</l>
              <l n="259">Must she no more such succous pasture find,</l>
              <l n="260">Gone deaf and blind?</l>
              <l n="261">Her tree of life drooped from the root:</l>
              <l n="262">She said not one word in her heart’s sore ache;</l>
              <l n="263">But peering thro’ the dimness, nought discerning,</l>
              <l n="264">Trudged home, her pitcher dripping all the way;</l>
              <l n="265">So crept to bed, and lay</l>
              <l n="266">Silent till Lizzie slept;</l>
              <pb n="15" facs="pageImages/GM-15.jpg"/>
              <l n="267">Then sat up in a passionate yearning,</l>
              <l n="268">And gnashed her teeth for baulked desire, and wept</l>
              <l n="269">As if her heart would break.</l>
              <l n="270">Day after day, night after night,</l>
              <l n="271">Laura kept watch in vain</l>
              <l n="272">In sullen silence of exceeding pain.</l>
              <l n="273">She never caught again the goblin cry:</l>
              <l n="274">‘Come buy, come buy;’ —</l>
              <l n="275">She never spied the goblin men</l>
              <l n="276">Hawking their fruits along the glen:</l>
              <l n="277">But when the noon waxed bright</l>
              <l n="278">Her hair grew thin and grey;</l>
              <l n="279">She dwindled, as the fair full moon doth turn</l>
              <l n="280">To swift decay and burn</l>
              <l n="281">Her fire away.</l>
              <l n="282">One day remembering her kernel-stone</l>
              <l n="283">She set it by a wall that faced the south;</l>
              <l n="284">Dewed it with tears, hoped for a root,</l>
              <pb n="16" facs="pageImages/GM-16.jpg"/>
              <l n="285">Watched for a waxing shoot,</l>
              <l n="286">But there came none;</l>
              <l n="287">It never saw the sun,</l>
              <l n="288">It never felt the trickling moisture run:</l>
              <l n="289">While with sunk eyes and faded mouth</l>
              <l n="290">She dreamed of melons, as a traveller sees</l>
              <l n="291">False waves in desert drouth</l>
              <l n="292">With shade of leaf-crowned trees,</l>
              <l n="293">And burns the thirstier in the sandful breeze.</l>
              <l n="294">She no more swept the house,</l>
              <l n="295">Tended the fowls or cows,</l>
              <l n="296">Fetched honey, kneaded cakes of wheat,</l>
              <l n="297">Brought water from the brook:</l>
              <l n="298">But sat down listless in the chimney-nook</l>

              <l n="301">To watch her sister’s cankerous care</l>
              <l n="302">Yet not to share.</l>

              <l n="303">She night and morning</l>
              <l n="304">Caught the goblins’ cry:</l>

              <l n="307">Beside the brook, along the glen,</l>
              <l n="308">She heard the tramp of goblin men,</l>
              <l n="309">The voice and stir</l>
              <l n="310">Poor Laura could not hear;</l>
              <l n="311">Longed to buy fruit to comfort her,</l>
              <l n="312">But feared to pay too dear.</l>
              <l n="313">She thought of Jeanie in her grave,</l>
              <l n="314">Who should have been a bride;</l>
              <l n="315">But who for joys brides hope to have</l>
              <l n="316">Fell sick and died</l>
              <l n="317">In her gay prime,</l>
              <l n="318">In earliest Winter time</l>
              <l n="319">With the first glazing rime,</l>

              <l n="322">Seemed knocking at Death’s door:</l>

              <l n="324">Better and worse;</l>
              <l n="325">But put a silver penny in her purse,</l>

              <l n="327">At twilight, halted by the brook:</l>
              <l n="328">And for the first time in her life</l>
              <l n="329">Began to listen and look.</l>
              <l n="330">Laughed every goblin</l>
