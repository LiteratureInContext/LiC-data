    <titlePart><ref target="Wycherley_" corresp="Wycherley">The Country-Wife,</ref><note xml:id="Wycherley" target="Wycherley_"><p>Theater was central to the culture of Restoration London. The restored monarch, Charles II, wanted to assert the centrality of the theater in English culture as a way of harkening back to the glory days of the Stuart dynasty in the early part of the century, when his grandfather James I had been the patron of William Shakespeare’s theatrical company, and when Ben Jonson and Inigo Jones had designed extravagant “masques” for performance at court. But Charles and his courtiers also brought back many of the norms of the Continental stage with them when they returned to power in 1660: proscenium arched, indoor playhouses with moveable scenery, for example, and actresses in the women’s parts. These changes marked a decisive break with the norms of the professional theaters of the Elizabethan era in England, where scenery was minimal to nonexistent, and where the women's parts were played by young men. During his first years in power, Charles supported the new theaters in a number of ways: he was the official patron of the company performing at the playhouse in Drury Lane where <hi rend="italic">The Country Wife</hi> was first staged; he attended plays at both state-licensed playhouses frequently; he even occasionally suggested plots to dramatists. Even more important than this personal connection was an <hi rend="italic">ideological</hi> alliance between the theater and the culture; this era found in the playhouse a mirror of its own highly performative character. The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries found themselves confronting an issue that has haunted culture ever since: how can we know if people are real and authentic, or merely performers, acting social roles in the manner of an actor in a theater? <hi rend="italic">The Country Wife</hi> is one of many literary works from this period that probes this question.</p> <p>William Wycherley became a courtier in the 1670s, and his plays are set in the world of fashionable London libertines like himself. Horner, the antihero at the center of <hi rend="italic">The Country Wife</hi>, is a familiar type of the period: a rake, for “rake-hell,” so called from the hellfire that such men seemed to be daring themselves to by their scandalous behavior. At the time, some observers thought that Wycherley had modeled Horner on the notorious libertine the Earl of Rochester. That might be the case, or it might simply be that Rochester was so famous and notorious in these years that he could readily be associated with any libertine figure. In any case, Horner is certainly following the libertine’s central ethical imperative--to pursue his own pleasures wherever they may lead him, and to use his “wit,” which in this period meant simply intellect, to get what he wants. Here, he advances his desire to pursue sexual relationships with the wives of men he knows by feigning impotence; men will think that he is not a threat, and women will be assured that they can conduct an affair with no damage to their reputations. What follows surprises even Horner, though, as he discovers that women--both Town women like Lady Fidget and even young Margery Pinchwife, the country wife of the title--have desires of their own, and cannot be as easily manipulated as he thought.</p>
      
        <p><hi rend="italic">The Country Wife</hi> is one of the most powerful expressions of late seventeenth-century English culture, and it remained a popular play for decades in theaters throughout the English-speaking world. This play has often been classed by theater historians as a “sex comedy,” for reasons that are obvious. But Wycherley is also interested in complex social issues, such as the confrontation between the values of the town and those of the country, the male anxiety over women’s agency and autonomy, and language as the medium through which all of these social norms are expressed and fought over. Some of this concern over language is apparant in the names of the play’s characters. Some characters--Horner, Pinchwife, the Fidgets, Quack, etc.--have names reminiscent of the allegorical names in a contemporary religious text like John Bunyan’s <hi rend="italic">The Pilgrim’s Progress</hi>. Such names suggest a fairly direct correspondence between a person’s name and their nature--Horner “horns in on” other relationships, for example, attempting to put the horns of the cuckold on a man guilty of being excessively controlling of his wife--such as the equally-aptly named Pinchwife.</p>
        
        <p>At the same time, and going against the grain of such directness, Wycherley is concerned with how many words lend themselves to misunderstanding because they can signify different things: starting with the vulgar pun in its title that practically dares the reader not to notice it, <hi rend="italic">The Country Wife </hi>includes plays on words like “honour,” “civil,” “business,” “frank,” and, most famously “china,” which accumulates multiple, increasingly sexual associations in the play’s central scene. As a general rule of thumb, while you are reading <hi rend="italic">The Country Wife</hi>, if you think that you see a dirty joke or a double-entendre, you are probably not mistaken; Wycherley has almost certainly indeed put it there. Yet that free play of language that the characters revel in, and that is so productive of <hi rend="italic">The Country Wife</hi>'s success as a comedy, leads to a serious question. With language itself so unpredictable, so uncontrollable, Wycherley seems to be saying, how can people communicate honestly with each other? Beneath the play’s scandalous subject matter, the play seems designed to provoke serious questions about social norms, communication, and the possibilities for cohesion and harmony in his culture.</p></note>

<l>The late so basted Scribler of this day,</l>
<l>Though he stands trembling, bids me boldly say,</l>
<l>What we, before most Playes are us'd to do,</l>
<l>For Poets out of fear, first draw on you;</l>

<l>Now, and at any time, to a full Pit;</l>
<l>Nay, often we anticipate your rage,</l>
<l>And murder Poets for you, on our Stage:</l>
<l>We set no Guards upon our Tyring-Room,</l>

I have told all the Chamber-maids, Waiting women, Tyre women, and Old women of my acquaintance; nay, and whisper'd it as a secret to'em, and to the Whisperers of

Your late journey into

<p>Dear Mr. Doctor, let vain Rogues be contented only to be thought abler Men than they are, generally 'tis all the pleasure they have, but mine lyes another way.</p>

<speaker>Qu.</speaker>
<p>You take, methinks, a very preposterous way to it, and as a ridiculous as if we Operators in Physick, shou'd put forth Bills to disparage our Medicaments, with hopes to gain Customers.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hor</speaker>
<p>Doctor, there are Quacks in love, as well as Physick, who get but the fewer and worse Patients, for their boastings a good name is seldom got by giving it ones self, and Women no more than honour are compass'd by bragging : Come, come Doctor, the wisest Lawyer never discovers the merits of his cause till the tryal; the wealthiest Man conceals his riches, and the cunning Gamster his play; Shy Husbands and Keepers like old Rooks are not to be cheated, but by a new unpractis'd trick; false friendship will pass now no more than false dice upon'em, no, not in the City.</p>

<p>Nay, by this means you may be the more acquainted with the Husbands, but the less with the Wives.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hor</speaker>
<p>Let me alone, if I can but abuse the Husbands, I'll soon disabuse the Wives: Stay—I'll reckon you up the advantages, I am like to have by my Stratagem: First, I shall be rid of all my old Acquaintances, the most insatiable sorts of Duns, that invade our Lodgings in a morning: And next, to the pleasure of making a New Mistriss is that of being rid of an old One, and of all old Debts; Love when it comes to be so, is paid the most unwillingly.</p>

<p>Well, you may be so rid of your old Acquaintances; but how will you get any new Ones?</p>

<p>
Doctor, thou wilt never make a good Chymist, thou art so incredulous and impatient; ask but all the young Fellows of the Town, if they do not loose more time like Huntsmen, in starting the game, than in running it down; one
<pb n="6"/>
knows not where to find'em, who will, or will not; Women of Quality are so civil, you can hardly distinguish love from good breeding, and a Man is often mistaken; but now I can be sure, she that shews an aversion to me loves the sport, as those Women that are gone, whom I warrant to be right: And then the next thing, is your Women of Honour, as you call'em, are only chary of their reputations, not their Persons, and 'tis scandal they wou'd avoid, not Men: Now may I have, by the reputation of an Eunuch, the Priviledges of One; and be seen in a Ladies Chamber, in a morning as early as her Husband; kiss Virgins before their Parents, or Lovers; and may be in short the

</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hor</speaker>
<p>Well a Pox on love and wenching, Women serve but to keep a Man from better Company; though I can't enjoy them, I shall you the more: good fellowship and friendship, are lasting, rational and manly pleasures.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>For all that give me some of those pleasures, you call effeminate too, they help to relish one another.</p>
</sp>

<p>They disturb one another.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>No, Mistresses are like Books; if you pore upon them too much, they doze you, and make you unfit for Company; but if us'd discreetly, you are the fitter for conversation by'em.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>A Mistress shou'd be like a little Country retreat near the Town, not to dwell in constantly, but only for a night and away; to tast the Town the better when a Man returns.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hor</speaker>
<p>I tell you, 'tis as hard to be a good Fellow, a good Friend, and a Lover of Women, as 'tis to be a good Fellow, a good Friend, and a Lover of Money : You cannot follow both, then choose your side; Wine gives you liberty, Love takes it away.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Gad, he's in the right on't.</p>
</sp>

<p>But prethee, why woud'st thou marry her? if she be ugly, ill bred, and silly, she must be rich then.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pin.</speaker>
<p>
As rich as if she brought me twenty thousand pound out of this Town; for she'l be as sure not to spend her moderate portion, as a
<hi rend="italic">London</hi>
Baggage wou'd be to spend hers, let it be what it wou'd; so 'tis all one: then because shes ugly, she's the likelyer to be my own; and being ill bred, she'l hate conversation; and since silly and innocent, will not know the difference betwixt a Man of one and twenty, and one of forty
</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hor</speaker>
<p>
Nine—to my knowledge; but if she be silly, she'l expect as much from a Man of forty nine, as from him of one and twenty: But methinks wit is more necessary than beauty,
<pb n="13"/>
and I think no young Woman ugly that has it, and no handsome Woman agreable without it.
</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pin.</speaker>
<p>'Tis my maxime, he's a Fool that marrys, but he's a greater that does not marry a Fool; what is wit in a Wife good for, but to make a Man a Cuckold?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hor</speaker>
<p>Yes, to keep it from his knowledge.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pin.</speaker>
<p>A Fool cannot contrive to make her husband a Cuckold.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hor</speaker>
<p>No, but she'l club with a Man that can; and what is worse, if she cannot make her Husband a Cuckold, she'l make him jealous, and pass for one, and then 'tis all one.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pin.</speaker>
<p>
Well, well, I'll take care for one, my Wife shall make me no Cuckold, though she had your help Mr.

<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>'Tis more than age can do.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hor</speaker>
<p>No, the word is, I'll marry and live honest; but a Marriage vow is like a penitent Gamesters Oath, and entring into Bonds, and penalties to stint himself to such a particular small sum at play for the future, which makes him but the more eager, and not being able to hold out, looses his Money again, and his forfeit to boot.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay, a Gamester will be a Gamester, whilst his Money lasts; and a Whoremaster, whilst his vigour.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>Nay, I have known'em, when they are broke and can loose no more, keep a fumbling with the Box in their hands to fool with only, and hinder other Gamesters.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>That had wherewithal to make lusty stakes.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pin.</speaker>
<p>Well, Gentlemen, you may laugh at me, but you shall never lye with my Wife, I know the Town.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

<p>But prethee, was not the way you were in better, is not keeping better than Marriage?</p>

</sp>
<pb n="14"/>
<sp>
<speaker>Hor</speaker>
<p>So then you only marry'd to keep a Whore to your self; well, but let me tell you, Women, as you say, are like Souldiers made constant and loyal by good pay, rather than by Oaths and Covenants, therefore I'd advise my Friends to keep rather than marry; since too I find by your example, it does not serve ones turn, for I saw you yesterday in the eighteen penny place with a pretty Country-wench.</p>

Hark you, Madam, take my advice in your anger; you know you often want one to make up your droling pack of hombre Players; and you may cheat him easily, for he's an ill Gamester, and consequently loves play: Besides you know, you have but two old civil Gentlemen (with stinking breaths too) to wait upon you abroad, take in the third, into your service; the other are but crazy: and a Lady shou;d have a horse, least sometimes you shou'd be forc'd to stay at home.

<p>He! he, I tell you, is my Rival, and will hinder my love.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hor</speaker>
<p>No, a foolish Rival, and a jealous Husband assist their Rivals designs; for they are sure to make their Women hate them, which is the first step to their love, for another Man.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>But I cannot come near his Mistriss, but in his company.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hor</speaker>
<p>Still the better for you, for Fools are most easily cheated, when they themselves are accessaries; and he is to be bubled of his Mistriss, as of his Money, the common Mistriss, by keeping him company.</p>

<p>I make love to her?</p>
</sp>

<p>Nay, I forgive thee; for I think I know thee, and I know her, but I am sure I know my self.</p>
</sp>
<sp>

Did she tell you so? I see all Women are like these of the

Ay, Women are as apt to tell before the intrigue, as Men after it, and so shew themselves the vainer Sex; but hast thou a Mistriss,
<hi rend="italic">Sparkish</hi>
? 'tis as hard for me to believe it, as that thou ever hadst a buble, as tou brag'd just now.
</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Spar.</speaker>
<p>
O your Servant, Sir; are you at your raillery, Sir? but we were some of us beforehand with you to day at the
<pb n="38"/>
Play: the Wits were something bold with you, Sir; did you not hear us laugh?
</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>Yes, But I thought you had gone to Plays, to laugh at the Poets wit, not at your own.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Spar.</speaker>
<p>Your Servant, Sir, no thank you; gad I go to a Play as to a Country-treat, I carry my own wine to one, and my own wit to t'other, or else I'm sure I shou'd not be merry at either; and the reason why we are so often lowder, than the players, is, because we think we speak more wit, and so become the Poets Rivals in his audience: for to tell you the truth, we hate the silly Rogues; nay, so much that we find fault even with their Bawdy upon the Stage, whilst we talk nothing else in the Pit as lowd.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hor</speaker>
<p>But, why should'st thou hate the silly Poets, thou hast too much wit to be one, and they like Whores are only hated by each other; and thou dost scorn writing, I'am sure.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Spar.</speaker>
<p>
Yes, I'd have you to know, I scorn writing; but Women, Women, that make Men do all foolish things, make'em write Songs too; every body does it: 'tis ev'n as common with Lovers, as playing with fans; and you can no more help Rhyming to your

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Har.</speaker>
<p>Nay, Poetry in love is no more to be avoided, than jealousy.</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dor.</speaker>
<p>But the Poets damn'd your Songs, did they?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Spar.</speaker>
<p>
Damn the Poets, they turn'd'em into Burlesque, as they call it; that Burlesque is a
<hi rend="italic">Hocus-Pocus</hi>
-trick, they have got, which by the virtue of
<hi rend="italic">Hictius doctius, topsey turvey</hi>
, they make a wise and witty Man in the World, a Fool upon the Stage you know not how; and 'tis therefore I hate'em too, for I know not but it may be my own case; for they'l put a Man into a Play for looking a Squint: Their Predecessors were contented to make Serving-men only their Stage-Fools, but these Rogues must have Gentlemen, with a Pox to'em, nay Knights: and indeed you shall hardly see a Fool upon the Stage, but he's a Knight; and to tell you the truth, they have kept me these six years from being a Knight in earnest, for fear of being knighted in a Play, and dubb'd a Fool.

<p>'Tis but being on the Stage, instead of standing on a Bench in the Pit.</p>

<p>Well that's a better reason, dear Friend; I wou'd not go near her now, for her's, or my own sake, but I can deny you nothing; for though I have known thee a great while, never go, if I do not love thee, as well as a new Acquaintance.</p>
</sp>

<p>I am oblig'd to you indeed, dear Friend, I wou'd be well with her only, to be well with thee still; for these tyes to Wives usually dissolve all tyes to Friends: I wou'd be contented, she shou'd enjoy you a nights, but I wou'd have you to my self a dayes, as I have had, dear Friend.</p>

<p>O amongst Friends, amongst Friends; for your Bigots in Honour, are just like those in Religion; they fear the eye of the world, more than the eye of Heaven, and think there is no virtue, but railing at vice; and no sin, but giving scandal: They rail at a poor, little, kept Player, and keep themselves some young, modest Pulpit Comedian to be privy to their sins in their Closets, not to tell 'em of them in their Chappels.</p>

<p>If you talk a word more of your Honour, you'll make me incapacle to wrong it; to talk of Honour in the mysteries of Love, is like talking of Heaven, or the Deity in an operation of Witchcraft, just when you are employing the Devil, it makes the charm impotent.</p>

<p>What all alone, not so much as one of your Cuckolds here, nor one of their Wives! they use to take their turns with you, as if they were to watch you</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hor</speaker>
<p>Yes it often happens, that a Cuckold is but his Wifes spye, and is more upon family duty, when he is with her gallant abroad hindring his pleasure, than when he is at home with her playing the Gallant, but the hardest duty a married woman imposes upon a lover is, keeping her husband company always</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Quack.</speaker>
<p>And his fondness wearies you almost as soon as hers</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hor</speaker>
<p>A Pox, keeping a Cuckold company after you have had his Wife, is as tiresome as the company of a Country Squire to a witty fellow of the Town, when he has got all his Mony</p>

</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hor</speaker>
<p>A Pox he's as surly as an Alderman that has been bit, and since he's so coy, his Wife's kindness is in vain, for she's a silly innocent</p>

<l>Then slink away, a fresh one to ingage,</l>

<l>You'd frighten listning Actress on the Stage:</l>
