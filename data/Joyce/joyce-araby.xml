        <p>
            North Richmond Street, being blind, was a quiet street except at the hour when
            the Christian Brothers’ School set the boys free. An uninhabited house of
            two storeys stood at the blind end, detached from its neighbours in a square
            ground. The other houses of the street, conscious of decent lives within them,
            gazed at one another with brown imperturbable faces.
        </p>
        <p>
            The former tenant of our house, a priest, had died in the back drawing-room.
            Air, musty from having been long enclosed, hung in all the rooms, and the waste
            room behind the kitchen was littered with old useless papers. Among these I
            found a few paper-covered books, the pages of which were curled and damp:
            <hi rend="italic">The Abbot</hi>, by Walter Scott, <hi rend="italic">The Devout Communicant</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The
                Memoirs of Vidocq</hi>. I liked the last best because its leaves were yellow.
            The wild garden behind the house contained a central apple-tree and a few
            straggling bushes under one of which I found the late tenant’s rusty
            bicycle-pump. He had been a very charitable priest; in his will he had left all
            his money to institutions and the furniture of his house to his sister.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the short days of winter came dusk fell before we had well eaten our
            dinners. When we met 
            <pb n="34" facs="pageImages/araby_34.png"/>
            in the street the houses had grown sombre. The space of
            sky above us was the colour of ever-changing violet and towards it the lamps of
            the street lifted their feeble lanterns. The cold air stung us and we played
            till our bodies glowed. Our shouts echoed in the silent street. The career of
            our play brought us through the dark muddy lanes behind the houses where we ran
            the gauntlet of the rough tribes from the cottages, to the back doors of the
            dark dripping gardens where odours arose from the ashpits, to the dark odorous
            stables where a coachman smoothed and combed the horse or shook music from the
            buckled harness. When we returned to the street light from the kitchen windows
            had filled the areas. If my uncle was seen turning the corner we hid in the
            shadow until we had seen him safely housed. Or if Mangan’s sister came
            out on the doorstep to call her brother in to his tea we watched her from our
            shadow peer up and down the street. We waited to see whether she would remain
            or go in and, if she remained, we left our shadow and walked up to
            Mangan’s steps resignedly. She was waiting for us, her figure defined by
            the light from the half-opened door. Her brother always teased her before he
            obeyed and I stood by the railings looking at her. Her dress swung as she moved
            her body and the soft rope of her hair tossed from side to side.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every morning I lay on the floor in the front parlour watching her door. The
            blind was pulled down to within an inch of the sash so that I could not be
            seen. When she came out on the doorstep my         
            <pb n="35" facs="pageImages/araby_35.jpg"/>
            heart leaped. I ran to the hall,
            seized my books and followed her. I kept her brown figure always in my eye and,
            when we came near the point at which our ways diverged, I quickened my pace and
            passed her. This happened morning after morning. I had never spoken to her,
            except for a few casual words, and yet her name was like a summons to all my
            foolish blood.
        </p>
        <p>
            Her image accompanied me even in places the most hostile to romance. On
            Saturday evenings when my aunt went marketing I had to go to carry some of the
            parcels. We walked through the flaring streets, jostled by drunken men and
            bargaining women, amid the curses of labourers, the shrill litanies of
            shop-boys who stood on guard by the barrels of pigs’ cheeks, the nasal
            chanting of street-singers, who sang a <hi rend="italic">come-all-you</hi> about
            O’Donovan Rossa, or a ballad about the troubles in our native land. These
            noises converged in a single sensation of life for me: I imagined that I bore
            my chalice safely through a throng of foes. Her name sprang to my lips at
            moments in strange prayers and praises which I myself did not understand. My
            eyes were often full of tears (I could not tell why) and at times a flood from
            my heart seemed to pour itself out into my bosom. I thought little of the
            future. I did not know whether I would ever speak to her or not or, if I spoke
            to her, how I could tell her of my confused adoration. But my body was like a
            harp and her words and gestures were like fingers running upon the wires.
        </p>
        <p>
            One evening I went into the back drawing-room 
            <pb n="36" facs="pageImages/araby_36.jpg"/>
            in which the priest had died. It
            was a dark rainy evening and there was no sound in the house. Through one of
            the broken panes I heard the rain impinge upon the earth, the fine incessant
            needles of water playing in the sodden beds. Some distant lamp or lighted
            window gleamed below me. I was thankful that I could see so little. All my
            senses seemed to desire to veil themselves and, feeling that I was about to
            slip from them, I pressed the palms of my hands together until they trembled,
            murmuring: <hi rend="italic">“O love! O love!”</hi> many times.
        </p>
        <p>
            At last she spoke to me. When she addressed the first words to me I was so
            confused that I did not know what to answer. She asked me was I going to
            <hi rend="italic">Araby</hi>. I forgot whether I answered yes or no. It would be a splendid
            bazaar, she said; she would love to go.
        </p>
        <p>
            “And why can’t you?” I asked.
        </p>
        <p>
            While she spoke she turned a silver bracelet round and round her wrist. She
            could not go, she said, because there would be a retreat that week in her
            convent. Her brother and two other boys were fighting for their caps and I was
            alone at the railings. She held one of the spikes, bowing her head towards me.
            The light from the lamp opposite our door caught the white curve of her neck,
            lit up her hair that rested there and, falling, lit up the hand upon the
            railing. It fell over one side of her dress and caught the white border of a
            petticoat, just visible as she stood at ease.
        </p>
        <p>
            “It’s well for you,” she said.
        </p>
        <p>
            “If I go,” I said, “I will bring you something.”
            <pb n="37" facs="pageImages/araby_37.jpg"/>
        </p>
        <p>
            What innumerable follies laid waste my waking and sleeping thoughts after that
            evening! I wished to annihilate the tedious intervening days. I chafed against
            the work of school. At night in my bedroom and by day in the classroom her
            image came between me and the page I strove to read. The syllables of the word
            <hi rend="italic">Araby</hi> were called to me through the silence in which my soul luxuriated
            and cast an Eastern enchantment over me. I asked for leave to go to the bazaar
            on Saturday night. My aunt was surprised and hoped it was not some Freemason
            affair. I answered few questions in class. I watched my master’s face
            pass from amiability to sternness; he hoped I was not beginning to idle. I
            could not call my wandering thoughts together. I had hardly any patience with
            the serious work of life which, now that it stood between me and my desire,
            seemed to me child’s play, ugly monotonous child’s play.
        </p>
        <p>
            On Saturday morning I reminded my uncle that I wished to go to the bazaar in
            the evening. He was fussing at the hallstand, looking for the hat-brush, and
            answered me curtly:
        </p>
        <p>
            “Yes, boy, I know.”
        </p>
        <p>
            As he was in the hall I could not go into the front parlour and lie at the
            window. I left the house in bad humour and walked slowly towards the school.
            The air was pitilessly raw and already my heart misgave me.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I came home to dinner my uncle had not yet been home. Still it was early.
            I sat staring at the clock for some time and, when its ticking began 
            <pb n="38" facs="pageImages/araby_38.jpg"/>
            to irritate me, I left the room. I mounted the staircase and gained the upper part
            of the house. The high cold empty gloomy rooms liberated me and I went from
            room to room singing. From the front window I saw my companions playing below
            in the street. Their cries reached me weakened and indistinct and, leaning my
            forehead against the cool glass, I looked over at the dark house where she
            lived. I may have stood there for an hour, seeing nothing but the brown-clad
            figure cast by my imagination, touched discreetly by the lamplight at the
            curved neck, at the hand upon the railings and at the border below the dress.

            When I came downstairs again I found Mrs Mercer sitting at the fire. She was an
            old garrulous woman, a pawnbroker’s widow, who collected used stamps for
            some pious purpose. I had to endure the gossip of the tea-table. The meal was
            prolonged beyond an hour and still my uncle did not come. Mrs Mercer stood up
            to go: she was sorry she couldn’t wait any longer, but it was after eight
            o’clock and she did not like to be out late as the night air was bad for
            her. When she had gone I began to walk up and down the room, clenching my
            fists. My aunt said:
        </p>
        <p>
            “I’m afraid you may put off your bazaar for this night of Our
            Lord.”
        </p>
        <p>
            At nine o’clock I heard my uncle’s latchkey in the halldoor. I
            heard him talking to himself and heard the hallstand rocking when it had
            received the weight of his overcoat. I could interpret these signs. When he was
            midway through his dinner I asked him 
            <pb n="39" facs="pageImages/araby_39.jpg"/>
            to give me the money to go to the bazaar. He had forgotten.
        </p>
        <p>
            “The people are in bed and after their first sleep now,” he said.
        </p>
        <p>
            I did not smile. My aunt said to him energetically:
        </p>
        <p>
            “Can’t you give him the money and let him go? You’ve kept him
            late enough as it is.”
        </p>
        <p>
            My uncle said he was very sorry he had forgotten. He said he believed in the
            old saying: “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.” He asked
            me where I was going and, when I had told him a second time he asked me did I
            know <hi rend="italic">The Arab’s Farewell to his Steed</hi>. When I left the kitchen he
            was about to recite the opening lines of the piece to my aunt.
        </p>
        <p>
            I held a florin tightly in my hand as I strode down Buckingham Street towards
            the station. The sight of the streets thronged with buyers and glaring with gas
            recalled to me the purpose of my journey. I took my seat in a third-class
            carriage of a deserted train. After an intolerable delay the train moved out of
            the station slowly. It crept onward among ruinous houses and over the twinkling
            river. At Westland Row Station a crowd of people pressed to the carriage doors;
            but the porters moved them back, saying that it was a special train for the
            bazaar. I remained alone in the bare carriage. In a few minutes the train drew
            up beside an improvised wooden platform. I passed out on to the road and saw by
            the lighted dial of a clock that it was ten minutes to ten. In front of me was
            a large building which displayed the magical name.           
            <pb n="40" facs="pageImages/araby_40.jpg"/>
        </p>
        <p>
            I could not find any sixpenny entrance and, fearing that the bazaar would be
            closed, I passed in quickly through a turnstile, handing a shilling to a
            weary-looking man. I found myself in a big hall girdled at half its height by a
            gallery. Nearly all the stalls were closed and the greater part of the hall was
            in darkness. I recognised a silence like that which pervades a church after a
            service. I walked into the centre of the bazaar timidly. A few people were
            gathered about the stalls which were still open. Before a curtain, over which
            the words <hi rend="italic">Café Chantant</hi> were written in coloured lamps, two men were
            counting money on a salver. I listened to the fall of the coins.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remembering with difficulty why I had come I went over to one of the stalls and
            examined porcelain vases and flowered tea-sets. At the door of the stall a
            young lady was talking and laughing with two young gentlemen. I remarked their
            English accents and listened vaguely to their conversation.
        </p>
        <p>
            “O, I never said such a thing!”
        </p>
        <p>
            “O, but you did!”
        </p>
        <p>
            “O, but I didn’t!”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Didn’t she say that?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Yes. I heard her.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “O, there’s a ... fib!”
        </p>
        <p>
            Observing me the young lady came over and asked me did I wish to buy anything.
            The tone of her voice was not encouraging; she seemed to have spoken to me out
            of a sense of duty. I looked humbly at the great jars that stood like eastern
            <pb n="41" facs="pageImages/araby_41.jpg"/>
            guards at either side of the dark entrance to the stall and murmured:
        </p>
        <p>
            “No, thank you.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The young lady changed the position of one of the vases and went back to the
            two young men. They began to talk of the same subject. Once or twice the young
            lady glanced at me over her shoulder.
        </p>
        <p>
            I lingered before her stall, though I knew my stay was useless, to make my
            interest in her wares seem the more real. Then I turned away slowly and walked
            down the middle of the bazaar. I allowed the two pennies to fall against the
            sixpence in my pocket. I heard a voice call from one end of the gallery that
            the light was out. The upper part of the hall was now completely dark.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gazing up into the darkness I saw myself as a creature driven and derided by
            vanity; and my eyes burned with anguish and anger.
