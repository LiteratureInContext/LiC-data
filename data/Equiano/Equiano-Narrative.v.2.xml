            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as sGML (TCP schema; AsCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>EVERY day now brought me nearer my freedom, and I was impatient till we proceeded again to sea, that I might have an opportunity of getting a sum large enough to purchase it.--- I was not long ungratified; for, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the year 1766, my master bought another sloop, named the <hi rend= "italic">Nancy</hi>, the largest I had ever seen. She was partly laden, and was to proceed to <hi rend= "italic">Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia</hi>; our Captain had his choice of three, and I was well pleased he chose this, which was the largest; for, from his having a large vessel, I had more room, and could carry a larger quantity of goods with me. Accordingly, when we had delivered our old vessel, the <hi rend= "italic">Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>, and completed the lading of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0324600502:4"/>
the <hi rend= "italic">Nancy</hi>, having made near three hundred per cent, by four barrels of pork I brought from <hi rend= "italic">Charlestown</hi>, I laid in as large a cargo as I could, trusting to God's providence to prosper my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking. With these views I sailed for <hi rend= "italic">Philadelphia</hi>. On our passage, when we drew near the land, I was for the first time surprised at the sight of some whales, having never seen any such large sea monsters before; and as we sailed by the land, one morning I saw a puppy whale close by the vessel; it was about the length of a <span= "a" corresp= "n">wherry boat</span> <note id= "n" target= "a" type= "gloss">A 15 to 20 foot long boat traditionally used to carry cargo and passengers in rivers and canals in England (Wikipedia)</note>, and it followed us all the day till we got within the <hi rend= "italic">Capes</hi>. We arrived safe and in good time at <hi rend= "italic">Philadelphia</hi>, and I sold my goods there chiefly to the quakers. They always appeared to be a very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest discreet sort of people, and never attempted to impose on me; I therefore liked them, and ever after chose to deal
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0324600502:5"/>
with them in preference to any others.</p>
            <p>One sunday morning while I was here, as I was going to church, I chanced to pass a meeting-house. The doors being open, and the house full of people, it excited my curiosity to go in. When I entered the house, to my great sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, I saw a very tall woman standing in the midst of them, speaking in an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible voice something which I could not understand. Having never seen any thing of this kind before, I stood and stared about me for some time, wondering at this odd scene. As soon as it was over, I took an opportunity to make inquiry about the place and people, when I was informed they were called Quakers. I particularly asked what that woman I saw in the midst of them had said, but none of them were pleased to satisfy me, so I quitted them, and soon after, as I was returning, I came to a church
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0324600502:6"/>
crowded with people; the church-yard was full likewise, and a number of people were even mounted on ladders, looking in at the windows. I thought this a strange sight, as I had never seen churches, either in <hi rend= "italic">England</hi> or the <hi rend= "italic">West Indies</hi> crowded in this manner before. I therefore made bold to ask some peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the meaning of all this, and they told me the Rev. Mr. George <hi rend= "italic">Whitfield</hi> was preaching. I had often heard of this gentleman, and had wished to see and hear him; but I had never before had an opportunity. I now therefore resolved to gratify myself with the sight, and pressed in amidst the multitude.--- When I got into the church I saw this pious man exhorting the people with the greatest fervour and earnestness, and sweating as much as I ever did while in slavery on <hi rend= "italic">Montserrat</hi> beach. I was very much struck and impressed with
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0324600502:7"/>
this; I thought it strange I had never seen divines exert themselves in this manner before, and was no longer at a loss to account for the thin congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations they preached to.</p>
            <p>When we had discharged our cargo here, and were loaded again, we left this fruitful land once more, and set sail for <hi rend= "italic">Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serrat</hi>. My <span id= "a" corresp= "n">traffic<note id= "n" target= "a" notetype= "gloss">By which Equiano means his trade history (Oxford English Dictionary)</note> had hitherto suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded so well with me, that I thought by selling my goods when we arrived at <hi rend= "italic">Montserrat</hi>, I should have enough to purchase my freedom. But as soon as our vessel arrived there, my master came on board, and gave orders for us to go to <hi rend= "italic">St. Eustatia</hi>, and discharge our cargo there, and from thence proceed for <hi rend= "italic">Georgia</hi>. I was much disappointed at this; but, thinking as usual, it was of no use to encounter with the decrees of fate, I submitted without repining, and we went to <hi rend= "italic">St. Eustatia</hi>. After we
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0324600502:8"/>
had discharged our cargo there, we took in a live cargo, (as we call a cargo of slaves.) Here I sold my goods tolerably well; but, not being able to lay out all my money in this small island to as much advantage as in many other places, I laid out only part, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder I brought away with me <span id= "a" corresp= "n">neat<note id= "n" target= "a" notetype= "gloss"> In good condition (Oxford English Dictionary)</note>. We sailed from hence for <hi rend= "italic">Georgia</hi>, and I was glad when we got there, though I had not much reason to like the place from my last adventure in <hi rend= "italic">Savannah</hi>; but I longed to get back to <hi rend= "italic">Montserrat</hi> and procure my freedom, which I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be able to purchase when I returned. As soon as we arrived here I waited on my careful doctor, Mr. <hi rend= "italic">Brady</hi>, to whom I made the most grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acknowledgments in my power for his former kindness and attention during my illness.</p>
            <p>While we remained here an odd cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance happened to the captain
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0324600502:9"/>
and me, which disappointed us both a good deal. A silversmith, whom we had brought to this place some voyages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, agreed with the Captain to return with us to the <hi rend= "italic">West Indies</hi>, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised at the same time to give the Captain a great deal of money, having pretended to take a liking to him, and being, as we thought, very rich. But while we stayed to load our vessel, this man was taken ill, in a house where we worked, and in a week's time became very bad. The worse he grew the more he used to speak of giving the Captain what he had promised him, so that he expected something considerable from the death of this man, who had no wife or child, and he attended him day and night. I used also to go with the Captain, at his own desire, to attend him: especially when we saw there was no appearance of his recovery: and, in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0324600502:10"/>
order to recompense me for my trouble, the Captain promised me ten pounds, when he should get the man's property. I thought this would be of great service to me, although I had nearly money enough to purchase my freedom, if I should get safe this voyage to <hi rend= "italic">Montserrat</hi>. In this expectation I laid out above eight pounds of my money for a suit of superfine clothes to dance in at my freedom, which I hoped was then at hand.--- We still continued to attend this man, being with him the last day he lived till very late at night. After we were got to bed, about one or two o'clock in the morning, the Captain was sent for, and informed the man was dead. On this he came to my bed, and, wak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, informed me of it, and desired me to get up and procure a light, and immediately go with him. I told him I
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0324600502:11"/>
was very sleepy, and wished he would take somebody else with him; or else, as the man was dead, and could want no farther attendance, to let all things remain as they were till the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'No, no,'</q> said he, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'we will have the money to night, I cannot wait till to-morrow; so let us go.'</q> Accordingly I got up and struck a light, and <hi rend= "italic">away we both went, and saw the man as dead as we could wish</hi>. The Captain said he would give him a grand burial, in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude for the promised treasure; and desired that all the things belonging to the deceased might be brought forth. Amongnst others there was a nest of drawers, of which he had kept the keys whilst the man was ill, and we opened them with no small eagerness and expectation; and as there were a great number within one another, with much impatience we
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0324600502:12"/>
took them one out of the other. At last, when we came to the smallest, and had opened it, we perceived it to be full of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and supposed to be notes; at the sight of which our hearts leapt for joy; and that instant the Captain clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his hands, cried out, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'Thank God here it is.'</q> But when we came to the  supposed treasure and long-looked-for bounty, (alas! alas! how uncertain and deceitful are all human affairs!) <hi rend= "italic">what had we found?</hi> While we thought we were embracing a substance, we grasped an empty nothing. The whole amount in the nest of drawers being only one dollar and a half; and all that the man possessed would not pay for his coffin!. Our sudden and exquisite joy was now succeeded by a sudden and exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site pain; and my Captain and I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, for some time, most ridiculous
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0324600502:13"/>
figures—pictures of chagrin and disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment! We returned greatly mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and left the deceased to do as well as he could for himself, as we had taken so good care of him when alive for nothing. We set sail once more for <hi rend= "italic">Montserrat</hi>, and arrived there safe; but much out of humour with our friend the silversmith. When we had unladen the vessel, and I had sold my venture, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myself master of about forty-seven pounds, I consulted my true friend, the Captain, how I should proceed in offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my master the money for my free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.--- He told me to come on a certain morning, when he and my master would be at breakfast together. Accordingly, on that morning I went, and met the Captain there, as he had appointed. When I went in I made my <span id= "a" corresp= "n">obeisance<note id= "n" target= "a" notetype= "gloss">The fact of obediance (Oxford English Dictionary)</note> to my master, and with my money in my hand, and many fears in my heart,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0324600502:14"/>
I prayed him to be as good as his offer to me, when he was pleased to promise me my freedom as soon as I could pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase it. This speech seemed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found him; he began to recoil; and my heart that instant sunk within me. <q rend="inline">'What,'</q> said he, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'give you your free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? Why, where did you get the money? Have you got forty-pounds sterling?'</q> 
               <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'Yes, sir,'</q> I answered. <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'How did you get it?'</q> replied he. I told him, very honestly. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain then said he knew I got the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney very honestly and with much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, and that I was particularly careful. On which my master replied, I got money much faster than he did; and said he would not have made me the promise which he did if he had thought I should have got money so soon. <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'Come, come,'</q> said my worthy Captain, clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping my master on the back, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'Come,

Robert, (which was his name) I think you must let him have his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;—you have laid your money out very well; you have received good interest for it all this time, and here is now the principal at last. I know Gustavas has earned you more than an hundred a-year, and he will still save you money, as he will not leave you:—Come, Robert, take the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.'</q> My master then said, he would not be worse than his promise; and, taking the money, told me to go to the secretary at the Register Office, and get my <span id= "a" corresp= "n">manumission<note id= "n" target= "a" notetype= "gloss"<Formal release from slavery or servitude. (Oxford English Dictionary)</note> drawn up. These words of my master were like a voice from heaven to me: in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant all my trepidation was turned into unutterable bliss, and I most reverently bowed myself with gratitude, unable to express my feelings, but by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing of my eyes, and a heart replete
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0324600502:16"/>
with thanks to God; while my true and worthy friend the Captain, congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated us both with a peculiar degree of heart-felt pleasure. As soon as the first transports of my joy were over, and that I had expressed my thanks to these my worthy friends in the best manner I was able, I rose with a heart full of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reverence, and left the room, in order to obey my master's joyful mandate of going to the Register Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. As I was leaving the house I called to mind the words of the Psalmist, in the 126th Psalm, and like him, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'I glorified God in my heart, in whom I trusted.'</q> These words had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed on my mind from the very day I was forced from <hi rend= "italic">Deptford</hi> to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent hour; and I now saw them, as I thought, fulfilled and verified. My imagination was all rapture as I flew to the Register Office; and, in this respect,

like the apostle <span id= "a" corresp= "n">Peter</span> <note id= "n" target= "a" notetype="gloss"> Allusion to Peter's escape from King Herrod's prison, when God sent an angel to miraculously save him.</note>,<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xii. 9.</note> (whose deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from prison was so sudden and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, that he thought he was in a vision) I could scarcely believe I was awake.

Some of the <span id= "a" corresp= "n">sable</span> <note id= "n" target= "a" notetype= "gloss">Black (Oxford English Dictionary)</note> females, who formerly stood aloof, now began to relax and appear less coy; but my heart was still fixed on <hi rend= "italic>London</hi>, where I hoped to be ere long. So that my worthy captain and his owner my late master, finding that the bent of my mind was towards <hi rend= "italic">London</hi>, said to me, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'We hope you won't leave us, but that you will still be with the vessels.'</q> Here gratitude bowed me down; and none but the generous mind can judge of my feelings, struggling between in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination and duty. However, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding my wish to be in <hi rend= "italic">London</hi>, I obediently answered my benefactors
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0324600502:22"/>
that I would go in the vessel, and not leave them; and from that day I was entered on board as an able-bodied seaman, at thirty-six shillings per month, besides what perquisites I could make. My intention was to make a voyage or two entirely to please these my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured patrons; but I determined that the year following, if it pleased God, I would see Old <hi rend= "italic">England</hi>, once more, and surprise my old master, captain <hi rend= "italic">Pascal</hi>, who was hourly in my mind; for I still loved him, notwithstanding his usage of me, and I pleased myself with think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what he would say when he saw what the Lord had done for me in so short a time, instead of being, as he might perhaps suppose, under the cruel yoke of some planter. With these kind of reveries I used often to entertain my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and shorten the time till my return; and now, being as in my original free
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0324600502:23"/>
<hi rend= "italic">African</hi> state, I embarked on board the <hi rend= "italic">Nancy</hi>, after having got all things ready for our voyage. In this state of serenity we sailed for <hi rend= "italic">St. Eustatia</hi>; and having smooth seas and calm weather, we soon arrived there; after taking our cargo on board, we proceeded to <hi rend= "italic">Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannah</hi> in Georgia, in August, 1766. While we were there, as usual, I used to go for the cargo up the rivers in boats; and on this business have been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently beset by Alligators, which were very numerous on that coast; and shot many of them when they have been near getting into our boats; which we have with great difficulty sometimes prevented, and have been very much frightened at them. I have seen a young one sold in <hi rend="italic">Georgia</hi> alive for sixpence.</p>
            <p>During our stay at this place, one evening a slave belonging to Mr.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0324600502:24"/>
<hi rend= "italic">Read</hi>, a merchant of <hi rend= "italic">Savannah</hi>, came near our vessel, and began to use me very ill. I entreated him to desist, as I knew there was little or no law for a free negro here; but the fellow, instead of taking my advice, persevered in his insults, and even struck me. At this I lost all temper, and fell on him, and beat him soundly. The next morning his master came to our vessel as we lay alongside the wharf, and desired me to come ashore that he might have me flogged all round the town, for beating his negro slave! I told him he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted me, and had given the provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, by first striking me. I had told my captain also the whole affair that morning, and desired him to go along with me to Mr. <hi rend= "italic">Read</hi>, to prevent bad consequences: but he said that it did not signify, and if Mr. <hi rend= "italic"> Read</hi> said
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0324600502:25"/>
any thing he would make matters up, and desired me to go to work, which I accordingly did. The Captain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on board when Mr. <hi rend= "italic">Read</hi> came and applied to him to deliver me up, he said he knew nothing of the matter, I was a free man. I was astonished and frightened at this, and thought I had better keep where I was than go ashore and be flogged round the town, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out judge or jury. I therefore refused to stir; and Mr. <hi rend= "italic">Read</hi> went away, swearing he would bring all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stables in the town, for he would have me out of the vessel. When he was gone, I thought his threat might prove too true to my sorrow; and I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in this belief, as well by the many instances I had seen of the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of free negroes, as from a fact that had happened within my own knowledge here a short time before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0324600502:26"/>
There was a free black man, a carpenter, that I knew, who for asking a gentleman that he worked for, for the money he had earned, was put into gaol<span id="a" corresp="n">gaol</span> <note id="n" target="a" type="gloss">A jail (OED)</note>; and afterwards this oppressed man was sent from Georgia, with false accusations, of an intention to set the gentleman's house on fire, and run away with his slaves. I was therefore much embarrassed, and very apprehensive of a flogging at least. I dreaded, of all things, the thoughts of being striped, as I never in my life had the marks of any violence of that kind. At that instant a rage seized my soul, and for a little I determined to resist the first man that should offer to lay violent hands on me, or basely use me without a trial; for I would sooner die like a free man, than suffer myself to be scourged by the hands of ruffians, and my blood drawn like a slave. The captain and others,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0324600502:27"/>
more cautious, advised me to make haste and conceal myself; for they said Mr. Read was a very spiteful man, and he would soon come on board with constables and take me. At first I refused this counsel, being determined to stand my ground; but at length, by the prevailing entreaties of the Captain and Mr. Dixon, with whom he lodged, I went to Mr. Dixon's house, which was a little out of town, at a place called <hi rend= "italic">Yea-ma-chra</hi>. I was but just gone when Mr. Read, with the constables, came for me, and searched the vessel; but, not finding me there, he swore he would have me dead or alive. I was secreted<span id="a" corresp="n">secreted</span> <note id="n" target="a" type="gloss">To keep secret, conceal, hide. (OED)</note> about five days; however, the good character which my captain always gave me as well as some other gentlemen who also knew me, procured me some friends. At last some of them told my Captain that he did not use me
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0324600502:28"/>
well, in suffering me thus to be imposed upon, and said they would see me redressed, and get me on board some other vessel. My Captain, on this, immediately went to Mr. Read, and told him, that ever since I eloped from the vessel his work had been neglected, and he could not go on with her loading, himself and mate not being well; and, as I had managed things on board for them, my absence must retard his voyage, and consequently hurt the owner; he therefore begged of him to forgive me, as he said he never heard any complaint of me before, during the several years I had been with him. After repeated entreaties, Mr. Read said I might go to hell, and that he would not meddle with me; on which my Captain came immediately to me at his lodging, and, telling me how pleasantly matters had gone on, desired me to go on board.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0324600502:29"/>
Some of my other friends then asked him if he had got the constable's warrant from them; the Captain said, No. On this I was desired by them to stay in the house; and they said they would get me on board of some other vessel before the evening. When the Captain heard this he became almost distracted. He went immediately for the warrant, and, after using every exertion in his power, he at last got it from my hunters; but I had all the expences to pay.</p>
            <p>After I had thanked all my friends for their kindness, I went on board again to my work, of which I had always plenty. We were in haste to complete our lading<span id="a" corresp="n">lading</span> <note id="n" target="a" type="gloss">The loading of a ship with its cargo. (OED)</note>, and were to carry twenty head of cattle with us to the West-Indies, where they are a very profitable article. In order to encourage me in working, and to make up for the time I had lost, my Captain promised me the privilege of carrying two bullocks<span id="a" corresp="n">bullock</span> <note id="n" target="a" type="gloss">Orig. a young bull, or bull calf; but afterwards, and in later times always, a castrated bull, an ox. (OED)</note>of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0324600502:30"/>
my own with me; and this made me work with redoubled ardour. As soon as I had got the vessel loaded, in doing which I was obliged to perform the duty of the mate as well as my own work, and that the bullocks were near coming on board, I asked the Captain leave to bring my two, according to his promise; but, to my great surprise, he told me there was no room for them. I then asked him to permit me to take one; but he said he could not. I was a good deal mortified at this usage, and told him I had no notion that he intended thus to impose on me; nor could I think well of any man that was so much worse than his word. On this we had some disagreement, and I gave him to understand, that I intended to leave the vessel. At this he appeared to be very much dejected; and our mate who had been very sickly, and whose
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0324600502:31"/>
duty had long devolved upon me, advised him to persuade me to stay: in consequence of which he spoke very kindly to me, making many fair promises, telling me, that, as the mate was so sickly, he could not do without me; and that, as the safety of the vessel and cargo depended greatly upon me, he therefore hoped that I would not be offended at what had passed between us, and swore he would make up all matters when we arrived in the West-Indies; so I consented to slave on as before. Soon after this, as the bullocks were coming on board, one of them ran at the Captain, and butted him so furiously in the breast, that he never recovered of the blow. In order to make me some amends for his treatment about the bullocks, the Captain now pressed me very much to take some turkeys, and other fowls, with me, and gave me liberty to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0324600502:32"/>
take as many as I could find room for: but I told him he knew very well I had never carried any turkeys before, as I always thought they were such tender birds that they were not fit to cross the seas. However, he continued to press me to buy them for once; and, what seemed very surprising to me, the more I was against it, the more he urged my taking them, insomuch that he ensured me from all losses that might happen by them, and I was prevailed on to take them; but I thought this very strange, as he had never acted so with me before. This, and not being able to dispose of my paper-money any other way, induced me at length to take four dozen. The turkeys, however, I was so dissatisfied about that I determined to make no more voyages to this quarter, nor with this captain; and was very apprehensive that my free voyage would be the worst I had ever made.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0324600502:33"/>
We set sail for Montserrat. The captain and mate had been both complaining of sickness when we sailed, and as we proceeded on our voyage they grew worse. This was about November, and we had not been long at sea before we began to meet with strong northerly gales and rough seas; and in about seven or eight days all the bullocks were near being drowned, and four or five of them died. Our vessel, which had not been tight<span id="a" corresp="n">tight</span> <note id="n" target="a" type="gloss"> Of such close texture or construction as to be impervious to a fluid, etc. - esp. Of a ship: watertight; well caulked and pitched; not leaky. (OED)</note> at first, was much less so now: and, though we were but nine in the whole, including five sailors and myself, yet we were obliged to attend to the pumps every half or three quarters of an hour. The captain and mate came on deck as often as they were able, which was now but seldom; for they declined so fast, that they were not well enough to make observations above four or five times the whole voyage.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0324600502:34"/>
The whole care of the vessel rested, therefore upon me, and I was obliged to direct her by mere dint of reason, not being able to work a traverse. The captain was now very sorry he had not taught me navigation, and protested, if ever he should get well again, he would not fail to do so; but in about seventeen days his illness increased so much, that he was obliged to keep his bed, continuing sensible, however, till the last, constantly having the owner's interest at heart; for this just and benevolent man ever appeared much concerned about the welfare of what he was intrusted with. When this dear friend found the symptoms of death approaching, he called me by my name; and, when I came to him, he asked (with almost his last breath) if he had ever done me any harm? <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'God forbid I should think so,'</q> replied I, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'I should
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0324600502:35"/>
then be the most ungrateful of wretches to the best of benefactors.'</q> While I was thus expressing my affection and sorrow by his bedside, he expired without saying another word; and the day following we committed his body to the deep. Every man on board loved him, and regretted his death; but I was exceedingly affected at it, and found that I did not know, till he was gone, the strength of my regard for him. Indeed I had every reason in the world to be attached to him; for, besides that he was in general mild, affable, generous, faithful, benevolent, and just, he was to me a friend and father; and had it pleased Providence, that he had died about five months before, I verily believe I should not have obtained my freedom when I did; and it is no improbable that I might not have been able to get it at any rate afterwards.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0324600502:36"/>
The captain being dead, the mate came on the deck, and made such observations as he was able, but to no purpose. In the course of a few days more, the few bullocks that remained were found dead; but the turkies I had, though on the deck, and exposed to so much wet and bad weather, did well, and I afterwards gained near three hundred per cent, on the sale of them; so that in the event it proved a happy circumstance for me that I had not bought the bullocks I intended, for they must have perished with the rest; and I could not help looking on this, otherwise trifling circumstance, as a particular providence of God, and was thankful accordingly. The care of the vessel took up all my time, and engaged my attention entirely. As we were now out of the variable winds, I thought I should not be much puzzled to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0324600502:37"/>
hit upon the islands. I was persuaded I steered right for Antigua, which I wished to reach, as the nearest to us; and in the course of nine or ten days we made this island, to our great joy; and the day after we came safe to Montserrat.</p>
            <p>Many were surprised when they heard of my conducting the sloop into the port, and I now obtained a new appellation<span id="a" corresp="n">appellation</span> <note id="n" target="a" type="gloss"> A designation, name, or title given. (OED)</note>, and was called Captain. This elated me not a little, and it was quite flattering to my vanity to be thus styled by as high a title as any freeman in this place possessed. When the death of the captain became known, he was much regretted by all who knew him; for he was a man universally respected. At the same time the sable Captain lost no fame; for the success I had met with increased the affection of my friends in no small measure.</p>

            <p>As I had now, by the death of my captain, lost my great benefactor and friend, I had little inducement to remain longer in the West Indies, except my gratitude to Mr. King, which I thought I had pretty well discharged in bringing back his vessel safe, and delivering his cargo to his satisfaction. I began to think of leaving this part of the world, of which I had been long tired, and returning to England, where my heart had always been; but Mr. King still pressed me very much to stay with his vessel; and he had done so much for me that I found myself unable to refuse his requests, and consented to go another voyage to Georgia, as the mate, from his ill state of health,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0324600502:40"/>
was quite useless in the vessel. Accordingly a new captain was appointed, whose name was William Phillips, an old acquaintance of mine; and, having refitted our vessel, and taken several slaves on board, we set sail for St. Eustatia, where we stayed but a few days: and on the 30th of January 1767, we steered for Georgia. Our new captain boasted strangely of his skill in navigating and conducting a vessel; and in consequence of this he steered a new course, several points more to the westward than we ever did before; this appeared to me very extraordinary.</p>
            <p>On the fourth of February, which was soon after we had got into our new course, I dreamt the ship was wrecked amidst the surfs and rocks, and that I was the means of saving every one on board; and on the night following I dreamed the very same dream. These
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0324600502:41"/>
dreams however made no impression on my mind; and the next evening, it being my watch below, I was pumping the vessel a little after eight o'clock, just before I went off the deck, as is the custom; and being weary with the duty of the day, and tired at the pump, (for we made a good deal of water) I began to express my impatience, and uttered with an oath, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'Damn the vessel's bottom out.'</q> But my conscience instantly smote me for the expression. When I left the deck I went to bed, and had scarcely fallen asleep when I dreamed the same dream again about the ship as I had dreamt the two preceeding nights. At twelve o'clock the watch was changed; and, as I had always the charge of the captain's watch, I then went upon deck. At half after one in the morning the man at the helm saw something under
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0324600502:42"/>
the lee-beam<span id="a" corresp="n">lee-beam</span> <note id="n" target="a" type="gloss">Hence designating the side of a vessel or sideward direction: the side away from the wind. (OED)</note> that the sea washed against, and he immediately called to me that there was a grampus<span id="a" corresp="n">grampus</span> <note id="n" target="a" type="gloss">The popular name of various delphinoid cetaceans, having a high falcate dorsal fin and a blunt rounded head, and remarkable for the spouting and blowing which accompanies their movements. (OED)</note>, and desired me to look at it. Accordingly I stood up and observed it for some time; but, when I saw the sea wash up against it again and again, I said it was not a fish but a rock. Being soon certain of this, I went down to the captain, and, with some confusion, told him the danger we were in, and desired him to come upon deck immediately. He said it was very well, and I went up again. As soon as I was upon deck, the wind, which had been pretty high, having abated a little, the vessel began to be carried sideways towards the rock, by means of the current. Still the captain did not appear. I therefore went to him again, and told him the vessel was then near a large rock, and desired he would come up with all speed.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0324600502:43"/>
He said he would, and I returned to the deck. When I was upon the deck again I saw we were not above a pistol shot from the rock, and I heard the noise of the breakers all around us. I was exceedingly alarmed at this; and the captain having not yet come on the deck I lost all patience; and, growing quite enraged, I ran down to him again, and asked him why he did not come up, and what he could mean by all this? <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'The breakers,'</q> said I, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'are round us, and the vessel is almost on the rock.'</q> With that he came on the deck with me, and we tried to put the vessel about, and get her out of the current, but all to no purpose, the wind being very small. We then called all hands up immediately; and after a little we got up one end of a cable, and fastened it to the anchor. By this time the surf was foamed round us, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0324600502:44"/>
made a dreadful noise on the breakers, and the very moment we let the anchor go the vessel struck against the rocks. One swell now succeeded another, as it were one wave calling on its fellow; the roaring of the billows increased, and, with one single heave of the swells, the sloop was pierced and transfixed among the rocks! in a moment a scene of horror presented itself to my mind, such as I never had conceived or experienced before. All my sins stared me in the face; and especially, I thought that God had hurled his direful vengeance on my guilty head for cursing the vessel on which my life depended. My spirits at this forsook me, and I expected every moment to go to the bottom: I determined if I should still be saved that I would never swear again. And in the midst of my distress, while the dreadful
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0324600502:45"/>
surfs were dashing with unremitting fury among the rocks, I remembered the Lord, though fearful that I was undeserving of forgiveness, and I thought that as he had often delivered he might yet deliver; and, calling to mind the many mercies he had shewn me in times past, they gave me some small hope that he might still help me. I then began to think how we might be saved; and I believe no mind was ever like mine so replete with inventions and confused with schemes, though how to escape death I knew not. The captain immediately ordered the hatches to be nailed down on the slaves in the hold, where there were above twenty, all of whom must unavoidably have perished if he had been obeyed. When he desired the man to nail down the hatches I thought that my sin was the cause of this, and that God would
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0324600502:46"/>
charge me with these people's blood. This thought rushed upon my mind that instant with such violence, that it quite overpowered me, and I fainted. I recovered just as the people were about to nail down the hatches; perceiving which, I desired them to stop. The captain then said it must be done: I asked him why? He said that every one would endeavour to get into the boat, which was but small, and thereby we should be drowned; for it would not have carried above ten at the most. I could no longer restrain my emotion, and I told him he deserved drowning for not knowing how to navigate the vessel; and I believe the people would have tossed him overboard if I had given them the least hint of it. However the hatches were not nailed down; and, as none of us could leave the vessel then on account of the darkness,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0324600502:47"/>
and as we knew not where to go, and were convinced besides that the boat could not survive the surfs, we all said we would remain on the dry part of the vessel, and trust to God till daylight appeared, when we should know better what to do.</p>
            <p>I then advised to get the boat prepared against morning, and some of us began to set about it; but others abandoned all care of the ship and themselves, and fell to drinking. Our boat had a piece out of her bottom near two feet long, and we had no materials to mend her; however, necessity being the mother of invention, I took some pump leather and nailed it to the broken part, and plastered it over with tallow-grease. And, thus prepared, with the utmost anxiety of mind we watched for day-light, and thought every minute an hour till it appeared.
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0324600502:48"/>
At last it saluted our longing eyes, and kind Providence accompanied its approach with what was no small comfort to us; for the dreadful swells began to subside; and the next thing that we discovered to raise our drooping spirits, was a small key or desolate island, about five or six miles off; but a barrier soon presented itself; for there was not water enough for our boat to go over the reefs, and this threw us again into a sad consternation; but there was no alternative, we were therefore obliged to put but few in the boat at once; and, what was still worse, all of us were frequently under the necessity of getting out to drag and lift it over the reefs. This cost us much labour and fatigue; and, what was yet more distressing, we could not avoid having our legs cut and torn very much with the rocks. There were only four people
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0324600502:49"/>
that would work with me at the oars; and they consisted of three black men and a Dutch creole sailor; and, though we went with the boat five times that day, we had no others to assist us. But, had we not worked in this manner, I really believe the people could not have been saved; for not one of the white men did any thing to preserve their lives; indeed they soon got so drunk that they were not able, but lay about the deck like swine, so that we were at last obliged to lift them into the boat, and carry them on shore by force. This want of assistance made our labour intolerably severe; insomuch, that, by going on shore so often that day, the skin was partly stript off my hands.</p>
            <p>However, we continued all the day to toil and strain our exertions, till we had brought all on board safe to the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0324600502:50"/>
shore, so that out of thirty-two people we lost not one.</p>
            <p>My dream now returned upon my mind with all its force; it was fulfilled in every part; for our danger was the same I had dreamt of; and I could not help looking on myself as the principal instrument in effecting our deliverance: for, owing to some of our people getting drunk, the rest of us were obliged to double our exertions; and it was fortunate we did, for in a very little time longer the patch of leather on the boat would have been worn out, and she would have been no longer fit for service. Situated as we were, who could think that men should be so careless of the danger they were in? for, if the wind had but raised the swell as it was when the vessel struck, we must have bid a final farewel to all hopes of deliverance; and though, I warned the people
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0324600502:51"/>
who were drinking, and entreated them to embrace the moment of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, nevertheless they persisted, as if not possessed of the least spark of reason. I could not help thinking, that, if any of these people had been lost, God would charge me with their lives, which, perhaps, was one cause of my labouring so hard for their preservation, and indeed every one of them afterwards seemed so sensible of the service I had rendered them, that while we were on the key I was a kind of chieftian amongst them. I brought some limes, oranges, and lemons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shore; and, finding it to be a good soil where we were, I planted several of them as a token to any one that might be cast away hereafter. This key, as we afterwards found, was one of the Bahama islands, which consist of a cluster of large islands, with
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0324600502:52"/>
smaller ones or keys, as they are called, interspersed among them. It was about a mile in circumference, with a white sandy beach running in a regular order along it. On that part of it where we first attempted to land there stood some very large birds, called slamin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes: these, from the reflection of the sun, appeared to us at a little dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as large as men; and, when they walked backwards and forwards, we could not conceive what they were: our captain swore they were cannibals. This created a great panic among us; and we held a consultation how to act. The captain wanted to go to a key that was within sight, but a great way off; but I was against it, as in so doing we should not be able to save all the people; <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'And therefore,'</q> said I, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'let us go on shore here, and perhaps these cannibals may take to the water.'</q>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0324600502:53"/>
Accordingly we steered toward them; and when we approached them, to our very great joy and no less wonder, they walked off one after the other very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately; and at last they took flight and relieved us entirely from our fears. About the key there were turtles and several sorts of fish in such abundance that we caught them without bait, which was a great relief to us after the salt provisions on board. There was also a large rock on the beach, about ten feet high, which was in the form of a punch-bowl at the top; this we could not help thinking Providence had ordained to supply us with rain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>water; and it was something singula<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that, if we did not take the water when it rained, in some little time after i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> would turn as salt as sea-water.</p>
            <p>Our first care, after refreshmen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> was to make ourselves tents to lodge in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0324600502:54"/>
which we did as well as we could with some sails we had brought from the ship. We then began to think how we might get from this place, which was quite uninhabited; and we deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to repair our boat, which was very much shattered, and to put to sea in quest of a ship or some inhabited island. It took us up however eleven days before we could get the boat ready for sea in the manner we wanted it, with a sail and other necessaries. When we had got all things prepared, the captain wanted me to stay on shore while he went to sea in quest of a ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel to take all the people off the key; but this I refused; and the captain and myself, with five more, set off in the boat towards New Providence. We had no more than two musket load of gun-powder with us if any thing should happen; and our stock of provisions
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0324600502:55"/>
consisted of three gallons of rum, four of water, some salt beef, some biscuit; and in this manner we proceeded to sea.</p>
            <p>On the second day of our voyage, we came to an island called Abbico, the largest of the Bahama islands. We were much in want of water; for by this time our water was expended, and we were exceedingly fatigued in pulling two days in the heat of the sun; and it being late in the evening, we hauled the boat ashore to try for water and remain during the night: when we came ashore we searched for water, but could find none. When it was dark, we made a fire around us for fear of the wild beasts, as the place was an entire thick wood, and we took it by turns to watch. In this situation we found very little rest, and waited with impatience for the morning. As
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0324600502:56"/>
soon as the light appeared we set off again with our boat, in hopes of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing assistance during the day. We were now much dejected and weakened by pulling the boat; for our sail was of no use, and we were almost famished for want of fresh water to drink. We had nothing left to eat but salt beef, and that we could not use without water. In this situation we toiled all day in sight of the island, which was very long; in the evening, seeing no relief, we made shore again, and fastened our boat. We then went to look for fresh water, being quite faint for the want of it; and we dug and searched about for some all the remainder of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but could not find one drop, so that our dejection at this period became excessive, and our terror so great, that we expected nothing but death to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us. We could not touch our
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0324600502:57"/>
beef, which was salt as brine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fresh water; and we were in the greatest terror from the apprehension of wild beasts. When unwelcome night came we acted as on the night before; and the next morning we set off again from the island in hopes of seeing some vessel. In this manner we toiled as well as we were able till four o'clock, during which we passed seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral keys, but could not meet with a ship; and, still famishing with thirst, went ashore on one of those keys again in hopes of finding some water. Here we found some leaves with a few drops of water in them, which we lapped with much eagerness; we then dug in several places, but without success. As we were digging holes in search of water there came forth some very thick and black stuff; but none of us could touch it, except the poor Dutch Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Creole,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0324600502:58"/>
who drank above a quart of it as eagerly as if had been wine. We tried to catch fish, but could not; and we now began to repine at our fate, and abandon ourselves to despair; when, in the midst of our murmuring, the captain all at once cried out. <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'A sail! a sail! a sail!'</q> This gladdening sound was like a reprieve to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict, and we all instantly turned to look at it; but in a little time some of us began to be afraid it was not a sail. However, at a venture, we embarked and steered after it; and, in half an hour to our unspeakable joy, we plainly saw that it was a vessel. At this our drooping spirits revived, and we made towards her with all the speed ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable. When we came near to her, we found she was a little sloop about the size of a Gravesend <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and quite full or people; a circumstance which
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0324600502:59"/>
we could not make out the meaning of. Our captain, who was a Welch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, swore that they were pirates, and would kill us. I said, be that as it might, we must board her if we were to die by it; and, if they should not receive us kindly, we must oppose them as well as we could; for there was no alternative between their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing and ours. This counsel was immediately taken; and I really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the captain, myself, and the Dutchman, would then have faced twenty men. We had two cutlasses and a musquet, that I brought in the boat; and in this situation, we rowed alongside, and immediately boarded her. I believe there were about forty hands on board; but how great was our surprise, as soon as we got on board, to find that the major part of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0324600502:60"/>
them were in the same predicament as ourselves.</p>
            <p>They belonged to a whaling schoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that was wrecked two days before us about nine miles to the north of our vessel. When she was wrecked some of them had taken to their boats and had left some of their people and property on a key, in the same manner as we had done; and were going, like us, to New Providence in quest of a ship, when they met with this little sloop, called a wrecker; their employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in those seas being to look after wrecks. They were then going to take the remainder of the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the schooner; for which the wrecker was to have all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the vessel, and likewise their people's help to get what they could out of her, and were then to carry the crew to New Providence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:0324600502:61"/>
We told the people of the wrecker the condition of our vessel, and we made the same agreement with them as the schooner's people; and, on their complying, we begged of them to go to our key directly, because our people were in want of water. They agreed, therefore, to go along with us first; and in two days we arrived at the key, to the inexpressible joy of the people that we had left behind, as they had been reduced to great extremities for want of water in our absence. Luckily for us, the wrecker had now more people on board than she could carry or vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual for any moderate length of time; they therefore hired the schooner's people to work on the wreck, and we left them our boat, and embarked for New Providence.</p>
            <p>Nothing could have been more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate than our meeting with this
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0324600502:62"/>
wrecker, for New Providence was at such a distance that we never could have reached it in our boat. The island of Abbico was much longer than we expected; and it was not till after sailing for three or four days that we got safe to the farther end of it, towards New Providence. When we arrived there we watered, and got a good many lobsters and other shell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fish; which proved a great relief to us, as our provisions and water were almost exhausted. We then proceeded on our voyage; but the day after we left the Island, late in the evening, and whilst we were yet amongst the Bahama keys, we were overtaken by a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent gale of wind, so that we were obliged to cut away the mast. The vessel was very near foundering; for she parted from her anchors, and struck several times on the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0324600502:63"/>
shoals. Here we expected every mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute that she would have gone to pieces, and each moment to be our last; so much so, that my old captain and sickly useless mate, and several others, fainted; and death stared us in the face on every side. All the swearers on board now began to call on the God of Heaven to assist them: and, sure enough, beyond our compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension he did assist us, and in a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous manner delivered us! In the very height of our extremity the wind lulled for a few minutes; and, although the swell was high beyond expression, two men, who were expert swimmers, attempted to go to the buoy of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, which we still saw on the water, at some distance, in a little punt that belonged to the wrecker, which was not large enough to carry more than two. she filled at different times in their
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0324600502:64"/>
endeavours to get into her alongside of our vessel; and they saw nothing but death before them, as well as we; but they said they might as well die that way as any other. A coil of very small rope, with a little buoy, was put in along with them; and, at last, with great hazard, they got the punt clear from the vessel; and these two intrepid water heroes paddled away for life to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the buoy of the anchor. Our eyes were fixed on them all the time, expecting every minute to be their last: and the prayers of all those that remained in their senses were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up to God, on their behalf, for a speedy deliverance, and for our own, which depended on them; and he heard and answered us! These two men at last reached the buoy; and, having fastened the punt to it, they tied one end of their rope to the small buoy
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0324600502:65"/>
that they had in the punt, and sent it adrift towards the vessel. We on board observing this threw out boat-hooks and leads fastened to lines, in order to catch the buoy: at last we caught it, and fastened a hawser to the end of the small rope; we then gave them a sign to pull, and they pulled the hawser to them, and fastened it to the buoy: which being done we hauled for our lives; and, through the mercy of God, we got again from the shoals into deep water, and the punt got safe to the vessel. It is impossible for any to conceive our heart-felt joy at this second deliverance from ruin, but those who have suffered the same hardships. Those whose strength and senses were gone, came to themselves, and were now as elated as they were before depressed. Two days after this the wind ceased, and the water became smooth. The punt
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0324600502:66"/>
then went on shore, and we cut down some trees; and having found our mast and mended it we brought it on board, and fixed it up. As soon as we had done this we got up the anchor, and away we went once more for New Providence, which in three days more we reached safe, after having been above three weeks in a situation in which we did not expect to escape with life. The inhabitants here were very kind to us; and, when they learned our situation, shewed us a great deal of hospitality and friendship. soon after this every one of my old fellow-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers that were free parted from us, and shaped their course where their inclination led them. One merchant, who had a large sloop, seeing our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and knowing we wanted to go to Georgia, told four of us that his vessel was going there; and, if we
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0324600502:67"/>
would work on board and load her, he would give us our passage free. As we could not get any wages whatever, and sound it very hard to get off the place, we were obliged to consent to his proposal; and we went on board and helped to load the sloop, though we had only our victuals allowed us. When she was entirely loaded, he told us she was going to Jamaica first, where we must go if we went in her. This, however, I refused; but my fellow-sufferers not having any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to help themselves with, necessity obliged them to accept of the offer, and to steer that course, though they did not like it.</p>
            <p>We stayed in New Providence about seventeen or eighteen days; during which time I met with many friends, who gave me encouragement to stay there with them, but I declined it;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0324600502:68"/>
though, had not my heart been fixed on England, I should have stayed, as I liked the place extremely, and there were some free black people here who were very happy, and we passed our time pleasantly together, with the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious sound of the catguts, under the lime and lemon trees. At length Captain Phillips hired a sloop to carry him and some of the slaves that he could not sell to Georgia; and I agreed to go with him in this vessel, meaning now to take my farewel of that place. When the vessel was ready we all em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked; and I took my leave of New Providence, not without regret. We sailed about four o'clock the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a fair wind, for Georgia; and about eleven o'clock the same morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a sudden and short gale sprung up and blew away most of our fails; and, as we were still among the keys, in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0324600502:69"/>
a very few minutes it dashed the sloop against the rocks. Luckily for us the water was deep; and the sea was not so angry, but that, after having for some time laboured hard, and being many in number, we were saved, through God's mercy: and, by using our greatest exertions, we got the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel off. The next day we returned to Providence, where we soon got her again refitted. some of the people swore that we had spells set upon us by somebody in Montserrat; and others that we had witches and wizzards amongst the poor helpless slaves; and that we never should arrive safe at Georgia. But these things did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me; I said, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'Let us again face the winds and seas, and swear not, but trust to God, and he will deliver us.'</q> We therefore once more set sail; and,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0324600502:70"/>
with hard labour in seven days time arrived safe at Georgia.</p>
            <p>After our arrival we went up to the town of savannah; and the same even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I went to a friend's house to lodge, whose name was Mosa, a black man. We were very happy at meeting each other; and after supper we had a light till it was between nine and ten o'clock at night. About that time the watch or patrol came by; and, discerning a light in the house, they knocked at the door: we opened it; and they came in and sat down and drank some punch with us: they also begged some limes of me, as they understood I had some, which I readily gave them. A little after this they told me I must go to the watch-house with them: this surprised me a good deal, after our kindness to them; and I asked them, Why so? They said that all negroes who had a
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0324600502:71"/>
light in their houses after nine o'clock were to be taken into custody, and either pay some dollars or be flogged. some of those people knew that I was a free man; but, as the man of the house was not free, and had his master to protect him, they did not take the same liberty with him they did with me. I told them that I was a free man, and just arrived from Providence; that we were not making any noise, and that I was not a stranger in that place, but was very well known there: <q rend="inline">'Besides,'</q> said I, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'what will you do with me?'</q>—<q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'That you shall see,'</q> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied they, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'but you must go to the watch-house with us.'</q> Now whether they meant to get money from me or not I was at a loss to know; but I thought immediately of the oranges and limes at santa Cruz: and seeing that nothing would pacify them I went
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0324600502:72"/>
with them to the watch-house, where I remained during the night. Early the next morning these imposing ruffians flogged a negro-man and woman that they had in the watch-house, and then they told me that I must be flogged too. I asked why? and if there was no law for free men? and told them if there was I would have it put in force against them. But this only exasperated them the more, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly swore they would serve me as Doctor Perkins had done; and were going to lay violent hands on me; when one of them, more humane than the rest, said that as I was a free man they could not justify stripping me by law. I then immediately sent for Doctor Brady, who was known to be an honest and worthy man; and on his coming to my assistance they let me go.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:0324600502:73"/>
This was not the only disagreeable incident I met with while I was in this place; for, one day, while I was a little way out of the town of savannah, I was beset by two white men, who meant to play their usual tricks with me in the way of kidnapping. As soon as these men accosted me, one of them said to the other, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'This is the very fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low we are looking for, that you lost:'</q> and the other swore immediately that I was the identical person. On this they made up to me, and were about to handle me; but I told them to be still and keep off; for I had seen those kind of tricks played upon other free blacks, and they must not think to serve me so. At this they paused a little, and one said to the other—it will not do; and the other answered that I talked two good English. I replied, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved I did; and I had also with me a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0324600502:74"/>
revengeful stick equal to the occasion; and my mind was likewise good. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily however it was not used; and, after we had talked together a little in this manner, the rogues left me.</p>
            <p>I stayed in savannah some time, anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously trying to get to Montserrat once more to see Mr. King, my old master, and then to take a final farewel of the American quarter of the globe. At last I met with a sloop called the speed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, Captain John Bunton, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to Grenada, and was bound to Martinico, a French island, with a cargo of rice, and I shipped myself on board of her.</p>
            <p>Before I left Georgia, a black woman who had a child lying dead, being very tenacious of the church burial service, and not able to get any white person to perform it, applied to me for that purpose. I told her I was no parson;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0324600502:75"/>
and besides, that the service over the dead did not affect the soul. This however did not satisfy her; she still urged me very hard: I therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with her earnest entreaties, and at last consented to act the parson for the sirst time in my life. As she was much respected, there was a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany both of white and black people at the grave. I then accordingly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed my new vocation, and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the funeral ceremony to the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of all present; after which I bade adieu to Georgia, and sailed sor Martinico.</p>

disgusted me very much against the place; and when I left it and sailed for Martinico I determined never more to revisit it. My new captain conducted his vessel safer than my former one; and, after an agreeable voyage, we got safe to our intended port. While I was on this island I went about a good deal, and found it very pleasant: in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular I admired the town of st. Pierre, which is the principal one in the island, and built more like an European town than any I had seen in the West Indies. In general also, slaves were better treated, had more holidays, and looked better than those in the English islands. After we had done our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness here, I wanted my discharge, which was necessary; for it was then the month of May, and I wished much to be at Montserrat to bid farewel to Mr. King, and all my
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0324600502:78"/>
other friends there, in time to sail for Old England in the July fleet. But, alas! I had put a great stumbling block in my own way, by which I was near losing my passage that season to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. I had lent my captain some money, which I now wanted to enable me to prosecute my intentions. This I told him; but when I applied for it, though I urged the necessity of my occasion, I met with so much shuffling from him, that I began at last to be afraid of losing my money, as I could not recover it by law; for I have already mentioned, that throughout the West Indies no black man's testimony is admitted, on any occasion, against any white person whatever, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my own oath would have been of no use. I was obliged, therefore, to remain with him till he might be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to return it to me. Thus we
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0324600502:79"/>
sailed from Martinico for the Grenades. I frequently pressing the captain for my money to no purpose; and, to render my condition worse, when we got there, the captain and his owners quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled; so that my situation became daily more irksome: for besides that we on board had little or no victuals allowed us, and I could not get my money nor wages, as I could then have gotten my passage free to Montserrat had I been able to accept it. The worst of all was, that it was growing late in July, and the ships in the islands must sail by the 26th of that month. At last, however, with a great many en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, I got my money from the captain, and took the first vessel I could meet with for st Eustatia. From thence I went in another to Basseterre in st. Kitts, where I arrived on the 19th of July. On the 22d, having met with a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0324600502:80"/>
vessel bound to Montserrat, I wanted to go in her; but the captain and others would not take me on board until I should advertise myself, and give notice of my going off the island. I told them of my haste to be in Montserrat, and that the time then would not admit of advertising, it being late in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the vessel about to sail; but he insisted it was necessary, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he said he would not take me. This reduced me to great perplexity; for if I should be compelled to submit to this degrading necessity, which every black freeman is under, of advertising himself like a slave, when he leaves an island, and which I thought a gross im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position upon any freeman, I feared I should miss that opportunity of going to Montserrat, and then I could not get to England that year. The vessel was just going off, and no time could be lost;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0324600502:81"/>
I immediately therefore set about, with a heavy heart, to try who I could get to befriend me in complying with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the captain. Luckily I found, in a few minutes, some gentlemen of Montserrat whom I knew; and, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing told them my situation, I requested their friendly assistance in helping me off the island. some of them, on this, went with me to the captain, and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him of my freedom; and, to my very great joy, he desired me to go on board. We then set sail, and the next day, 23d, I arrived at the wished-for place, after an absence of six months, in which I had more than once experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the delivering hand of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, when all human means of escap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing destruction seemed hopeless. I saw my friends with a gladness of heart which was increased by my absence and the dangers I had escaped, and I was received with great friendship by
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0324600502:82"/>
them all, but particularly by Mr. King, to whom I related the fate of his floop, the Nancy, and the causes of her being wrecked. I now learned with extreme sorrow, that his house was washed away during my absence, by the bursting of a pond at the top of a mountain that was opposite the town of Plymouth. It swept great part of the town away, and Mr. King lost a great deal of property from the inundation, and nearly his life. When I told him I intended to go to London that season, and that I had come to visit him before my departure, the good man expressed a great deal of affection for me, and sorrow that I should leave him, and warmly advised me to stay there; insisting, as I was much respected by all the gentlemen in the place, that I might do very well, and in a short time have land and slaves of my own. I thanked him for this
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0324600502:83"/>
instance of his friendship; but, as I wished very much to be in London, I declined remaining any longer there, and begged he would excuse me. I then requested he would be kind enough to give me a certificate of my behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our while in his service, which he very readily comp ied with, and gave me the following:</p>

            <p>Having obtained this, I parted from my kind master, after many sincere professions of gratitude and regard,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0324600502:84"/>
and prepared for my departure for Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. I immediately agreed to go with one Capt. John Hamer, for seven gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas (the passage to London) on board a ship called, the Andromache; and on the 24th and 25th, I had free dances, as they are called, with some of my countrymen, previous to my seeting off; after which I took leave of all my friends, and on the 26th I embarked for London, exceedingly glad to see myself once more on board of a ship; and still more so, in steering the course I had long wished for. With a light heart I bade Montserrat farewell, and never had my feet on it since; and with it I bade adieu to the sound of the cruel whip, and all other dreadful instruments of torture; adieu to the offensive sight of the violated chastity of the sable females, which has too often accosted my eyes; adieu to oppressions (although
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0324600502:85"/>
to me less severe than most of my countrymen); and adieu to the angry howling, dashing surfs. I wished for a grateful and thankful heart to praise the Lord God on high for all his mercies! in this extasy I steered the ship all night.</p>
            <p>We had a most prosperous voyage, and, at the end of seven weeks, arrived at Cherry-Garden stairs. Thus were my longing eyes once more gratified with a sight of London, after having been absent from it above four years. I immediately received my wages, and I never had earned seven guineas so quick in my life before; I had thirty-seven guineas in all, when I got cleared of the ship. I now entered upon a scene quite new to me, but full of hope. In this situation my first thoughts were to look out for some of my former friends, and amongst the first of those were the Miss Guerins. Assoon, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as I had regaled myself I went in
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0324600502:86"/>
quest of those kind ladies, whom I was very impatient to see; and with some difficulty and perseverance, I found them at May's-hill, Greenwich. They were most agreeably surprised to see me, and I quite overjoyed at meeting with them. I told them my history, at which they expressed great wonder, and freely acknowledged it did their cousin, Capt. Pascal, no honour. He then visited there frequently; and I met him four or five days after in Greenwich park. When he saw me he appeared a good deal surprised, and asked me how I came back? I answered, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'In a ship.'</q> To which he replied dryly, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'I suppose you did not walk back to London on the water.'</q> As I saw, by his manner, that he did not seem to be sorry for his behaviour to me, and that I had not much reason to expect any favour from him, I told him that he
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0324600502:87"/>
had used me very ill, after I had been such a faithful servant to him for so many years; on which, without saying any more, he turned about and went away. A few days after this I met Capt. Pascal at Miss Guerin's house, and asked him for my prize-money. He said there was none due to me; for, if my prize-money had been 10,000l. he had a right to it all. I told him I was informed otherwise: on which he bade me defiance; and in a bantering tone, desired me to commence a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit against him for it: <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'There are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers enough,'</q> said he, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'that will take the cause in hand, and you had better try it.'</q> I told him then that I would try it, which enraged him very much; however, out of regard to the ladies, I remained still, and never made any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther demand of my right. some time afterwards these sriendly ladies asked
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0324600502:88"/>
me what I meant to do with myself, and now they could assist me. I thanked them, and said, if they pleased, I would be their servant; but if not, I had thirty-seven gnineas, which would sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port me for some time, I would be much obliged to them to recommend me to some person who would teach me a business whereby I might earn my living. They answered me very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litely, that they were sorry it did not suit them to take me as their servant, and asked me what business I should like to learn? I said, hair-dressing. They then promised to assist me in this; and soon after they recommended me to a gentleman whom I had known before, one Capt. O'Hara, who treated me with much kindness, and procured me a master, a hair-dresser, in Coventry-court, Haymarket, with whom he placed me. I was with this man from septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0324600502:89"/>
till the February following. In that time we had a neighbour in the same court who taught the French-horn. He used to blow it so well that I was charmed with it, and agreed with him to teach me to blow it. Accordingly he took me in hand, and began to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct me, and I soon learned all the three parts. I took great delight in blowing on this instrument, the evenings being long; and besides that I was fond of it, I did not like to be idle, and it filled up my vacant hours innocently. At this time also I agreed with the Rev. Mr. Gregory, who lived in the same court, where he kept an academy and an evening-school, to improve me in arithmetic. This he did as far as barter and alligation; so that all the time I was there I was entirely em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. In February 1768, I hired myself to Dr. Charles Irving, in Pall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0324600502:90"/>
so celebrated for his successful experiments in making sea water fresh; and here I had plenty of hair dressing to improve my hand. This gentleman was an excellent master; he was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly kind and good tempered; and allowed me in the evenings to attend my schools, which I esteemed a great blessing; therefore I thanked God and him for it, and used all my diligence to improve the opportunity. This dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and attention recommended me to the notice and care of my three pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptors, who on their parts bestowed a great deal of pains in my instruction, and besides were all very kind to me. My wages, however, which were by two thirds less than ever I had in my life (for I had only 12l. per annum) I soon found would not be sufficient to defray this extraordinary expence of masters, and my own necessary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0324600502:91"/>
my old thirty-seven guineas had by this time worn all away to one. I thought it best, therefore, to try the sea again in quest of more money, as I had been bred to it, and had hitherto found the profession of it successful. I had also a very great desire to see Turkey, and I now determined to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify it. Accordingly, in the month of May, 1768, I told the doctor my wish to go to sea again, to which he made no opposition; and we parted on friendly terms. The same day I went into the city in quest of a master. I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely fortunate in my inquiry; for I soon heard of a gentleman who had a ship going to Italy and Turkey, and he wanted a man who could dress hair well. I was overjoyed at this, and went imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately on board of his ship, as I had been directed, which I found to be fitted up with great taste, and I already
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0324600502:92"/>
foreboded no small pleasure in sailing in her. Not finding the gentleman on board, I was directed to his lodgings, where I met with him the next day, and gave him a specimen of my dressing. He liked it so well that he hired me immediately, so that I was perfectly happy; for the ship, master, and voyage, were intirely to my mind. The ship was called the Delawar, and my master's name was John Jolly, a neat smart good humoured man, just such an one as I wished to serve. We sailed from England in July following, and our voyage was extremely pleasant. We went to Villa Franca, Nice, and Leghorn; and in all these places I was charmed with the richness and beauty of the countries, and struck with the elegant buildings with which they abound. We had always in them plenty of extraordinary good wines and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0324600502:93"/>
rich fruits, which I was very fond of; and I had frequent occasions of gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both my taste and curiosity; for my captain always lodged on shore in those places, which afforded me oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to see the country around. I also learned navigation of the mate, which I was very sond of. When we left Italy we had delightful sailing among the Archipelago islands, and from thence to smyrna in Turkey. This is a very ancient city; the houses are built of stone, and most of them have graves adjoining to them; so that they sometimes present the appearence of church-yards. Provisions are very plentiful in this city, and good wine less than a penny a pint. The grapes, pomegranates, and many other fruits, were also the richest and largest I ever tasted. The natives are well looking and strong made, and treated me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0324600502:94"/>
with great civility. In general I believe they are fond of black peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and several of them gave me pressing invitations to stay amongst them, although they keep the franks, or Christians, separate, and do not suffer them to dwell immediately amongst them. I was astonished in not seeing women in any of their shops, and very rarely any in the streets; and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I did they were covered with a veil from head to foot, so that I could not see their faces, except when any of them out of curiosity uncovered them to look at me, which they sometimes did. I was surprised to see how the Greeks are, in some measure, kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by the Turks, as the negroes are in the West Indies by the white people. The less refined Greeks, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready hinted, dance here in the same manner as we do in our nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:0324600502:95"/>
On the whole, during our stay here, which was about five months, I liked the place and the Turks extremely well. I could not help observing one very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable circumstance there: the tails of the sheep are flat, and so very large, that I have known the tail even of a lamb to weigh from eleven to thirteen pounds. The fat of them is very white and rich, and is excellent in puddings, for which it is much used. Our ship being at length richly loaded with silk, and other articles, we sailed for England.</p>
            <p>In May 1769, soon after our return from Turkey, our ship made a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful voyage to Oporto in Portugal, where we arrived at the time of the carnival. On our arrival, there were sent on board of us thirty-six articles to observe with very heavy penalties if we should break any of them; and none o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> us even dared to go on board any othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

vessel or on shore, till the Inquisition had sent on board and searched for every thing illegal, especially bibles. such as were produced, and certain other things were sent on shore till the ships were going away; and any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in whose custody a bible was found concealed, was to be imprisoned and flogged, and sent into slavery for ten years. I saw here many very magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent sights, particularly the garden of Eden, where many of the clergy and laity went in procession in their several orders with the host, and sung Te De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. I had a great curiosity to go into some of their churches, but could not gain admittance without using the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary sprinkling of holy water at my entrance. From curiosity, and a wish to be holy, I therefore complied with this ceremony, but its virtues were lost upon me, for I found myself nothing
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0324600502:97"/>
the better for it. This place abounds with plenty of all kinds of provisions. The town is well built and pretty, and commands a fine prospect. Our ship having taken in a load of wine, and other commodities, we sailed for Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and arrived in July following.</p>
            <p>Our next voyage was to the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean. The ship was again got ready, and we sailed in september for Genoa. This is one of the finest cities I ever saw; some of the edifices were of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful marble, and made a most noble ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; and many had very curious fountains before them. The churches were rich and magnificent, and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously adorned both in the inside and out. But all this grandeur was in my eyes disgraced by the galley slaves, whose condition both there and in other parts of Italy is truly piteous and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. After we had stayed there some
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0324600502:98"/>
weeks, during which we bought many different things we wanted, and got them very cheap, we sailed to Naples, a charming city, and remarkably clean. The bay is the most beautiful I ever saw; the moles for shipping are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. I thought it extraordinary to see grand operas acted here on sunday nights, and even attended by their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties. I too, like these great ones, went to those sights, and vainly serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God in the day while I thus served mammon effectually at night. While we remained here, there happened an eruption of mount Vesuvius, of which I had a perfect view. It was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly awful; and we were so near that the ashes from it used to be thick on our deck. After we had transacted our business at Naples, we sailed with a fair wind once more for smyrna, where we arrived in December. A seraskier
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0324600502:99"/>
or officer, took a liking to me here, and wanted me to stay, and offered me two wives; however I resused the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, thinking one was as much as some could manage, and more than others would venture on. The mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants here travel in caravans or large companies. I have seen many cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans from India, with some hundreds of camels, laden with different goods. The people of these caravans are quite brown. Among other articles, they brought with them a great quantity of locusts, which are a kind of pulse, sweet and pleasant to the palate, and in shape resembling French beans, but longer. Each kind of goods is sold in a street by itself, and I always found the Turks very honest in their dealings. They let no Christians into their mosques or churches, for which I was very sorry; as I was always fond of going to see
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0324600502:100"/>
the different modes of worship of the people wherever I went. The plague broke out while we were in smyrna, and we stopped taking goods into the ship till it was over. she was then richly laden, and we sailed in about March 1770, for England. One day in our passage we met with an accident which was near burning the ship. A black cook, in melting some fat, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set the pan into the fire under the deck, which immediately began to blaze, and the flame went up very high under the foretop. With the fright, the poor cook became almost white, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther speechless. Happily however we got the fire out without doing much mischief. After various delays in this passage, which was tedious, we arrived in standgate creek in July; and, at the latter end of the year, some new event
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0324600502:101"/>
occurred, so that my noble captain, the ship, and I all separated.</p>
            <p>In April 1771, I shipped myself as a steward with Capt. Wm. Robertson of the ship Grenada Planter, once more to try my fortune in the West Indies; and we sailed from London for Madeira, Barbados, and the Grenades<span id="a010" corresp="n010">Barbados</span> <note id="n010" target="a010" type="gloss">These islands traded heavily in sugar cane. Barbados had one of the largest sugar industries in the world during the eighteenth century(Wikipedia).</p>
            <p>A white man, an islander, bought some goods of me to the amount of some pounds, and made me many fair promises as usual, but without any intention of paying me. He had likewise bought goods from some more of our people, whom he intended to serve in the same manner; but he still amused us with promises. However, when our ship was loaded, and near sailing, this honest buyer discovered no intention
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0324600502:102"/>
or sign of paying for any thing he had bought of us; but on the contrary, when I asked him for my money he threatened me and another black man he had bought goods of, so that we found we were like to get more blows than payment. On this we went to complain to one Mr. M'Intosh, a justice of the peace; we told his worship of the man's villainous tricks, and begged that he would be kind enough to see us redressed: but being negroes, although free, we could not get any remedy; and our ship being then just upon the point of sailing, we knew not how to help ourselves, though we thought it hard to lose our property in this manner. Luckily for us however, this man was also indebted to three white sailors, who could not get a farthing from him; they therefore readily joined us, and we all went together in
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0324600502:103"/>
search of him. When we found where he was, I took him out of a house and threatened him with vengeance; on which, finding he was likely to be handled roughly, the rogue offered each of us some small allowance, but nothing near our demands. This exasperated us much more; and some were for cutting his ears off; but he begged hard for mercy, which was at last granted him, after we had entirely stripped him. We then let him go, for which he thanked us, glad to get off so easily, and ran into the bushes, after having wished us a good voyage. We then repaired on board, and shortly after set sail for England. I cannot help remarking here a very narrow escape we had from being blown up, owing to a piece of negligence of mine. Just as our ship was under sail, I went down under the cabin to do some business,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0324600502:104"/>
and had a lighted candle in my hand, which, in my hurry, without thinking, I held in a barrel of gunpowder. It remained in the powder until it was near catching sire, when fortunately I observed it and snatched it out in time, and providentially no harm happened; but I was so overcome with terror that I immediately fainted at this deliverance.</p>
            <p>In twenty-eight days time we arrived in England, and I got clear of this ship. But, being still of a roving disposition, and desirous of seeing as many different parts of the world as I could, I shipped myself soon after, in the same year, as steward on board of a fine large ship, called the Jamaica, Captain David Watt; and we sailed from England in December 1771, for Nevis <span id="a010" corresp="n010">Nevis</span> <note id="n010" target="a010" type="gloss">Small island in the Caribbean(Wikipedia).</note> and Jamaica. I found Jamaica to be a very fine large island, well peopled, and the most considerable
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0324600502:105"/>
of the West India islands. There was a vast number of negroes here, whom I found as usual exceedingly imposed upon by the white people, and the slaves punished as in the other islands. There are negroes whose business it is to flog slaves; they go about to different people for employment, and the usual pay is from one to four bits. I saw many cruel punishments inflicted on the slaves in the short time I stayed here. In particular I was present when a poor fellow was tied up and kept hanging by the wrists at some distance from the ground, and then some half hundred weights were fixed to his ankles, in which posture he was flogged most unmercifully. There were also, as I heard, two different masters noted for cruelty on the island, who had staked up two negroes naked, and in two hours the vermin stung them
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0324600502:106"/>
to death. I heard a gentleman, I well knew, tell my captain that he passed sentence on a negro man to be burnt alive for attempting to poison an overseer. I pass over numerous other instances, in order to relieve the reader by a milder scene of roguery. Before I had been long on the island, one Mr. smith at Port Morant, bought goods of me to the amount of twenty-five pounds sterling; but when I demanded payment from him, he was going each time to beat me, and threatened that he would put me in goal. One time he would say I was going to set his house on fire; at another, he would swear I was going to run away with his slaves. I was astonished at this usage from a person who was in the situation of a gentleman, but I had no alternative; and was therefore obliged to submit. When I came to Kingston, I was surprised to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0324600502:107"/>
see the number of Africans who were assembled together on Sundays; particularly at a large commodious place, called spring Path. Here each different nation of Africa meet and dance after the manner of their own country. They still retain most of their native customs: they bury their dead, and put victuals, pipes and tobacco, and other things, in the grave with the corps, in the same manner as in Africa. Our ship having got her loading we sailed for London, where we arrived in the August following. On my return to London, I waited on my old and good master, Dr. Irving, who made me an offer of his service again. Being now tired of the sea I gladly accepted it. I was very happy in living with this gentleman once more; during which time we were daily employed in reducing old Neptune's dominions
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0324600502:108"/>
by purifying the briny element and making it fresh. Thus I went on till May 1773, when I was roused by the sound of fame, to seek new adventures, and find, towards the north pole, what our Creator never intended we should, a passage to India. An expedition was now fitting out to explore a north-east passage, conducted by the Honourable Constantine John Phipps, since Lord Mulgrave, in his Majesty's sloop of war the Race Horse. My master being anxious for the reputation of this adventure, we therefore prepared every thing for our voyage, and I attended him on board the Race Horse, the 24th day of May, 1773. We proceeded to Sheerness<span id="a010" corresp="n010">Sheerness</span> <note id="n010" target="a010" type="gloss">Sheerness is a port to the east of London. See link for photo http://www.weather-forecast.com/locations/Sheerness.</note>, where we were joined by his Majesty's sloop the Carcass, commanded by Captain Lutwidge. On the 4th of June, we sailed towards our destined place, the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0324600502:109"/>
pole; and on the 15th of the same month we were off shetland. On this day I had a great and unexpected deliverance from an accident which was near blowing up the ship and destroying the crew, which made me ever after during the voyage uncommonly cautious. The ship was so filled that there was very little room on board for any one, which placed me in a very aukward situation. I had resolved to keep a journal of this singular and interesting voyage; and I had no other place for this purpose but a little cabin, or the doctor's store-room, where I slept. This little place was stuffed with all manner of combustibles, particularly with tow and aquafortis<span id="a010" corresp="n010">aquafortis</span> <note id="n010" target="a010" type="gloss">Nitric Acid, Latin for Strong Water, it is a highly corrosive substance.</note> , and many other dangerous things. Unfortunately it happened in the evening as I was writing my journal, that I had occasion to take the candle out of the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0324600502:110"/>
lanthorn<span id="a010" corresp="n010">lanthorn</span> <note id="n010" target="a010" type="gloss">lantern</note> , and a spark having touched a single thread of the tow, all the rest caught the flame, and immediately the whole was in a blaze. I saw nothing but present death before me, and expected to be the first to perish in the flames. In a moment the alarm was spread, and many people who were near, ran to assist in putting out the fire. All this time I was in the very midst of the flames; my shirt, and the handkerchief on my neck, were burnt, and I was almost smothered with the smoke. However, through God's mercy, as I was nearly giving up all hopes, some people brought blankets and mattresses and threw them on the flames, by which means in a short time the fire was put out. I was severely reprimanded and menaced by such of the officers who knew it, and strictly charged never more to go there with a
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0324600502:111"/>
light: and, indeed, even my own fears made me give heed to this command for a little time—but at last, not being able to write my journal in any other part of the ship, I was tempted again to venture by stealth with a light in the same cabin, though not without considerable fear and dread on my mind. On the 20th of June, we began to use Dr. Irving's apparatus for making salt water fresh; I used to attend the distillery: I frequently purified from twenty-six to forty gallons a day. The water thus distilled was perfectly pure, well tasted, and free from salt; and was used on various occasions on board the ship. On the 28th of June, being in lat. 78, we made Greenland, where I was surprized to see the sun did not set. The weather now became extremely cold; and as we sailed between north and east, which was our
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0324600502:112"/>
course, we saw many very high and curious mountains of ice; and also a great number of very large whales, which used to come close to our ship, and blow the water up to a very great height in the air. One morning we had vast quantities of sea-horses<span id="a010" corresp="n010">sea-horses</span> <note id="n010" target="a010" type="gloss">Walruses</note>  about the ship, which neighed exactly like any other horses. We fired some harpoon guns amongst them, in order to take some; but we could not get any. The 30th, the captain of a Greenland ship came on board, and told us of three ships that were lost in the ice; however we still held on our course till July the 11th, when we were stopt by one compact impenetrable body of ice. We ran along it from east to west above ten degrees; and on the 27th we got as far north as 80, 37; and in 19 or 20 degrees; east longitude from London. On the 29th and 30th of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0324600502:113"/>
July, we saw one continued plain of smooth unbroken ice, bounded only by the horizon; and we fastened to a piece of ice that was eight yards eleven inches thick. We had generally sunshine, and constant daylight; which gave cheerfulness and novelty to the whole of this striking, grand, and uncommon scene; and, to heighten it still more, the reflection of the sun from the ice gave the clouds a most beautiful appearance. We killed many different animals at this time, and among the rest nine bears. Though they had nothing in their paunches but water yet they were all very fat. We used to decoy them to the ship sometimes by burning feathers of skins. I thought them course eating, but some of the ship's company relished them very much. some of our people once, in the boat, fired at and wounded a seahorse,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0324600502:114"/>
which dived immediately; and in a little time after, brought up with it a number of others. They all joined in an attack upon the boat, and were with difficulty prevented from staving or oversetting her; but a boat from the Carcass having come to assist ours, and joined it, they dispersed, after having wrested an oar from one of the men. One of the ship's boats had before been attacked in the same manner, but happily no harm was done. Though we wounded several of these animals we never got but one. We remained hereabouts until the 1st of August; when the two ships got completely fastened in the ice, occasioned by the loose ice that set in from the sea. This made our situation very dreadful and alarming; so that on the 7th day, we were in very great apprehension of having the ships squeezed to pieces.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0324600502:115"/>
The officers now held a council to know what was best for us to do in order to save our lives; and it was determined that we should endeavour to escape by dragging our boats along the ice towards the sea; which, however, was farther off than any of us thought. This determination filled us with extreme dejection, and confounded us with despair; for we had very little prospect of escaping with life. However, we sawed some of the ice about the ships, to keep it from hurting them; and thus kept them in a kind of pond. We then began to drag the boats as well as we could towards the sea; but, after two or three days labour, we made very little progress; so that some of our hearts totally failed us, and I really began to give up myself for lost, when I saw our surrounding calamities. While we were
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0324600502:116"/>
at this hard labour, I once fell into a pond we had made amongst some loose ice, and was very near being drowned; but providentially some people were near who gave me immediate assistance, and thereby I escaped drowning. Our deplorable condition, which kept up the constant apprehension of our perishing in the ice, brought me gradually to think of eternity in such a manner as I never had done before. I had the fears of death hourly upon me, and shuddered at the thoughts of meeting the grim king of terrors in the <hi rend= “italic”>natural</hi> state I then was in, and was exceedingly doubtful of a happy eternity if I should die in it. I had no hopes of my life being prolonged for any time; for we saw that our existence could not be long on the ice after leaving the ships, which were now out of sight, and some miles from the boats.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0324600502:117"/>
Our appearance now became truly lamentable; pale dejection seized every countenance; many, who had been before blasphemers, in this our distress began to call on the good God of heaven for his help; and in the time of our utter need he heard us, and against hope or human probability, delivered us! It was the eleventh day of the ships being thus fastened, and the fourth of our drawing the boats in this manner, that the wind changed to the E. N. E. The weather immediately became mild, and the ice broke towards the sea, which was to the s. W. of us. Many of us on this got on board again, and with all our might we hove the ships into every open water we could find, and made all the sail on them in our power: and now, having a prospect of success, we made signals for the boats and the remainder
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0324600502:118"/>
of the people. This seemed to us like a reprieve from death; and happy was the man who could first get on board of any ship, or the first boat he could meet. We then proceeded in this manner till we got into the open water again, which we accomplished in about thirty hours, to our infinite joy and gladness of heart. As soon as we were out of danger, we came to anchor and refitted; and on the 19th of August, we sailed from this uninhabited extremity of the world, where the inhospitable climate affords neither food nor shelter, and not a tree or shrub of any kind grows amongst its barren rocks; but all is one desolate and expanded waste of ice, which even the constant beams of the sun for six months in the year, cannot penetrate or dissolve. The sun now being on the decline, the days shortened as
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0324600502:119"/>
we sailed to the southward; and, on the 28th, in latitude 73, it was dark by ten o'clock at night. September the 10th, in latitude 58-59, we met a very severe gale of wind and high seas, and shipped a great deal of water in the space of ten hours. This made us work exceedingly hard at all our pumps a whole day; and one sea, which struck the ship with more force than any thing I ever met with of the kind before, laid her under water for some time, so that we thought she would have gone down. Two boats were washed from the booms, and the long-boat from the chucks: all other moveable things on the decks were also washed away, among which were many curious things of different kinds which we had brought from Greenland; and we were obliged, in order to lighten the ship, to toss some of our guns overboard.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0324600502:120"/>
We saw a ship at the same time, in very great distress, and her masts were gone; but we were unable to assist her. We now lost sight of the Carcass till the 26th, when we saw land about Orfordness <span id="a010" corresp="n010">Orfordness</span> <note id="n010" target="a010" type="gloss”Click link for picture of location on map: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Suffolk_UK_location_map.svg</note>, off which place she joined us. From thence we sailed for London, and on the 30th came up to Deptford. And thus ended our Arctic voyage, to the no small joy of all on board, after having been absent four months; in which time, at the imminent hazard of our lives, we explored nearly as far towards the Pole as 81 degrees north, and 20 degrees east longitude; being much farther, by all accounts, than any navigator had ever ventured before; in which we fully proved the impracticability of finding a passage that way to India.</p>

               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>Our voyage to the North Pole being ended, I returned to London with Doctor Irving, with whom I continued for some time, during which I began seriously to reflect on the dangers I had escaped, particularly those of my last voyage, which made a lasting impression on my mind; and, by the grace of God,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0324600502:122"/>
proved afterwards a mercy to me; it caused me to reflect deeply on my eternal state, and to seek the Lord with full purpose of heart ere it was too late. I rejoiced greatly; and heartily thanked the Lord for directing me to London, where I was determined to work out my own salvation, and in so doing, procure a title to heaven; being the result of a mind blended by ignorance and sin.</p>
            <p>In process of time I left my master, Doctor Irving, the purifier of waters. I lodged in Coventry-court, Haymarket, where I was continually oppressed and much concerned about the salvation of my soul, and was determined (in my own strength) to be a first-rate Christian. I used every means for this purpose; and, not being able to find any person amongst those with
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0324600502:123"/>
whom I was then acquainted that acquiesced with me in point of religion, or, in scripture language, that would shew me any good, I was much dejected, and knew not where to seek relief; however, I first frequented the neighbouring churches, st. James's, and others, two or three times a day, for many weeks: still I came away dissatisfied: something was wanting that I could not obtain, and I really found more heart-felt relief in reading my bible at home than in attending the church; and, being resolved to be saved, I pursued other methods. First I went among the quakers, where the word of God was neither read or preached, so that I remained as much in the dark as ever. I then searched into the Roman Catholic principles, but was not in the least edified. I at length had recourse to the Jews, which availed me
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0324600502:124"/>
nothing, as the fear of eternity daily harassed my mind, and I knew not where to seek shelter from the wrath to come. However this was my conclusion, at all events, to read the four evangelists, and whatever sect or party I found adhering thereto, such I would join. Thus I went on heavily without any guide to direct me the way that leadeth to eternal life. I asked different people questions about the manner of going to heaven, and was told different ways. Here I was much staggered, and could not find any at that time more righteous than myself, or indeed so much inclined to devotion. I thought we should not all be saved (this is agreeable to the holy scriptures) nor would all be damned. I found none among the circle of my acquaintance that kept wholly the ten commandments. so righteous was I in my own
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0324600502:125"/>
eyes, that I was convinced I excelled many of them in that point, by keeping eight out of ten; and finding those who in general termed themselves Christians not so honest or so good in their morals as the Turks, I really thought the Turks were in a safer way of salvation than my neighbours: so that between hopes and fears I went on, and the chief comforts I enjoyed were in the musical French horn, which I then practised, and also dressing of hair. Such was my situation some months, experiencing the dishonesty of many people here. I determined at last to set out for Turkey, and there to end my days. It was now early in the spring 1774. I sought for a master, and found a captain John Hughes, commander of a ship called Anglicania, fitting out in the river Thames, and bound to Smyrna <span id="a010" corresp="n010">Smyrna</span> <note id="n010" target="a010" type="gloss">Known today as Izmir, Turkey, this large port was an Ancient Greek city that’s strategically advantageous position has maintained it as a trading port to this day(BiblePlaces.com).</note>in Turkey. I shipped myself with him as a
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0324600502:126"/>
steward; at the same time I recommended to him a very clever black man, John Annis, as a cook. This man was on board the ship near two months doing his duty: he had formerly lived many years with Mr. William Kirkpatrick, a gentleman of the island of St. Kitts, from whom he parted by consent, though he afterwards tried many schemes to inveigle<span id="a010" corresp="n010">inveigle</span> <note id="n010" target="a010" type="gloss">Persuade</note> the poor man. He had applied to many captains who traded to St. Kitts to trepan him<span id="a010" corresp="n010">trepan</span> <note id="n010" target="a010" type="gloss"> This does not refer to the surgical definition of trepan which means to dig a hole in the scull. This is a lesser known definition meaning to ensnare or trap (hughcrosfield.wordpress.com)</note>; and when all their attempts and schemes of kidnapping proved abortive, Mr. Kirkpatrick came to our ship at Union stairs, on Easter Monday, April the fourth, with two wherry boats and six men, having learned that the man was on board; and tied, and forcibly took him away from the ship, in the presence of the crew and the chief mate, who had detained him after he had information
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0324600502:127"/>
to come away. I believe this was a combined piece of business: but, be that as it may, it certainly reflected great disgrace on the mate and captain also, who, although they had desired the oppressed man to stay on board, yet this vile act on the man who had served him, he did not in the least assist to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover or pay me a farthing of his wages, which was about five pounds. I proved the only friend he had, who attempted to regain him his liberty if possible, having known the want of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty myself. I sent as soon as I could to Gravesend, and got knowledge of the ship in which he was; but unluckily she had sailed the first tide after he was put on board. My intention was then immediately to apprehend Mr. Kirk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patrick, who was about setting off for scotland; and, having obtained a <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bcas corpus</hi> for him, and got a tipstaff to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0324600502:128"/>
go with me to st. Paul's church-yard, where he lived, he, suspecting some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this kind, set a watch to look out. My being known to them, obliged me to use the following deception: I whitened my face, that they might not know me, and this had the desired effect. He did not go out of his house that night, and next morning I contrived a well plotted stratagem, notwithstanding he had a gentleman in his house to personate him. My direction to the tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staff, who got admittance into the house, was to conduct him to a judge, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the writ. When he came there, his plea was, that he had not the body in custody, on which he was admitted to bail. I proceeded immediately to that well known philanthropist, Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville sharp, <abbr>Esq</abbr> who received me with the utmost kindness, and gave me every instruction that was needful on
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0324600502:129"/>
the occasion. I lest him in full hope that I should gain the unhappy man his liberty, with the warmest sense of gratitude towards Mr. sharp, for his kindness; but alas! my attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney proved unfaithful; he took my money, lost me many months em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy, and did not do the least good in the cause; and when the poor man ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at st. Kitts, he was, according to custom, staked to the ground with four pins through a cord, two on his wrists, and two on his ancles, was cut and flog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged most unmercifully, and afterwards loaded cruelly with irons about his neck. I had two very moving letters from him, while he was in this situation; and made attempts to go after him at a great hazard, but was sadly disappointed: I also was told of it by some very respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table families now in London, who saw him in st. Kitts, in the same state, in which he remained till kind death re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0324600502:130"/>
him out of the hands of his ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants. During this disagreeable busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness I was under strong convictions of sin, and thought that my state was worse than any man's; my mind was unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countably disturbed; I often wished for death, though at the same time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced I was altogether unprepared for that awful summons. suffering much by villains in the late cause, and being much concerned about the state of my soul, these things (but particularly the latter) brought me very low; so that I became a burden to myself, and viewed all things around me as emptiness and vanity, which could give no satisfaction to a troubled conscience. I was again determined to go to Turkey, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, at that time, never more to return to England. I engaged as steward on board a Turkeyman (the Wester Hall, Capt. Lina) but was prevented by means of my late captain, Mr. Hughes, and others. All this appeared
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0324600502:131"/>
to be against me, and the only comfort I then experienced was, in reading the holy scriptures, where I saw that <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'there is no new thing under the sun,'</q> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. i. 9; and what was appointed for me I must submit to. Thus I continued to travel in much heaviness, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently murmured against the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, particularly in his providential dealings; and, awful to think! I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to blaspheme, and wished often to be any thing but a human being. In these severe conflicts the Lord answered me by awful <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed,'</q> Job xxxiii. 15. He was pleased, in much mercy, to give me to see, and in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure understand, the great and awful scene of the judgment-day, that <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'no unclean person, no unholy thing, can enter into the kingdom of God,</q> Eph.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0324600502:132"/>
v. 5. I would then, if it had been pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, have changed my nature with the meanest worm on the earth; and was ready to say to the mountains and rocks <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'fall on me,'</q> Rev. vi. 16; but all in vain. I then in the greatest agony requested the divine Creator, that he would grant me a small space of time to repent of my follies and vile iniquities, which I felt were grievous. The Lord, in his manifold mercies, was pleased to grant my request, and being yet in a state of time the sense of God's mercies were so great on my mind when I awoke, that my strength entirely fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me for many minutes, and I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly weak. This was the first spiritual mercy I ever was sensible or, and being on praying ground, as soon as I recovered a little strength, and got out of bed and dressed myself, I invoked Heaven from my inmost soul, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently begged that God would never
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0324600502:133"/>
again permit me to blaspheme his most holy name. The Lord, who is long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suffering, and full of compassion to such poor rebels as we are, condescended to hear and answer. I felt that I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unholy, and saw clearly what a bad use I had made of the faculties I was endowed with: they were given me to glorify God with; I thought, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I had better want them here, and enter into life eternal, than abuse them and be cast into hell sire. I prayed to be directed, if there were any holier than those with whom I was acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Lord would point them out to me. I appealed to the searcher of hearts, whether I did not wish to love him more, and serve him better. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all this, the reader may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily discern, if a believer, that I was still in nature's darkness. At length I hated
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0324600502:134"/>
the house in which I lodged, because God's most holy name was blasphemed in it; then I saw the word of God ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, viz. <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'Before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I will hear.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>I had a great desire to read the bible the whole day at home; but not having a convenient place for retirement, I left the house in the day, rather than stay amongst the wicked ones; and that day as I was walking, it pleased God to direct me to a house where there was an old sea-faring man, who experienced much of the love of God shed abroad in his heart. He began to discourse with me; and, as I desired to love the Lord, his conversation rejoiced me greatly; and indeed I had never heard before the love of Christ to believers set forth in such a manner, and in so clear a point of view. Here I had more questions to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0324600502:135"/>
put to the man than his time would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to answer: and in that memor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able hour there came in a dissenting minister; he joined our discourse, and asked me some few questions; among others, where I heard the gospel preached? I knew not what he meant by hearing the gospel; I told him I had read the gospel: and he asked where I went to church, or whether I went at all or not? To which I replied <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'I attended st. James's, st. Martin's, and st. Ann's soho;'</q>—<q rend="inline">'so,'</q> said he, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'you are a churchman?'</q>I answered, I was. He then invited me to a love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feast at his chapel that evening. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the offer, and thanked him; and soon after he went away, I had some further discourse with the old Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, added to some profitable read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which made me exceedingly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. When I left him he reminded me
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0324600502:136"/>
of coming to the feast; I assured him I would be there. Thus we parted, and I weighed over the heavenly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation that had passed between these two men, which cheered my then heavy and drooping spirit more than any thing I had met with for many months. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I thought the time long in going to my supposed banquet. I also wished much for the company of these friendly men; their company pleased me much; and I thought the gentleman very kind in asking me, a stranger, to a feast; but how singular did it appear to me, to have it in a chapel! When the wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for hour came I went, and happily the old man was there, who kindly seated me, as he belonged to the place. I was much astonished to see the place filled with people, and no signs of eating and drinking. There were many ministers in the company. At last they began
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0324600502:137"/>
by giving out hymns, and between the singing, the ministers engaged in prayer: in short, I knew not what to make of this sight, having never seen any thing of the kind in my life before now. some of the guests began to speak their experience, agreeable to what I read in the scriptures: much was said by every speaker of the providence of God, and his unspeakable mercies, to each of them. This I knew in a great measure, and could most heartily join them. But when they spoke of a future state, they seemed to be altogether cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of their calling and election of God; and that no one could ever seperate them from the love of Christ, or pluck them out of his hands. This filled me with utter consternation, intermingled with admiration. I was so amazed as not to know what to think of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; my heart was attracted, and my
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0324600502:138"/>
affections were enlarged. I wished to be as happy as them, and was persuaded in my mind that they were different from the world <q rend="inline">'that lieth in wickedness,'</q> 1 John v. 19. Their language and singing, &amp;c. did well harmonize; I was entirely overcome, and wished to live and die thus. Lastly, some persons in the place produced some neat baskets full of buns, which they distributed about; and each person communicated with his neighbour, and sipped water out of different mugs, which they handed about to all who were present. This kind of Christian fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship I had never seen, nor ever thought of seeing on earth; it fully reminded me of what I had read in the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, of the primitive Christians, who loved each other and broke bread; in partaking of it, even from house to house. This entertainment (which lasted about four hours) ended in sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0324600502:139"/>
and prayer. It was the first soul feast I ever was present at. This last twenty-four hours produced me things, spiritual and temporal, sleeping and waking, judgment and mercy, that I could not but admire the goodness of God, in directing the blind, blasphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sinner in the path that he knew not of, even among the just; and instead of judgment he has shewed mercy, and will hear and answer the prayers and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of every returning prodigal:
<q>
                  <l>O! to grace how great a debtor</l>
                  <l>Daily I'm constrain'd to be!</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>After this I was resolved to win Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven if possible; and if I perished I thought it should be at the feet of Jesus, in praying to him for salvation. After having been an eye-witness to some of the happiness which attended those who feared God, I knew not how, with any
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0324600502:140"/>
propriety, to return to my lodgings, where the name of God was continually profaned, at which I felt the greatest horror; I paused in my mind for some time, not knowing what to do; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to hire a bed elsewhere, or go home again. At last fearing an evil report might arise, I went home, with a farewel to card-playing and vain jest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. I saw that time was very short, eternity long, and very near; and I viewed those persons alone blessed who were found ready at midnight call, or when the judge of all, both quick and dead, cometh.</p>
            <p>The next day I took courage, and went to Holborn, to see my new and worthy acquaintance, the old man, Mr. C—; he, with his wife, a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious woman, were at work at silk weaving; they seemed mutually happy, and both quite glad to see me, and I
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0324600502:141"/>
more so to see them. I sat down and we conversed much about soul matters, &amp;c. Their discourse was amazingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, edifying, and pleasant. I knew not at last how to leave this agreeable pair, till time summoned me away. As I was going they lent me a little book, entitled <q rend="inline margQuotes">"The conversion of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian."</q> It was in questions and answers. The poor man came over the sea to London, to inquire after the Christian's God, who, (through rich mercy) he found, and had not his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in vain. The above book was of great use to me, and at that time was a means of strengthening my faith; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in parting, they both invited me to call on them when I pleased. This delighted me, and I took care to make all the improvement from it I could; and so far I thanked God for such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and desires. I prayed that the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0324600502:142"/>
many evils I felt within might be done away, and that I might be weaned from my former carnal acquaintances. This was quickly heard and answered, and I was soon connected with those whom the scripture calls the excellent of the earth. I heard the gospel preached, and the thoughts of my heart and actions were laid open by the preachers, and the way of salvation by Christ alone was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently set forth. Thus I went on hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily for near two months; and I once heard, during this period, a reverend gentleman Mr. G. speak of a man who had departed this life in full assurance of his going to glory I was much asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished at the assertion; and did very deliberately inquire how he could get at this knowledge. I was answered fully, agreeable to what I read in the oracles of truth; and was told also, that if I did not experience the new birth,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0324600502:143"/>
and the pardon of my sins, through the blood of Christ, before I died, I could not enter the kingdom of heaven. I knew not what to think of this report, as I thought I kept eight commandments out of ten; then my worthy interpreter told me I did not do it, nor could I; and he added, that no man ever did or could keep the commandments, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offending in one point. I thought this sounded very strange, and puzzled me much for many weeks; for I thought it a hard saying. I then asked my friend Mr. L—d, who was a clerk in a chapel, why the commandments of God were given, if we could not be saved by them? To which he replied, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'The law is a schoolmaster to bring us to Christ,'</q> who alone could and did keep the commandments, and fulfilled all their requirements for his elect people, even those to whom he had given
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0324600502:144"/>
a living faith, and the sins of those chosen vessels <hi>were already</hi> atoned for and forgiven them whilst living; and if I did not experience the same before my exit, the Lord would say at that great day to me, <q rend="inline">'Go, ye cursed,'</q> &amp;c. &amp;c. for God would appear faithful in his judgments to the wicked, as he would be faithful in shewing mercy to those were ordained to it before the world was; therefore Christ Jesus seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be all in all to that man's soul. I was much wounded at this discourse, and brought into such a dilemma as I never expected. I asked him, if <hi>he</hi> was to die that moment, whether he was sure to enter the kingdom of God? and added, <q rend="inline">'Do you <hi>know</hi> that your sins are forgiven you?'</q> He answered in the affirmative. Then confusion, anger, and discontent seized me, and I stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered much at this sort of doctrine; it
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0324600502:145"/>
brought me to a stand, not knowing which to believe, whether salvation by works, or by faith only in Christ. I requested him to tell me how I might know when my sins were forgiven me. He assured me he could not, and that none but God alone could do this. I told him it was very mysterious; but he said it was really matter of fact, and quoted many portions of scripture immediately to the point, to which I could make no reply. He then desired me to pray to God to shew me these things. I answered, that I prayed to God every day? He said, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'I perceive you are a churchman.</q> I answered, I was. He then entreated me to beg of God to shew me what I was, and the true state of my soul. I thought the prayer very short and odd; so we parted for that time. I weighed all these things well over, and could not help thinking how it was possible for a man to know
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0324600502:146"/>
that his sins were forgiven him in this life. I wished that God would reveal this self same thing unto me. In a short time after this I went to Westminster chapel; the Rev. Mr. P— preached from Lam. iii. 39. It was a wonderful sermon; he clearly shewed that a living man had no cause to complain for the punishments of his sins; he evidently justified the Lord in all his dealings with the sons of men; he also shewed the justice of God in the eternal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the wicked and impenitent. The discourse seemed to me like a two-edged sword cutting all ways; it afforded me much joy, intermingled with many fears about my soul; and when it was ended, he gave it out that he intended, the ensuing week, to examine all those who meant to attend the Lord's table. Now I thought much of my good works, and at the same time was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0324600502:147"/>
of my being a proper object to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the sacrament; I was full of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation till the day of examining. However, I went to the chapel, and, though much distressed, I addressed the reverend gentleman, thinking if I was not right, he would endeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me of it. When I conversed with him, the first thing he asked me, was, what I knew of Christ? I told him I believed in him, and had been baptized in his name. <q rend="inline">'Then,'</q> said he, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'when were you brought to the knowledge of God? and how were you convinced of sin?'</q> I knew not what he meant by these questions; I told him I kept eight commandments out of ten; but that I sometimes swore on board ship, and sometimes when on shore, and broke the sabbath. He then asked me if I could read? I answered, <q rend="inline">'Yes.'</q>—<q rend="inline">'Then,'</q> said he, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'do you not read in the bible
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0324600502:148"/>
he that offends in one point is guilty of all?'</q> I said, <q rend="inline">'Yes.'</q> Then he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured me, that one sin unatoned for was as sufficient to damn a soul as one leak was to sink a ship. Here I was struck with awe; for the minister exhorted me much, and reminded me of the shortness of time, and the length of eternity, and that no unregenerate soul, or any thing unclean, could enter the kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>He did not admit me as a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant; but recommended me to read the scriptures, and hear the word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not to neglect fervent prayer to God, who has promised to hear the suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of those who seek him in godly sincerity; so I took my leave of him, with many thanks, and resolved to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his advice, so far as the Lord would condescend to enable me. During this time I was out of employ, nor was I
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0324600502:149"/>
likely to get a situation suitable for me, which obliged me to go once more to sea. I engaged as steward of a ship called the Hope, Capt. Richard strange, bound from London to Cadiz in spain. In a short time after I was on board I heard the name of God much blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed, and I feared greatly, lest I should catch the horrible infection. I thought if I sinned again, after having life and death set evidently before me, I should certainly go to hell. My mind was uncommonly chagrined, and I mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured much at God's providential deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with me, and was discontented with the commandments, that I could not be saved by what I had done; I hated all things, and wished I had never been born; confusion seized me, and I wished to be annihilated. One day I was standing on the very edge of the stern of the ship, thinking to drown
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0324600502:150"/>
myself; but this scripture was instantly impressed on my mind—<q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'That no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him,'</q> 1 John iii. 15. Then I paused, and thought myself the unhappiest man living. Again I was convinced that the Lord was better to me than I deserved, and I was better off in the world than many. After this I began to fear death; I fretted, mourned, and prayed, till I became a burden to others, but more so to myself. At length I concluded to beg my bread on shore rather than go again to sea amongst a people who feared not God, and I entreated the captain three different times to discharge me; he would not, but each time gave me greater and greater encouragement to continue with him, and all on board shewed me very great civility: notwithstanding all this I was unwilling to embark again. At last some of my
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0324600502:151"/>
religious friends advised me, by saying it was my lawful calling, consequently it was my duty to obey, and that God was not confined to place, &amp;c. &amp;c. particularly Mr. G. s. the governor of Tothil-fields Bridewell, who pitied my case, and read the eleventh chapter of the Hebrews to me, with exhortations. He prayed for me, and I believed that he prevailed on my behalf, as my burden was then greatly removed, and I found a heartfelt resignation to the will of God. The good man gave me a pocket Bible and <span id= “n” corresp= “n”> Alleine's Alarm to the Unconverted </span><note id=“n” target=“a” type=“gloss”> Reference to Joseph Alleine’s 1671 “An Alarm to the Unconverted,” which was commonly referred to as the “Sure Guide to Heaven,” that outlined the need for religious conversion of all people.</note> We parted, and the next day I went on board again. We sailed for Spain, and I found favour with the captain. It was the fourth of the month of September when we sailed from London; we had a delightful voyage to Cadiz, where we arrived the twenty-third of the same month. The place
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0324600502:152"/>
is strong, commands a fine prospect, and is very rich. The Spanish galloons frequent that port, and some arrived whilst we were there. I had many opportunities of reading the scriptures. I wrestled hard with God in fervent prayer, who had declared in his word that he would hear the groanings and deep sighs of the poor in spirit. I found this verified to my utter astonishment and comfort in the following manner:</p>
            <p>On the morning of the 6th of October, (I pray you to attend) all that day, I thought that I should either see or hear something supernatural. I had a secret impulse on my mind of something that was to take place, which drove me continually for that time to a throne of grace. It pleased God to enable me to wrestle with him, as Jacob did: I prayed that if sudden death were to happen, and I perished, it might be at Christ's feet.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:0324600502:153"/>
In the evening of the same day, as I was reading and meditating on the fourth chapter of the Acts, <span id= “n” corresp= “n”> twelfth verse </span><note id= “n” target= “a” type= “gloss”> Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved (Acts 4:12)</note>, under the solemn apprehensions of eternity, and reflecting on my past actions, I began to think I had lived a moral life, and that I had a proper ground to believe I had an interest in the divine favour; but still meditating on the subject, not knowing whether salvation was to be had partly for our own good deeds, or solely as the sovereign gift of God;—in this deep consternation the Lord was pleased to break in upon my soul with his bright beams of heavenly light; and in an instant as it were, removing the veil, and letting light into a dark place, I saw clearly with the eye of faith the crucified Saviour bleeding on the cross on mount Calvary: the scriptures became an unsealed book, I saw myself a condemned criminal under the law,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0324600502:154"/>
which came with its full force to my conscience, and when <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'the commandment came sin revived, and I died.'</q> I saw the Lord Jesus Christ in his humiliation, loaded and bearing my reproach, sin, and shame. I then clearly perceived that by the deeds of the law no flesh living could be justified. I was then convinced that by the first Adam sin came, and by the second Adam (the Lord Jesus Christ) all that are saved must be made alive. It was given me at that time to know what it was to be born again, <span id= “n” corresp= “n”> John iii. 5.</span><note id= “n” target= “a” type= “gloss”> Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit.” (John 3:5)</note> I saw the eighth chapter to the Romans, and the doctrines of God's decrees, verified agreeable to his eternal, everlasting, and unchangeable purposes. The word of God was sweet to my taste, yea sweeter than honey and the honeycomb. Christ was revealed to my soul as the chiefest among ten thousand. These heavenly moments
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0324600502:155"/>
were really as life to the dead, and what John calls an earnest of the spirit<note n="*" place="bottom">John xvi. 13, 14. &amp;c.</note>. This was indeed unspeakable, and I firmly believe undeniable by many. Now every leading providential circumstance that happened to me, from the day I was taken from my parents to that hour, was then in my view, as if it had but just then occurred. I was sensible of the invisible hand of God, which guided and protected me when in truth I knew it not: still the Lord pursued me although I slighted and disregarded it; this mercy melted me down. When I considered my poor wretched state I wept, seeing what a great debtor I was to sovereign free grace. Now the Ethiopian was willing to be saved by Jesus Christ, the sinner's only surety, and also to rely on none other person or thing for salvation.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0324600502:156"/>
Self was obnoxious, and good works he had none, for it is God that worketh in us both to will and to do. Oh! The amazing things of that hour can never be told—it was joy in the Holy Ghost! I felt an astonishing change; the burden of sin, the gaping jaws of hell, and the fears of death, that weighed me down before, now lost their horror; indeed I thought death would now be the best earthly friend I ever had. Such were my grief and joy as I believe are seldom experienced. I was bathed in tears, and said, What am I that God should thus look on me the vilest of sinners? I felt a deep concern for my mother and friends, which occasioned me to pray with fresh <span id= “n” corresp= “n”> ardour </span><note id= “n” target= “a” type= “gloss”> Heat of passion or desire, vehemence, ardent desire; warmth of emotion, zeal, fervour, eagerness, enthusiasm. (OED)</note>,; and in the abyss of thought, I viewed the unconverted people of the world in a very awful state, being without God and without hope.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:0324600502:157"/>
It pleased God to pour out on me the Spirit of prayer and the grace of <span id= “n” corresp= “n”> supplication </span><note id= “n” target= “a” type= “gloss”> 1. A humble plea; an earnest request or entreaty 2. The action of addressing a solemn request to God. (OED)</note>, so that in loud acclamations I was enabled to praise and glorify his most holy name. When I got out of the cabin, and told some of the people what the Lord had done for me, alas, who could understand me or believe my report!—None but to whom the arm of the Lord was revealed. I became a barbarian to them in talking of the love of Christ: his name was to me as ointment poured forth; indeed it was sweet to my soul, but to them a rock of offence. I thought my case singular, and every hour a day until I came to London, for I much longed to be with some to whom I could tell of the wonders of God's love towards me, and join in prayer to him whom my soul loved and thirsted after. I had uncommon commotions within, such as few can tell aught about. Now the bible was my
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0324600502:158"/>
only companion and comfort; I prized it much, with many thanks to God that I could read it for myself, and was not left to be tossed about or led by man's devices and notions. The worth of a soul cannot be told.—May the Lord give the reader an understanding in this. Whenever I looked in the bible I saw things new, and many texts were immediately applied to me with great comfort, for I knew that to me was the word of salvation sent. Sure I was that the spirit which <span id= “n” corresp= “n”> indited </span><note id= “n” target= “a” type= “gloss”> To utter, suggest, or inspire a form of words which is to be repeated or written down. (OED)</note> the word opened my heart to receive the truth of it as it is in Jesus—that the same spirit enabled me to act faith upon the promises that were precious to me, and enabled me to believe to the salvation of my soul. By free grace I was persuaded that I had a part in the first resurrection, and was enlightened with the <q rend="inline">'light of the living,'</q> Job xxxiii. 30.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0324600502:159"/>
I wished for a man of God with whom I might converse: my soul was like the chariots of <span id= “n” corresp= “n”> Aminadab </span><note id= “n” target= “a” type= “gloss”> A person mentioned in Canticles 6:12 whose chariots were famed for their swiftness. (Bible Study Tools)</note>, Canticles vi. 12. These among others, were the precious promises that were so powerfully applied to me: <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'All things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive,'</q> Matt. xxi. 22. <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you,'</q> John xiv. 27. I saw the blessed Redeemer to be the fountain of life, and the well of salvation. I experienced him to be all in all; he had brought me by a way that I knew not, and he had made crooked paths straight. Then in his name I set up my Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto he hath helped me: and could say to the sinners about me, Behold what a saviour I have! Thus I was, by the teaching of that all-glorious Deity, the great One in Three, and Three in One, confirmed in the truths of the bible, those oracles
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0324600502:160"/>
of everlasting truth, on which every soul living must stand or fall eternally, agreeable to Acts iv. 12. <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'Neither is there salvation in any other, for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved, but only Christ Jesus.'</q> May God give the reader a right understanding in these facts! <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'To him that believeth, all things are possible, but to them that are unbelieving nothing is pure,</q> Titus i. 15.</p>
            <p>During this period we remained at Cadiz until our ship got <span id= “n” corresp= “n”> laden. </span><note id= “n” target= “a” type= “gloss”> Burdened, loaded, weighed down.(OED)</note> We sailed about the fourth of November; and, having a good passage, we arrived in London the month following, to my comfort, with heartfelt gratitude to God for his rich and unspeakable mercies.</p>
            <p>On my return I had but one text which puzzled me, or that the devil
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0324600502:161"/>
endeavoured to buffet me with, viz. <span id= “n” corresp= “n”> Rom. xi. 6.</span><note id= “n” target= “a” type= “gloss”> For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin- Romans 6:6</note> and, as I had heard of the Reverend Mr. Romaine, and his great knowledge in the scriptures, I wished much to hear him preach. One day I went to <span id= “n” corresp= “n”> Blackfriars church</span><note id= “n” target= “a” type= “gloss”> An area of central London, which lies in the south-west corner of the City of London. The name Blackfriars was first used in 1317 and derives from the black cappa worn by the Dominican Friars who moved their priory from Holborn to the area between the River Thames and Legate Hill in 1276. (Blackfriars, Oxford,England)</note>, and, to my great satisfaction and surprise, he preached from that very text. He very clearly <span id= “n” corresp= “n”> shewed </span><note id= “n” target= “a” type= “gloss”> A spelling of the word “showed”</note> the difference between human works and free election, which is according to God's sovereign will and pleasure. These glad tidings set me entirely at liberty, and I went out of the church rejoicing, seeing my spots were those of God's Children. I went to Westminster Chapel, and saw some of my old friends, who were glad when they perceived the wonderful change that the Lord had wrought in me, particularly Mr. G— s—, my worthy acquaintance, who was a man of a choice spirit, and had great zeal
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0324600502:162"/>
sor the Lord's service. I enjoyed his correspondence till he died in the year 1784. I was again examined at that same chapel, and was received into church-fellowship amongst them: I rejoiced in spirit, making melody in my heart to the God of all my mercies, Now my whole wish was to be dissolved, and to be with Christ—but, alas! I must wait mine appointed time.</p>

            <p>WHEN our ship was got ready for sea again, I was intreated by the captain to go in her once more; but, as I felt myself now as happy as I could with to be in this life, I for some time refused; however, the advice of my friends at last prevailed; and, in full resignation to the will of God, I again
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0324600502:170"/>
embarked for Cadiz in March 1775. We had a very good passage, without any material accident, until we arrived off the Bay of Cadiz; when one Sunday, just as we were going into the harbour, the ship struck against a rock and knocked off a garboard plank, which is the next to the keel. In an instant all hands were in the greatest confusion, and began with loud cries to call on God to have mercy on them. Although I could not swim, and saw no way of escaping death, I felt no dread in my then situation, having no desire to live. I even rejoiced in spirit, thinking this death would be sudden glory. But the fulness of time was not yet come. The people near to me were much astonished in seeing me thus calm and resigned; but I told them of the peace of God, which through sovereign grace I enjoyed, and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0324600502:171"/>
these words were that instant in my mind:
<q>
                  <l>" Christ is my pilot wise, my compass is his word;</l>
                  <l>" My soul each storm desies, while I have such a Lord.</l>
                  <l>" I trust his faithfulness and power,</l>
                  <l>" To save me in the trying hour.</l>
                  <l>" Though rocks and quicksands deep through all my passage lie,</l>
                  <l>" Yet Christ shall safely keep and guide me with his eye,</l>
                  <l>" How can I sink with such a prop,</l>
                  <l>" That bears the world and all things up?"</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>At this time there were many large Spanish flukers or passage-vessels full of people crossing the channel; who seeing our condition, a number of them came alongside of us. As many hands as could be employed began to work; some at our three pumps, and the rest unloading the ship as fast as possible. There being only a single rock called the Porpus on which we struck, we soon got off it, and providentially it was then high water, we therefore run the ship
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0324600502:172"/>
ashore at the nearest place to keep her from sinking. After many tides, with a great deal of care and industry, we got her repaired again. When we had dispatched our business at Cadiz, we went to Gibraltar, and from thence to Malaga, a very pleasant and rich city, where there is one of the finest cathedrals I had ever seen. It had been above fifty years in building, as I heard, though it was not then quite finished; great parts of the inside, however, was completed and highly decorated with the richest marble columns and many superb paintings; it was lighted occasionally by an amazing number of wax tapers of different sizes, some of which were as thick as a man's thigh; these, however, were only used on some of their grand festivals.</p>
            <p>I was very much shocked at the custom of bull-baiting, and other diversions
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0324600502:173"/>
which prevailed here on Sunday evenings, to the great scandal of Christianity and morals. I used to express my <span id= “n” corresp= “n”> abhorrence </span><note id= “n” target= “a” type= “gloss”> A feeling of revulsion; disgusted loathing. (OED)</note> of it to a priest whom I met with. I had frequent contests about religion with the reverend father, in which he took great pains to make a proselyte of me to his church; and I no less to convert him to mine. On these occasions I used to produce my Bible, and shew him in what points his church erred. He then said he had been in England, and that every person there read the Bible, which was very wrong; but I answered him that Christ desired us to search the scriptures. In his zeal for my conversion, he solicited me to go to one of the universities in Spain, and declared that I should have my education free; and told me, if I got myself made a priest, I might in time
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0324600502:174"/>
become even pope; and that Pope Benedict was a black man. As I was ever desirous of learning, I paused for some time upon this temptation; and thought by being crafty I might catch some with <span id= “n” corresp= “n”> guile </span><note id= “n” target= “a” type= “gloss”> Sly or cunning intelligence. (OED)</note>; but I began to think that it would be only hypocrisy in me to embrace his offer, as I could not in conscience conform to the opinions of his church. I was therefore enabled to regard the word of God, which says, <q rend="inline">'Come out from amongst them,'</q> and refused Father Vincent's offer. so we parted without conviction on either side.</p>
            <p>Having taken at this place some fine wines, fruits, and money, we proceeded to Cadiz, where we took about two tons more of money, &amp;c. and then sailed for England in the month of June. When we were about the north latitude 42, we had contrary wind for
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0324600502:175"/>
several days, and the ship did not make in that time above six or seven miles strait course. This made the captain exceeding fretful and peevish: and I was very sorry to hear God's most holy name often blasphemed by him. One day, as he was in that <span id= “n” corresp= “n”> impious </span><note id= “n” target= “a” type= “gloss”> Showing lack of respect for God or religion. (OED)</note> mood, a young gentleman on board, who was a passenger, reproached him, and said he acted wrong; for we ought to be thankful to God for all things, as we were not in want of any thing on board; and though the wind was contrary for us, yet it was fair for some others, who, perhaps, stood in more need of it than we. I immediately seconded this young gentleman with some boldness, and said we had not the least cause to murmur, for that the Lord was better to us than we deserved, and that he had done all things well. I expected that the captain
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0324600502:176"/>
would be veay angry with me for speaking, but he replied not a word. However, before that time on the following day, being the 21st of June, much to our great joy and astonishment, we saw the providential hand of our benign Creator, whose ways with his blind creatures are past finding out. The preceding night I dreamed that I saw a boat immediately off the starboard main shrouds; and exactly at half past one o'clock, the following day at noon, while I was below, just as we had dined in the cabin, the man at the helm cried out, A boat! which brought my dream that instant into my mind. I was the first man that jumped on the deck; and looking from the shrouds onward, according to my dream, I descried a little boat at some distance; but, as the waves were high, it was as much as we could do sometimes to discern
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0324600502:177"/>
her; we however stopped the ship's way, and the boat, which was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly small, came alongside with eleven mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable men, whom we took on board immediately. To all human appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, these people must have perished in the course of one hour or less, the boat being small, it barely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them. When we took them up they were half drowned, and had no victuals, compass, water, or any other necessary whatsoever, and had only one bit of an oar to steer with, and that right before the wind; so that they were obliged to trust entirely to the mercy of the waves. As soon as we got them all on board, they bowed themselves on their knees, and, with hands and voices lifted up to heaven, thanked God for their deliverance; and I trust that my prayers were not wanting amongst them at the same
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0324600502:178"/>
time. This mercy of the Lord quite melted me, and I recollected his words, which I faw thus verified in the 107th Psalm, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever. Hungry and thirsty, their souls fainted in them. They cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distressess. And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation. O that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men! For he satisfieth the longing soul, and silleth the hungry soul with goodness.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'such as sit in dardness and in the shadow of death:</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses. They that go down
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0324600502:179"/>
to the sea in ships; that do business in great waters: these see the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep. Whoso is wise and will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve these things, even they shall understand the loving kindness of the Lord.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>The poor distressed captain said, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'that the Lord is good; for, seeing that I am not fit to die, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gave me a space of time to repent.'</q> I was very glad to hear this expression, and took an opportunity when convenient of talking to him on the providence of God. They told us they were Portuguese, and were in a brig loaded with corn, which shifted that morning at five o'clock, owing to which the vessel sunk that instant with two of the crew; and how these eleven got into the boat (which was lashed to the deck) not one of them could tell.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0324600502:180"/>
We provided them with every neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, and brought them all safe to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: and I hope the Lord gave them repentance unto life eternal.</p>
            <p>I was happy once more amongst my friends and brethren, till November, when my old friend, the celebrated Doctor Irving, bought a remarkable sine sloop, about 150 tons. He had a mind for a new adventure in cultivat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a plantation at Jamaica, and the Musquito shore; asked me to go with him, and said that he would trust me with his estate in preference to any one. By the advice, therefore, of my friends, I accepted of the offer, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the harvest was fully ripe in those parts, and hoped to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument under God, of bringing some poor sinner to my well beloved master, Jesus Christ. Before I embarked, I found with the Doctor four Masquito
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0324600502:181"/>
Indians, who were chiefs in their own country, and were brought here by some English traders for some selfish ends. One of them was the Musquito king's son; a youth of about eighteen years of age; and whilst he was here he was baptized by the name of George. They were going back at the government's expense, after having been in England about twelve months, during which they learned to speak pretty good English. When I came to talk to them about eight days before we sailed, I was very much mortified in finding that they had not frequented any churches since they were here, to be baptized, nor was any attention paid to their morals. I was very sorry for this mock Christianity, and had just an opportunity to take some of them once to church before we sailed. We embarked in the month of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0324600502:182"/>
1776, on board of the sloop Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing star, Captain David Miller, and sailed for Jamaica. In our passage, I took all the pains that I could to instruct the Indian prince in the doctrines of Christianity, of which he was entirely ignorant; and, to my great joy, he was quite attentive, and received with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness the truths that the Lord enabled me to set forth to him. I taught him in the compass of eleven days all the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and he could put even two or three of them together and spell them. I had Fox's Martyrology with cuts, and he used to be very fond of looking into it, and would ask many questions about the papal cruelties he saw de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picted there, which I explained to him. I made such progress with this youth, especially in religion, that when I used to go to bed at different hours of the night, if he was in his bed, he would
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0324600502:183"/>
get up on purpose to go to prayer with me, without any other clothes than his shirt; and before he would eat any of his meals amongst the gentlemen in the cabin, he would sirst come to me to pray as he called it. I was well pleased at this, and took great delight in him, and used much supplication to God for his conversion. I was in full hope of seeing daily every appearance of that change which I could wish; not knowing the devices of satan, who had many of his emissaries to sow his tares as fast as I sowed the good seed, and pull down as fast as I built up. Thus we went on nearly four fifths of our passage, when satan at last got the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand. some of his messengers, seeing this poor heathen much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in piety, began to ask him whether I had converted him to Christianity, laughed and made their
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0324600502:184"/>
jest at him, for which I rebuked them as much as I could; but this treatment caused the prince to halt between two opinions. some of the true sons of Belial, who did not believe that there was any hereafter, told him never to fear the devil, for there was none existing; and if ever he came to the prince, they desired he might be sent to them. Thus they teazed the poor innocent youth, so that he would not learn his book any more! He would not drink nor carouse with these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly actors, nor would he be with me, even at prayers. This grieved me very much. I endeavoured to persuade him as well as I could, but he would not come; and entreated him very much to tell me his reasons for acting thus. At last he asked me, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'How comes it that all the white men on board who can read and write, and observe the sun,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0324600502:185"/>
and know all things, yet swear, lie, and get drunk, only excepting your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self?'</q> I answered him, the reason was, that they did not fear God; and that if any one of them died so they could not go to, or be happy with God. He replied, that if these persons went to hell he would go to hell too. I was sorry to hear this; and, as he some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times had the tooth-ach, and also some other persons in the ship at the same time, I asked him if their tooth-ach made his easy: he said, No. Then I told him if he and these people went to hell together, their pains would not make his any lighter. This answer had great weight with him: it depressed his spirits much; and he became ever after, during the passage, fond of being alone. When we were in the latitude of Martinico, and near making the land, one morning we had a brisk gale
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0324600502:186"/>
of wind, and, carrying too much sail, the main-mast went over the side. Many people were then all about the deck, and the yards, masts, and rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, came tumbling all about us, yet there was not one of us in the least hurt, although some were within a hair's breadth of being killed: and, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, I saw two men who, by the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential hand of God, were most miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously preserved from being smashed to pieces. On the fifth of January we made Antigua and Montserrat, and ran along the rest of the islands: and on the fourteenth we arrived at Jamaica. One sunday while we were there I took the Musquito Prince George to church, where he saw the sacrament adminis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. When we came out we saw all kinds of people, almost from the church door for the space of half a mile down to the waterside, buying and selling all
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0324600502:187"/>
kinds of commodities: and these acts afforded me great matter of exhortation to this youth, who was much astonished. Our vessel being ready to sail for the Musquito shore, I went with the Doctor on board a Guinea-man, to purchase some slaves to carry with us, and cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate a plantation; and I chose them all my own countrymen. On the twelfth of February we sailed from Jamaica, and on the eighteenth arrived at the Musquito shore, at a place called Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peupy. All our Indian guests now, after I had admonished them and a few cases of liquor given them by the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, took an affectionate leave of us, and went ashore, where they were met by the Musquito king, and we never saw one of them afterwards. We then sailed to the southward of the shore, to a place called Cape Gracias a Dios, where there was a large lagoon or
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0324600502:188"/>
lake, which received the emptying of two or three very fine large rivers, and abounded much in fish and land tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toise. some of the native Indians came on board of us here; and we used them well, and told them we were come to dwell amongst them, which they seemed pleased at. so the Doctor and I, with some others, went with them ashore; and they took us to different places to view the land, in order to choose a place to make a plantation of. We fixed on a spot near a river's bank, in a rich soil; and, having got our necessaries out of the sloop, we began to clear away the woods, and plant different kinds of vegetables, which had a quick growth. While we were employed in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, our vessel went northward to Black River to trade. While she was there, a spanish guarda costa met with and took her. This proved very hurtful,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0324600502:189"/>
and a great embarrassment to us. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we went on with the culture of the land. We used to make fires every night all around us, to keep off wild beasts, which, as soon as it was dark, set up a most hideous roaring. Our habitation being far up in the woods, we frequently saw different kinds of animals; but none of them ever hurt us, except poisonous snakes, the bite of which the Doctor used to cure by giving to the patient as soon as possible, about half a tumbler of strong rum, with a good deal of Cayenne pepper in it. In this manner he cured two natives and one of his own slaves. The Indians were exceedingly fond of the Doctor, and they had good reason for it; for I believe they never had such an useful man amongst them. They came from all quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to our dwelling; and some <hi>woolwow</hi> or flat-headed Indians, who lived fifty or
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0324600502:190"/>
sixty miles above our river, and this side of the south sea, brought us a good deal of silver in exchange for our goods. The principal articles we could get from our neighbouring Indians, were turtle oil, and shells, little silk grass, and some provisions; but they would not work at any thing for us, except fishing; and a few times they assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to cut some trees down, in order to build us houses; which they did exactly like the Africans, by the joint labour of men, women, and children. I do not recollect any of them to have had more than two wives. These always accompanied their husbands when they came to our dwelling, and then they generally carried whatever they brought to us, and always squatted down behind their husbands. Whenever we gave them any thing to eat, the men and their wives eat seperate. I never saw the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0324600502:191"/>
least sign of incontinence amongst them. The women are ornamented with beads, and fond of painting themselves; the men also paint, even to excess, both their faces and shirts: their favourite colour is red. The women generally cultivate the ground, and the men are all fishermen and canoe makers. Upon the whole, I never met any nation that were so simple in their manners as these people, or had so little ornament in their houses. Neither had they, as I ever could learn, one word expressive of an oath. The worst word I ever heard amongst them when they were quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, was one that they had got from the English, which was <q rend="inline">'you rascal.'</q> I never saw any mode of worship among them; but in this they were not worse than their European brethren or neighbours, for I am sorry to say that there was not one white person in our dwelling, nor
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0324600502:192"/>
any where else, that I saw, in different places I was at on the shore, that was better or more pious than those unen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened indians; but they either worked or slept on sundays: and, to my sorrow, working was too much sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day's employment with ourselves; so much so, that in some length of time we really did not know one day from another. This mode of living laid the foundation of my decamping at last. The natives are well made and warlike; and they particularly boast of having never been conquered by the spaniards. They are great drinkers of strong liquors when they can get them. We used to distil rum from pine apples, which were very plentiful here; and then we could not get them away from our place. Yet they seemed to be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, in point of honesty, above any other nation I was ever amongst. The
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0324600502:193"/>
country being hot, we lived under an open shed, where we had all kinds of goods, without a door or a lock to any one article; yet we slept in safety, and never lost any thing, or were disturbed. This surprised us a good deal; and the Doctor, myself, and others, used to say if we were to lie in that manner in Europe we should have our throats cut the first night. The Indian governor goes once in a certain time all about the province or district, and has a number of men with him as attendants and assistants. He settles all the differences among the people, like the judge here, and is treated with very great respect. He took care to give us timely notice before he came to our habitation, by sending his stick as a token, for rum, sugar, and gunpowder, which we did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse sending; and at the same time we made the utmost preparation to receive
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0324600502:194"/>
his honour and his train. When he came with his tribe, and all our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring chieftians, we expected to sind him a grave reverend judge, solid and sagacious; but instead of that, before he and his gang came in sight, we heard them very clamorous; and they even had plundered some of our good neighbouring Indians, having intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated themselves with our liquor. When they arrived we did not know what to make of our new guests, and would gladly have dispensed with the honour of their company. However, having no alternative, we feasted them plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully all the day till the evening; when the governor, getting quite drunk, grew very unruly, and struck one of our most friendly chiefs, who was our nearest neighbour, and also took his gold-laced hat from him. At this a great commotion taken place; and the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0324600502:195"/>
Doctor interfered to make peace, as we could all understand one another, but to no purpose; and at last they became so outrageous that the Doctor, fearing he might get into trouble, left the house, and made the best of his way to the nearest wood, leaving me to do as well as I could among them. I was so enraged with the Governor, that I could have wished to have seen him tied fast to a tree and flogged for his behaviour; but I had not people enough to cope with his party. I therefore thought of a stratagem to appease the riot. Recollecting a passage I had read in the life of Columbus, when he was amongst the Indians in Mexico or Peru, where on some occasion, he frightened them, by telling them of certain events in the heavens, I had recourse to the same expedient; and it succeeded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my most sanguine expectations.
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0324600502:196"/>
When I had formed my determination. I went in the midst of them; and, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold of the Governor, I pointed up to the heavens. I menaced him and the rest: I told them God lived there, and that he was angry with them, and they must not quarrel so; that they were all brothers, and if they did not leave off, and go away quietly, I would take the book (point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Bible) read, and <hi>tell</hi> God to make them dead. This operated on them like magic.—The clamour im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ceased, and I gave them some rum and a few other things; after which they went away peaceably; and the Governor afterwards gave our neighbour, who was called Captain Plasmyah, his hat again. When the Doctor returned, he was exceedingly glad at my success in thus getting rid of our troublesome guests. The Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quito
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0324600502:197"/>
people within our vicinity, out of respect to the Doctor, myself, and his people, made entertainments of the grand kind, called in their tongue <hi>tourri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> or <hi>dryckbot.</hi> The English of this expression is, a feast of drinking about, of which it seems a corruption of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. The drink consisted of pine apples roasted, and casades chewed or beaten in mortars; which, after lying some time, ferments, and becomes so strong as to intoxicate, when drank in any quantity. We had timely notice given to us of the entertainment. A white family, whithin five miles of us, told us how the drink was made, and I and two others went before the time to the village, where the mirth was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be held, and there we saw the whole art of making the drink, and also the kind of animals that were to be eaten there. I cannot say the sight
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0324600502:198"/>
of either the drink or the meat were enticing to me. They had some thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of pine apples roasting, which they squeezed dirt and all, into a canoe they had there for the purpose. The casade drink was in beef barrels, and other vessels, and looked exactly like hog-wash. Men, women, and children, were thus employed in roasting the pine apples, and squeezing them with their hands. For sood they had many land torpins or tortoises, some dried turtle, and three large alligators alive, and tied fast to the trees. I asked the people what they were going to do with these alligators; and I was told they were to be eaten. I was much surpris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at this, and went home, not a little disgusted at the preparations. When the day of the feast was come, we took some rum with us, and went to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed place, where we found a great
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0324600502:199"/>
assemblage of these people, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived us very kindly. The mirth had begun before we came; and they were dancing with music: and the musical instruments were nearly the same as those of any other sable people; but, as I thought much less melodious than any other nation I ever knew. They had many curious gestures in dancing, and a variety of motions and postures of their bodies, which to me were in no wise attracting. The males danced by themselves, and the females also by themselves, as with us. The Doctor shewed his people the example, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately joining the women's party, though not by their choice. On per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the women disgusted, he joined the males. At night there were great illuminations, by setting fire to many pine trees, while the dryckbot went round merrily by calabashes or gourds: but the liquor might more justly be
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0324600502:200"/>
called eating than drinking. One Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, the oldest father in the vicinity, was dressed in a strange and terrifying form. Around his body were skins adorned with different kinds of feathers, and he had on his head a very large and high head-piece, in the form of a gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadier's cap, with prickles like a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupine: and he made a certain noise which resembled the cry of an alligator. Our people skipped amongst them out of complaisance, though some could not drink of their tourrie; but our rum met with customers enough, and was soon gone. The alligators were killed and some of them roasted. Their manner of roasting is by digging a hole in the earth, and filling it with wood, which they burn to coal, and then they lay sticks across, on which they set the meat. I had a raw piece of the alligator in my hand: it was very rich: I thought it looked like fresh salmon, and it had a
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0324600502:201"/>
most fragrant smell, but I could not eat any of it. This merry-making at last ended without the least discord in any person in the company, although it was made up of different nations and complexions.</p>
            <p>The rainy season came on here about the latter end of May, which continued till August very heavily; so that the rivers were overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and our provisions then in the ground were washed away. I thought this was in some measure a judgment upon us for working on sundays, and it hurt my mind very much. I often wished to leave this place and sail for Europe; for our mode of procedure and living in this heathenish form was very irksome to me. The word of God saith, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'What does it avail a man if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?'</q> This was much and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily impressed on my mind; and though
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0324600502:202"/>
I did not know how to speak to the Doctor for my discharge, it was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable for me to stay any longer. But about the middle of June I took courage enough to ask him for it. He was very unwilling at sirst to grant my request; but I gave him so many reasons for it, that at last he consented to my going, and gave me the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certificate of my behaviour:</p>

Though I was much attached to the Doctor, I was happy when he consented. I got every thing ready for my depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, and hired some Indians, with a large canoe, to carry me off. All my poor countrymen, the slaves, when they heard of my leaving them, were very sorry, as I had always treated them with care and affection, and did every thing I could to comfort the poor creatures, and render their condition easy. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken leave of my old friends and companions, on the 18th of June, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by the Doctor, I left that spot of the world, and went southward above twenty miles along the river. There I found a sloop, the captain of which told me he was going to Jamaica. Having agreed for my passage with him and one of the owners, who was also on board, named Hughes, the Doctor and I parted, not without shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0324600502:204"/>
tears on both sides. The vessel then sailed along the river till night, when she stopped in a lagoon within the same river. During the night a schooner belonging to the same owners came in, and, as she was in want of hands, Hughes, the owner of the sloop asked me to go in the schooner as a sailor, and said he would give me wages. I thanked him; but I said I wanted to go to Jamaica. He then immediately changed his tone, and swore, and abused me very much, and asked how I came to be freed. I told him, and said that I came into that vicinity with Dr. Irving; whom he had seen that day. This account was of no use; he still swore exceedingly at me, and cursed the mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a fool that sold me my freedom, and the doctor for another in letting me go from him. Then he desired me to go in the schooner, or else I should
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0324600502:205"/>
not go out of the sloop as a free-man. I said this was very hard, and begged to be put on shore again; but he swore that I should not. I said I had been twice amongst the Turks, yet had never seen any such usage with them, and much less could I have expected any thing of this kind among the Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians. This incensed him exceedingly; and, with a volley of oaths and impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, he replied, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'Christians! damn you, you are one of st. Paul's men; but by G—, except you have st. Paul's or st. Peter's faith, and walk upon the water to the shore, you shall not go out of the vessel;'</q> which I now learnt was going amongst the spaniards towards Carthagena, where he swore he would sell me. I simply asked him what right he had to sell me? but, without another word, he made some of his people tie ropes round each of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0324600502:206"/>
my ancles, and also to each wrist, and another rope round my body, and hoisted me up without letting my feet touch or rest upon any thing. Thus I hung, without any crime committed, and without judge or jury; merely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I was a free man, and could not by the law get any redress from a white person in those parts of the world. I was in great pain from my situation, and cried and begged very hard for some mercy; but all in vain. My tyrant, in a great rage brought a mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet out of the cabin and loaded it before me and the crew, and swore that he would shoot me if I cried any more. I had now no alternative; I therefore remained silent, seeing not one white man on board who said a word on my behalf. I hung in that manner from between ten and eleven o'clock at night till about one in the morning;
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0324600502:207"/>
when, finding my cruel abuser fast asleep, I begged some of his slaves to slack the rope that was round my body, that my feet might rest on something. This they did at the risk of being cruelly used by their master, who beat some of them severely at first for not tying me when he commanded them. Whilst I remained in this condition, till between five and six o'clock next morning, I trust I prayed to God to forgive this blasphemer, who cared not what he did, but when he got up out of his sleep in the morning was of the very fame temper and disposition as when he left me at night. When they got up the anchor, and the vessel was getting under way, I once more cried and begged to be released; and now, being fortunately in the way of their hoisting the sails, they released me. When I was let down, I spoke to one Mr. Cox,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0324600502:208"/>
a carpenter, whom I knew on board, on the impropriety of this conduct. He also knew the doctor, and the good opinion he ever had of me. This man then went to the captain, and told him not to carry me away in that manner? that I was the doctor's steward, who regarded me very highly, and would resent this usage when he should come to know it. On which he desired a young man to put me ashore in a small canoe I brought with me. This sound gladdened my heart, and I got hastily into the canoe and set off, whilst my tyrant was down in the cabin; but he soon spied me out, when I was not above thirty or forty yards from the vessel, and running upon the deck with a loaded musket in his hand, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented it at me, and swore heavily and dreadfully, that he would shoot me that instant, if I did not come back on
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0324600502:209"/>
board. As I knew the wretch would have done as he said, without hesitation, I put back to the vessel again; but, as the good Lord would have it, just as I was alongside he was abusing the captain for letting me go from the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel; which the captain returned, and both of them soon got into a very great heat. The young man that was with me now got out of the canoe; the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel was sailing on fast with a smooth sea: and I then thought it was neck or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, so at that instant I set off again, for my life, in the canoe, towards the shore; and fortunately the confusion was so great amongst them on board, that I got out of the reach of the mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket shot unnoticed, while the vessel sailed on with a fair wind a different way; so that they could not overtake me without tacking: but even before that could be done I should have been
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0324600502:210"/>
on shore, which I soon reached, with many thanks to God for this unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected deliverance. I then went and told the other owner, who lived near that shore (with whom I had agreed for my passage) of the usage I had met with. He was very much astonished and appeared very sorry for it. After treating me with kindness, he gave me some refreshment, and three heads of roasted Indian corn, for a voyage of about eighteen miles south, to look for another vessel. He then directed me to an Indian chief of a district, who was also the Musquito admiral, and had once been at our dwelling; after which I set off with the canoe across a large lagoon alone (for I could not get any one to assist me), though I was much jaded, and had pains in my bowels, by means of the rope I had hung by the night before. I was therefore at differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0324600502:211"/>
times unable to manage the canoe, for the paddling was very laborious. However, a little before dark I got to my destined place, where some of the Indians knew me, and received me kindly. I asked for the admiral; and they conducted me to his dwelling. He was glad to see me, and refreshed me with such things as the place afforded; and I had a hammock to fleep in. They acted towards me more like Christians than those whites I was amongst the last night, though they had been baptised. I told the admiral I wanted to go to the next port to get a vessel to carry me to Jamaica; and requested him to send the canoe back which I then had, for which I was to pay him. He agreed with me, and sent five able Indians with a large canoe to carry my things to my intended place, about fifty miles; and we set off
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0324600502:212"/>
the next morning. When we got out of the lagoon and went along shore, the sea was so high that the canoe was oftentimes very near being filled with water. We were obliged to go ashore and drag across different necks of land; we were also two nights in the swamps, which swarmed with musquito flies, and they proved troublesome to us. This tiresome journey of land and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ended, however, on the third day, to my great joy; and I got on board of a sloop commanded by one Captain Jenning. she was then partly loaded, and he told me he was expecting daily to sail for Jamaica; and having agreed with me to work my passage, I went to work accordingly. I was not many days on board before we sailed; but to my sorrow and disappointment, though used to such tricks, we went to the southward along the Musquito shore,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0324600502:213"/>
instead of steering for Jamaica. I was compelled to assist in cutting a great deal of mahogany wood on the shore as we coasted along it, and load the vessel with it, before she sailed. This fretted me much; but, as I did not know how to help myself among these deceivers, I thought patience was the only remedy I had left, and even that was forced. There was much hard work and little victuals on board, except by good luck we happened to catch turtles. On this coast there was also a particular kind of fish called manatee, which is most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent eating, and the flesh is more like beef than fish; the scales are as large as a shilling, and the skin thicker than I ever saw that of any other fish. Within the brackish waters along shore there were likewise vast numbers of alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators, which made the fish scarce. I was on board this sloop sixteen days,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0324600502:214"/>
during which, in our coasting, we came to another place, where there was a smaller sloop called the Indian Queen, commanded by one John Baker. He also was an Englishman, and had been a long time along the shore trading for turtle shells and silver, and had got a good quantity of each on board. He wanted some hands very much; and, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding I was a freeman, and wanted to go to Jamaica, he told me if he could get one or two, that he would sail im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately for that Island: he also pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to shew me some marks of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and respect, and promised to give me forty-five shillings sterling a a month if I would go with him. I thought this much better than cutting wood for nothing. I therefore told the other captain that I wanted to go to Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica in the other vessel; but he would not listen to me; and, seeing me resolved
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0324600502:215"/>
to go in a day or two, he got the vessel to sail, intending to carry me away against my will. This treatment mortified me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrstroke">̄</g> extremely. I immediately, according to an agreement I had made with the captain of the Indian Queen, called for her boat, which was lying near us, and it came alongside; and, by the means of a north-pole shipmate which I met with in the sloop I was in, I got my things into the boat, and went on board of the Indian Queen, July the 10th. A few days after I was there, we got all things ready and sailed: but again, to my great mortification, this vessel still went to the south, nearly as far as Carthagena, trading along the coast, instead of going to Jamaica, as the captain had promised me: and, what was worst of all, he was a very cruel and bloody-minded man, and was a horrid blasphemer. Among others,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0324600502:216"/>
he had a white pilot, one stoker, whom he beat often as severely as he did some negroes he had on board. One night in particular, after he had beaten this man most cruelly, he put him into the boat, and made two negroes row him to a desolate key, or small island; and he loaded two pistols, and swore bitterly that he would shoot the negroes if they brought stoker on board again. There was not the least doubt but that he would do as he said, and the two poor fellows were obliged to obey the cruel mandate; but, when the captain was asleep, the two negroes took a blanket and carried it to the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate stoker, which I believe was the means of saving his life from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance of insects. A great deal of entreaty was used with the captain the next day, before he would consent to let stoker come on board; and when
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0324600502:217"/>
the poor man was brought on board he was very ill, from his situation during the night, and he remained so till he was drowned a little time after. As we sailed southward we came to many uninhabited islands, which were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown with fine large cocoa nuts. As I was very much in want of provisions, I brought a boat load of them on board, which lasted me and others for several weeks, and afforded us many a delicious repast in our scarcity. One day, before this, I could not help ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the providential hand of God, that ever supplied all our wants, though in the ways and manner we know not. I had been a whole day without food, and made signals for boats to come off, but in vain. I therefore earnestly prayed to God for relief in my need; and at the close of the evening I went off the deck. Just as I laid down I heard a
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0324600502:218"/>
noise on the deck; and, not knowing what it meant, I went directly on the deck again, when what should I see but a fine large fish about seven or eight pounds, which had jumped aboard! I took it, and admired, with thanks, the good hand of God; and, what I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as not less extraordinary, the captain, who was very avaricious, did not attempt to take it from me, there being only him and I on board; for the rest were all gone ashore trading. sometimes the people did not come off for some days: this used to fret the captain, and then he would vent his fury on me by beating me, or making me feel in other cruel ways. One day especially, in his wild, wicked, and mad career, after striking me several times with different things, and once across my mouth, even with a red burning stick out of the fire, he got a barrel of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0324600502:219"/>
gunpowder on the deck, and swore that he would blow up the vessel. I was then at my wit's end, and earnestly prayed to God to direct me. The head was out of the barrel; and the captain took a lighted stick out of the fire to blow himself and me up, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there was a vessel then in sight coming in, which he supposed was a spaniard, and he was afraid of falling into their hands. seeing this I got an axe, unnoticed by him, and placed myself between him and the powder, having resolved in myself as soon as he attempted to put the fire in the barrel to chop him down that instant. I was more than an hour in this situation; during which he struck me often, still keeping the fire in his hand for this wicked purpose. I really should have thought myself justifiable in any other part of the world if I had killed him,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0324600502:220"/>
and prayed to God, who gave me a mind which rested solely on himself. I prayed for resignation, that his will might be done: and the following two portions of his holy word, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to my mind, buoyed up my hope, and kept me from taking the life of this wicked man. <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'He hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the times before appointed, and set bounds to our habitations,'</q> Acts xvii. 26. And, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'Who is there among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God,'</q> Isaiah l. 20. And thus by the grace of God I was enabled to do. I found him a present help in the time of need, and the captain's fury began to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side as the night approached: but I found,<q>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:0324600502:221"/>
                  <l>" That he who cannot stem his anger's tide</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The next morning we discovered that the vessel which had caused such a fury in the captain was an English sloop. They soon came to an anchor where we were, and, to my no small surprise, learned that Doctor Irving was on board of her on his way from the Musquito shore to Jamaica. I was for going immediately to see this old master and friend, but the captain would not suffe me to leave the vessel. I then informe the Doctor, by letter, how I was treated and begged that he would take me out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

on the Musquito shore, during which the slaves were well fed and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, a white overseer had supplied my place: this man through inhumanity and ill-judged avarice, beat and cut the poor slaves most unmercifully; and the consequence was, that every one got into a large Puriogua canoe, and endeavoured to escape; but not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where to go, or how to manage the canoe, they were all drowned; in consequence of which the Doctor's plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was left uncultivated, and he was now returning to Jamaica to purchase more slaves, and stock it again.</p>
            <p>On the 14th of October, the Indian Queen arrived at Kingston in Jamaica. When we were unloaded I demanded my wages, which amounted to eight pounds five shillings sterling; but Captain Baker refused to give me one farthing, although it was the hardest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>earned
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0324600502:223"/>
money I ever worked for in my life. I found out Doctor Irving upon this, and acquainted him of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's knavery. He did all he could to help me to get my money; and we went to every magistrate in Kingston (and there were nine) but they all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to do any thing for me, and said my oath could not be admitted against a white man. Nor was this all; for Baker threatened that he would beat me severely if he could catch me for attempting to demand my money; and this he would have done, but that I got, by means of Doctor Irving, under the protection of Captain Douglas, of the squirrel man of war. I thought this exceeding hard usage; though indeed I found it to be too much the practice there to pay free negro men for their labour in this manner.</p>
            <p>One day I went with a free negroe taylor, named Joe Diamond, to one
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0324600502:224"/>
Mr. Cochran, who was indebted to him some trifling sum; and the man, not being able to get his money, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to murmur. The other immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately took a horse-whip to pay him with it, but, by the help of a good pair of heels, the taylor got off. such oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions as these made me seek for a vessel to get off the island as fast as I could: and by the mercy of God, I found a ship in November bound for England, when I embarked with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy, after having taken a last farewell of Doctor Irving. When I left Jamaica he was employed in refining sugars; and some months after my arrival in England I learned, with much sorrow, that this my amiable friend was dead, owing to his having eaten some poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned fish.</p>
            <p>We had many very heavy gales of wind in our passage; in the course of
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0324600502:225"/>
which no material incident occurred, except that an American privateer, falling in with the fleet, was captured and set sire to by his Majesty's ship the squirrel.</p>
            <p>On January the seventh, 1777, we arrived at Plymouth. I was happy once more to tread upon English ground; and, after passing some little time at Plymouth and Exeter, among some pious friends, whom I was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py to see, I went to London with a heart replete with thanks to God for past mercies.</p>

            <p>sUCH were the various fares which I was a witness to, and the fortune I experienced until the year 1777. Since that period, my life has been more uniform, and the incidents of it fewer, than in any other equal number of years preceding; I therefore hasten to the conclusion of a narrative, which I
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0324600502:227"/>
fear the reader may think already sufficiently tedious.</p>
            <p>I had suffered so many impositions in my commercial transactions in different parts of the world, that I became heartily disgusted with the seafaring life, and was determined not to return to it, at least for some time. I therefore once more engaged in service shortly after my return, and continued for the most part in this situation until 1784.</p>
            <p>Soon after my arrival in London, I saw a remarkable circumstance relative to African complexion, which I thought so extraordinary, that I beg leave just to mention it: A white negro woman, that I had formerly seen in London and other parts, had married a white man, by whom she had three boys, and they were every one mullattoes, and yet they had fine light hair. In 1779,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0324600502:228"/>
I served Governor Macnamara, who had been a considerable time on the coast of Africa. In the time of my service, I used to ask frequently other servants to join me in family prayer; but this only excited their mockery. However, the Governor, understanding that I was of a religious turn, wished to know what religion I was of; I told him I was a Protestant of the Church of England, agreeable to the thirty nine articles of that church; and that whomsoever I found to preach according to that doctrine, those I would hear. A few days after this, we had some more discourse on the same subject; when he said he would, if I chose, as he thought I might be of service in converting my countrymen to the Gospel faith, get me sent out as missionary to Africa. I at first refused going, and told him how I had been served on a like occasion
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0324600502:229"/>
by some white people the last voyage I went to Jamaica, when I attempted (if it were the will of God) to be the means of converting the Indian prince; and said I supposed they would serve me worse than Alexander the coppersmith did St. Paul, if I should attempt to go amongst them in Africa. He told me not to fear, for he would apply to the Bishop of London to get me ordained. On these terms I consented to the Governor's proposal to go to Africa in hope of doing good, if possible, amongst my countrymen; so, in order to have me sent out properly, we immediately wrote the following letters to the late Bishop of London:</p>

                  <p>That your memorialist is desirous of returning to Africa as a missionary, if encouraged by your Lordship, in hopes of being able to prevail upon his countrymen to become Christians; and your memorialist is the more induced to undertake the same, from the success that has attended the like undertakings when encouraged by the Portugeuse

through their different settlements on the coast of Africa, and also by the Dutch: both governments encouraging the blacks, who, by their education are qualified to undertake the same, and are found more proper than European clergymen, unacquainted with the language and customs of the country.</p>
                  <p>Your memorialist's only motive for soliciting the office of a missionary is, that he may be a means, under God, of reforming his countrymen and persuading them to embrace the Christian religion.

With these letters, I waited on the Bishop by the Governor's desire, and presented them to his Lordship. He received me with much condescension and politeness; but, from some certain scruples of delicacy, and saying the Bishops were not of opinion of sending a new missionary to Africa, he declined to ordain me.</p>
            <p>My sole motive for thus dwelling on this transaction, or inserting these papers, is the opinion which gentlemen of sense and education, who are acquainted with Africa, entertain of the probability of converting the inhabitants of it to the faith of Jesus Christ, if the attempt were countenanced by the legislature.</p>
            <p>shortly after this I left the Governor, and served a nobleman in the Dorsetshire militia, whith whom I was encamped at Coxheath for some time;
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0324600502:235"/>
but the operations there were too minute and uninteresting to make a detail of.</p>
            <p>In the year 1783, I visited eight counties in Wales, from motives of curiosity. While I was in that part of the country I was led to go down into a coal-pit in shropshire, but my curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity nearly cost me my life; for while I was in the pit the coals fell in, and buried one poor man, who was not far from me: upon this I got out as fast as I could, thinking the furface of the earth the safest part of it.</p>
            <p>In the spring of 1784, I thought of visiting old ocean again. In consequence of this I embarked as steward on board a fine new ship called the London, commanded by Martin Hopkin, and sailed for New-York. I admired this city very much; it is large and well-built, and abounds with provisions
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0324600502:236"/>
of all kinds. While we lay here a circumstance happened which I thought extremely singular:—One day a malefactor was to be executed on a gallows; but with a condition that if any woman, having nothing on but her shift, married the man under the gallows, his life was to be saved. This extraordinary privilege was claimed; a woman presented herself; and the marriage ceremony was performed.</p>
            <p>Our ship having got laden were turned to London in January 1785. When she was ready again for another voyage, the captain being an agreeable man, I sailed with him from hence in the spring, March 1785, for Philadelphia. On the 5th of April, we took our departure from the land's-end, with a pleasant gale; and about nine o'clock that night the moon shone bright, and the sea was smooth, while our ship
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0324600502:237"/>
was going free by the wind, at the rate of about four or five miles an hour.—At this time another ship was going nearly as fast as we on the opposite point, meeting us right in the teeth, yet none on board observed either ship until we struck each other forcibly head and head, to the astonishment and consternation of both crews. she did us much damage, but I believe we did her more; for when we passed by each other, which we did very quickly, they called to us to bring to, and hoist out our boat, but we had enough to do to mind ourselves; and in about eight minutes we saw no more of her. We refitted as well as we could the next day, and proceeded on our voyage, and in May arrived at Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>I was very glad to see this favorite old town once more; and my pleasure was much increased in seeing the worthy
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0324600502:238"/>
Quakers freeing and easing the burthens of many of my oppressed African brethren. It rejoiced my heart when one of these friendly people took me to see a free-school they had erected for every denomination of black people, whose minds are cultivated here, and forwarded to virtue; and thus they are made useful members of the community. Does not the success of this practice say loudly to the planters, in the language of scripture—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Go ye and do likewise!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>In October 1585, I was accompanied by some of the Africans, and presented this address of thanks to the gentlemen called Friends or Quakers, in Gracechurch-Court, Lombard-street:</p>

her Colonies, concerning the Calamitous state of the enslaved Negroes: We part of the poor, oppressed, needy, and much degraded negroes, desire to approach you with this address of thanks, with our inmost love and warmest ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment; and with the deepest sense of your benevolence, unwearied labour, and kind interposition, towards breaking the yoke of slavery, and to administer a little comfort and ease to thousands and tens of thousands of very grievously afflicted, and too heavy burthened negroes.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, could you, by perseverance, at last be enabled under God, to lighten in any degree the heavy burthen of the afflicted, no doubt it would in some measure, be the possible means, under God, of saving the souls of many of the oppressors; and if so, sure we are that the God, whose eyes are ever upon
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0324600502:240"/>
all his creatures, and always rewards every true act of virtue, and regards the prayers of the oppressed, will give to you and yours those blessings which it is not in our power to express or conceive, but which we as a part of those captivated, oppressed, and afflicted people, most earnestly wish and pray for.</p>
            <p>These gentlemen received us very kindly, with a promise to exert themselves on behalf of the oppressed Africans, and we parted.</p>
            <p>While in town, I chanced once to be invited to a Quaker's wedding. The simple and yet expressive mode used at their solemnizations is worthy of note. The following is the true form of it:</p>
            <p>After the company have met, they have seasonable exhortations by several of the members; the bride and bridegroom stand up, and, taking each other
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0324600502:241"/>
by the hand in a solemn manner,the man declares to this purpose:</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Friends, in the fear of the Lord, and in the presence of this assembly, whom I desire to be my witnesses, I take this my friend, M. N. to be my wife; promising, through divine assistance, to be unto her a loving and faithful husband till death separate us:"</q> and the woman makes the like declaration. Then the two first sign their names to the record, and as many more witnesses as have a mind. I had the honour to subscribe mine to a register in Gracechurch-Court, Lombard-street.—My hand is ever free—if any female Debonair wishes to obtain it, this mode I recommend.</p>
            <p>We returned to London in August; and our ship not going immediately to sea, I shipped as a steward in an American ship called the Harmony, Captain
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0324600502:242"/>
John Willet, and left London in March 1786, bound to Philadelphia. Eleven days after sailing, we carried our foremast away. We had a nine weeks passage, which caused our trip not to succeed well, the market for our goods proving bad; and to make it worse, my commander began to play me the like tricks as others too often practise on free negroes in the West Indies. But I thank God I found many friends here, who in some measure prevented him. On my return to London in August, I was very agreeably surprised to find that the benevolence of government had adopted the plan of some philanthropic individuals to send the Africans from hence to their native quarter; and that some vessels were then engaged to carry them to sierra Leona; an act which redounded to the honour of all concerned in its promotion,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0324600502:243"/>
and filled me with prayers and much rejoicing. There was then in the city, a select committee of gentlemen for the black poor, to some of whom I had the honour of being known; and, as soon as they heard of my arrival, they sent for me to the committee. When I came there, they informed me of the intention of government; and as they seemed to think me qualified to super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intend part of the undertaking, they asked me to go with the black poor to Africa. I pointed out to them many objections to my going; and particularly I expressed some difficulties on the account of the slave dealers, as I would certainly oppose their traffic in the human species by every means in my power. However these objections were over-ruled by the gentlemen of the committee, who prevailed on me to consent to go; and recommended me to the honourable
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0324600502:244"/>
Commissioners of his Majesty's Navy, as a proper person to act as commissary for government in the intended expedition; and they accordingly appointed me in November 1786, to that office, and gave me sufficient power to act for the government in the capacity of commissary, having received my warrant and the following order.</p>

            <p>I proceeded immediately to the executing of my duty on board the vessels destined for the voyage, where I continued till the March following.</p>
            <p>During my continuanee in the employment of government, I was struck with the flagrant abuses committed by the agent, and endeavoured to remedy
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0324600502:247"/>
them, but without effect. One instance, among many which I could produce, may serve as a specimen. Government had ordered to be provided all necessaries (slops, as they are called, included) for 750 persons; however, not being able to muster more than 426, I was ordered to send the superfluous slops, &amp;c. to the king's stores at Portsmouth; but, when I demanded them for that purpose from the agent, it appeared they had never been bought, though paid for by government. But that was not all, government were not the only objects of peculation; these poor people suffered infinitely more; their accommodations, were most wretched; many of them wanted beds, and many more cloathing and other necessaries. For the truth of this, and much more, I do not seek credit from my own assertion. I appeal to the testimony of Capt.
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0324600502:248"/>
Thompson, of the Nautilus, who convoyed us, to whom I applied in February 1787, for a remedy, when I had remonstrated to the agent in vain, and even brought him to be a witness of the injustice and oppression I complained of. I appeal also to a letter written by these wretched people, so early as the beginning of the preceding January, and published in the Morning Herald, on the 4th of that month, signed by twenty of their chiefs.</p>
            <p>I could not silently suffer govern>ment to be thus cheated, and my countrymen plundered and oppressed, and even lest destitude of the necessaries for almost their existence. I therefore informed the Commissioners of the Navy of the agent's proceeding; but my dismission was soon after procured, by means of a gentleman in the city, whom the agent, conscious of his peculation,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0324600502:249"/>
had deceived by letter, and who, moreover, empowered the same agent to receive on board, at the government expence, a number of persons as pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers, contrary to the orders I receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. By this I suffered a considerable loss in my property: however, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners were satisfied with my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and wrote to Capt. Thompson, expressing their opprobation of it.</p>
            <p>Thus provided, they proceeded on their voyage; and at last, worn out by treatment, perhaps not the most mild, and wasted by sickness, brought on by want of medicine, cloaths, bedding, &amp;c. they reached sirrea Leona just at at the commencement of the rains. At that season of the year it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to cultivate the lands; their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions therefore were exhausted before they could derive any benefit from agriculture; and it is not surprising
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0324600502:250"/>
that many, especially the lascars, whose constitutions are very tender, and who had been cooped up in ships from October to June, and accommodated in the manner I have mentioned, should be so wasted by their confinement as not long to survive it.</p>
            <p>Thus ended my part of the long-talked of expedition to sierra Leona; an expedition which, however unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate in the event, was humane and politic in its design, nor was its failure owing to government: every thing was done on their part; but there was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently sufficient mismanagement at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the conduct and execution of it to defeat its success.</p>
            <p>I should not have been so ample in my account of this transaction, had not the share I bore in it been made the subject of partial animadversion, and even my dismission from my employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0324600502:251"/>
thought worthy of being made by some a matter of public triumph<note n="*" place="bottom">see the Public Advertiser, July 14, 1787.</note>. The motives which might influence any person to descend to a petty contest with an obscure African, and to seek gratification by his depression, perhaps it is not proper here to inquire into or relate, even if its detection were neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to my vindication; but I thank Heaven it is not. I wish to stand by my own integrity, and not to shelter myself under the impropriety of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and I trust the behaviour of the Commissioners of the Navy to me en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title me to make this assertion; for after I had been dismissed, March 24, I drew up a memorial thus:</p>

of dismission from the Honourable Commissioners of the Navy, by your Lordships orders;</p>
                        <p>That, conscious of having acted with the most perfect fidelity and the greatest assiduity in discharging the trust reposed in him, he is altogether at a loss to conceive the reasons of your Lordships having altered the favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able opinion you were pleased to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of him, sensible that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships would not proceed to so severe a measure without some apparent good cause; he therefore has every reason to believe that his conduct has been grossly misrepresented to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, and he is the more confirmed in his opinion, because, by opposing mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of others concerned in the same expedition, which tended to defeat your Lordships humane intentions, and to put the government to a very consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

additional expence, he created a number of enemies, whose misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations, he has too much reason to believe, laid the foundation of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission. Unsupported by friends; and unaided by the advantages of a liberal education, he can only hope for redress from the justice of his cause, in addition to the mortification of having been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from his employment, and the advantage which he reasonably might have expected to have derived there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from. He has had the misfortune to have sunk a considerable part of his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle property in fitting himself out, and in other expences arising out of his situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, an account of which he here annexes. Your memorialist will not trouble your Lordships with a vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of any part of his conduct, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he knows not of what crimes he is accused; he, however, earnestly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats

that you will be pleased to direct an inquiry into his behaviour during the time he acted in the public service; and, if it be found that his dismission arose from salse representations, he is confident that in your Lordships jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice he shall find redress.</p>
                        <p>Your petitioner therefore humbly prays that your Lordships will take his case into consideration, and that you will be pleased to order payment of the above referred-to account, amounting to 32l. 4s. and also the wages intended, which is most humbly submitted.</p>

It is upon these grounds that I hope and expect the attention of gentlemen in power. These are designs consonant to the elevation of their rank, and the dignity of their stations: they are ends suitable to the nature of a free and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous government; and, connected with views of empire and dominion,

            <p>As the inhuman traffic of slavery is to be taken into the consideration of the British legislature, I doubt not, if a system of commerce was established in Africa, the demand for manufactures will most rapidly augment, as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive inhabitants will insensibly adopt the British fashions, manners, customs, &amp;c.

               </gap>inite. The supposition is most obvious. It will be equally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense in Africa—The same cause, viz. civilization, will ever have the same effect.</p>
            <p>It is trading upon safe grounds. A commercial intercourse with Africa opens an inexhaustible source of wealth to the manufacturing interests of Great Britain, and to all which the slave trade is an objection.</p>
            <p>If I am not misinformed, the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturing interest is equal, if not supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, to the landed interest, as to the value, for reasons which will soon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. The abolition of slavery, so diabolical, will give a most rapid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension of manufactures, which is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally and diametrically opposite to what some interested people assert.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:0324600502:265"/>
The manufactures of this country must and will, in the nature and reason of things, have a full and constant em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy by supplying the African mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets.</p>
            <p>Population, the bowels and surface of Africa, abound in valuable and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful returns; the hidden treasures of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies will be brought to light and into circulation. Industry, enterprize, and mining, will have their full scope, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably as they civilize. In a word, it lays open an endless field of commerce to the British manufactures and merchant adventurer. The manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturing interest and the general inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests are synonymous. The abolition of slavery would be in reality an universal good.</p>
            <p>Tortures, murder, and every other imaginable barbarity and iniquity, are practised upon the poor slaves with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity.

I hope the slave trade will be abolished. I pray it may be an event at hand. The great body of manusac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers, uniting in the cause, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderably facilitate and expedite it; and, as I have already stated, it is most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially their interest and advantage, and as such the nation's at large, (except those persons concerned in the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturing neck-yokes, collars, chains, hand-cuffs, leg-bolts, drags, thumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>screws, iron muzzles, and coffins; cats, scourges, and other instruments of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture used in the slave trade). In a short time one sentiment alone will prevail, from motives of interest as well as jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and humanity. Europe contains one hundred and twenty millions of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. Query—How many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions doth Africa contain? supposing the Africans, collectively and indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually, to expend 5l. a head in raiment
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0324600502:267"/>
and furniture yearly when civilized, &amp;c. an immensity beyond the reach of imagination!</p>
            <p>This I conceive to be a theory founded upon facts, and therefore an infallible one. If the blacks were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to remain in their own country, they would double themselves every fifteen years. In proportion to such increase will be the demand for manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures. Cotton and indigo grow spontaneously in most parts of Africa; a consideration this of no small con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence to the manufacturing towns of Great Britain. It opens a most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense, glorious, and happy prospect—the clothing, &amp;c. of a continent ten thousand miles in circumference, and immensely rich in productions of every denomination in return for manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>

I have only therefore to request the reader's indulgence and conclude. I am far from the vanity of thinking there is any merit in this narrative: I hope censure will be suspended, when it is considered that it was written by one who was as unwilling as unable to adorn the plainness of truth by the colouring of imagination. My life and fortune have been extremely chequered, and my adventures various. Even those I have related are considerably abridged. If any incident in this little work should appear uninteresting and trifling to most readers, I can only say, as my excuse for mentioning it, that almost every event of my life made an impression on my mind, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced my conduct. I early accus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed myself to look for the hand of God in the minutest occurrence, and to learn from it a lesson of morality
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0324600502:269"/>
and religion; and in this light, every circumstance I have related was to me of importance. After all, what makes any event important, unless by its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation we become better and wiser, and learn <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly before God?'</q> To those who are possessed of this spirit, there is scarcely any book or incident so trifling that does not afford some profit, while to others the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ages seems of no use; and even to pour out to them the treasures of wisdom is throwing the jewels of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction away.</p>
