            <p>PERMIT me, with the greatest deference and respect, to lay at your feet the following genuine Narrative; the chief design of which is to excite in your august assemblies a sense of compassion for the miseries which the Slave-Trade has entailed on my unfortunate countrymen. By the horrors of that trade was I first torn away from all the tender connex ons that were naturally dear to my heart; but these,
               <pb n="IV" facs="pageImages/Equiano-vol1-pIV.jpg"/>
               through the mysterious ways of Providence, I ought to regard as infinitely more than compensated by the introduction I have thence obtained to the knowledge of the Christian religion, and of a nation which, by its liberal sentiments, its humanity, the glorious freedom of its government, and its proficiency in arts and sciences, has exalted the dignity of human nature.</p> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>
            <p>I am sensible I ought to entreat your pardon for addressing to you a work so wholly devoid of literary merit; but, as the production of an unlettered African, who is actuated by the hope of becoming an instrument towards the relief of his suffering countrymen, I trust that <hi>such a man,</hi> pleading in <hi>such a</hi>

               <hi>cause,</hi> will be acquitted of boldness and presumption.</p> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>
            <p>May the God of heaven inspire your hearts with peculiar benevolence on that important day when the question of Abolition is to be discussed, when thousands, in consequence of your Determination, are to look for Happiness or Misery!</p> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>

            <head>A LIST OF <ref target="a001" corresp="n001">SUBSCRIBERS</ref><note xml:id="n001" target="a001">Equiano published the book by subscription, subsidizing the printing of the book by soliciting payment up front from people who would then receive their copy of the book (or copies; some people ordered multiple copies) when it was published. This was a shrewd move on Equiano's part, as it enabled him to retain copyright in his book, which meant that he received all of the profits, rather than, as was more typical in the period, receiving a lump sum in advance for his copyright. At the same time, the subscribers were able to associate themselves with the abolitionist cause; becoming a subscriber, and having your name published in this list, was like signing a petition in favor of ending the slave trade. The <hi>Interesting Narrative</hi> was a great success, going into nine editions in Equiano's lifetime. With each edition, the list of subscribers grew; the first edition had 321 subscribers, which grew to 804 in the ninth edition, published in 1794. Here we print the list of subscribers for the second edition, published in 1789.</note>.</head>

            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>The author's account of his country, and their manners and customs, Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Justiceâ€”EmbrenchÃ©â€”Marriage ceremony, and public entertainmentsâ€”Mode of livingâ€”Dressâ€”Manufactures Buildingsâ€”Commerceâ€”Agricultureâ€”War and religionâ€”superstition of the nativesâ€”Funeral ceremonies of the priests or magiciansâ€”Curious mode of discovering poisonâ€”some hints concerning the origin of the author's countrymen, with the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of different writers on that subject.</hi>

            </argument>
            <p>I BELIEVE it is difficult for those who publish their own memoirs to escape the imputation of vanity; nor is this
               <pb n="2" facs="pageImages/Equiano-vol1-p2.jpg"/>
the only disadvantage under which they labour: it is also their misfortune, that what is uncommon is rarely, if ever, believed, and what is obvious we are apt to turn from with disgust, and to charge the writer with impertinence. People generally think those memoirs only worthy to be read or remembered which abound in great or striking events; those, in short, which in a high degree excite either admiration or pity: all others they consign to contempt and oblivion. It is therefore, I confess, not a little hazardous in a private and obscure individual, and a stranger too, thus to solicit the indulgent attention of the public; especially when I own I offer here the history of neither a saint, a hero, nor a tyrant. I believe there are a few events in my life, which have not happened to many: it is true the incidents of it are numerous; and, did I consider myself an European,
               <pb n="3" facs="pageImages/Equiano-vol1-p3.jpg"/>
I might say my sufferings were great: but when I compare my lot with that of most of my countrymen, I regard myself as a <hi>particular favourite of Heaven,</hi> and acknowledge the mereies of Providence in every occurrence of my life. If then the following narrative does not appear sufficiently interesting to engage general attention, let my motive be some excuse for its publication. I am not so foolishly vain as to expect from it either immortality or literary reputation. If it affords any satisfaction to my numerous friends, at whose request it has been written, or in the smallest degree promotes the interests of humanity, the ends for which it was undertaken will be fully attained, and every wish of my heart gratified. Let it therefore be remembered, that, in wishing to avoid censure, I do not aspire to praise.</p> <lb/> <lb/>

               That part of Africa, known by the name of Guinea, to which the trade for slaves is carried on, extends along the coast above 3400 miles, from Senegal to Angola, and includes a variety of kingdoms. Of these the most considerable is the kingdom of <ref target="a0001" corresp="n0001">Benin</ref><note xml:id="n0001" target="a0001">A prime area for the slave trade during this time due to its economic and military prowess. The upper hand in warfare was an important factor in the African slave trade because of the tradition in which African tribes would enslave other Africans after battles, viewing them as spoils of war.</note>, both as to extent and wealth, the richness and cultivation of the soil, the power of its king, and the number and warlike disposition of the inhabitants. It is situated nearly under the line, and extends along the coast about 170 miles, but runs back into the intertior part of Africa to a distance hitherto I believe unexplored by any traveller; and seems only terminated at length by the empire of Abyssinia, near 1500 miles from its beginning. This kingdom is divided into many provinces or districts: in one of the most remote and fertile of which,
               <pb n="5" facs="pageImages/Equiano-vol1-p5.jpg"/>
I was born, in the year 1745, situated in a charming fruitful vale, named Essaka. The distance of this province from the capital of Benin and the sea coast must be very considerable; for I had never heard of white men or Europeans, nor of the sea; and our subjection to the king of Benin was little more than nominal; for every transaction of the government, as far as my slender observation extended, was conducted by the chiefs or elders of the place. The manners and government of a people who have little commerce with other countries are generally very simple; and the history of what passes in one family or village, may serve as a specimen of the whole nation. My father was one of those elders or chiefs I have spoken of, and was styled EmbrenchÃ©; a term, as I remember, importing the highest distinction, and
               <pb n="6" facs="pageImages/Equiano-vol1-p6.jpg"/>
signifying in our language a <hi>mark</hi> of grandeur. This mark is conferred on the person entitled to it, by cutting the skin across at the top of the forehead, and drawing it down to the eye-brows; and while it is in this situation applying a warm hand, and rubbing it until it shrinks up into a thick <hi>weal</hi> across the lower part of the forehead. Most of the judges and senators were thus marked; my father had long borne it: I had seen it conferred on one of my brothers, and I also was <hi>destined</hi> to receive it by my parents. Those EmbrenchÃ© or chief men, decided disputes and punished crimes; for which purpose they always assembled together. The proceedings were generally short; and in most cases the law of retaliation prevailed. I remember a man was brought before my father, and the other judges, for kidnapping a boy;
               <pb n="7" facs="pageImages/Equiano-vol1-p7.jpg"/>
and, although he was the son of a chief or senator, he was condemned to make recompense by a man or woman slave. Adultery, however, was sometimes punished with slavery or death; a punishment which I believe is inflicted on it throughout most of the nations of Africa<note n="*" place="bottom">see Benezet's "Account of Guinea" throughout.</note>: so sacred among them is the honour of the marriage bed, and so jealous are they of the fidelity of their wives. Of this I recollect an instanceâ€”a woman was convicted before the judges of adultery, and delivered over, as the custom was, to her husband to be punished. Accordingly he determined to put her to death: but it being found, just before her execution, that she had an infant at her breast; and no woman being prevailed on to perform the part of a nurse, she was spared on
               <pb n="8" facs="pageImages/Equiano-vol1-p8.jpg"/>
account of the child. The men, however, do not preserve the same constancy to their wives, which they expect from them; for they indulge in a plurality, though seldom in more than two. Their mode of marriage is thus:â€”both parties are usually betrothed when young by their parents, (though I have known the males to betroth themselves). On this occasion a feast is prepared, and the bride and bridegroom stand up in the midst of all their friends, who are assembled for the purpose, while he declares she is thenceforth to be looked upon as his wife, and that no other person is to pay any addresses to her. This is also immediately proclaimed in the vicinity, on which the bride retires from the assembly. some time after she is brought home to her husband, and then another feast is made, to which
               <pb n="9" facs="pageImages/Equiano-vol1-p9.jpg"/>
the relations of both parties are invited: her parents then deliver her to the bridegroom, accompanied with a number of blessings, and at the same time they tie round her waist a cotton string of the thickness of a goose-quill, which none but married women are permitted to wear: she is now considered as completely his wife; and at this time the dowry is given to the new married pair, which generally consists of portions of land, slaves, and cattle, household goods, and implements of husbandry. These are offered by the friends of both parties; besides which the parents of the bridegroom present gifts to those of the bride, whose property she is looked upon before marriage; but after it she is esteemed the sole property of her husband. The ceremony being now ended the festival begins, which is
               <pb n="10" facs="pageImages/Equiano-vol1-p10.jpg"/>
celebrated with bonefires, and loud acclamations of joy, accompanied with music and dancing.</p> <lb/> <lb/>
            <p>We are almost a nation of dancers, musicians, and poets. Thus every great event, such as a triumphant return from battle, or other cause of public rejoicing is celebrated in public dances which are accompanied with songs and music suited to the occasion. The assembly is seperated into four divisions, which dance either apart or in succession, and each with a character peculiar to itself. The first division contains the married men, who in their dances frequently exhibit feats of arms, and the representation of a battle. To these succeed the married women, who dance in the second division. The young men accupy the third: and the maidens the fourth. Each represents some interesting scene
               <pb n="11" facs="pageImages/Equiano-vol1-p11.jpg"/>
of real life, such as a great achievement, domestic employment, a pathetic story, or some rural sport; and as the subject is generally founded on some recent event, it is therefore ever new. This gives our dances a spirit and variety which I have scarcely seen elsewhere<note n="*" place="bottom">When I was in Smyrna I have frequently seen the Greeks dance after this manner.</note>. We have many musical instruments, particularly drums of different kinds, a piece of music which resembles a guitar, and another much like a stickado. These last are chiefly used by betrothed virgins, who play on them on all grand festivals.</p> <lb/> <lb/>
            <p>As our manners are simple, our luxuries are few. The dress of both sexes is nearly the same. It generally consists of a long piece of calico, or muslin, wrapped loosely round the body, somewhat in the form of a
               <pb n="12" facs="pageImages/Equiano-vol1-p12.jpg"/>
               highland plaid. This is usually dyed blue, which is our <ref target="a003" corresp="n003">favorite colour.</ref><note xml:id="n003" target="a003" >The best color to wear in Europe during this time was purple since the color was hard to extract and get a hold of. If one was to wear purple it was usually because they were royal.</note> It is extracted from a berry, and is brighter and richer than any I have seen in Europe. Besides this, our women of distinction wear golden ornaments, which they dispose with some profusion on their arms and legs. When our women are not employed with the men in tillage, their usual occupation is spinning and weaving cotton, which they afterwards dye, and make into garments. They also manufacture earthen vessels, of which we have many kinds. Among the rest tobacco pipes, made after the same fashion, and used in the same manner, as those in Turkey<note n="*" place="bottom">The bowl is earthen, curiously figured, to which a long reed is fixed as a tube. This tube is sometimes so long as to be borne by one, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently out of grandeur, by two boys.</note>.</p> <lb/> <lb/>
            <p>Our manner of living is entirely plain; for as yet the natives are unacquainted
               <pb n="13" facs="pageImages/Equiano-vol1-p13.jpg"/>
with those refinements in cookery which debauch the taste: bullocks, goats, and poultry, supply the greatest part of their food. These constitute likewise the principal wealth of the country, and the chief articles of its commerce. The flesh is usually stewed in a pan; to make it savoury we sometimes use also pepper, and other spices, and we have salt made of wood ashes. Our vegetables are mostly plantains, eadas, yams, beans, and Indian corn. The head of the family usually eats alone; his wives and slaves have also their separate tables. Before we taste food we always wash our hands: indeed our cleanliness on all occasions is extreme; but on this it is an indispensible ceremony. After washing, libation is made, by pouring out a small portion of the drink on the floor, and tossing a small quantity of the food
               <pb n="14" facs="pageImages/Equiano-vol1-p14.jpg"/>
in a certain place, for the spirits of departed relations, which the natives suppose to preside over their conduct, and guard them from evil. They are totally unacquainted with strong or spirituous liquors; and their principal beverage is palm wine. This is got from a tree of that name, by tapping it at the top, and fastening a large gourd to it; and sometimes one tree will yield three or four gallons in a night. When just drawn it is of a most delicious sweetness; but in a few days it acquires a tartish and more spirituous flavour: though I never saw any one intoxicated by it. The same tree also produces nuts and oil. Our principal luxury is in perfumes; one sort of these is an odoriferous wood of delicious fragrance: the other a kind of earth; a small portion of which thrown
               <pb n="15" facs="pageImages/Equiano-vol1-p15.jpg"/>
into the fire diffuses a most powerful odour<note n="*" place="bottom">When I was in smyrna I saw the same kind of earth, and brought some of it with me to England; it resembles musk in strength, but is more delicious in scent, and is not unlike the smell of a rose.</note>. We beat this wood into powder, and mix it with palm oil; with which both men and women perfume themselves.</p> <lb/> <lb/>
            <p>In our buildings we study convenience rather than ornament. Each master of a family has a large square piece of ground, surrounded with a moat or fence, or enclosed with a wall made of red earth tempered: which, when dry, is as hard as brick. Within this are his houses to accommodate his family and slaves; which, if numerous, frequently present the appearance of a village. In the middle stands the principal building, appropriated to the sole use of the master, and consisting
               <pb n="16" facs="pageImages/Equiano-vol1-p16.jpg"/>
               of two apartments; in one of which he sits in the day with his family, the other is left apart for the reception of his friends. He has besides these a distinct apartment in which he sleeps, <ref target="a004" corresp="n004">together with his male children</ref><note xml:id="n004" target="a004" >The Spartans, from ancient Greece, performed this same practice. The men stayed away from the women most of the time so they could focus on war and studying with their brothers. This practice helps the men stay sharp and not have either of the sexes be distracted by each other.</note> . On each side are the apartments of his wives, who have also their separate day and night houses. The habitations of the slaves and their families are distributed throughout the rest of the enclosure. These houses never exceed one story in height: they are always built of wood, or stakes driven into the ground, crossed with wattles, and neatly plastered within and without. The roof is thatched with reeds. Our dayhouses are left open at the sides; but those in which we sleep are always covered, and plastered in the inside, with a composition mixed with cow dung, to keep off the different insects,
               <pb n="17" facs="pageImages/Equiano-vol1-p17.jpg"/>
which annoy us during the night. The walls and floors also of these are generally covered with mats. Our beds consist of a platform, raised three or four feet from the ground, on which are laid skins, and different parts of a spungy tree called plantain. Our covering is calico or muslin, the same as our dress. The usual seats are a few logs of wood; but we have benches, which are generally perfumed, to accommodate strangers: these compose the greater part of our household furniture. Houses so constructed and furnished require but little skill to erect them. Every man is a sussicient architect for the purpose. The whole neighbourhood afford their unanimous assistance in building them, and in return receive, and expect no other recompense than a feast.</p> <lb/> <lb/>

               <pb n="18" facs="pageImages/Equiano-vol1-p18.jpg"/>
is prodigal of her favours, our wants are few and easily supplied; of course we have few manufactures. They consist for the most part of calicoes, earthen ware, ornaments, and instruments of war and husbandry. But these make no part of our commerce, the principal articles of which, as I have observed, are provisions. In such a state, money is of little use; however we have some small pieces of coin, if I may call them such. They are made something like an anchor; but I do not remember either their value or denomination. We have also markets, at which I have been frequently with my mother. These are sometimes visited by stout mahogany-coloured men from the south west of us: we call them <hi>Oye-Eboe,</hi> which term signifies red men living at a distance. They generally bring us fire-arms, gunpowder,

hats, beads, and dried fish. The last we esteemed a great rarity, as our waters were only brooks and springs. These articles they barter with us for odoriferous woods and earth, and our salt of wood ashes. They always carry slaves through our land; but the strictest account is exacted of their manner of procuring them before they are suffered to pass. Sometimes indeed we sold slaves to them, but they were only prisoners of war, or such among us as had been convicted of kidnapping, or adultery, and some other crimes, which we esteemed heinous. This practice of kidnapping induces me to think, that, notwithstanding all our strictness, their principal business among us was to trepan our people. I remember too they carried great sacks along with them, which not long after I had an

opportunity of fatally seeing applied to that infamous purpose.</p> <lb/> <lb/>
            <p>Our land is uncommonly rich and fruitful, and produces all kinds of vegetables in great abundance. We have plenty of Indian corn, and vast quantities of cotton and tobacco. Our pine apples grow without culture; they are about the size of the largest sugar-loaf, and finely flavoured. We have also spices of different kinds, particularly pepper; and a variety of delicious fruits which I have never seen in Europe; together with gums of various kinds, and honey in abundance. All our industry is exerted to improve those blessings of nature. Agriculture is our chief employment; and <ref target="a005" corresp="n005">every one,</ref> even the children and women, are engaged in it <note xml:id="n005" target="a005" >Interesting to note that they are living in an egalitarian culture when it comes to agriculture, the backbone to their existence.</note> . Thus we are all habituated to labour from our earliest years. Every one contributes something to the common
