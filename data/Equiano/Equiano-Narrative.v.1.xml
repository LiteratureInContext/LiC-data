            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as sGML (TCP schema; AsCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               through the mysterious ways of Providence, I ought to regard as infinitely more than compensated by the introduction I have thence obtained to the knowledge of the Christian religion, and of a nation which, by its liberal sentiments, its humanity, the glorious freedom of its government, and its profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in arts and sciences, has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted the dignity of human nature.</p>
            <p>I am sensible I ought to entreat your pardon for addressing to you a work so wholly devoid of literary merit; but, as the production of an unlettered African, who is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated by the hope of becoming an instrument towards the relief of his suffering countrymen, I trust that <hi>such a man,</hi> pleading in <hi>such a</hi>

            <p>May the God of heaven inspire your hearts with peculiar benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence on that important day when the question of Abolition is to be discussed, when thousands, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of your Determination, are to look for Happiness or Misery!</p>

            <p>I BELIEVE it is difficult for those who publish their own memoirs to escape the imputation of vanity; nor is this
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0324600501:25"/>
the only disadvantage under which they labour: it is also their misfortune, that what is uncommon is rarely, if ever, believed, and what is obvious we are apt to turn from with disgust, and to charge the writer with impertinence. People generally think those memoirs only worthy to be read or remembered which abound in great or striking events; those, in short, which in a high degree excite either admiration or pity: all others they consign to contempt and oblivion. It is therefore, I confess, not a little hazardous in a private and obscure individual, and a stranger too, thus to solicit the indulgent attention of the public; especially when I own I offer here the history of neither a saint, a hero, nor a tyrant. I believe there are a few events in my life, which have not happened to many: it is true the incidents of it are numerous; and, did I consider myself an European,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0324600501:26"/>
I might say my sufferings were great: but when I compare my lot with that of most of my countrymen, I regard myself as a <hi>particular favourite of Heaven,</hi> and acknowledge the mereies of Providence in every occurrence of my life. If then the following narrative does not appear sufficiently interesting to engage general attention, let my motive be some excuse for its publication. I am not so foolishly vain as to expect from it either immortality or literary reputation. If it affords any satisfaction to my numerous friends, at whose request it has been written, or in the smallest degree promotes the interests of humanity, the ends for which it was undertaken will be fully attained, and every wish of my heart gratified. Let it therefore be remembered, that, in wishing to avoid censure, I do not aspire to praise.</p>

               That part of Africa, known by the name of Guinea, to which the trade for slaves is carried on, extends along the coast above 3400 miles, from Senegal to Angola, and includes a variety of kingdoms. Of these the most considerable is the kingdom of <ref target="a001" corresp="n001">Benin</ref><note xml:id="n001" target="a001" type="gloss">This was the prime area for the slave trade during this time.  It is known that African tribes would enslave other Africans because they were the treasure from war.</note>, both as to extent and wealth, the richness and cultivation of the soil, the power of its king, and the number and warlike disposition of the inhabitants. It is situated nearly under the line, and extends along the coast about 170 miles, but runs back into the intertior part of Africa to a distance hitherto I believe unexplored by any traveller; and seems only terminated at length by the empire of Abyssinia, near 1500 miles from its beginning. This kingdom is divided into many provinces or districts: in one of the most remote and fertile of which,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0324600501:28"/>
I was born, in the year 1745, situated in a charming fruitful vale, named Essaka. The distance of this province from the capital of Benin and the sea coast must be very considerable; for I had never heard of white men or Europeans, nor of the sea; and our subjection to the king of Benin was little more than nominal; for every transaction of the government, as far as my slender observation extended, was conducted by the chiefs or elders of the place. The manners and government of a people who have little commerce with other countries are generally very simple; and the history of what passes in one family or village, may serve as a specimen of the whole nation. My father was one of those elders or chiefs I have spoken of, and was styled Embrenché; a term, as I remember, importing the highest distinction, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0324600501:29"/>
signifying in our language a <hi>mark</hi> of grandeur. This mark is conferred on the person entitled to it, by cutting the skin across at the top of the forehead, and drawing it down to the eye-brows; and while it is in this situation applying a warm hand, and rubbing it until it shrinks up into a thick <hi>weal</hi> across the lower part of the forehead. Most of the judges and senators were thus marked; my father had long borne it: I had seen it conferred on one of my brothers, and I also was <hi>destined</hi> to receive it by my parents. Those Embrenché or chief men, decided disputes and punished crimes; for which purpose they always assembled together. The proceedings were generally short; and in most cases the law of retaliation prevailed. I remember a man was brought before my father, and the other judges, for kidnapping a boy;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0324600501:30"/>
and, although he was the son of a chief or senator, he was condemned to make recompense by a man or woman slave. Adultery, however, was sometimes punished with slavery or death; a punishment which I believe is inflicted on it throughout most of the nations of Africa<note n="*" place="bottom">see Benezet's "Account of Guinea" throughout.</note>: so sacred among them is the honour of the marriage bed, and so jealous are they of the fidelity of their wives. Of this I recollect an instance—a woman was convicted before the judges of adultery, and delivered over, as the custom was, to her husband to be punished. Accordingly he determined to put her to death: but it being found, just before her execution, that she had an infant at her breast; and no woman being prevailed on to perform the part of a nurse, she was spared on
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0324600501:31"/>
account of the child. The men, however, do not preserve the same constancy to their wives, which they expect from them; for they indulge in a plurality, though seldom in more than two. Their mode of marriage is thus:—both parties are usually betrothed when young by their parents, (though I have known the males to betroth themselves). On this occasion a feast is prepared, and the bride and bridegroom stand up in the midst of all their friends, who are assembled for the purpose, while he declares she is thenceforth to be looked upon as his wife, and that no other person is to pay any addresses to her. This is also immediately proclaimed in the vicinity, on which the bride retires from the assembly. some time after she is brought home to her husband, and then another feast is made, to which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0324600501:32"/>
the relations of both parties are invited: her parents then deliver her to the bridegroom, accompanied with a number of blessings, and at the same time they tie round her waist a cotton string of the thickness of a goose-quill, which none but married women are permitted to wear: she is now considered as completely his wife; and at this time the dowry is given to the new married pair, which generally consists of portions of land, slaves, and cattle, household goods, and implements of husbandry. These are offered by the friends of both parties; besides which the parents of the bridegroom present gifts to those of the bride, whose property she is looked upon before marriage; but after it she is esteemed the sole property of her husband. The ceremony being now ended the festival begins, which is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0324600501:33"/>
celebrated with bonefires, and loud acclamations of joy, accompanied with music and dancing.</p>
            <p>We are almost a nation of <ref target="a002" corresp="n002">dancers, musicians, and poets</ref><note xml:id="n002" target="a002" type="gloss">Proves that African culture cannot be viewed as backwards or lacking.</note> . Thus every great event, such as a triumphant return from battle, or other cause of public rejoicing is celebrated in public dances which are accompanied with songs and music suited to the occasion. The assembly is seperated into four divisions, which dance either apart or in succession, and each with a character peculiar to itself. The first division contains the married men, who in their dances frequently exhibit feats of arms, and the representation of a battle. To these succeed the married women, who dance in the second division. The young men accupy the third: and the maidens the fourth. Each represents some interesting scene
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0324600501:34"/>
of real life, such as a great achievement, domestic employment, a pathetic story, or some rural sport; and as the subject is generally founded on some recent event, it is therefore ever new. This gives our dances a spirit and variety which I have scarcely seen elsewhere<note n="*" place="bottom">When I was in Smyrna I have frequently seen the Greeks dance after this manner.</note>. We have many musical instruments, particularly drums of different kinds, a piece of music which resembles a guitar, and another much like a stickado. These last are chiefly used by betrothed virgins, who play on them on all grand festivals.</p>
            <p>As our manners are simple, our luxuries are few. The dress of both sexes is nearly the same. It generally consists of a long piece of calico, or muslin, wrapped loosely round the body, somewhat in the form of a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0324600501:35"/>
               highland plaid. This is usually dyed blue, which is our <ref target="a003" corresp="n003">favorite colour.</ref><note xml:id="n003" target="a003" type="gloss">The best color to wear in Europe during this time was purple since the color was hard to extract and get a hold of. If one was to wear purple it was usually because they were royal.</note> It is extracted from a berry, and is brighter and richer than any I have seen in Europe. Besides this, our women of distinction wear golden ornaments, which they dispose with some profusion on their arms and legs. When our women are not employed with the men in tillage, their usual occupation is spinning and weaving cotton, which they afterwards dye, and make into garments. They also manufacture earthen vessels, of which we have many kinds. Among the rest tobacco pipes, made after the same fashion, and used in the same manner, as those in Turkey<note n="*" place="bottom">The bowl is earthen, curiously figured, to which a long reed is fixed as a tube. This tube is sometimes so long as to be borne by one, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently out of grandeur, by two boys.</note>.</p>
            <p>Our manner of living is entirely plain; for as yet the natives are unacquainted
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0324600501:36"/>
with those refinements in cookery which debauch the taste: bullocks, goats, and poultry, supply the greatest part of their food. These constitute likewise the principal wealth of the country, and the chief articles of its commerce. The flesh is usually stewed in a pan; to make it savoury we sometimes use also pepper, and other spices, and we have salt made of wood ashes. Our vegetables are mostly plantains, eadas, yams, beans, and Indian corn. The head of the family usually eats alone; his wives and slaves have also their separate tables. Before we taste food we always wash our hands: indeed our cleanliness on all occasions is extreme; but on this it is an indispensible ceremony. After washing, libation is made, by pouring out a small portion of the drink on the floor, and tossing a small quantity of the food
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0324600501:37"/>
in a certain place, for the spirits of departed relations, which the natives suppose to preside over their conduct, and guard them from evil. They are totally unacquainted with strong or spirituous liquors; and their principal beverage is palm wine. This is got from a tree of that name, by tapping it at the top, and fastening a large gourd to it; and sometimes one tree will yield three or four gallons in a night. When just drawn it is of a most delicious sweetness; but in a few days it acquires a tartish and more spirituous flavour: though I never saw any one intoxicated by it. The same tree also produces nuts and oil. Our principal luxury is in perfumes; one sort of these is an odoriferous wood of delicious fragrance: the other a kind of earth; a small portion of which thrown
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0324600501:38"/>
into the fire diffuses a most powerful odour<note n="*" place="bottom">When I was in smyrna I saw the same kind of earth, and brought some of it with me to England; it resembles musk in strength, but is more delicious in scent, and is not unlike the smell of a rose.</note>. We beat this wood into powder, and mix it with palm oil; with which both men and women perfume themselves.</p>
            <p>In our buildings we study convenience rather than ornament. Each master of a family has a large square piece of ground, surrounded with a moat or fence, or enclosed with a wall made of red earth tempered: which, when dry, is as hard as brick. Within this are his houses to accommodate his family and slaves; which, if numerous, frequently present the appearance of a village. In the middle stands the principal building, appropriated to the sole use of the master, and consisting
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0324600501:39"/>
               of two apartments; in one of which he sits in the day with his family, the other is left apart for the reception of his friends. He has besides these a distinct apartment in which he sleeps, <ref target="a004" corresp="n004">together with his male children</ref><note xml:id="n004" target="a004" type="gloss">The Spartans, from ancient Greece, performed this same practice. The men stayed away from the women most of the time so they could focus on war and studying with their brothers. This practice helps the men stay sharp and not have either of the sexes be distracted by each other.</note> . On each side are the apartments of his wives, who have also their separate day and night houses. The habitations of the slaves and their families are distributed throughout the rest of the enclosure. These houses never exceed one story in height: they are always built of wood, or stakes driven into the ground, crossed with wattles, and neatly plastered within and without. The roof is thatched with reeds. Our dayhouses are left open at the sides; but those in which we sleep are always covered, and plastered in the inside, with a composition mixed with cow dung, to keep off the different insects,
<pb n="17"/>
which annoy us during the night. The walls and floors also of these are generally covered with mats. Our beds consist of a platform, raised three or four feet from the ground, on which are laid skins, and different parts of a spungy tree called plantain. Our covering is calico or muslin, the same as our dress. The usual seats are a few logs of wood; but we have benches, which are generally perfumed, to accommodate strangers: these compose the greater part of our household furniture. Houses so constructed and furnished require but little skill to erect them. Every man is a sussicient architect for the purpose. The whole neighbourhood afford their unanimous assistance in building them, and in return receive, and expect no other recompense than a feast.</p>
            <p>As we live in a country where nature
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0324600501:41"/>
is prodigal of her favours, our wants are few and easily supplied; of course we have few manufactures. They consist for the most part of calicoes, earthen ware, ornaments, and instruments of war and husbandry. But these make no part of our commerce, the principal articles of which, as I have observed, are provisions. In such a state, money is of little use; however we have some small pieces of coin, if I may call them such. They are made something like an anchor; but I do not remember either their value or denomination. We have also markets, at which I have been frequently with my mother. These are sometimes visited by stout mahogany-coloured men from the south west of us: we call them <hi>Oye-Eboe,</hi> which term signifies red men living at a distance. They generally bring us fire-arms, gunpowder,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0324600501:42"/>
hats, beads, and dried fish. The last we esteemed a great rarity, as our waters were only brooks and springs. These articles they barter with us for odoriferous woods and earth, and our salt of wood ashes. They always carry slaves through our land; but the strictest account is exacted of their manner of procuring them before they are suffered to pass. Sometimes indeed we sold slaves to them, but they were only prisoners of war, or such among us as had been convicted of kidnapping, or adultery, and some other crimes, which we esteemed heinous. This practice of kidnapping induces me to think, that, notwithstanding all our strictness, their principal business among us was to trepan our people. I remember too they carried great sacks along with them, which not long after I had an
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0324600501:43"/>
opportunity of fatally seeing applied to that infamous purpose.</p>
            <p>Our land is uncommonly rich and fruitful, and produces all kinds of vegetables in great abundance. We have plenty of Indian corn, and vast quantities of cotton and tobacco. Our pine apples grow without culture; they are about the size of the largest sugar-loaf, and finely flavoured. We have also spices of different kinds, particularly pepper; and a variety of delicious fruits which I have never seen in Europe; together with gums of various kinds, and honey in abundance. All our industry is exerted to improve those blessings of nature. Agriculture is our chief employment; and <ref target="a005" corresp="n005">every one,</ref> even the children and women, are engaged in it <note xml:id="n005" target="a005" type="gloss">Interesting to note that they are living in an egalitarian culture when it comes to agriculture, the backbone to their existence.</note> . Thus we are all habituated to labour from our earliest years. Every one contributes something to the common
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0324600501:44"/>
               stock; and as we are unacquainted with idleness, we have no beggars. The benefits of such a mode of living are obvious. The West India planters prefer the slaves of Benin or Eboe, to those of any other part of Guinea, <ref target="a006" corresp="n006">for their hardiness, intelligence, integrity, and zeal</ref><note xml:id="n006" target="a006" type="gloss">The narrator appears to be proud that it is his land that is most commonly used for the slave trade due to his people's hardiness and work ethic.</note> . Those benefits are felt by us in the general healthiness of the people, and in their vigour and activity; I might have added too in their comeliness. Deformity is indeed unknown amongst us, I mean that of shape. Numbers of the natives of Eboe now in London, might be brought in support of this assertion: for, in regard to complexion, ideas of beauty are wholly relative. I remember while in Africa to have seen three negro children, who were tawny, and another quite white, who were universally regarded by myself, and the natives in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0324600501:45"/>
general, as far as related to their complexions, as deformed. Our women too were in my eyes at least uncommonly graceful, alert, and modest to a degree of bashfulness; nor do I remember to have ever heard of an instance of incontinence amongst them before marriage. They are also remarkably cheerful. Indeed cheerfulness and affability are two of the leading characteristics of our nation.</p>
            <p>Our tillage is exercised in a large plain or common, some hours walk from our dwellings, and all the neighbours resort thither in a body. They use no beasts of husbandry; and their only instruments are hoes, axes, shovels, and beaks, or pointed iron to dig with. sometimes we are visited by locusts, which come in large clouds, so as to darken the air, and destroy our harvest. This however happens rarely, but when
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0324600501:46"/>
it does, a famine is produced by it. I remember an instance or two wherein this happened. This common is often the theatre of war; and therefore when our people go out to till their land, they not only go in a body, but generally take their arms with them for fear of a surprise; and when they apprehend an invasion, they guard the avenues to their dwellings, by driving sticks into the ground, which are so sharp at one end as to pierce the foot, and are generally dipped in poison. From what I can recollect of these battles, they appear to have been irruptions of one little state or district on the other, to obtain prisoners or booty. Perhaps they were incited to this by those traders who brought the European goods I mentioned amongst us. Such a mode of obtaining slaves in Africa is common; and I believe more
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0324600501:47"/>
are procured this way, and by kidnaping, than any other<note n="*" place="bottom">see Benezet's Account of Africa throughout.</note>. When a trader wants slaves, he applies to a chief for them, and tempts him with his wares. It is not extraordinary, if on this occasion he yields to the temptation with as little firmness, and accepts the price of his fellow creatures liberty with as little reluctance as the enlightened merchant. Accordingly he falls on his neighbours, and a desperate battle ensues. If he prevails and takes prisoners, he gratifies his avarice by selling them; but, if his party be vanquished, and he falls into the hands of the enemy, he is put to death: for, as he has been known to foment their quarrels, it is thought dangerous to let him survive, and no ransom can save him, though all other prisoners may be redeemed. We have firearms, bows and arrows, broad two-edged
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0324600501:48"/>
swords and javelins: we have shields also which cover a man from head to foot. All are taught the use of these weapons; even our women are warriors, and march boldly out to fight along with the men. Our whole district is a kind of militia: on a certain signal given, such as the firing of a gun at night, they all rise in arms and rush upon their enemy. It is perhaps something remarkable, that when our people march to the field a red flag or banner is borne before them. I was once a witness to a battle in our common. We had been all at work in it one day as usual, when our people were suddenly attacked. I climbed a tree at some distance, from which I beheld the sight. There were many women as well as men on both sides; among others my mother was there, and armed with a broad sword. After
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0324600501:49"/>
               fighting for a considerable time with great fury, and many had been killed, our people obtained the victory, and took their enemy's Chief prisoner. He was carried off in great triumph, and, though he offered a large ransom for his life, he was put to death. A virgin of note among our enemies had been slain in the battle, and her <ref target="a007" corresp="n007">arm was exposed in our market-place</ref>, where our trophies were always exhibited. <note xml:id="n007" target="a007" type="gloss">Grisly account that does not parallel the thriving and forward thinking culture of the narrator's home that he described earlier.</note>  The spoils were divided according to the merit of the warriors. Those prisoners which were not sold or redeemed we kept as slaves: but how different was their condition from that of the slaves in the West Indies! With us they do no more work than other members of the community, even their master; their food, clothing and lodging were nearly the same as theirs, (except that they were not permitted
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0324600501:50"/>
to eat with those who were free-born); and there was scarce any other difference between them, than a superior degree of importance which the head of a family possesses in our state, and that authority which, as such, he exercises over every part of his household. some of these slaves have even slaves under them as their own property, and for their own use.</p>
            <p>As to religion, the natives believe that there is one Creator of all things, and that he lives in the sun, and is girted round with a belt that he may never eat or drink; but, according to some, he smokes a pipe, which is our own favourite luxury. They believe he governs events, especially our deaths or captivity; but, as for the doctrine of eternity, I do not remember to have ever heard of it: some however believe in the transmigration of souls in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0324600501:51"/>
a certain degree. Those spirits, which are not transmigrated, such as their dear friends or relations, they believe always attend them, and guard them from the bad spirits or their foes. For this reason they always before eating, as I have observed, put some small portion of the meat, and pour some of their drink, on the ground for them; and they often make <ref target="a008" corresp="n008">oblation</ref><note xml:id="n008" target="a008" type="gloss">oblation: (the act of making a religious offering; specifically capitalized :  the act of offering the eucharistic elements to God</note>of the blood of beasts or fowls at their graves.

There she made her libations, and spent most of the night in cries and lamentations. I have been often extremely terrified on these occasions. The loneliness of the place, the darkness of the night, and the ceremony
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0324600501:52"/>
of libation, naturally awful and gloomy, were heightened by my mother's lamentations; and these concurring with the doleful cries of birds, by which these places were frequented, gave an inexpressible terror to the scene.</p>
            <p>We compute the year from the day on which the sun crosses the line, and on its setting that evening, there is a general shout throughout the land; at least I can speak from my own knowledge, throughout our vicinity. The people at the same time make a great noise with rattles, not unlike the basket rattles used by children here, though much larger, and hold up their hands to heaven for a blessing. It is then the greatest offerings are made; and those children whom our wise men foretel will be fortunate are then presented to different people. I remember
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0324600501:53"/>
many used to come to see me, and I was carried about to others for that purpose. They have many offerings, particularly at full moons; generally two at harvest before the fruits are taken out of the ground: and when any young animals are killed, sometimes they offer up part of them as a sacrifice. These offerings, when made by one of the heads of a family, serve for the whole. I remember we often had them at my father's and my uncle's, and their families have been present. Some of our offerings are eaten with bitter herbs. We had a saying among us to any one of a cross temper, <q>'That if they were to be eaten, they should be eaten with bitter herbs.'</q> </p>
            <p>We practised circumcision like the Jews, and made offerings and feasts on that occasion in the same manner as they did. Like them also, our
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0324600501:54"/>
children were named from some event, some circumstance, or fancied foreboding at the time of their birth. I was named <hi>Olaudah,</hi> which, in our language, signifies vicissitude, or fortunate also; one favoured, and having a loud voice and well spoken. I remember we never polluted the name of the object of our adoration; on the contrary, it was always mentioned with the greatest reverence; and we were totally unacquainted with swearing, and all those terms of abuse and reproach which find their way so readily and copiously into the language of more civilized people. The only expressions of that kind I remember were, <q>'May you rot, or may you swell, or may a beast take you.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>I have before remarked that the natives of this part of Africa are extremely cleanly. This necessary habit
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0324600501:55"/>
of decency was with us a part of religion, and therefore we had many purifications and washings; indeed almost as many, and used on the same occasions, if my recollection does not fail me, as the <ref target="a010" corresp="n010">Jews</ref> <note xml:id="n010" target="a010" type="gloss">Religious laws require Jewish people to take part in ritual washing, including an immersion of the whole body (tevilah) and the pouring water over the hands (netilat yadayim). There is no specific correlation or proof that this contributed to higher hygiene levels among the Jewish population, however, so Equiano's statement is likely based on stereotypes of the time (Wikipedia)</note> Those that touched the dead at any time were obliged to wash and purify themselves before they could enter a dwelling-house. Every woman too, at certain times, was forbidden to come into a dwelling-house, or touch any person, or any thing we eat. I was so fond of my mother I could not keep from her, or avoid touching her at some of those periods, in consequence of which I was obliged to be kept out with her, in a little house made for that purpose, till offering was made, and then we were purified.</p>
            <p>Though we had no places of public worship, we had priests and magicians, or wise men. I do not remember
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0324600501:56"/>
whether they had different offices, or whether they were united in the same persons, but they were held in great reverence by the people. They calculated our time, and foretold events, as their name imported, for we called them Ah-affoe-way-cah, which signifies calculators or yearly men, our year being called Ah-affoe. They wore their beards, and when they died they were suceeded by their sons. Most of their implements and things of value were interred along with them. Pipes and tobacco were also put into the grave with the corpse, which was always perfumed and ornamented, and animals were offered in sacrifice to them. None accompanied their funerals but those of the same profession or tribe. These buried them after sunset, and always returned from the grave by
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0324600501:57"/>
a different way from that which they went.</p>
            <p>These magicians were also our doctors or physicians. They practised bleeding by cupping; and were very successful in healing wounds and expelling poisons. They had likewise some extraordinary method of discovering jealousy, theft, and poisoning; the success of which no doubt they derived from the unbounded influence over the credulity and superstition of the people. I do not remember what those methods were, except that as to poisoning: I recollect an instance or two, which I hope it will not be deemed impertinent here to insert, as it may serve as a kind of specimen of the rest, and is still used by the negroes in the West Indies. A young woman had been poisoned, but it was not known by whom: the doctor ordered the corpse to be taken up by
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0324600501:58"/>
some persons, and carried to the grave. As soon as the bearers had raised it on their shoulders, they seemed seized with some <note n="*" place="bottom">see also Leiut. Matthew's Voyage, p. 123.</note> sudden impulse, and ran to and fro unable to stop themselves. At last, after having passed through a number of thorns and prickly bushes unhurt, the corpse fell from them close to a house, and defaced it in the fall; and the owner being taken up, he immediately confessed the poisoning<note n="†" place="bottom">An instance of this kind happened at Montserrat in the West Indies in the year 1763. I then belonged to the Charming Sally, Capt. Doran.—The chief mate, Mr. Mansfield, and some of the crew being one day on shore, were present at the burying of a poisoned negro girl? Though they had often heard of the circumstance of the running in such cases, and had even seen it, they imagined it to be a trick of the corpse-bearers. The mate therefore desired two of the sailors to take up the coffin, and carry it to the grave. The sailors, who were all of the same opinion, readily obeyed; but they had scaretly raised it to their shoulders, before they began to run furiously about, quite unable to direct themselves, till, at last, without intention, they came to the hut of him who had poisoned the girl. The coffin then immediately fell from their shoulders against the hut, and damaged part of the wall. The owner of the hut was taken into custody on this, and confessed the poisoning.—I give this story as it was related by the mate and crew on their return to the ship. The credit which is due to it I leave with the reader.</note>.</p>

               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0324600501:59"/>
The natives are extremely cautions about poison. When they buy any eatable the seller kisses it all round before the buyer, to shew him it is not poisoned; and the same is done when any meat or drink is presented, particularly to a stranger. We have serpents of different kinds, some of which are esteemed ominous when they appear in our houses, and these we never molest. I remember two of those ominous snakes, each of which was as thick as the calf of a man's leg, and in colour resembling a dolphin in the water, crept at different times into my
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0324600501:60"/>
mother's night-house, where I always lay with her, and coiled themselves into folds, and each time they crowed like a cock. I was desired by some of our wise men to touch these, that I might be interested in the good omens, which I did, for they were quite harmless, and would tamely suffer themselves to be handled; and then they were put into a large open earthen pan, and set on one side of the highway. Some of our snakes, however, were poisonous: one of them crossed the road one day as I was standing on it, and passed between my feet without offering to touch me, to the great surprise of many who saw it; and these incidents were accounted by the wise men, and likewise by my mother and the rest of the people, as remarkable omens in my favour.</p>
            <p>such is the imperfect sketch my
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0324600501:61"/>
memory has furnished me with of the manners and customs of a people among whom I first drew my breath. And here I cannot forbear suggesting what has long struck me very forcibly, namely, the strong analogy which even by this sketch, imperfect as it is, appears to prevail in the manners and customs of my countrymen and those of the Jews, before they reached the Land of Promise, and particularly the patriarchs while they were yet in that pastoral state which is described in Genesis—an analogy, which alone would induce me to think that the one people had sprung from the other. Indeed this is the opinion of <ref target="a011" corresp="n011">Dr. Gill</ref> <note xml:id="n011" target="a011" type="gloss">John Gill (1697-1771) was a prominent biblical scholar of the time, know most commonly for his in-depth biblical analysis in <hi>An Exposition of the New Testament</hi> (3 vols., 1746–8), and <hi> Exposition of the Old Testament</hi> (6 vols., 1748–63)(Wikipedia)</note>, who, in his commentary on Genesis, very ably deduces the pedigree of the Africans from <ref target="a012" corresp="n012">Afer and Afra</ref> <note xml:id="n012" target="a012" type="gloss"> In Dr. Gill's analysis of Genesis 25:4, he mentions an Aphra and Apher, not an Afer and Afra, which is a potential error on Equiano's part.

It is also conformable to the sentiments of Dr. John Clarke, formerly Dean of Sarum, in his Truth of the Christian Religion: both these authors concur in ascribing to us this original. The reasonings of those gentlemen are still further confirmed by the scripture chronology; and if any further corroboration were required, this resemblance in so many respects is a strong evidence in support of the opinion. Like the Israelites in their primitive state, our government was conducted by our chiefs or judges, our wise men and elders; and the head of a family with us enjoyed a similar authority over his household with that which is ascribed to Abraham and the other patriarchs. The law of retaliation obtained almost universally with us as with them: and even their religion appeared to have shed upon us a ray of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0324600501:63"/>
its glory, though broken and spent in its passage, or eclipsed by the cloud with which time, tradition, and ignorance might have enveloped it; for we had our circumcision (a rule I believe peculiar to that people:) we had also our sacrifices and burnt-offerings, our washings and purifications, on the same occasions as they had.</p>

in me with great care, and made an impression on my mind, which time could not erase, and which all the adversity and variety of fortune I have since experienced, served only to rivet and record; for, whether the love of one's country be real or imaginary, or a lesson of reason, or an instinct of nature, I still look back with pleasure on the first scenes of my life, though that pleasure has been for the most part mingled with sorrow.</p>
            <p>I have already acquainted the reader with the time and place of my birth. My father, besides many slaves, had a numerous family, of which seven lived to grow up, including myself and a sister; who was the only daughter. As I was the youngest of the sons, I became, of course, the greatest favourite with my mother, and was always with her; and she used to take particular
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0324600501:70"/>
pains to form my mind. I was trained up from my earliest years in the art of war: my daily exercise was shooting and throwing javelins; and my mother adorned me with emblems, after the manner of our greatest warriors. In this way I grew up till I was turned the age of eleven, when an end was put to my happiness in the following manner:—Generally when the grown people in the neighbourhood were gone far in the fields to labour the children assembled together in some of the neighbours' premises to play; and commonly some of us used to get up a tree to look out for any assailant, or kidnapper, that might come upon us; for they sometimes took those opportunities of our parents absence to attack and carry off as many as they could seize. One day, as I was watching at the top of a tree in our yard, I saw one of those people
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0324600501:71"/>
come into the yard of our next neighbour but one, to kidnap, there being many stout young people in it. Immediately on this I gave the alarm of the rogue, and he was surrounded by the stoutest of them, who entangled him with cords, so that he could not escape till some of the grown people came and secured him. But alas! ere long it was my fate to be thus attacked, and to be carried off, when none of the grown people were nigh. One day, when all our people were gone out to their works as usual, and only I and my dear sister were left to mind the house, two men and a woman got over our walls, and in a moment seized us both, and, without giving us time to cry out, or make resistance, they stopped our mouths, and ran off with us, into the nearest wood. Here they tied our hands, and continued to carry us as
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0324600501:72"/>
far as they could, till night came on, when we reached a small house, where the robbers halted for refreshment and spent the night. We were then unbound, but were unable to take any food; and, being quite overpowered by fatigue and grief, our only relief was some sleep, which allayed our misfortune for a short time. The next morning we left the house, and continued travelling all the day. For a long time we had kept the woods, but at last we came into a road which I believed I knew. I had now some hopes of being delivered; for we had advanced but a little way before I discovered some people at a distance, on which I began to cry out for their assistance; but my cries had no other effect than to make them tie me faster and stop my mouth, and then they put me into a large sack. They also
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0324600501:73"/>
stopped my sister's mouth, and tied her hands; and in this manner we proceeded till we were out of the sight of these people. When we went to rest the following night they offered us some victuals; but we refused it; and the only comfort we had was in being in one another's arms all that night, and bathing each other with our tears. But alas! we were soon deprived of even the small comfort of weeping together. The next day proved a day of greater sorrow than I had yet experienced; for my sister and I were then separated, while we lay clasped in each others arms. It was in vain that we besought them not to part us; she was torn from me, and immediately carried away, while I was left in a state of distraction not to be described. I cried and grieved continually; and for several days, did not
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0324600501:74"/>
eat any thing but what they forced into my mouth. At length, after many days travelling, during which I had often changed masters, I got into the hands of a chieftain, in a very pleasant country. This man had two wives and some children, and they all used me extremely well, and did all they could to comfort me; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the first wife, who was something like my mother. Although I was a great many days journey from my father's house, yet these people spoke exactly the same language with us. This first master of mine, as I may call him, was a smith, and my prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal employment was working his bellows, which were the same kind as I had seen in my vicinity. They were in some respects not unlike the stoves here in gentlemen's kitchens; and were covered over with leather; and in the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0324600501:75"/>
middle of that leather a stick was fixed, and a person stood up, and worked it, in the same manner as is done to pump water out of a cask with a hand pump. I believe it was gold he worked, for it was of a lovely bright yellow colour, and was worn by the women on their wrists and ancles. I was there I suppose about a month, and they at last used to trust me some little distance from the house. This liberty I used in embracing every opportunity to inquire the way to my own home: and I also sometimes, for the same purpose, went with the maidens, in the cool of the evenings, to bring pitchers of water from the springs for the use of the house. I had also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked where the sun rose in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and set in the evening, as I had travelled along; and I had observed that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> father's house was towards the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0324600501:76"/>
rising of the sun. I therefore deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to seize the first opportunity of making my escape, and to shape my course for that quarter; for I was quite oppressed and weighed down by grief after my mother and friends; and my love of liberty, ever great, was strengthened by the mortifying cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of not daring to eat with the free-born children, although I was mostly their companion. While I was projecting my escape, one day an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky event happened, which quite disconcerted my plan, and put an end to my hopes. I used to be sometimes employed in assisting an elderly woman slave, to cook and take care of the poultry: and one morning, while I was feeding some chickens, I happened to toss a small pebble at one of them, which hit it on the middle, and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly killed it. The old slave, having
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0324600501:77"/>
soon after missed the chicken, inquired after it; and on my relating the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent (for I told her the truth, because my mother would never suffer me to tell a lie) she flew into a violent pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, threatened that I should suffer for it; and, my master being out, she immediately went and told her mistress what I had done. This alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me very much, and I expected an instant flogging, which to me was uncommonly dreadful; for I had sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom been beaten at home. I therefore resolved to fly; and accordingly I ran into a thicket that was hard by, and hid myself in the bushes. soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards my mistress and the slave returned, and, not seeing me, they searched all the house, but not finding me, and I not making answer when they called to me, they thought I ad run away, and the whole neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0324600501:78"/>
was raised in the pursuit of me. In that part of the country (as in ours) the houses and villages were skirted with woods, or shrubberies, and the bushes were so thick that a man could readily conceal himself in them, so as to elude the strictest search. The neighbours continued the whole day looking for me, and several times many of them came within a few yards of the place where I lay hid. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected every moment, when I heard a rustling among the trees, to be found out, and punished by my master: but they never discovered me, though they were often so near that I even heard their conjectures as they were looking about for me; and I now learned from them, that any attempt to return home would be hopeless. Most of them supposed I had fled towards home;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0324600501:79"/>
but the distance was so great, and the way so intricate, that they thought I could never reach it, and that I should be lost in the woods. When I heard this I was seized with a violent panie, and abandoned myself to despair. Night too began to approach, and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated all my fears. I had before entertained hopes of getting home; and had determined when it should be dark to make the attempt; but I was now convinced it was fruitless, and began to consider that, if possibly I could escape all other animals, I could not those of the human kind; and that, not knowing the way, I must perish in the woods. Thus was I like the hunted deer:<q>
                  <l>—"Ev'ry leaf and ev'ry whisp'ring breath</l>
                  <l>"Convey'd a foe, and ev'ry foe a death."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I heard frequent rustlings among the leaves; and being pretty sure they were
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0324600501:80"/>
snakes, I expected every instant to be stung by them. This increased my anguish, and the horror of my situation became now quite insupportable. I at length quitted the thicket, very saint and hungry, for I had not eaten or drank any thing all the day; and crept to my master's kitchen, from whence I set out at first, and which was an open shed, and laid myself down in the ashes with an anxious wish for death to relieve me from all my pains. I was scarcely awake in the morning, when the old woman slave, who was the first up, came to light the fire, and saw me in the fire place. she was very much surprised to see me, and could scarcely believe her own eyes. she now promised to intercede for me, and went for her master, who soon after came, and, having slightly reprimanded
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0324600501:81"/>
me, ordered me to be taken care of, and not ill treated.</p>
            <p>soon after this my master's only daughter, and child by his first wife, sickened and died, which affected him so much that for some time he was almost frantic, and really would have killed himself, had he not been watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and prevented. However, in a small time afterwards he recovered, and I was again sold. I was now carried to the left of the sun's rising, through many dreary wastes and dismal woods, amidst the hideous roarings of wild beasts. The people I was sold to used to carry me very often, when I was tired, either on their shoulders or on their backs. I saw many convenient well-built sheds along the road, at proper distances, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate the merchants and travellers, who lay in those buildings along with
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0324600501:82"/>
their wives, who often accompany them; and they always go well armed.</p>
            <p>From the time I left my own nation I always found somebody that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood me till I came to the sea coast. The languages of different nations did not totally differ, nor were they so co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious as those of the Europeans, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the English. They were therefore easily learned; and, while I was journeying thus through Africa, I acquired two or three different tongues. In this manner I had been travelling for a considerable time, when one evening to my great sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, whom should I see brought to the house where I was but my dear sister! As soon as she saw me she gave a loud shriek, and ran into my arms—I was quite overpowered: neither of us could speak; but, for a considerable time,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0324600501:83"/>
clung to each other in mutual embraces, unable to do any thing but weep. Our meeting affected all who saw us; and indeed I must acknowledge, in honour of those sable destroyers of human rights, that I never met with any ill treatment, or saw any offered to their slaves, except tying them, when ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, to keep them from running away. When these people knew we were brother and sister, they indulged us to be together; and the man, to whom I supposed we belonged, lay with us, he in the middle, while she and I held one another by the hands across his breast all night; and thus for a while we forgot our misfortunes in the joy of being together: but even this small comfort was scon to have an end; for scarcely had the fatal morning appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when she was again torn from me for ever! I was now more miserable,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0324600501:84"/>
if possible, than before. The small relief which her presence gave me from pain was gone, and the wretchedness of my situation was redoubled by my anxiety after her fate, and my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions lest her sufferings should be greater than mine, when I could not be with her to alleviate them. Yes, thou dear partner of all my childish sports! thou sharer of my joys and sorrows! happy should I have ever esteemed myself to encounter every misery for you, and to procure your freedom by the sacrifice of my own. Though you were early forced from my arms, your image has been always rivetted in my heart, from which neither <hi>time nor fortune</hi> have been able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it; so that, while the thoughts of your sufferings have damped my prosperity, they have mingled with adversity and increased its bitterness.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0324600501:85"/>
To that Heaven which protects the weak from the strong, I commit the care of your innocence and virtues, if they have not already received their full reward, and if your youth and delicacy have not long since fallen vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims to the violence of the African trader, the pestilential stench of a Guinea ship, the seasoning in the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean colonies, or the lash and lust of a brutal and unrelenting overseer.</p>
            <p>I did not long remain after my sister. I was again sold, and carried through a number of places, till, after travelling a considerable time, I came to a town called Tinmah, in the most beautiful country I had yet seen in Africa. It was extremely rich, and there were many rivulets which flowed through it, and supplied a large pond in the centre of the town, where the people washed. Here I first saw and tasted cocoa nuts,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0324600501:86"/>
which I thought superior to any nuts I had ever tasted before; and the trees, which were loaded, were also interspers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongst the houses, which had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious shades adjoining, and were in the same manner as ours, the insides being neatly plastered and whitewashed, Here I also saw and tasted for the first time sugar-cane. Their money consisted of little white shells, the size of the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger nail. I was sold here for one hundred and seventy-two of them by a merchant who lived and brought me there. I had been about two or three days at his house, when a wealthy widow, a neighbour of his, came there one even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and brought with her an only son, a young gentleman about my own age and size. Here they saw me; and, having taken a fancy to me, I was bought of the merchant, and went home with them. Her house and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0324600501:87"/>
premises were situated close to one of those rivulets I have mentioned, and were the finest I ever saw in Africa: they were very extensive, and she had a number of slaves to attend her. The next day I was washed and perfumed, and when meal-time came, I was led into the presence of my mistress, and eat and drank before her with her son. This filled me with astonishment; and I could scarce help expressing my sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise that the young gentleman should suffer me, who was bound, to eat with him who was free; and not only so, but that he would not at any time either eat or drink till I had taken first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause. I was the eldest, which was agreeable to our custom. Indeed every thing here, and all their treatment of me, made me forget that I was a slave. The language of these people resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ours so nearly, that we understood
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0324600501:88"/>
each other perfectly. They had also the very same customs as we. There were likewise slaves daily to attend us, while my young master and I with other boys sported with our darts and bows and arrows, as I had been used to do at home. In this resemblance to my former happy state, I passed about two months; and I now began to think I was to be adopted into the family, and was beginning to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to my situation, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get by degrees my misfortunes, when all at once the delusion vanished; for, without the least previous knowledge, one morning early, while my dear master and companion was still asleep, I was awakened out of my reverie to fresh sorrow, and hurried away even amongst the uncircumcised.</p>
            <p>Thus, at the very moment I dreamed of the greatest happiness, I found my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0324600501:89"/>
most miserable; and it seemed as if fortune wished to give me this taste of joy, only to render the reverse more poignant. The change I now expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced was as painful as it was sudden and unexpected. It was a change in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed from a state of bliss to a scene which is inexpressible by me, as it discovered to me an element I had never before beheld, and till then had no idea of, and wherein such instances of hardship and cruelty continually oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred as I can never reflect on but with horror.</p>
            <p>All the nations and people I had hitherto passed through resembled our own in their manners, customs, and language: but I came at length to a country, the inhabitants of which differed from us in all those particulars. I was very much struck with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, especially when I came among
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0324600501:90"/>
a people who did not circumcise, and eat without washing their hands. They cooked also in iron pots, and had Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean cutlasses and cross bows, which were unknown to us, and fought with their fists amongst themselves. Their women were not so modest as ours, for they eat, and drank, and slept, with their men. But above all, I was amazed to see no sacrifices or offerings among them. In some of those places the people ornamented themselves with scars, and likewise filed their teeth very sharp. They wanted sometimes to ornament me in the same manner, but I would not suffer them; hoping that I might some time be among a people who did not thus disfigure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as I thought they did. At last I came to the banks of a large river, which was covered with canoes, in which the people appeared to live
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0324600501:91"/>
with their household utensils and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions of all kinds. I was beyond measure astonished at this, as I had never before seen any water larger than a pond or a rivulet: and my surprise was mingled with no small fear when I was put into one of these canoes, and we began to paddle and move along the river. We continued going on thus till night; and when we came to land, and made fires on the banks, each family by themselves, some dragged their canoes on shore, others stayed and cooked in theirs, and laid in them all night. Those on the land had mats, of which they made tents, some in the shape of little houses: in these we slept: and after the morning meal, we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked again and proceeded as before. I was often very much astonished to see some of the women, as well as the men, jump into the water, dive to the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0324600501:92"/>
bottom, come up again, and swim about. Thus I continued to travel, sometimes by land, sometimes by water, through different countries and various nations, till, at the end of six or seven months after I had been kidnapped, I arrived at the sea coast. It would be tedious and uninteresting to relate all the incidents which befell me dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this journey, and which I have not yet forgotten; of the various hands I passed through, and the manners and customs of all the different people among whom I lived: I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only observe, that in all the places where I was, the soil was exceedingly rich; the pomkins, aedas, plantains, yams, &amp;c. &amp;c. were in great abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and of incredible size. There were also vast quantities of different gums, though not used for any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; and every where a great deal of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0324600501:93"/>
tobacco. The cotton even grew quite wild; and there was plenty of red-wood. I saw no mechanics whatever in all the way, except such as I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. The chief employment in all these countries was agriculture, and both the males and females, as with us, were brought up to it, and trained in the arts of war.</p>
            <p>The first object which saluted my eyes when I arrived on the coast was the sea, and a slave ship, which was then riding at anchor, and waiting for its cargo. These filled me with asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, which was soon converted into terror when I was carried on board. I was immediately handled, and tossed up to see if I were sound, by some of the crew; and I was now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded that I had gotten into a world of bad spirits, and that they were going to kill me. Their complexions too
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0324600501:94"/>
differing so much from ours, their long hair, and the language they spoke, (which was very different from any I had ever heard) united to confirm me in this belief. Indeed such were the horrors of my views and fears at the moment, that, if ten thousand world, had been my own, I would have freely parted with them all to have exchanged my condition with that of the meanest slave in my own country. When I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed round the ship too and saw a large furnace or copper boiling, and a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of black people of every descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion chained together, every one of their countenances expressing dejection and sorrow, I no longer doubted of my fate; and, quite overpowered with horror and anguish, I fell motionless on the deck and fainted. When I recovered a little I found some black people about me, who I believed were
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0324600501:95"/>
some of those who brought me on board, and had been receiving their pay; they talked to me in order to cheer me, but all in vain. I asked them if we were not to be eaten by those white men with horrible looks, red faces, and long hair. They told me I was not: and one of the crew brought me a small portion of spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liquor in a wine glass; but, being afraid of him, I would not take it out of his hand. One of the blacks there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore took it from him and gave it to me, and I took a little down my palate, which, instead of reviving me, as they thought it would, threw me into the greatest consternation at the strange feeling it produced, having never tasted any such liquor before. soon after this the blacks who brought me on board went off, and left me abandoned to despair. I now saw myself deprived
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0324600501:96"/>
of all chance of returning to my native country, or even the least glimpse of hope of gaining the shore, which I now considered as friendly; and I even wished for my former slavery in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to my present situation, which was filled with horrors of every kind, still heightened by my ignorance of what I was to undergo. I was not long suffered to indulge my grief; I was soon put down under the decks, and there I received such a salutation in my nostrils as I had never expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced in my life: so that, with the loathsomeness of the stench, and crying together, I became so sick and low that I was not able to eat, nor had I the least desire to taste any thing. I now wished for the last friend, death, to relieve me; but soon, to my grief, two of the white men offered me eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables; and, on my refusing to eat,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0324600501:97"/>
one of them held me fast by the hands, and laid me across, I think the windlass, and tied my feet, while the other flogged me severely. I had never experienced any thing of this kind before; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not being used to the water, I naturally feared that element the first time I saw it, yet nevertheless, could I have got over the nettings, I would have jumped over the side, but I could not; and, besides, the crew used to watch us very closely who were not chained down to the decks, lest we should leap into the water: and I have seen some of these poor African pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners most severely cut for attempting to do so, and hourly whipped for not eating. This indeed was often the case with myself. In a little time after, amongst the poor chained men, I found some of my own nation, which in a small degree gave ease to my mind. I
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0324600501:98"/>
inquired of these what was to be done with us? They gave me to understand we were to be carried to these white people's country to work for them. I then was a little revived, and thought, if it were no worse than working, my situation was not so desperate: but still I feared I should be put to death, the white people looked and acted, as I thought, in so savage a manner; for I had never seen among any people such instances of brutal cruelty; and this not only shewn towards us blacks, but also to some of the whites themselves. One white man in particular I saw, when we were permitted to be on deck, flogged so unmercifully with a large rope near the foremast, that he died in consequence of it; and they tossed him over the side as they would have done a brute. This made me fear these people the more; and I expected
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0324600501:99"/>
nothing less than to be treated in the same manner. I could not help expressing my fears and apprehensions to some of my countrymen: I asked them if these people had no country, but lived in this hollow place (the ship)? they told me they did not, but came from a distant one. <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'Then,'</q> said I, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'how comes it in all our country we never heard of them?'</q> They told me because they lived so very far off. I then asked where were their women? had they any like themselves? I was told they had: <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'And why,'</q> said I, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'do we not see them?'</q> they answered, because they were left behind. I asked how the vessel could go? they told me they could not tell; but that there were cloth put upon the masts by the help of the ropes I saw, and then the vessel went on; and the white men had some spell or magic they put in the water
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0324600501:100"/>
when they liked in order to stop the vessel. I was exceedingly amazed at this account, and really thought they were spirits. I therefore wished much to be from amongst them, for I expected they would sacrifice me: but my wishes were vain; for we were so quartered that it was impossible for any of us to make our escape. While we stayed on the coast I was mostly on deck; and one day, to my great astonishment, I saw one of these vessels coming in with the sails up. As soon as the whites saw it, they gave a great shout, at which we were amazed; and the more so as the vessel appeared larger by approaching nearer. At last she came to an anchor in my sight, and when the anchor was let go I and my countrymen who saw it were lost in astonishment to observe the vessel stop; and were now convinced it was
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0324600501:101"/>
done by magic. Soon after this the other ship got her boats out, and they came on board of us, and the people of both ships seemed very glad to see each other. Several of the strangers also shook hands with us black people, and made motions with their hands, signifying I suppose, we were to go to their country; but we did not understand them. At last, when the ship we were in, had got in all her cargo, they made ready with many fearful noises, and we were all put under deck, so that we could not see how they managed the vessel. But this disappointment was the least of my sorrow. The stench of the hold while we were on the coast was so intolerably loathsome, that it was dangerous to remain there for any time, and some of us had been permitted to stay on the deck for the fresh air; but now that the whole ship's cargo were
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0324600501:102"/>
confined together, it became absolutely <ref target="a014" corresp="n014">pestilential</ref> <note xml:id="n014" target="a014" type="gloss">According to the Oxford English Dictionary, relating to epidemic disease</note>. The closeness of the place, and the heat of the climate, added to the number in the ship, which was so crowded that each had scarcely room to turn himself, almost suffocated us. This produced copious perspirations, so that the air soon became unfit for respiration, from a variety of loathsome smells, and brought on a sickness among the slaves, of which many died, thus falling victims to the improvident avarice, as I may call it, of their purchasers. This wretched situation was again aggravated by the galling of the chains, now become insupportable; and the filth of the necessary tubs, into which the children often fell, and were almost suffocated. The shrieks of the women, and the groans of the dying, rendered the whole a scene of horror almost inconceivable. Happily perhaps
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0324600501:103"/>
for myself I was soon reduced so low here that it was thought necessary to keep me almost always on-deck; and from my extreme youth I was not put in fetters. In this situation I expected every hour to share the fate of my companions, some of whom were almost daily brought upon deck at the point of death, which I began to hope would soon put an end to my miseries. Often did I think many of the inhabitants of the deep much more happy than myself, I envied them the freedom they enjoyed, and as often wished I could change my condition for theirs. Every circumstance I met with served only to render my state more painful, and heighten my apprehensions, and my opinion of the cruelty of the whites. One day they had taken a number of fishes; and when they had killed and satisfied themselves with as many as
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0324600501:104"/>
they thought fit, to our astonishment who were on the deck, rather than give any of them to us to eat, as we expected, they tossed the remaining fish into the sea again, although we begged and prayed for some as well as we could, but in vain; and some of my countrymen, being pressed by hunger, took an opportunity, when they thought no one saw them, of trying to get a little privately; but they were discovered, and the attempt procured them some very severe floggings. One day, when we had a smooth sea and moderate wind, two of my wearied countrymen who were chained together (I was near them at the time), preferring death to such a life of misery, somehow made through the nettings and jumped into the sea: immediately another quite dejected fellow, who on account of his illness, was suffered to be out of irons,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0324600501:105"/>
also followed their example; and I believe many more would very soon have done the same if they had not been prevented by the ship's crew, who were instantly alarmed. Those of us that were the most active were in a moment put down under the deck, and there was such a noise and confusion amongst the people of the ship as I never heard before, to stop her, and get the boat out to go after the slaves. However two of the wretches were drowned, but they got the other, and afterwards flogged him unmercifully, for thus attempting to prefer death to slavery. In this manner we continued to undergo more hardships than I can now relate, hardships which are inseparable from this accursed trade. Many a time we were near suffocation from the want of fresh air, which we were often without for whole days together. This,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0324600501:106"/>
and the stench of the necessary tubs, carried off many. During our passage I first saw flying fishes, which surprised me very much: they used frequently to fly across the ship, and many of them fell on the deck. I also now first saw the use of the quadrant; I had often with astonishment seen the mariners make observations with it, and I could not think what it meant. They at last took notice of my surprise: and one of them, willing to increase it, as well as to gratify my curiosity, made me one day look through it. The clouds appeared to me to be land, which disappeared as they passed along. This heightened my wonder; and I was now more persuaded than ever that I was in another world, and that every thing about me was magic. At last we came in sight of the island of Barbadoes, at which the whites on board gave a great
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0324600501:107"/>
shout, and made many signs of joy to us. We did not know what to think of this; but as the vessel drew nearer we plainly saw the harbour, and other ships of different kinds and sizes; and we soon anchored amongst them off Bridge Town. Many merchants and planters now came on board, though it was in the evening. They put us in separate parcels, and examined us attentively. They also made us jump, and pointed to the land, signifying we were to go there. We thought by this we should be eaten by these ugly men, as they appeared to us; and, when soon after we were all put down under the deck again, there was much dread and trembling among us, and nothing but bitter cries to be heard all the night from these apprehensions, insomuch that at last the white people got some old slaves from the land to pacify us. They
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0324600501:108"/>
told us we were not to be eaten, but to work, and were soon to go on land, where we should see many of our country people. This report eased us much; and sure enough, soon after we were landed, there came to us Africans of all languages. We were conducted immediately to the merchant's yard, where we were all pent up together like so many sheep in a fold, without regard to sex or age. As every object was new to me every thing I saw filled me with surprise. What struck me first was that the houses were built with bricks and stories, and in every other respect different from those I had seen in Africa: but I was still more astonished on seeing people on horseback. I did not know what this could mean; and indeed I thought these people were full of nothing but magical arts. While I was in this astonishment one of my
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0324600501:109"/>
fellow prisoners spoke to a countryman of his about the horses, who said they were the same kind they had in their country. I understood them, though they were from a distant part of Africa, and I thought it odd I had not seen any horses there; but afterwards, when I came to converse with different Africans, I found they had many horses amongst them, and much larger than those I then saw. We were not many days in the merchant's custody before we were sold after their usual manner, which is this:—On a signal given, (as the beat of a drum) the buyers rush at once into the yard where the slaves are confined, and make choice of that parcel they like best. The noise and clamour with which this is attended, and the eagerness visible in the countenances of the buyers, serve not a little to increase the apprehension of the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0324600501:110"/>
terrified Africans, who may well be supposed to consider them as the ministers of that destruction to which they think themselves devoted. In this manner, without scruple, are relations and friends separated, most of them never to see each other again. I remember in the vessel in which I was brought over, in the men's apartment, there were several brothers, who, in the sale, were sold in different lots; and it was very moving on this occasion to see and hear their cries at parting. O, ye nominal Christians! Might not an African ask you, learned you this from your God, who says unto you, do unto all men as you would men should do unto you? Is it not enough that we are torn from our country and friends, to toil for your luxury and lust of gain? Must every tender feeling be likewise sacrificed to your avarice?
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0324600501:111"/>
Are the dearest friends and relations, now rendered more dear by their separation from their kindred, still to be parted from each other, and thus prevented from cheering the gloom of slavery with the small comfort of being together and mingling their sufferings and sorrows? Why are parents to lose their children, brothers their sisters, or husbands their wives? Surely this is a new refinement in cruelty, which, while it has no advantage to atone for it, thus aggravates distress, and adds fresh horrors even to the wretchedness of slavery.</p>

            <p>I stayed in this island for a few days; I believe it could not be above a fortnight; when I and some few more slaves, that were not saleable amongst the rest, from very much fretting, were shipped off in a sloop for North America. On the passage we were better treated than when we were coming from Africa, and we had plenty of rice and fat pork. We were landed up a river a good way from the sea, about Virginia county, where we saw few or none of our native Africans, and not one soul who could talk to me. I was a few weeks weeding grass, and gathering stones in a plantation; and at last all my companions were distributed different ways, and only myself was left. I was now exceedingly miserable, and thought myself worse off
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0324600501:114"/>
than any of the rest of my companions; for they could talk to each other, but I had no person to speak to that I could understand. In this state I was constantly grieving and pining, and wishing for death rather than any thing else. While I was in this plantation the gentleman, to whom I suppose the estate belonged, being unwell, I was one day sent for to his dwelling house to fan him; when I came into the room where he was I was very much affrighted at some things I saw, and the more so as I had seen a black woman slave as I came through the house, who was cooking the dinner, and the poor creature was cruelly loaded with various kinds of iron machines; she had one particularly on her head, which locked her mouth so fast that she could scarcely speak; and could not eat nor drink. I was much astonished and shocked at
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0324600501:115"/>
this contrivance, which I afterwards learned was called the iron muzzle. Soon after I had a fan put into my hand, to fan the gentleman while he slept; and so I did indeed with great fear. While he was fast asleep I indulged myself a great deal in looking about the room, which to me appeared very fine and curious. The first object that engaged my attention was a watch which hung on the chimney, and was going. I was quite surprised at the noise it made, and was afraid it would tell the gentleman any thing I might do amiss: and when I immediately after observed a picture hanging in the room, which appeared constantly to look at me, I was still more affrighted, having never seen such things as these before. At one time I thought it was something relative to magic; and not seeing it move I thought it might be some way
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0324600501:116"/>
the whites had to keep their great men when they died, and offer them libations as we used to do to our friendly spirits. In this state of anxiety I remained till my master awoke, when I was dismissed out of the room, to my no small satisfaction and relief; for I thought that these people were all made up of wonders. In this place I was called Jacob; but on board the African snow I was called Michael. I had been some time in this miserable, forlorn, and much dejected state, without having any one to talk to, which made my life a burden, when the kind and unknown hand of the Creator (who in very deed leads the blind in a way they know not) now began to appear, to my comfort; for one day the captain of a merchant ship, called the Industrious Bee, came on some business to my master's house. This gentleman, whose name was Michael
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0324600501:117"/>
Henry Pascal, was a lieutenant in the royal navy, but now commanded this trading ship, which was somewhere in the confines of the county many miles off. While he was at my master's house it happened that he saw me, and like me so well that he made a purchase of me. I think I have often heard him say he gave thirty or forty pounds sterling for me; but I do not now remember which. However, he meant me for a present to some of his friends in England: and I was sent accordingly from the house of my then master, (one Mr. Campbell) to the place where the ship lay; I was conducted on horseback by an elderly black man, (a mode of travelling which appeared very odd to me). When I arrived I was carried on board a fine large ship, loaded with tobacco, etc. and just ready to sail for England.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0324600501:118"/>
I now thought my condition much mended; I had sails to lie on, and plenty of good victuals to eat; and every body on board used me very kindly, quite contrary to what I had seen of any white people before; I therefore began to think that they were not all of the same disposition. A few days after I was on board we sailed for England. I was still at a loss to conjecture my destiny. By this time, however, I could smatter a little imperfect English; and I wanted to know as well as I could where we were going. some of the people of the ship used to tell me they were going to carry me back to my own country, and this made me very happy. I was quite rejoiced at the idea of going back; and thought if I should get home what wonders I should have to tell. But I was reserved for another
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0324600501:119"/>
fate, and was soon undeceived, when we came within sight of the English coast. While I was on board this ship, my captain and master named me <hi>Gustavus Vasa.</hi> I at that time began to understand him a little, and refused to be called so, and told him as well as I could that I would be called Jacob; but he said I should not, and still called me Gustavus: and when I refused to answer to my new name, which at first I did, it gained me many a cuff; so at length I submitted, and by which I have been known ever since. The ship had a very long passage; and on that account we had very short allowance of provisions. Towards the last we had only one pound and a half of bread per week, and about the same quantity of meat, and one quart of water a-day. We spoke with only one vessel the whole time we were
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0324600501:120"/>
at sea, and but once we caught a few fishes. In our extremities the captain and people told me in jest they would kill and eat me; but I thought them in earnest, and was depressed beyond measure, expecting every moment to be my last. While I was in this situation one evening they caught, with a good deal of trouble, a large shark, and got it on board. This gladdened my poor heart exceedingly, as I thought it would serve the people to eat instead of their eating me; but very soon, to my astonishment, they cut off a small part of the tail, and tossed the rest over the side. This renewed my <ref target="a015" corresp="n015">consternation</ref> <note xml:id="n015" target="a015" type="gloss">Can be defined as amazement and terror, or dismay (Oxford English Dictionary)</note>; and I did not know what to think of these white people, though I very much feared they would kill and eat me. There was on board the ship a young lad who had never been at sea before, about
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0324600501:121"/>
four or five years older than myself; his name was Richard Baker. He was a native of America, had received an excellent education, and was of a most amiable temper. Soon after I went on board he shewed me a great deal of partiality and attention, and in return I grew extremely fond of him. We at length became inseparable; and, for the space of two years, he was of very great use to me, and was my constant companion and instructor. Although this dear youth had many slaves of his own, yet he and I have gone through many sufferings together on shipboard; and we have many nights lain in each other's bosoms when we were in great distress. Thus such a friendship was cemented between us as we cherished till his death, which to my very great sorrow, happened in the year 1759, when he was up the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0324600501:122"/>
Archipelago, on board his majesty's ship the Preston: an event which I have never ceased to regret, as I lost at once a kind interpreter, an agreeable companion, and a faithful friend; who, at the age of fifteen, discovered a mind superior to prejudice; and who was not ashamed to notice, to associate with, and to be the friend and instructor of one who was ignorant, a stranger, of a different complexion, and a slave! My master had lodged in his mother's house in America: he respected him very much, and made him always eat with him in the cabin. He used often to tell him jocularly that he would kill and eat me. Sometimes he would say to me—the black people were not good to eat, and would ask me if we did not eat people in my country. I said, No: then he said he would kill Dick (as he always called him) first,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0324600501:123"/>
and afterwards me. Though this hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing relieved my mind a little as to myself, I was alarmed for Dick, and whenever he was called I used to be very much afraid he was to be killed; and I would peep and watch to see if they were going to kill him: nor was I free from this consternation till we made the land. One night we lost a man overboard; and the cries and noise were so great and confused, in stopping the ship, that I, who did not know what was the matter, began, as usual, to be very much afraid, and to think they were going to make an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering with me, and perform some magic; which I still believed they dealt in. As the waves were very high I thought the Ruler of the seas was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and I expected to be offered up to appease him. This filled my mind with agony, and I could not any more
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0324600501:124"/>
that night close my eyes again to rest. However, when daylight appeared was a little eased in my mind; but still every time I was called I used to think it was to be killed. some time after this we saw some very large fish, which I afterwards found were called grampusses. They looked to me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely terrible, and made their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance just at dusk; and were so near as to blow the water on the ship's deck. I believed them to be the rulers of the sea; and as the white people did not make any offerings at any time, I thought they were angry with them: and, at last, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed my belief was, the wind just then died away, and a calm ensued, and in consequence of it the ship stopped going. I supposed that the fish had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed this, and I hid myself in the fore part of the ship, through fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0324600501:125"/>
offered up to appease them, every minute peeping and quaking: but my good friend Dick came shortly towards me, and I took an opportunity to ask him, as well as I could, what these fish were. Not being able to talk much English, I could but just make him understand my question; and not at all, when I asked him if any offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were to be made to them: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he told me these fish would swallow any body; which sufficiently alarmed me. Here he was called away by the captain, who was leaning over the quarter-deck railing and looking at the fish; and most of the people were busied in getting a barrel of pitch to light, for them to play with. The captain now called me to him, having learned some of my apprehensions from Dick; and having diverted himself and others for some time with my fears
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0324600501:126"/>
which appeared ludicrous enough in my crying and trembling, he dismissed me. The barrel of pitch was now lighted and put over the side into the water: by this time it was just dark, and the fish went after it; and, to my great joy, I saw them no more.</p>
            <p>However, all my alarms began to subside when we got sight of land; and at last the ship arrived at Falmouth, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a passage of thirteen weeks. Every heart on board seemed gladdened on our reaching the shore, and none more than mine. The captain immediately went on shore, and sent on board some fresh provisions, which we wanted very much: we made good use of them, and our samine was soon turned into feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, almost without ending. It was about the beginning of the spring 1757, when I arrived in England, and I was near twelve years of age at that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0324600501:127"/>
time. I was very much struck with the buildings and the pavement of the streets in Falmouth; and, indeed, every object I saw filled me with new sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise. One morning, when I got upon deck, I saw it covered all over with the snow that fell over-night: as I had never seen any thing of the kind before, I thought it was salt; so I immediately ran down to the mate and desired him, as well as I could, to come and see how somebody in the night had thrown salt all over the deck. He, knowing what it was, desired me to bring some of it down to him: accordingly I took up a handful of it, which I found very cold indeed; and when I brought it to him he desired me to taste it. I did so, and I was surprised beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. I then asked him what it was; he told me it was snow: but I could not in anywise understand him. He
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0324600501:128"/>
asked me if we had no such thing in my country; and I told him, No. I then asked him the use of it, and who made it; he told me a great man in the heavens, called God: but here again I was to all intents and purposes at a loss to understand him; and the more so, when a little after I saw the air filled with it, in a heavy shower, which fell down on the same day. After this I went to church; and having never been at such a place before, I was again amazed at seeing and hearing the service. I asked all I could about it; and they gave me to understand it was worshipping God, who made us and all things. I was still at a great loss, and soon got into an endless field of inquiries, as well as I was able to speak and ask about things. However, my little friend Dick used to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0324600501:129"/>
be my best interpreter; for I could make free with him, and he always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed me with pleasure: and from what I could understand by him of this God, and in seeing these white people did not sell one another as we did, I was much pleased; and in this I thought they were much happier than we Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans. I was astonished at the wisdom of the white people in all things I saw; but was amazed at their not sacrificing, or making any offerings, and eating with unwashed hands, and touching the dead. I likewise could not help re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marking the particular slenderness of their women, which I did not at first like; and I thought they were not so modest and shamefaced as the African women.</p>
            <p>I had often seen my master and Dick employed in reading; and I had a great curiosity to talk to the books, as
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0324600501:130"/>
I thought they did; and so to learn how all things had a beginning: for that purpose I have often taken up a book, and have talked to it, and then put my ears to it, when alone, in hopes it would answer me; and I have been very much concerned when I found it remained silent.</p>
            <p>My master lodged at the house of a gentleman in Falmouth, who had a fine little daughter about six or seven years of age, and she grew prodigiously fond of me; insomuch that we used to eat together, and had servants to wait on us. I was so much caressed by this family that it often reminded me of the treatment I had received from my little noble African master. After I had been here a few days, I was sent on board of the ship; but the child cried so much aster me that nothing could pacify her till I was sent for again.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0324600501:131"/>
It is ludicrous enough, that I began to fear I should be betrothed to this young lady; and when my master asked me if I would stay there with her behind him, as he was going away with the ship, which had taken in the tobacco again, I cried immediately, and said I would not leave him. At last, by stealth, one night I was sent on board the ship again; and in a little time we sailed for Guernsey, where she was in part owned by a merchant, one Nicholas Doberry. As I was now amongst a people who had not their faces scarred, like some of the African nations where I had been, I was very glad I did not let them ornament me in that manner when I was with them. When we arrived at Guernsey, my master placed me to board and lodge with one of his mates, who had a wife and family there; and some months after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0324600501:132"/>
he went to England, and left me in care of this mate, together with my friend Dick: This mate had a little daughter, aged about five or six years, with whom I used to be much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted. I had often observed that when her mother washed her face it looked very rosy; but when she washed mine it did not look so: I therefore tried oftentimes myself if I could not by washing make my face of the same co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour as my little play-mate (Mary), but it was all in vain; and I now began to be mortified at the difference in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions. This woman behaved to me with great kindness and attention; and taught me every thing in the same manner as she did her own child, and indeed in every respect treated me as such. I remained here till the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of the year 1757; when my master, being appointed first lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0324600501:133"/>
of his majesty's ship the Roe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buck, sent for Dick and me, and his old mate: on this we all left Guernsey, and set out for England in a sloop bound for London. As we were coming up towards the Nore, where the Roebuck lay, a man of war's boat came alongside to press our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; on which each man ran to hide himself. I was very much frightened at this, though I did not know what it meant, or what to think or do. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I went and hid myself also under a hencoop. Immediately afterwards the press-gang came on board with their swords drawn, and searched all about, pulled the people out by force, and put them into the boat. At last I was found out also; the man that found me held me up by the heels while they all made their sport of me, I roaring and crying out all the time most lustily; but at
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0324600501:134"/>
last the mate, who was my conductor, seeing this, came to my assistance, and did all he could to pacify me; but all to very little purpose, till I had seen the boat go off. soon afterwards we came to the Nore, where the Roebuck lay; and, to our great joy, my master came on board to us, and brought us to the ship. When I went on board this large ship, I was amazed indeed to see the quantity of men and the guns. However my surprise began to diminish as my knowledge increased; and I ceased to feel those apprehensions and alarms which had taken such strong possession of me when I first came among the Europeans, and for some time after. I began now to pass to an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite extreme; I was so far from being afraid of any thing new which I saw, that, after I had been some time in this ship, I even began to long for an engagement.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0324600501:135"/>
My griefs too, which in young minds are not perpetual, were now wearing away; and I soon enjoyed myself pretty well, and felt tolerably easy in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent situation. There was a number of boys on board, which still made it more agreeable; for we were always together, and a great part of our time was spent in play. I remained in this ship a considerable time, during which we made several cruises, and visited a variety of places: among others we were twice in Holland, and brought over several persons of distinction from it, whose names I do not now remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. On the passage, one day, for the diversion of those gentlemen, all the boys were called on the quarter deck, and were paired proportionably, and then made to fight; after which the gentlemen gave the combatants from five to nine shillings each. This was
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0324600501:136"/>
the first time I ever fought with a white boy; and I never knew what it was to have a bloody nose before. This made me fight most desperately; I suppose considerably more than an hour: and at last, both of us being weary, we were parted. I had a great deal of this kind of sport afterwards, in which the captain and the ship's company used very much to encourage me. some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time afterwards the ship went to Leith in scotland, and from thence to the Ork<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, where I was surprised in seeing scarcely any night: and from thence we sailed with a great fleet, full of soldiers, for England. All this time we had never come to an engagement, though we were frequently cruising off the coast of France: during which we chased many vessels, and took in all seventeen prizes. I had been learning many of the manoeuvres of the ship
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0324600501:137"/>
during our cruise; and I was several times made to fire the guns. One even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, off Havre de Grace, just as it was growing dark, we were standing off shore, and met with a fine large French-built frigate. We got all things immediately ready for fighting; and I now expected I should be gratified in seeing an engagement, which I had so long wished for in vain. But the very moment the word of command was given to fire, we heard those on board the other ship cry <q rend="inline">'Haul down the jib;'</q> and in that instant she hoisted English colours. There was instantly with us an amazing cry of—<q rend="inline">'Avast!'</q> or stop firing; and I think one or two guns had been let off, but happily they did no mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. We had hailed them several times; but they not hearing, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no answer, which was the cause of our firing. The boat was then sent
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0324600501:138"/>
on board of her, and she proved to be the Ambuscade man of war, to my no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>small disappointment. We returned to Portsmouth, without having been in any action, just at the trial of Admiral Byng (whom I saw several times dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it): and my master having left the ship, and gone to London for promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Dick and I were put on board the savage sloop of war, and we went in her to assist in bringing off the st. George man of war, that had ran ashore somewhere on the coast. After staying a few weeks on board the savage, Dick and I were sent on shore at Deal, where we remained some short time, till my master sent for us to London, the place I had long desired exceedingly to see. We therefore both with great pleasure got into a waggon, and came to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, where we were received by a Mr. Guerin, a relation of my master. This
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0324600501:139"/>
gentleman had two sisters, very ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ladies, who took much notice and great care of me. Though I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired so much to see London, when I arrived in it I was unfortunately unable to gratify my curiosity; for I had at this time the chilblains to such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that I could not stand for several months, and I was obliged to be sent to st. George's Hospital. There I grew so ill, that the doctors wanted to cut my left leg off at different times, apprehending a mortification; but I always said I would rather die than suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it; and happily (I thank God) I recovered without the operation. After being there several weeks, and just as I had recovered, the small pox broke out on me, so that I was again confined; and I thought myself now particularly unfortunate. However I soon reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered again; and by this time my
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0324600501:140"/>
master having been promoted to be first lieutenant of the Preston man of war of fifty guns, then new at Deptford, Dick and I were sent on board her, and soon after we went to Holland to bring over the late Duke of — to England.—While I was in this ship an incident happened, which, though trifling, I beg leave to relate, as I could not help taking particular notice of it, and considering it then as a judgment of God. One morning a young man was looking up to the fore-top, and in a wicked tone, common on shipboard, d—d his eyes about something. Just at the moment some small particles of dirt fell into his left eye, and by the evening it was very much inflamed. The next day it grew worse; and within six or seven days he lost it. From this ship, my master was appointed a lieutenant on board the Royal George.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0324600501:141"/>
When he was going he wished me to stay on board the Preston, to learn the French horn; but the ship being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered for Turkey I could not think of leaving my master, to whom I was very warmly attached; and I told him if he left me behind it would break my heart. This prevailed on him to take me with him; but he left Dick on board the Preston, whom I embraced at parting for the last time. The Royal George was the largest ship I had ever seen; so that when I came on board of her I was surprised at the number of people, men, women, and children, of every denomination; and the largeness of the guns, many of them also of brass, which I had never seen before. Here were also shops or stalls of every kind of goods, and people crying their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent commodities about the ship as in a town. To me it appeared a little
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0324600501:142"/>
world, into which I was again cast with out a friend, for I had no longer my dear companion Dick. We did not stay long here. My master was not many weeks on board before he got an appointment to be sixth lieutenant of the Namur, which was then at spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, fitting up for Vice-admiral Bosca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, who was going with a large fleet on an expedition against Louisburgh. The crew of the Royal George were turned over to her, and the flag of that gallant admiral was hoisted on board, the blue at the maintop gallant mast head. There was a very great fleet of men of war of every descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion assembled together for this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and I was in hopes soon to have an opportunity of being gratified with a sea-fight. All things being now in readiness, this mighty fleet (for there was also Admiral Cornish's fleet in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0324600501:143"/>
destined for the East Indies) at last weighed anchor, and failed. The two fleets continued in company for several days, and then parted; Admiral Cornish, in the Lenox, having first sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted our admiral in the Namur, which he returned. We then steered for America; but, by contrary winds, we were driven to Teneriffe, where I was struck with its noted peak. Its prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious height, and its form, resembling a sugar loaf, filled me with wonder. We remained in sight of this island some days, and then proceeded for America, which we soon made, and got into a very commodious harbour called st. George, in Halifax, where we had fish in great plenty, and all other fresh provisions. We were here joined by different men of war and transport ships with soldiers; after which, our fleet being increased to a
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0324600501:144"/>
prodigious number of ships of all kinds, we sailed for Cape Breton in Nova scotia. We had the good and gallant General Wolfe on board our ship, whose affability made him highly esteemed and beloved by all the men. He often honoured me, as well as other boys, with marks of his notice; and saved me once a flogging for fighting with a young gentleman. We arrived at Cape Breton in the summer of 1758: and here the soldiers were to be landed, in order to make an attack upon Louis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgh. My master had some part in superintending the landing; and here I was in a small measure gratified in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an encounter between our men and the enemy. The French were posted on the shore to receive us, and disputed our landing for a long time: but at last they were driven from their trenches, and a complete landing was effected. Our
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0324600501:145"/>
troops pursued them as far as the town of Louisbourgh. In this action many were killed on both sides. One thing remarkable I saw this day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—A lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Princess Amelia, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ho, as well as my master, superintended <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> landing, was giving the word of command, and while his mouth was oper a musquet ball went through it, and passed out at his check. I had that day in my hand the scalp of an indian king, who was killed in the engagement: the scalp had been taken off by an Highlander. I saw this king's ornaments too, which were very curious, and made of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>Our land forces laid siege to the town of Louisbourgh, while the French men of war were blocked up in the harbour by the fleet, the batteries at the same time playing upon them from the land. This they did with such effect, that one
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0324600501:146"/>
day I saw some of the ships set on fire by the shells from the batteries, and I believe two or three of them were quite burnt. At another time, about fifty boats belonging to the English men of war, commaded by Captain George Belfour of the Aetna fire ship, and Mr. Laforey another junior captain, attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and boarded the only two remaining French men of war in the harbour. They also set fire to a seventy-gun ship, but a sixty-four, called the Bienfaisant, they brought off. During my stay here I had often an opportunity of being near cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Belfour, who was pleased to notice me, and liked me so much that he often asked my master to let him have me, but he would not part with me; and no consideration could have induced me to leave him. At last Louisbourgh was taken, and the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish men of war came into the harbour
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0324600501:147"/>
before it, to my very great joy; for I had now more liberty of indulging my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and I went often on shore. When the ships were in the harbour we had the most beautiful procession on the water I ever saw. All the admirals and captains of the men of war, full dressed, and in their barges, well ornamented with pendants, came alongside of the Namur. The vice-admiral then went on shore in his barge, followed by the other officers in order of seniority, to take possession, as I suppose, of the town and fort. some time after this the French governor and his lady, and other persons of note, came on board our ship to dine. On this occasion our ships were dressed with colours of all kinds, from the topgallant-mast head to the deck; and this, with the firing of guns, formed a most grand and magnificent spectacle.</p>

               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:0324600501:148"/>
As soon as every thing here was settled, Admiral Boscawen sailed with part of the fleet for England, leaving some ships behind with Rear admirals sir Charles Hardy and Durell. It was now winter; and one evening, during our passage home, about dusk, when we were in the channel, or near sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and were beginning to look for land, we descried seven sail of large men of war, which stood off shore. several people on board of our ship said, as the two fleets were (in forty minutes from the first sight) within hail of each other, that they were English men of war; and some of our people even began to name some of the ships. By this time both fleets began to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, and our admiral ordered his flag to be hoisted. At that instant the other fleet, which were French, hoisted their ensigns, and gave us a broadside as they
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0324600501:149"/>
passed by. Nothing could create greater surprise and confusion among us than this: the wind was high, the sea rough, and we had our lower and middle deck guns housed in, so that not a single gun on board was ready te be fired at any of the French ships. However, the Royal William and the somerset, being our sternmost ships, became a little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and each gave the French ships a broadside as they passed by. I after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heard this was a French squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, commanded by Mons. Conflans; and certainly had the Frenchmen known our condition, and had a mind to fight us, they might have done us great mischief. But we were not long before we were prepared for an engagement. Immediately many things were tossed overboard; the ships were made ready for fighting as soon as possible; and about ten at night we had bent a new
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0324600501:150"/>
main sail, the old one being split. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now in readiness for fighting, we wore ship, and stood after the French fleet, who were one or two ships in number more than we. However we gave them chase, and continued pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them all night; and at day-light we saw six of them, all large ships of the line, and an English East Indiaman, a prize they had taken. We chased them all day till between three and four o'clock in the evening, when we came up with, and passed within a musquet shot of one seventy-four gun ship, and the Indiaman also, who now hoisted her colours, but immediately hauled them down again. On this we made a sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal for the other ships to take possession of her; and, supposing the man of war would likewise strike, we cheered, but she did not; though if we had fired into her, from being so near, we must have taken her. To my utter surprise,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0324600501:151"/>
the somerset, who was the next ship a-stern of the Namur, made way like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; and, thinking they were sure of this French ship, they cheered in the same manner, but still continued to follow us. The French Commodore was about a gun-shot ahead of all, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from us with all speed; and about four o'clock he carried his foretop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mast overboard. This caused another loud cheer with us; and a little after the topmast came close by us; but, to our great surprise, instead of coming up with her, we found she went as fast as ever, if not faster. The sea grew now much smoother; and the wind lulling, the seventy-four gun ship we had passed came again by us in the very same direction, and so near, that we heard her people talk as she went by; yet not a shot was fired on either side; and about five or six o'clock, just as it grew dark, she joined her
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0324600501:152"/>
commodore. We chased all night; but the next day we were out of sight, so that we saw no more of them; and we only had the old Indiaman (called Carnarvon I think) for our trouble. After this we stood in for the channel, and soon made the land; and, about the close of the year 1758-9, we got safe to st. Helen's. Here the Namur ran aground; and also another large ship astern of us; but, by starting our water, and tossing many things overboard to lighten her, we got the ships off without any damage. We stayed for a short time at spithead, and then went into Portsmouth harbour to refit: from whence the admiral went to London; and my master and I soon followed, with a press-gang, as we wanted some hands to complete our complement.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>IT was now between two and three years since I first came to England, a great part of which I had spent at sea; so that I became inured to that service, and began to consider myself as happily situated; for my master treated me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways extremely well; and my attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and gratitude to him were very great. From the various scenes I had
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0324600501:155"/>
beheld on ship-board, I soon grew a stranger to terror of every kind, and was, in that respect at least, almost an Englishman. I have often reflected with surprise that I never felt half the alarm at any of the numerous dangers I have been in, that I was silled with at the first sight of the Europeans, and at every act of theirs, even the most trifling, when I first came among them, and for some time afterwards. That fear, however, which was the effect of my ignorance, wore away as I began to know them. I could now speak English tolerably well, and I perfectly understood every thing that was said. I not only felt myself quite easy with these new countrymen, but relished their society and manners. I no longer looked upon them as spirits, but as men superior to us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had the stronger desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0324600501:156"/>
them; to imbibe their spirit, and imitate their manners; I therefore embraced every occasion of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and every new thing that I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served I treasured up in my memory. I had long wished to be able to read and write; and for this purpose I took every opportunity to gain instruction, but had made as yet very little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress. However, when I went to London with my master, I had soon an opportunity of improving myself, which I gladly embraced. shortly after my arrival, he sent me to wait upon the Miss Guerins, who had treated me with much kindness when I was there before; and they sent me to school.</p>
            <p>While I was attending these ladies, their servants told me I could not go to Heaven, unless I was baptized. This made me very uneasy; for I had now some faint idea of a future state:
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0324600501:157"/>
accordingly I communicated my anxiety to the eldest Miss Guerin, with whom I was become a favourite, and pressed her to have me baptized; when to my great joy, she told me I should. she had formerly asked my master to let me be baptized, but he had refused; however she now insisted on it; and he being under some obligation to her brother complied with her request; so I was baptized in st. Margaret's church, Westminster, in February 1759, by my present name. The clergyman at the same time, gave me a book, called a Guide to the Indians, written by the Bishop of sodor and Man. On this occasion, Miss Guerin did me the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to stand as godmother, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards gave me a treat. I used to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend these ladies about the town, in which service I was extremely happy; as I had thus many opportunities of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0324600501:158"/>
seeing London, which I desired of all things. I was sometimes, however, with my master at his rendezvous-house, which was at the foot of West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster-bridge. Here I used to enjoy myself in playing about the bridge stairs, and often in the watermen's wherries, with other boys. On one of these occasions there was another boy with me in a wherry, and we went out into the current of the river: while we were there, two more stout boys came to us in another wherry, and, abusing us for taking the boat, desired me to get into the other wherry-boat. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly I went to get out of the wherry I was in; but just as I had got one of my feet into the other boat, the boys shoved it off, so that I fell into the Thames; and, not being able to swim, I should unavoidably have been drowned, but for the assistance of some
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0324600501:159"/>
watermen who providentially came to my relief.</p>
            <p>The Namur being again got ready for sea, my master, with his gang, was ordered on board; and, to my no small grief, I was obliged to leave my school<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master, whom I liked very much, and always attended while I stayed in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, to repair on board with my master. Nor did I leave my kind pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronesses, the Miss Guerins, without uneasiness and regret. They often used to teach me to read, and took great pains to instruct me in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of religion and the knowledge of God. I therefore parted from those amiable ladies with reluctance: after receiving from them many friendly cautions how to conduct myself, and some valuable presents.</p>
            <p>When I came to spithead, I found we were destined for the Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0324600501:160"/>
with a large fleet, which was now ready to put to sea. We only waited for the arrival of the admiral, who soon came on board; and about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the spring 1759, having weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed anchor, and got under way, sailed for the Mediterranean; and in eleven days, from the Land's End, we got to Gibraltar. While we were here I used to be often on shore, and got various fruits in great plenty, and very cheap.</p>
            <p>I had frequently told several people, in my excursions on shore, the story of my being kidnapped with my sister, and of our being separated, as I have related before; and I had as often expressed my anxiety for her fate, and my sorrow at having never met her again. One day, when I was on shore, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning these circumstances to some persons, one of them told me he knew
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0324600501:161"/>
where my sister was, and, if I would accompany him, he would bring me to her. Improbable as this story was, I believed it immediately, and agreed to go with him, while my heart leaped for joy; and, indeed, he conducted me to a black young woman, who was so like my sister, that at first sight, I really thought it was her: but I was quickly undeceived; and, on talking to her, I found her to be of another nation.</p>
            <p>While we lay here the Preston came in from the Levant. As soon as she arrived, my master told me I should now see my old companion, Dick, who was gone in her when she sailed for Turkey. I was much rejoiced at this news, and expected every minute to embrace him; and when the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain came on board of our ship, which he did immediately after, I ran to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after my friend; but, with inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0324600501:162"/>
sorrow, I learned from the boat's crew that the dear youth was dead! and that they had brought his chest, and all his other things, to my master: these he afterwards gave to me, and I regarded them as a memorial of my friend, whom I loved, and grieved for, as a brother.</p>
            <p>While we were at Gibralter, I saw a soldier hanging by the heels, at one of the moles<note n="*" place="bottom">He had drowned himself in endeavouring to desert.</note>: I thought this a strange sight, as I had seen a man hanged in London by his neck. At another time I saw the master of a frigate towed to shore on a grating, by several of the men of war's boats, and discharged the fleet, which I understood was a mark of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace for cowardice. On board the same ship there was also a sailor hung up at the yard-arm.</p>
            <p>After lying at Gibralter for some
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0324600501:163"/>
time, we sailed up the Mediterranean a considerable way above the Gulf of Eyons; where we were one night overtaken with a terrible gale of wind, much greater than any I had ever yet experienced. The sea ran so high that, though all the guns were well housed, there was great reason to fear their getting loose, the ship rolled so much; and if they had it must have proved our destruction. After we had cruised here for a short time, we came to Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celona, a spanish sea-port, remarkable for its silk manufactures. Here the ships were all to be watered; and my master, who spoke different languages, and used often to interpret for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, superintended the watering of ours. For that purpose he and the officers of the other ships, who were on the same service, had tents pitched in the bay; and the spanish soldiers were stationed along the shore, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0324600501:164"/>
to see that no depredations were committed by our men.</p>
            <p>I used constantly to attend my mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and I was charmed with this place. All the time we stayed it was like a fair with the natives, who brought us fruits of all kinds, and sold them to us much cheaper than I got them in England. They used also to bring wine down to us in hog and sheep skins, which diverted me very much. The spanish officers here treated our officers with great politeness and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and some of them, in particular, used to come often to my master's tent to visit him; where they would some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times divert themselves by mounting me on the horses or mules, so that I could not fall, and setting them off at full gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop; my imperfect skill in horsemanship all the while affording them no small entertainment. After the ships were
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0324600501:165"/>
watered, we returned to our old sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of cruizing off Toulon, for the purpose of intercepting a fleet of French men of war that lay there. One sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, in our cruise, we came off a place where there were two small French fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates lying in shore; and our admiral, thinking to take or destroy them, sent two ships in after them—the Culloden and the Conqueror. They soon came up to the Frenchmen; and I saw a smart fight here, both by sea and land: for the frigates were covered by bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, and they played upon our ships most furiously, which they as furiously returned, and for a long time a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant firing was kept up on all sides at an amazing rate. At last one frigate sunk; but the people escaped, though not without much difficulty: and a little after some of the people left the other frigate also, which was a mere
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0324600501:166"/>
wreck. However, our ships did not venture to bring her away, they were so much annoyed from the batteries, which raked them both in going and coming: their topmasts were shot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and they were otherwise so much shattered, that the admiral was obliged to send in many boats to tow them back to the fleet. I afterwards sailed with a man who fought in one of the French batteries during the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and he told me our ships had done considerable mischief that day on shore and in the batteries.</p>
            <p>After this we sailed for Gibraltar, and arrived there about August 1759. Here we remained with all our sails un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent, while the fleet was watering and doing other necessary things. While we were in this situation, one day the admiral, with most of the principal of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and many people of all stations,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0324600501:167"/>
being on shore, about seven o'clock in the evening we were alarmed by signals from the frigates stationed for that purpose; and in an instant there was a general cry that the French fleet was out, and just passing through the streights. The admiral immediately came on board with some other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers; and it is impossible to describe the noise, hurry and confusion through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole fleet, in bending their sails and slipping their cables; many people and ships' boats were left on shore in the bustle. We had two captains on board of our ship who came away in the hurry and left their ships to follow. We shewed lights from the gun-wales to the main top mast-head; and all our lieutenants were employed amongst the fleet to tell the ships not to wait for ther captains, but to put the sails to the yards, slip their cables
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0324600501:168"/>
and follow us; and in this confusion of making ready for fighting, we set out for sea in the dark after the French fleet. Here I could have exclaimed with Ajax,<q>
                  <l>"Oh Jove! O father! if it be thy will</l>
                  <l>"That we must perish, we thy will obey,</l>
                  <l>"But let us perish by the light of day."</l>
               </q> They had got the start of us so far that we were not able to come up with them during the night; but at day-light we saw seven sail of the line of battle some miles ahead. We immediately chased them till about four o'clock in the evening, when our ships came up with them; and, though we were about fifteen large ships, our gallant admiral only fought them with his own division, which consisted of seven; so that we were just ship for ship. We passed by the whole of the enemy's fleet in order to come at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0324600501:169"/>
Mons. La Clue, who was in the Ocean, an eighty-four gun ship. as we passed they all fired on us; and at one time three of them fired together, continuing to do so for some time. Notwithstanding which our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral would not suffer a gun to be fired at any of them, to my astonishment; but made us lie on our bellies on the deck till we came quite close to the Ocean, who was ahead of them all; when we had orders to pour the whole three tiers into her at once.</p>
            <p>The engagement now commenced with great fury on both sides: the Ocean immediately returned our fire, and we continued engaged with each other for some time; during which I was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently stunned with the thundering of the great guns, whose dreadful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents hurried many of my companions into awful eternity. At last the French
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0324600501:170"/>
line was entirely broken, and we obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the victory, which was immediately proclaimed with loud huzzas and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations. We took three prizes, La Modeste, of sixty-four guns, and Le Temeraire and Centaur, of seventy-four guns each. The rest of the French ships took to flight with all the sail they could crowd. Our ship being very much damaged, and quite disabled from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing the enemy, the admiral imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately quitted her, and went in the broken and only boat we had left on board the Newark, with which, and some other ships, he went after the French. The Ocean, and another large French ship, called the Redoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, endeavouring to escape, ran ashore at Cape Logas, on the coast of Portugal; and the French admiral and some of the crew got ashore; but we, finding it impossible to get the ships
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0324600501:171"/>
off, set fire to them both. About midnight I saw the Ocean blow up, with a most dreadful explosion. I never beheld a more awful scene. In less than a minute, the midnight for a certain space seemed turned into day by the blaze, which was attended with a noise louder and more terrible than thunder, that seemed to rend every element around us.</p>
            <p>My station during the engagement was on the middle-deck, where I was quartered with another boy, to bring powder to the aftermost gun; and here I was a witness of the dreadful fate of many of my companions, who, in the twinkling of an eye, were dashed in pieces, and launched into eternity. Happily I escaped unhurt, though the shot and splinters flew thick about me during the whole fight. Towards the latter part of it my master was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0324600501:172"/>
and I saw him carried down to the surgeon; but though I was much alarmed for him and wished to assist him I dared not leave my post. At this station my gun-mate (a partner in bringing powder for the same gun) and I ran a very great risk for more than half an hour of blowing up the ship. For, when we had taken the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges out of the boxes, the bottoms of many of them proving rotten, the powder ran all about the deck, near the match tub: we scarcely had water enough at the last to throw on it. We were also, from our employment, very much exposed to the enemy's shots; for we had to go through nearly the whole length of the ship to bring the powder. I expected therefore every minute to be my last; especially when I saw our men fall so thick about me; but, wishing to guard as much against
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0324600501:173"/>
the dangers as possible, at first I thought it would be safest not to go for the powder till the Frenchmen had fired th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> roadside; and then, while they were charging, I could go and come wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>  powder: but immediately after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I thought this caution was fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less; and, cheering myself with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection that there was a time allotted for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>to die as well as to be born, I instantly cast off all fear or thought whatever of death, and went through the whole of my duty with alacrity; pleasing myself with the hope, if I sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived the battle, of relating it and the dangers I had escaped to the Miss Guerins, and others, when I should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to London.</p>
            <p>Our ship suffered very much in this engagement; for, besides the number of our killed and wounded, she was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most torn to pieces, and our rigging so
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0324600501:174"/>
much shattered, that our mizen-mast, main-yard, &amp;c. hung over the side of the ship; so that we were obliged to get many carpenters, and others from some of the ships of the fleet, to assist in setting us in some tolerable or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and, notwithstanding which, it took us some time before we were complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refitted; after which we lest Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Broderick to command, and we, with the prizes steered for England. On the passage, and as soon as my master was something recovered of his wounds, the admiral appointed him captain of the Aetna fire-ship, on which he and I left the Namur, and went on board of her at sea. I liked this little ship very much. I now became the captain's steward, in which situation I was very happy: for I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely well treated by all on board; and I had leisure to improve myself in
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0324600501:175"/>
reading and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3+ letters">
                  <desc>•••…</desc>
               </gap>ing. The latter I had learned a little of before I left the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, as there was a school on board. When we arrived at spithead, the Aetna went into Portsmouth harbour to refit, which being done, we returned to spichead and joined a large fleet that was thought to be intended against the Havannah; but about that time the king died; whether that prevented the expedition I know not; but it caused our ship to be stationed at Cowes, in the isle of Wight, till the beginning of the year sixty-one. Here I spent my time very pleasantly; I was much on shore all about this delightful island, and found the inhabitants very civil.</p>
            <p>While I was here, I met with a trifling incident, which surprised me agreeably. I was one day in a field belonging to a gentleman who had a black boy about my own size; this boy
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0324600501:176"/>
having observed me from his master's house, was transported at the sight of one of his own countrymen, and ran to meet me with the utmost haste. I not knowing what he was about, turned a little out of his way at first, but to no purpose: he soon came close to me and caught hold of me in his arms as if I had been his brother, though we had never seen each other before. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we had talked together for some time he took me to his master's house, where I was treated very kindly. This benevolent boy and I were very happy in frequently seeing each other till about the month of March 1761, when our ship had orders to fit out again for another expedition. When we got ready, we joined a very large fleet at spithead, commanded by Commodore Keppel, which was destined against Belle-Isle, and with a number of trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0324600501:177"/>
ships with troops on board to make a descent on the place, we sailed once more in quest of fame. I longed to engage in new adventures and see fresh wonders.</p>
            <p>I had a mind on which every thing uncommon made its full impression, and every event which I considered as marvellous. Every extraordinary escape, or signal deliverance, either of myself or others, I looked upon to be effected by the interposition of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. We had not been above ten days at sea before an incident of this kind happened; which, whatever cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit it may obtain from the reader, made no small impression on my mind.</p>
            <p>We had on board a gunner, whose name was John Mondle; a man of very indifferent morals. This man's cabin was between the decks, exactly over where I lay, abreast of the quarter-deck
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0324600501:178"/>
ladder. One night, the 5th of April, being terrified with a dream, he awoke in so great a fright that he could not rest in his bed any longer, nor even remain in his cabin; and he went upon deck about four o'clock in the morning extremely agitated. He immediately told those on the deck of the agonies of his mind, and the dream which occasioned it; in which he said he had seen many things very awful, and had been warned by st. Peter to repent, who told him time was short. This he said had greatly alarmed him, and he was determined to alter his life. People generally mock the fears of others when they are themselves in safety; and some of his shipmates who heard him only laughed at him. However, he made a vow that he never would drink strong liquors again; and he immediately got a light, and gave away his sea-stores
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0324600501:179"/>
of liquor. After which, his agitation still continuing, he began to read the scriptures, hoping to find some relief; and soon afterwards he laid himself down again on his bed, and endeavoured to compose himself to sleep, but to no purpose; his mind still continuing in a state of agony. By this time it was exactly half after seven in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: I was then under the half-deck at the great cabin door; and all at once I heard the people in the waist cry out, most fearfully—<q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'The Lord have mercy upon us! We are all lost! The Lord have mercy upon us!'</q> Mr. Mondle hearing the cries, immediately ran out of his cabin; and we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly struck by the Lynne, a forty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun ship, Captain Clark, which nearly ran us down. This ship had just put about, and was by the wind, but had not got full headway, or we must all
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0324600501:180"/>
have perished; for the wind was brisk. However, before Mr Mondle had got four steps from his cabin door, she struck our ship with her cutwater right in the middle of his bed and cabin, and ran it up to the combings of the quarter deck hatchway, and above three feet below water, and in a minute there was not a bit of wood to be seen where Mr. Mondle's cabin stood; and he was so near being killed that some of the splinters tore his face. As Mr. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle must inevitably have perished from this accident had he not been alarmed in the very extraordinary way I have related, I could not help regarding this as an awful interposition of Providence for his preservation. The two ships for some time swinged alongside of each other; for ours being a fireship, our grappling-irons caught the Lynne every way, and the yards and rigging
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0324600501:181"/>
went at an astonishing rate. Our ship was in such a shocking condition that we all thought she would instantly go down, and every one ran for their lives, and got as well as they could on board the Lynne; but our lieutenant being the aggressor, he never quitted the ship. However, when we found she did not sink immediately, the captain came on board again, and encouraged our people to return and try to save her. Many on this came back, but some would not venture. some of the ships in the fleet, seeing our situation; immediately sent their boats to our as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance; but it took us the whole day to save the ship with all their help. And by using every possible means, particularly frapping her together with many hawsers, and putting a great quantity of tallow below water where she was damaged, she was kept to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0324600501:182"/>
but it was well we did not meet with any gales of wind, or we must have gone to pieces; for we were in such a crazy condition that we had ships to attend us till we arrived at Belle-Isle, the place of our destination; and then we had all things taken out of the ship, and she was properly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired. This escape of Mr. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, which he, as well as myself, always considered as a singular act of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, I believe had a great influence on his life and conduct ever afterwards.</p>
            <p>Now that I am on this subject I beg leave to relate another instance or two which strongly raised my belief of the particular interposition of Heaven, and which might not otherways have found a place here, from their insignificance. I belonged for a few days in the year 1758, to the Jason, of fifty-four guns, at Plymouth; and one night, when I
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0324600501:183"/>
was on board, a woman, with a child at her breast, fell from the upper-deck down into the hold, near the keel. Every one thought that the mother and child must be both dashed to pieces; but, to our great surprise, neither of them was hurt. I myself one day fell headlong from the upper-deck of the Aetna down the after-hold, when the ballast was out; and all who saw me fall cried out I was killed: but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not the least injury. And in the same ship a man fell from the mast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head on the deck without being hurt. In these, and in many more instances, I thought I could plainly trace the hand of God, without whose permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion a sparrow cannot fall. I began to raise my fear from man to him alone, and to call daily on his holy name with fear and reverence: and I trust he heard my supplications, and graciously
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0324600501:184"/>
condescended to answer me according to his holy word, and to implant the seeds of piety in me, even one of the meanest of his creatures.</p>
            <p>When we had refitted our ship, and all things were in readiness for attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the place, the troops on board the transports were ordered to disembark; and my master as a junior captain, had a share in the command of the landing. This was on the 12th of April. The French were drawn up on the shore, and had made every dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to oppose the landing of our men, only a small part of them this day being able to effect it; most of them, after fighting with great bravery, were cut off; and General Crawford, with a number of others, were taken prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. In this day's engagement we had also our lieutenant killed.</p>
            <p>On the 21st of April we renewed our
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0324600501:185"/>
efforts to land the men, while all the men of war were stationed along the shore to cover it, and fired at the French batteries and breast works from early in the morning till about four o'clock in the evening, when our sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers effected a safe landing. They immediately attacked the French; and, after a sharp encounter, forced them from the batteries. Before the enemy retreated they blew up several of them, lest they should fall into our hands. Our men now proceeded to besiege the citadel, and my master was ordered on shore to superintend the landing of all the materials necessary for carrying on the siege; in which service I mostly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him. While I was there I went about to different parts of the island; and one day, particularly, my curiosity almost cost me my life. I wanted very much to see the mode of charging the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0324600501:186"/>
mortars and letting off the shells, and for that purpose I went to an English battery that was but a very few yards from the walls of the citadel. There, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I had an opportunity of completely gratifying myself in seeing the whole operation, and that not without run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a very great risk, both from the English shells that burst while I was there, but likewise from those of the French. One of the largest of their shells bursted within nine or ten yards of me: there was a single rock close by, about the size of a butt; and I got instant shelter under it in time to avoid the fury of the shell. Where it burst the earth was torn in such a manner that two or three butts might easily have gone into the hole it made, and it threw great quantities of stones and dirt to a considerable distance. Three shot were also fired at me and another
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0324600501:187"/>
boy who was along with me, one of them in particular seemed<q>
                  <l>"Wing'd with red lightning and impetuous rage;"</l>
               </q> for with a most dreadfull sound it hissed close by me, and struck a rock at a little distance, which it shattered to pieces. When I saw what perilous circumstances I was in, I attempted to return the nearest way I could find, and thereby I got between the English and the French centinels. An English serjeant, who commanded the outposts, seeing me, and surprised how I came there, (which was by stealth along the seashore), reprimanded me very severely for it, and instantly took the centinel off his post into custody, for his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence in suffering me to pass the lines. While I was in this situation I observed at a little distance a French horse, belonging to some islanders, which I thought I would now mount,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0324600501:188"/>
for the greater expedition of getting off Accordingly I took some cord which I had about me, and making a kind of bridle of it, I put it round the horse's head, and the tame beast very quietly suffered me to tie him thus and mount him. As soon as I was on the horse's back I began to kick and beat him, and try every means to make him go quick, but all to very little purpose: I could not drive him out of a slow pace. While I was creeping along, still within reach of the enemy's shot, I met with a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant well mounted on an English horse, I immediately stopped; and, crying, told him my case; and begged of him to help me, and this he effectually did; for, having a fine large whip, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to lash my horse with it so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely, that he set off full speed with me towards the sea, while I was quite unable to hold or manage him. In
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0324600501:189"/>
this manner I went along till I came to a craggy precipice. I now could not stop my horse; and my mind was filled with apprehensions of my deplor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fate should he go down the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice, which he appeared fully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to do: I therefore thought I had better throw myself off him at once, which I did immediately with a great deal of dexterity, and fortunately escap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unhurt. As soon as I found my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self at liberty I made the best of my way for the ship, determined I would not be so fool-hardy again in a hurry.</p>
            <p>We continued to besiege the citadel till June, when it surrendered. During the siege I have counted above sixty shells and carcases in the air at once. When this place was taken I went through the citadel, and in the bomb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs under it, which were cut in the solid rock; and I thought it a surprising
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0324600501:190"/>
place, both for strength and building: notwithstanding which our shots and shells had made amazing devastation, and ruinous heaps all around it.</p>
            <p>After the taking of this island, our ships with some others commanded by commodore stanhope in the swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, went to Basse-road, where we blocked up a French fleet. Our ships were there from June till February fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; and in that time I saw a great many scenes of war, and stratagems on both sides to destroy each others fleet. sometimes we would attack the French with some ships of the line; at other times with boats; and frequently we made prizes. Once or twice the French attacked us by throwing shells with their bomb-vessels; and one day as a French vessel was throwing shells at our ships she broke from her springs, behind the isle of I de Re: the tide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0324600501:191"/>
complicated, she came within a gun shot of the Nassau; but the Nassau could not bring a gun to bear upon her, and thereby the Frenchman got off. We were twice attacked by their fire floats, which they chained together, and then let them float down with the tide; but each time we sent boats with graplings, and towed them safe out of the fleet.</p>
            <p>We had different commanders while we were at this place, Commodores stanhope, Dennis, Lord Howe, &amp;c. From hence, before the spanish war began, our ship and the Wasp sloop were sent to st. sebastian in spain, by Commodore stanhope; and Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore Dennis afterwards sent our ship as a cartel to Bayonne in France<note n="*" place="bottom">Among others whom we brought from Bayonne, were two gentlemen, who had been in the West Indies, where they sold slaves; and they confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed they had made at one time a false bill of sale, and sold two Portuguese white men among a lot of slaves.</note>, after

One day while we were at Bayonne, Mr. Mondle saw one of our men, as he thought, in the gun-room; and a little after, coming on the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-deck, he spoke of some circumstances of this man to some of the officers. They told him that he man was then out of the ship, in one of the coats with the Lieutenant: but Mr. Mondle would not believe it, and we searched the ship, when he found the man was actually out of her; and when the boat returned some time after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, we found the man had been drowned at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>After our ship was fitted out again for service, in september she went to Guernsey, where I was very glad to see
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0324600501:193"/>
my old hostess, who was now a widow, and my former little charming com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, her daughter. I spent some time here very happily with them, till October, when we had orders to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to Portsmouth. We parted from each other with a great deal of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and I promised to return soon, and see them again; not knowing what all-powerful fate had determined for me. Our ship having arrived at Ports<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, we went into the harbour, and remained there till the latter end of November, when we heard great talk about a peace; and, to our very great joy, in the beginning of December we had orders to go up to London with our ship to be paid off. We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this news with loud huzzas, and every other demonstration of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and nothing but mirth was to be seen throughout every part of the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0324600501:194"/>
ship. I too was not without my share of the general joy on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. I thought now of nothing but being freed, and working for myself, and thereby getting money to enable me to get a good education; for I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had a great desire to be able at least to read and write; and while I was on ship-board I had endeavoured to improve myself in both. While I was in the Aetna particularly, the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's clerk taught me to write, and gave me a smattering of arithmetic as far as the rule of three. There was also one Daniel Queen, about forty years of age, a man very well educat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who messed with me on board this ship, and he likewise dressed and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the captain. Fortunately this man soon became very much attached to me, and took very great pains to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct me in many things. He taught
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0324600501:195"/>
me to shave and dress hair a little, and also to read in the Bible, explaining many passages to me, which I did not comprehend. I was wonderfully sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised to see the laws and rules of my own country written almost exactly here; a circumstance which I believe tended to impress our manners and customs more deeply on my memory. I used to tell him of this resemblance; and many a time we have sat up the whole night together at this employment. In short, he was like a father to me; and some even used to call me after his name; they also styled me the black Christian. Indeed I almost lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with the affection of a son. Many things I have denied myself that he might have them; and when I used to play at marbles or any other game, and won a few halfpence, or got any little money, which I some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0324600501:196"/>
did, for shaving any one, I used to buy him a little sugar or tobacco, as far as my stock of money would go. He used to say, that he and I never should part; and that when our ship was paid off, as I was as free as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self or any other man on board, he would instruct me in his business, by which I might gain a good livelihood. This gave me new life and spirits; and my heart burned within me, while I thought the time long till I obtained my freedom. For though my master had not promised it to me, yet, besides the assurances I had received that he had no right to detain me, he always treated me with the greatest kindness, and reposed in me an unbounded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence; he even paid attention to my morals; and would never suffer me to deceive him, or tell lies, of which he used to tell me the consequences; and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0324600501:197"/>
that if I did so God would not love me; so that from all this tenderness, I had never once supposed, in all my dreams of freedom, that he would think of detaining me any longer than I wished.</p>
            <p>In pursuance of our orders we sailed from Portsmouth for the Thames, and arrived at Deptford the 10th of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, where we cast anchor just as it was high water. The ship was up about half an hour, when my master ordered the barge to be manned; and all in an instant, without having before given me the least reason to suspect any thing of the matter, he forced me into the barge; saying, I was going to leave him, but he would take care I should not. I was so struck with the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedness of this proceeding, that for some time I did not make a reply, only I made an offer to go for my
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0324600501:198"/>
books and chest of clothes, but he swore I should not move out of his sight; and if I did he would cut my throat, at the same time taking his hanger. I began, however, to collect myself; and, plucking up courage, I told him I was free, and he could not by law serve me so. But this only enraged him the more; and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to swear, and said he would soon let me know whether he would or not, and at that instant sprung him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into the barge from the ship, to the astonishment and sorrow of all on board. The tide, rather unluckily for me, had just turned downward, so that we quickly fell down the river along with it, till we came among some out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward-bound West Indiamen; for he was resolved to put me on board the first vessel he could get to receive me. The boat's crew, who pulled against
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0324600501:199"/>
their will, became quite faint disserent times, and would have gone ashore; but he would not let them. some of them strove then to cheer me, and told me he could not sell me, and that they would stand by me, which revived me a little; and I still entertained hopes; for as they pulled along he asked some vessels to receive me, but they would not. But, just as we had got a little below Gravesend, we came alongside of a ship which was going away the next tide for the West Indies; her name was the Charming sally, Captain James Doran; and my master went on board and agreed with him for me; and in a little time I was sent sor into the cabin. When I came there Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Doran asked me if I knew him: I answered that I did not; <q rend="inline">'Then,'</q> said he, <q rend="inline margQuotes">'you are now my slave.'</q> I told him my master could not sell me
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0324600501:200"/>
to him, nor to any one else. <q rend="inline">'Why,'</q> said he, <q rend="inline margQuotes">'did not your master buy you?'</q> I confessed he did. <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'But I have served him,'</q> said I, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'many years, and he has taken all my wages and prize-money, for I only got one sixpence during the war; besides this I have been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; and by the laws of the land no man has a right to sell me:'</q> And I added, that I had heard a lawyer and others at different times tell my master so. They both then said that those people who told me so were not my friends; but I replied—<q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'It was very extraordinary that other people did not know the law as well as they.'</q> Upon this Captain Doran said I talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too much English; and if I did not behave myself well, and be quiet, he had a method on board to make me. I was too well convinced of his power over me to doubt what he said;
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0324600501:201"/>
and my former sufferings in the slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship presenting themselves to my mind, the recollection of them made me shudder. However, before I retired I told them that as I could not get any right among men here I hoped I should hereafter in Heaven; and I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately left the cabin, filled with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment and sorrow. The only coat I had with me my master took away with him, and said, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">"If your prize-money had been 10,000l. I had a right to it all, and would have taken it.'</q> I had about nine guineas, which, during my long sea-faring life, I had scraped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether from trifling perquisites and little ventures; and I hid it that instant, lest my master should take that from me likewise, still hoping that by some means or other I should make my escape to the snore; and indeed some of my old snipmates told me not to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0324600501:202"/>
despair, for they would get me back again; and that, as soon as they could get their pay, they would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately come to Portsmouth to me, where this ship was going: but, alas! all my hopes were baffled, and the hour of my deliverance was as yet far off. My master, having soon concluded his bargain with the captain, came out of the cabin, and he and his people got into the boat and put off; I followed them with aching eyes as long as I could, and when they were out of sight I threw myself on the deck, with a heart ready to burst with ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and anguish.</p>

            <p>THUs, at the moment I expected all my toils to end, was I plunged, as I supposed, in a new slavery; in comparison of which all my service hitherto
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0324600501:204"/>
had been perfect freedom; and whose horrors, always present to my mind, now rushed on it with tenfold aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. I wept very bitterly for some time: and began to think that I must have done something to displease the Lord, that he thus punished me so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely. This filled me with painful reflections on my past conduct; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected that on the morning of our arrival at Deptford I had rashly sworn that as soon as we reached London I would spend the day in rambling and sport. My conscience smote me for this unguarded expression: I felt that the Lord was able to disappoint me in all things, and immediately consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my present situation as a judgment of Heaven on account of my presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in swearing: I therefore, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition of heart, acknowledged my transgression to God, and poured out

my soul before him with unfeigned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and with earnest supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I besought him not to abandon me in my distress, nor cast me from his mercy for ever. In a little time my grief, spent with its own violence, began to subside; and after the first confusion of my thoughts was over I reflected with more calmness on my present condition: I considered that trials and disappointments are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for our good, and I thought God might perhaps have permitted this in order to teach me wisdom and resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for he had hitherto shadowed me with the wings of his mercy, and by his invisible but powerful hand brought me the way I knew not. These re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections gave me a little comfort, and I rose at last from the deck with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and sorrow in my countenance, yet mixed with some faint hope that
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0324600501:206"/>
the <hi>Lord would appear</hi> for my deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</p>
            <p>soon afterwards, as my new master was going on shore, he called me to him, and told me to behave myself well, and do the business of the ship the same as any of the rest of the boys, and that I should sare the better for it; but I made him no answer. I was then asked If I could swim, and I said, No, How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I was made to go under the deck, and was well watched. The next tide the ship got under way, and soon after arrived at the Mother Bank, Portsmouth; where she waited a few days for some of the West India convoy. While I was here I tried every means I could devise amongst the people of the ship to get me a boat from the shore, as there was none suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to come alongside of the ship; and their own, whenever it was used,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0324600501:207"/>
was hoisted in again immediately. A sailor on board took a guinea from me on pretence of getting me a boat; and promised me, time after time, that it was hourly to come off. When he had the watch upon deck I watched also; and looked long enough, but all in vain; I could never see either the boat or my guinea again. And what I thought was still the worst of all, the fellow gave information, as I after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards found, all the while to the mates, of my intention to go off, if I could in any way do it; but, rogue like, he never told them he had got a guinea from me to procure my es<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>e. However, after we had sailed, and his trick was made known to the ship's crew, I had some satisfacti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>•••…</desc>
               </gap> by them all for his behaviour to me. I was still in hopes that my old shipmates would
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0324600501:208"/>
not forget heir promise to come for me to Portsmouth: and, indeed, at last, but not till the day before we sailed, some of them did come there, and sent me off some oranges, and other tokens of their regard. They also sent me word they would come off to me themselves the next day or the day after; and a lady also, who lived in Gosport, wrote to me that she would come and take me out of the ship at the same time. This lady had been once very intimate with my former master: I used to sell and take care of a great deal of property for her, in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ships; and in return she always shewed great friendship for me, and used to tell my master that she would take me away to live with her: but, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately for me, a disagreement soon afterwards took place between them; and she was succeeded in my master's
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0324600501:209"/>
good graces by another lady, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared sole mistress of the Aetna, and mostly lodged on board. I was not so great a favourite with this lady as with the former; she had conceived a pique against me on some occasion when she was on board, and she did not fail to instigate my master to treat me in the manner he did<note n="*" place="bottom">Thus was I sacrificed to the envy and resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this woman for knowing that the lady whom she had succeeded in my master's good graces designed to take me into her service; which, had I once got on shore, she would not have been able to present. she felt her pride alarmed at the superiority of her rival in being attended by a black servant: it was not less to prevent this than to be revenged on me, that she caused the captain to treat me thus cruelly.</note>.</p>
            <p>However, the next morning, the 30th of December, the wind being brisk and easterly, the Aeolus frigate, which was to escort the convoy, made a signal for failing. All the ships
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0324600501:210"/>
then got up their anchors; and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any of my friends had an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to come off to my relief, to my inexpressible anguish our ship had got under way. What tumultuous emotions agitated my soul when the convoy got under sail, and I a prisoner on board, now without hope! I kept my swimming eyes upon the land in a state of unutterable grief; not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what to do, and despairing how to help myself. While my mind was in this situation the fleet sailed on, and in one day's time I lost sight of the wished-for land. In the first expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of my grief I reproached my fate, and wished I had never been born. I was ready to curse the tide that bore us, the gale that wasted my prison, and even the ship that conducted us; and I called on death to relieve me from the horrors I felt and dreaded,

The turbulence of my emotions how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever naturally gave way to calmer thoughts, and I soon perceived what fate had decreed no mortal on earth could prevent. The convoy sailed on without any accident, with a pleasant gale and smooth sea, for six weeks, till February, when one morning the Aeolus ran down a brig, one of the convoy, and she instantly went down and was ingulfed in the dark recesses of the ocean. The convoy was immediately thrown into great confusion till it was day-light; and the Aeolus was illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined with lights to prevent any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mischief.

At the sight of this land of bondage, a fresh horror ran through all my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ame, and chilled me to the heart. My for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer slavery now rose in dreadful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view to my mind, and displayed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but misery, stripes, and chains; and, in the first paroxysm of my grief, I called upon God's thunder, and his avenging power, to direct the stroke of death to me, rather than permit me to become a slave, and be sold from lord to lord.</p>
            <p>In this state of my mind our ship came to an anchor, and soon after dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged her cargo. I now knew what it was to work hard; I was made to help to unload and load the ship. And, to comfort me in my distress in that time, two of the sailors robbed me of all my money, and ran away from the ship. I had been so long used to an European climate, that at
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0324600501:214"/>
first I felt the scorching West India sun very painful, while the dashing surf would toss the boat and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in it frequently above high water mark. sometimes our limbs were broken with this, or even attended with instant death, and I was day by day mangled and torn.</p>
            <p>About the middle of May, when the ship was got ready to sail for England, I all the time believing that Fate's blackest clouds were gathering over my head, and expecting their bursting would mix me with the dead, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Doran sent for me ashore one morning, and I was told by the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger that my fate was then deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. With trembling steps and fluttering heart I came to the captain, and found with him one Mr. Robert King, a quaker, and the first merchant in the place. The captain then told
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0324600501:215"/>
me my former master had sent me there to be sold; but that he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired him to get me the best master he could, as he told him I was a very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving boy, which Captain Doran said he found to be true; and if he were to stay in the West Indies he would be glad to keep me himself; but he could not venture to take me to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, for he was very sure that when I came there I would leave him. I at that instant burst out a crying, and begged much of him to take me to England with him, but all to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. He told me he had got me the very best master in the whole island, with whom I should be as happy as if I were in England, and for that reason he chose to let him have me, though he could sell me to his own brother-in-law for a great deal more money than what he got from this gentleman.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0324600501:216"/>
Mr. King, my new master, then made a reply, and said the reason he had bought me was on account of my good character; and, as he had not the least doubt of my good behaviour, I should be very well off with him. He also told me he did not live in the West Indies, but at Philadelphia, where he was going soon; and, as I understood something of the rules of arithmetic, when we got there he would put me to school, and fit me for a clerk. This conversation relieved my mind a little, and I left those gentlemen considerably more at ease in myself than when I came to them; and I was very thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Captain Doran, and even to my old master, for the character they had given me; a character which I after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards found of infinite service to me. I went on board again, and took leave of all my shipmates; and the next day
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0324600501:217"/>
the ship sailed. When she weighed anchor I went to the waterside and looked at her with a very wishful and aching heart, and followed her with my eyes until she was totally out of sight. I was so bowed down with grief that I could not hold up my head for many months; and if my new master had not been kind to me I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I should have died under it at last. And indeed I soon found that he fully deserved the good character which Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Doran had given me of him; for he possessed a most amiable disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and temper, and was very chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and humane. If any of his slaves behaved amiss he did not beat or use them ill, but parted with them. This made them afraid of disobliging him; and as he treated his slaves better than any other man on the island, so he was better and more faithfully served
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0324600501:218"/>
by them in return. By this kind treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I did at last endeavour to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose myself; and with fortitude, though moneyless, determined to face what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever fate had decreed for me. Mr. King soon asked me what I could do; and at the same time said he did not mean to treat me as a common slave. I told him I knew something of sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship, and could shave and dress hair pretty well; and I could refine wines, which I had learned on ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, where I had often done it; and that I could write, and understood arithmetic tolerably well as far as the Rule of Three. He then asked me if I knew any thing of gauging; and, on my answering that I did not, he said one of his clerks should teach me to guage.</p>
            <p>Mr. King dealt in all manner of merchandize, and kept from one to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0324600501:219"/>
six clerks. He loaded many vessels in a year; particularly to Philadelphia, where he was born, and was connected with a great mercantile house in that city. He had besides many vessels and droggers, of different sizes, which used to go about the island; and others to collect rum, sugar, and other goods. I understood pulling and managing those boats very well; and this hard work, which was the first that he set me to, in the sugar seasons used to be my constant employment. I have rowed the boat, and slaved at the oars, from one hour to sixteen in the twenty-four; during which I had fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen pence sterling per day to live on, though sometimes only ten pence. However this was considerably more than was allowed to other slaves that used to work often with me, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to other gentlemen on the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0324600501:220"/>
island: those poor souls had never more than nine-pence per day, and seldom more than six-pence, from their masters or owners, though they earned them three or four pisterines<note n="*" place="bottom">These pisterines are of the value of a shilling.</note>: for it is a common practice in the West Indies for men to purchase slaves though they have not plantations them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, in order to let them out to planters and merchants at so much a piece by the day, and they give what allowance they chuse out of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of their daily work to their slaves for subsistence; this allowance is often very scanty. My master often gave the owners of these slaves two and a half of these pieces per day, and found the poor fellows in victuals himself, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he thought their owners did not feed them well enough according to the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0324600501:221"/>
work they did. The slaves used to like this very well; and, as they knew my master to be a man of feeling, they were always glad to work for him in preference to any other gentleman; some of whom after they had been paid for these poor people's labours, would not give them their allowance out of it. Many times have I even seen these unfortunate wretches beaten for asking for their pay; and often severely flogged by their owners if they did not bring them their daily or weekly money exactly to the time; though the poor creatures were obliged to wait on the gentlemen they had worked for sometimes for more than half the day before they could get their pay; and this generally on sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, when they wanted the time for themselves. In particular, I knew a countryman of mine who once did not
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0324600501:222"/>
bring the weekly money directly that it was earned; and though he brought it the same day to his master, yet he was staked to the ground for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended negligence, and was just going to receive a hundred lashes, but for a gentleman who begged him off fifty. This poor man was very industrious; and, by his frugality, had saved so much money by working on shipboard, that he had got a white man to buy him a boat, unknown to his master. some time after he had this little estate, the governor wanted a boat to bring his sugar from different parts of the island; and, knowing this to be a negro-man's boat, he seized upon it for himself, and would not pay the owner a farthing. The man on this went to his master, and complained to him of this act of the governor; but the only satisfaction he received
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0324600501:223"/>
was to be damned very heartily by his master, who asked him how dared any of his negroes to have a boat. If the justly-merited ruin of the governor's fortune could be any gratification to the poor man he had thus robbed, he was not without consolation. Extortion and rapine are poor providers; and some time after this the governor died in the King's Bench in England, as I was told, in great poverty. The last war favoured this poor negro-man, and he found some means to escape from his Christian master: he came to England; where I saw him afterwards several times. such treatment as this often drives these miserable wretches to despair, and they run away from their masters at the hazard of their lives. Many of them, in this place, unable to get their pay when they have earned it, and fearing
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0324600501:224"/>
to be flogged, as usual, if they return home without it, run away where they can for shelter, and a reward is often offered to bring them in dead or alive. My master used sometimes, in these cases, to agree with their owners, and to settle with them himself; and thereby he saved many of them a flogging.</p>
            <p>Once, for a few days, I was let out to fit a vessel, and I had no victuals allowed me by either party; at last I told my master of this treatment, and he took me away from it. In many of the estates, on the different islands where I used to be sent for rum or sugar, they would not deliver it to me, or any other negro; he was therefore obliged to send a white man along with me to those places; and then he used to pay him from six to ten pisterines a day. From being thus employed,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0324600501:225"/>
during the time I served Mr. King, in going about the different estates on the island, I had all the opportunity I could wish for to see the dreadful usage of the poor men; usage that reconciled me to my situation, and made me bless God for the hands into which I had fallen.</p>
            <p>I had the good fortune to please my master in every department in which he employed me; and there was scarcely any part of his business, or houshold affairs, in which I was not occasionally engaged. I often supplied the place of a clerk, in receiving and delivering cargoes to the ships, in tending stores, and delivering goods: and, besides this, I used to shave and dress my master when convenient, and take care of his horse; and when it was necessary, which was very often, I worked likewise on board of different
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0324600501:226"/>
vessels of his. By these means I became very useful to my master; and saved him, as he used to acknowledge, above a hundred pounds a year. Nor did he scruple to say I was of more advantage to him than any of his clerks; though their usual wages in the West Indies are from sixty to a hundred pounds current a year.</p>
            <p>I have sometimes heard it asserted that a negro cannot earn his master the first cost; but nothing can be further from the truth. I suppose nine tenths of the mechanics throughout the West Indies are negro slaves; and I well know the coopers among them earn two dollars a day; the carpenters the same, and oftentimes more; as also the masons, smiths, and fishermen, &amp;c. and I have known many slaves whose masters would not take a thousand pounds current for them.
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0324600501:227"/>
But surely this assertion refutes itself; for, if it be true, why do the planters and merchants pay such a price for slaves? And, above all, why do those who make this assertion exclaim the most loudly against the abolition of the slave trade? so much are men blinded, and to such inconsistent arguments are they driven by mistaken interest! I grant, indeed, that slaves are some times, by half-feeding, half-clothing, over-working and stripes, reduced so low, that they are turned out as unfit for service, and left to perish in the woods, or expire on a dunghill.</p>
            <p>My master was several times offered by different gentlemen one hundred guineas for me; but he always told them he would not sell me, to my great joy: and I used to double my diligence and care for fear of getting into the hands of those men who did not
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0324600501:228"/>
allow a valuable slave the common support of life. Many of them even used to find fault with my master for feeding his slaves so well as he did; although I often went hungry, and an Englishman might think my fare very indifferent; but he used to tell them he always would do it, because the slaves thereby looked better and did more work.</p>
            <p>While I was thus employed by my master I was often a witness to cruelties of every kind, which were exercised on my unhappy fellow slaves. I used frequently to have different cargoes of new negroes in my care for sale; and it was almost a constant practice with our clerks, and other whites, to commit violent depredations on the chastity of the female slaves; and these I was, though with reluctance, obliged to submit to at all times, being unable to
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0324600501:229"/>
help them. When we have had some of these slaves on board my master's vessels to carry them to other islands, or to America, I have known our mates to commit these acts most shamefully, to the disgrace, not of Christians only, but of men. I have even known them gratify their brutal passion with females not ten years old; and these abominations some of them practised to such scandalous excess, that one of our captains discharged the mate and others on that account. And yet in Montserrat I have seen a negro man staked to the ground, and cut most shockingly, and then his ears cut off bit by bit, because he had been connected with a white woman who was a common prostitute: as if it were no crime in the whites to rob an innocent African girl of her virtue; but most heinous in a black man only to gratify a
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0324600501:230"/>
passion of nature, where the temptation was offered by one of a different colour, though the most abandoned woman of her species.</p>
            <p>One Mr. D— told me that he had sold 41000 negroes, and that he once cut off a negro-man's leg for running away—I asked him if the man had died in the operation, how he as a christian could answer for the horrid act before God? and he told me, answering was a thing of another world; what he thought and did were policy. I told him that the christian doctrine taught us to do unto others as we would that others should do unto us. He then said that his scheme had the desired effect—it cured that man and some others of running away.</p>
            <p>Another negro-man was half hanged, and then burnt, for attempting to poison
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0324600501:231"/>
a cruel overseer. Thus by repeated cruelties are the wretched first urged to despair, and then murdered, because they still retain so much of human nature about them as to wish to put an end to their misery, and retaliate on their tyrants! These overseers are indeed for the most part persons of the worst character of any denomination of men in the West Indies. Unfortunately, many humane gentlemen, by not residing on their estates, are obliged to leave the management of them in the hands of these human butchers, who cut and mangle the slaves in a shocking manner on the most trifling occasions, and altogether treat them in every respect like brutes. They pay no regard to the situation of pregnant women, nor the least attention to the lodging of the field negroes. Their huts, which ought to be well covered, and the place dry where they
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0324600501:232"/>
take their little repose, are often open sheds, built in damp places; so that, when the poor creatures return tired from the toils of the field, they contract many disorders, from being exposed to the damp air in this uncomfortable state, while they are heated, and their pores are open. This neglect certainly conspires with many others to cause a decrease in the births as well as in the lives of the grown negroes. I can quote many instances of gentlemen who reside on their estates in the west Indies, and then the scene is quite changed; the negroes are treated with lenity and proper care, by which their lives are prolonged, and their masters profited. To the honour of humanity, I knew several gentlemen who managed their estates in this manner; and they found that benevolence was their true interest.
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0324600501:233"/>
And, among many I could mention in several of the islands, I knew one in Montserrat whose slaves looked remarkably well, and never needed any fresh supplies of negroes; and there are many other estates, especially in Barbadoes, which, from such judicious treatment, need no fresh stock of negroes at any time. I have the honour of knowing a most worthy and humane gentleman, who is a native of Barbadoes, and has estates there<note n="†" place="bottom">sir Philip Gibbes, Baronet, Barbadoes.</note>. This gentleman has written a treatise on the usage of his own slaves. He allows them two hours for refreshment at mid-day; and many other indulgencies and comforts, particularly in their lying; and, besides this, he raises more provisions on his estate than they can destroy; so that by these attentions
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0324600501:234"/>
he saves the lives of his negroes, and keeps them healthy, and as happy as the condition of slavery can admit. I myself, as shall appear in the sequel, managed an estate, where, by those attentions, the negroes were uncommonly cheerful and healthy, and did more work by half than by the common mode of treatment they usually do. For want, therefore, of such care and attention to the poor negroes, and otherwise oppressed as they are, it is no wonder that the decrease should require 20,000 new negroes annually to fill up the vacant places of the dead.</p>
            <p>Even in Barbadoes, notwithstanding those humane exceptions which I have mentioned, and others I am acquainted with, which justly make it quoted as a place where slaves meet with the best treatment, and need fewest recruits of any in the West Indies, yet this
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0324600501:235"/>
island requires 1000 negroes annually to keep up the original stock, which is only 80,000. so that the whole term of a negro's life may be said to be there but sixteen years<note n="*" place="bottom">Benezet's Account of Guinea, p. 16.</note>? And yet the climate here is in every respect the same as that from which they are taken, except in being more wholesome. Do the British colonies decrease in this manner? And yet what a prodigious difference is there between an English and West India climate?</p>
            <p>While I was in Montserrat I knew a negro man, named Emanuel Sankey, who endeavoured to escape from his miserable bondage, by concealing himself on board of a London ship: but fate did not favour the poor oppressed man; for, being discovered when the vessel was under sail, he was delivered up again to his master. This <hi>Christian</hi>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:0324600501:236"/>
               <hi>master</hi> immediately pinned the wretch down to the ground at each wrist and ancle, and then took some sticks of sealing wax, and lighted them, and droped it all over his back. There was another master who was noted for cruelty; and I believe he had not a slave but what had been cut, and had pieces fairly taken out of the flesh: and after they had been punished thus, he used to make them get into a long wooden box or case he had for that purpose, in which he shut them up during pleasure. It was just about the height and breadth of a man; and the poor wretches had no room, when in the case to move.</p>
            <p>It was very common in several of the islands, particularly in st. Kitt's, for the slaves to be branded with the initial letters of their master's name; and a load of heavy iron hooks hung about their necks. Indeed on the most
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0324600501:237"/>
trifling occasions they were loaded with chains; and often instruments of torture were added. The iron muzzle, thumb-screws, &amp;c. are so well known, as not to need a description, and were sometimes applied for the slightest faults. I have seen a negro beaten till some of his bones were broken, for only letting a pot boil over. Is it surprising that usage like this should drive the poor creatures to despair, and make them seek a refuge in death from those evils which render their lives intolerable—while,<q>
                  <l>"With shuddering horror pale, and eyes aghast,</l>
                  <l>"They view their lamentable lot, and find</l>
                  <l>"No rest!"</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This they frequently do. A negro-man on board a vessel of my master, while I belonged to her, having been put in irons for some trifling misdemeanor, and kept in that state
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0324600501:238"/>
for some days, being weary of life, took an opportunity of jumping overboard into the sea; however, he was picked up without being drowned. Another, whose life was also a burden to him, resolved to starve himself to death, and refused to eat any victuals: this procured him a severe flogging: and he also, on the first occasion which offered, jumped overboard at Charles Town, but was saved.</p>
            <p>Nor is there any greater regard shewn to the little property than there is to the persons and lives of the negroes. I have already related an instance or two of particular oppression out of many which I have witnessed; but the following is frequent in all the islands. The wretched field-slaves, after toiling all the day for an unfeeling owner, who gives them but little victuals, steal sometimes a few moments from
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0324600501:239"/>
rest or refreshment to gather some small portion of grass, according as their time will admit. This they commonly tie up in a parcel; either a bit's worth (six-pence) or half a bit's worth; and bring it to town, or to the market, to sell. Nothing is more common than for the white people on this occasion to take the grass from them without paying for it; and not only so, but too often also, to my knowledge, our clerks, and many others, at the same time have committed acts of violence on the poor, wretched, and helpless females; whom I have seen for hours stand crying to no purpose, and get no redress or pay of any kind. Is not this one common and crying sin enough to bring down God's judgment on the islands? He tells us the oppressor and the oppressed are both in his hands; and if these are not the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0324600501:240"/>
poor, the broken-hearted, the blind, the captive, the bruised, which our saviour speaks of, who are they? One of these depredators once, in st. Eustatia, came on board of our vessel, and bought some fowls and pigs of me; and a whole day after his departure with the things, he returned again and wanted his money back: I refused to give it; and, not seeing my captain on board, he began the common pranks with me; and swore he would even break open my chest and take my money. I therefore expected, as my captain was absent, that he would be as good as his word: and he was just proceeding to strike me, when fortunately a British seaman on board, whose heart had not been debauched by a West India climate, interposed and prevented him. But had the cruel man struck me I certainly should have defended
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0324600501:241"/>
myself at the hazard of my life; for what is life to a man thus oppressed? He went away, however, swearing; and threatened that whenever he caught me on shore he would shoot me, and pay for me afterwards.</p>
            <p>The small account in which the life of a negro is held in the West Indies, is so universally known, that it might seem impertinent to quote the following extract, if some people had not been hardy enough of late to assert that negroes are on the same footing in that respect as Europeans. By the 329th Act, page 125, of the Assembly of Barbadoes, it is enacted <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'That if any negro, or other slave, under punishment by his master, or his order, for running away, or any other crime or misdemeanor towards his said master, unfortunately shall suffer in life or member, no person whatsoever
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0324600501:242"/>
shall be liable to a fine; but if any man shall out of <hi>wantonness, or only of bloody-mindedness, or cruel iniention, wilfully kill a negro, or other slave, of his own, he shall pay into the public treasury fifteen pounds sterling.</hi>'</q> And it is the same in most, if not all, of the West India islands. Is not this one of the many acts of the islands which call loudly for redress? And do not the Assembly which enacted it deserve the appellation of savages and brutes rather than of christians and men? It is an act at once unmerciful, unjust, and unwise; which for cruelty would disgrace an assembly of those who are called barbarians; and for its injustice and <hi>insanity</hi> would shock the morality and common sense of a Samaide or Hottentot.</p>
            <p>shocking as this and many more acts of the bloody West India code at first
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0324600501:243"/>
view appear, how is the iniquity of it heightened when we consider to whom it may be extended! Mr. James Tobin, a zealous labourer in the vineyard of slavery gives an account of a French planter of his acquaintance, in the island of Martinico, who shewed him many mulattoes working in the fields like beasts of burden; and he told Mr. Tobin these were all the produce of his own loins! And I myself have known similar instances. Pray, reader, are these sons and daughters of the French planter less his children by being begotten on black women? And what must be the virtue of those legislators, and the feelings of those fathers, who estimate the lives of their sons, however begotten, at no more than fifteen pounds; though they should be murdered, as the act says, <hi>out of wantonness and bloody-mindedness!</hi> But is
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0324600501:244"/>
not the slave trade entirely a war with the heart of man? And surely that which is begun by breaking down the barriers of virtue involves in its continuance destruction to every principle, and buries all sentiments in ruin!</p>
            <p>I have often seen slaves, particularly those who were meagre, in different islands, put into scales and weighed; and then sold from three pence to six pence or nine pence a pound. My master, however, whose humanity was shocked at this mode, used to sell such by the lump. And at or after a sale it was not uncommon to see negroes taken from their wives, wives taken from their husbands, and children from their parents, and sent off to other islands, and wherever else their merciless lords choose; and probably never more during life see each other! Oftentimes my heart has bled at these
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0324600501:245"/>
partings; when the friends of the departed have been at the water side, and, with sighs and tears, have kept their eyes fixed on the vessel, till it went out of sight.</p>
            <p>A poor Creole negro I knew well, who, after having been often thus transported from island to island, at last resided in Montserrat. This man used to tell me many melancholy tales of himself. Generally, after he had done working for his master, he used to employ his few leisure moments to go a fishing. When he had caught any fish, his master would frequently take them from him without paying him; and at other times some other white people would serve him in the same manner. One day he said to me, very movingly, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'sometimes when a white man take away my fish I go to my maser, and he get me my right;
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0324600501:246"/>
and when my maser by strength take away my fishes, what me must do? I can't go to any body to be righted; then,'</q> said the poor man, looking up above, <q rend="inline margsglQuotes">'I must look up to God Mighty in the top for right.'</q> This artless tale moved me much, and I could not help feeling the just cause Moses had in redressing his brother against the Egyptian. I exhorted the man to look up still to the God on the top, since there was no redress below. Though I little thought then that I myself should more than once experience such imposition, and need the same exhortation hereafter, in my own transactions in the islands; and that even this poor man and I should some time after suffer together in the same manner, as shall be related hereafter.</p>
            <p>Nor was such usage as this confined to particular places or individuals; for,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0324600501:247"/>
in all the different islands in which I have been (and I have visited no less than fifteen) the treatment of the slave, was nearly the same; so nearly indeed, that the history of an island, or even a plantation, with a few such exceptions as I have mentioned, might serve for a history of the whole. such a tendency has the slave-trade to debauch men's minds, and harden them to every feeling of humanity! For I will not suppose that the dealers in slaves are born worse than other men—No; it is the fatality of this mistaken avarice, that it corrupts the milk of human kindness and turns it into gall. And, had the pursuits of those men been different, they might have been as generous, as tender-hearted and just, as they are unfeeling, rapacious and cruel. surely this traffic cannot be good, which spreads like a pestilence, and taints what it touches! which
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0324600501:248"/>
violates that first natural right of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, equality and independency, and gives one man a dominion over his fellows which God could never intend! For it raises the owner to a state as far above man as it depresses the slave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it; and, with all the presumption of human pride, sets a distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, immeasurable in extent, and endless in duration! Yet how mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken is the avarice even of the planters. Are slaves more useful by being thus humbled to the condition of brutes, than they would be if suffered to enjoy the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of men? The freedom which diffuses health and prosperity through out Britain answers you—No. When you make men slaves you deprive them of half their virtue, you set them in your own conduct an example of fraud, rapine, and cruelty, and compel them to live with you in a state of war; and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0324600501:249"/>
yet you complain that they are not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest or faithful! You stupify them with stripes, and think it necessary to keep them in a state of ignorance; and yet you assert that they are incapable of learning; that their minds are such a barren soil or moor, that culture would be lost on them; and that they come from a climate, where nature, though prodigal of her bounties in a degree unknown to yourselves, has left man alone scant and unfinished; and incapable of enjoying the treasures she has poured out for him!—An as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion at once impious and absurd. Why do you use those instruments of torture? Are they fit to be applied by one rational being to another? And are ye not struck with shame and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, to see the partakers of your nature reduced so low? But, above all, are there no dangers attending this
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0324600501:250"/>
mode of treatment? Are you not hourly in dread of an insurrection? Nor would it be surprising: for when
<q>
                  <l>"—No peace is given</l>
                  <l>"To us enslav'd, but custody severe;</l>
                  <l>"And stripes and arbitrary punishment</l>
                  <l>"Inflicted—What peace can we return?</l>
                  <l>"But to our power, hostility and hate;</l>
                  <l>"Untam'd reluctance, and revenge, though slow.</l>
                  <l>"Yet ever plotting how the conqueror least</l>
                  <l>"May reap his conquest, and may least rejoice</l>
                  <l>"In doing what we most in suffering feel."</l>
               </q> But by changing your conduct, and treating your slaves as men, every cause of fear would be banished. They would be faithful, honest, intelligent and vigorous; and peace, prosperity, and happiness, would attend you.</p>

            <p>IN the precedeing chapter I have set before the reader a few of those many instances of oppression, extortion, and cruelty, which I have been a witness
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0324600501:252"/>
to in the West Indies: but, were I to enumerate them all, the catalogue would be tedious and disgusting. The punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the slaves on every trifling oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion are so frequent, and so well known together with the different instruments with which they are tortured, that it cannot any longer afford novelty to recite them; and they are too shock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to yield delight either to the writer or the reader. I shall therefore here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after only mention such as incidentally befell myself in the course of my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures.</p>
            <p>In the variety of departments in which I was employed by my master, I had an opportunity of seeing many cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious scenes in different islands; but, above all, I was struck with a celebrated curiosity called Brimstone-Hill, which is a high and steep mountain, some few miles from the town of Plymouth in Montserrat. I had often heard of some

I had taken some potatoes with me, and I put them into different ponds, and in a few minutes they were well boiled. I tasted some of them, but they were very sulphurous; and the silver shoe buckles, and all the other things of that metal we had among us, were, in a little time turned as black as lead.</p>
            <p>some time in the year 1763, kind Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence seemed to appear rather more favourable to me. One of my master's vessels, a Bermudas sloop, about sixty tons burthen was commanded by one
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0324600501:254"/>
Captain Thomas Farmer, an English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a very alert and active man, who gained my master a great deal of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney by his good mangement in carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing passengers from one island to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but very often his sailors used to get drunk and run away from the vessel, which hindered him in his business very much. This man had taken a liking to me; and many different times begged of my master to let me go a trip with him as a sailor; but he would tell him he could not spare me, though the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel sometimes could not go for want of hands, for sailors were generally very scarce in the island. However, at last, from necessity or force, my master was prevailed on, though very reluctantly, to let me go with this captain; but he gave him great charge to take care that I did not run away, for if I did he would make him pay for me. This being the case, the captain had for
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0324600501:255"/>
some time a sharp eye upon me when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the vessel anchored; and as soon as she returned I was sent for on shore again. Thus was I slaving as it were for life, sometimes at one thing, and sometimes at another; so that the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and I were nearly the most useful men in my master's employment. I also became so useful to the captain on shipboard, that many times, when he used to ask for me to go with him, though it should be but for twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>four hours, to some of the islands near us, my master would answer he could not spare me, at which the captain would swear, and would no go the trip; and tell my master I was better to him on board than any three white men he had; for they used to behave ill in many respects, particularly in getting drunk; and then they frequently got the boat stove, so as to hinder the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel from coming back as soon as she
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0324600501:256"/>
might have done. This my master knew very well; and at last, by the captain's constant entreaties, after I had been several times with him, one day to my great joy, told me the captain would not let him rest, and asked whether I would go aboard as a sailor, or stay on shore and mind the stores, for he could not bear any longer to be plagued in this manner. I was very happy at this proposal, for I immediately thought I might in time stand some chance by being on board to get a little money, or possibly make my escape if I should be used ill: I also expected to get better food, and in greater abundance; for I had oftentimes felt much hunger, though my master treated his slaves, as I have observed, uncommonly well. I therefore, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hesitation, answered him, that I would go and be a sailor if he pleased. Accordingly I was ordered on board
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0324600501:257"/>
directly. Nevertheless, between the vessel and the shore, when she was in port, I had little or no rest, as my master always wished to have me along with him. Indeed he was a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant gentleman, and but for my expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations on shipboard I should not have thought of leaving him. But the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain liked me also very much, and I was entirely his right-hand man. I did all I could to deserve his favour, and in return I received better treatment from him than any other I believe ever met with in the West Indies in my situation.</p>
            <p>After I had been sailing for some time with this captain, at length I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to try my luck and commence merchant. I had but a very small ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital to begin with; for one single half bit, which is equal to three-pence in England, made up my whole stock. However I trusted to the Lord to be
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0324600501:258"/>
with me; and at one of our trips to <hi>st. Eustatia,</hi> a Dutch island, I bought a glass tumbler with my half bit, and when I came to Montserrat I sold it for a bit, or six-pence. Luckily we made several successive trips to st. Eustatia (which was a general mart for the West Indies, about twenty leagues from Montserrat) and in our next, finding my tumbler so profitable, with this one bit I bought two tumblers more; and when I came back I sold them for two bits equal to a shilling sterling. When we went again I bought with these two bits four more of these glasses, which I sold for fout bits on our return to Montserrat: and in our next voyage to st. Eustatia, I bought two glasses with one bit, and with the other three I bought a jug of Geneva, nearly about three pints in measure. When we came to Montserrat, I sold the gin for eight bits, and the tumblers for two, so that
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0324600501:259"/>
my capital now amounted in all to a dollar, well husbanded and acquired in the space of a month or six weeks, when I blessed the Lord that I was so rich. As we sailed to different islands, I laid this money out in various things occasionally, and it used to turn to very good account, especially when we went to Guadaloupe, Grenada, and the rest of the French islands. Thus was I going all about the islands upwards of four years, and ever trading as I went, during which I experienced many instances of ill usage, and have seen many injuries done to other negroes in our dealings with whites: and, amidst our recreations, when we have been dancing and merry-making, they, without cause, have molested and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted us. Indeed I was more than once obliged to look up to God on high, as I had advised the poor fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man some time before. And I had not
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0324600501:260"/>
been long trading for myself in the manner I have related above, when I experienced the like trial in company with him as follows: This man being used to the water, was upon an emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency put on board of us by his master to work as another hand, on a voyage to santa Cruz; and at our sailing he had brought his little all for a venture which consisted of six bits' worth of limes and oranges in a bag; I had also my whole stock, which was about twelve bits' worth of the same kind of goods, separate in two bags; for we had heard these fruits sold well in that island. When we came there, in some little convenient time he and I went ashore with our fruits to sell them; but we had scarcely landed when we were met by two white men, who presently took our three bags from us. We could not at first guess what they meant to do; and for some time we thought
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0324600501:261"/>
they were jesting with us; but they too soon let us know otherwise, for they took our ventures immediately to a house hard by, and adjoining the fort, while we followed all the way begging of them to give us our fruits, but in vain. They not only refused to return them but swore at us, and threatened if we did not immediately depart they would flog us well. We told them these three bags were all we were worth in the world, and that we brought them with us to sell when we came from Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serrat, and shewed them the vessel. But this was rather against us, as they now saw we were strangers as well as slaves. They still therefore swore, and desired us to be gone, and even took sticks to beat us; while we, seeing they meant what they said, went off in the greatest confusion and despair. Thus, in the very minute of gaining more by three times than I ever did
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0324600501:262"/>
by any venture in my life before, was I deprived of every farthing I was worth. An insupportable misfortune! but how to help ourselves we knew not. In our consternation we went to the commanding officer of the fort, and told him how we had been served by some of his people; but we obtained not the least redress: he answered our complaints only by a volley of impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations against us, and immediately took a horse-whip, in order to chastise us, so that we were obliged to turn out much faster than we came in. I now, in the agony of distress and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, wished that the ire of God in his forked lightning might transsix these cruel oppressors among the dead. still however we persevered; went back again to the house, and begged and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought them again and again for our fruits, till at last some other people that were in the house asked if we would be
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0324600501:263"/>
contented if they kept one bag and gave us the other two. We, seeing no remedy whatever, consented to this; and they, observing one bag to have both kinds of fruit in it, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to my companion, kept that; and the other two, which were mine they gave us back. As soon as I got them, I ran as fast as I could, and got the first negro man I could to help me off; my companion, however, stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a little longer to plead; he told them the bag they had was his, and likewise all that he was worth in the world; but this was of no avail, and he was obliged to return without it. The poor old man wringing his hands, cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bitterly for his loss; and, indeed, he then did look up to God on high, which so moved me with pity for him, that I gave him nearly one third of my fruits. We then proceeded to the markets to sell them; and Providence
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0324600501:264"/>
was more favourable to us than we could have expected, for we sold our fruits uncommonly well; I got for mine about thirty-seven bits. such a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising reverse of fortune in so short a space of time seemed like a dream, and proved no small encouragement for me to trust the Lord in any situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. My captain afterwards fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently used to take my part, and get me my right, when I have been plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered or used ill by these tender Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian depredators; among whom I have shuddered to observe the unceasing blasphemous execrations which are wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t only thrown out by persons of all ages and conditions, not only without oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, but even as if they were indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences and pleasure.</p>
            <p>At one of our trips to st. Kitt's, I had eleven bits of my own; and my friendly captain lent me five more,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0324600501:265"/>
with which I bought a Bible. I was very glad to get this book, which I fcarcely could meet with any where. I think there was none sold in Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serrat; and, much to my grief, from being forced out of the Aetna in the manner I have related, my Bible, and the Guide to the Indians, the two books I loved above all others, were left behind.</p>
            <p>While I was in this place, st. Kitt's, a very curious imposition on human nature took place:—A white man wanted to marry in the church a free black woman that had land and slaves in Montserrat: but the clergyman told him it was against the law of the place to marry a white and a black in the church. The man then asked to be married on the water, to which the parson consented, and the two lovers went in one boat, and the parson and
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0324600501:266"/>
clerk in another, and thus the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was performed. After this the loving pair came on board our vessel, and my captain treated them extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well, and brought them safe to Montserrat.</p>
            <p>The reader cannot but judge of the irksomeness of this situation to a mind like mine, in being daily exposed to new hardships and impositions, after having seen many better days, and been as it were, in a state of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and plenty; added to which, every part of the world I had hitherto been in, seemed to me a paradise in comparison of the West Indies. My mind was therefore hourly replete with inventions and thoughts of being freed, and, if possible, by honest and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able means; for I always remembered the old adage; and I trust it has ever been my ruling principle, that <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0324600501:267"/>
is the best policy;"</q> and likewise that other golden precept—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"To do unto all men as I would they should do unto me."</q> However, as I was from early years a predestinarian, I thought whatever fate had determined must ever come to pass; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if ever it were my lot to be freed nothing could prevent me, although I should at present see no means or hope to obtain my freedom; on the other hand, if it were my fate not to be freed I never should be so, and all my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours for that purpose would be fruitless. In the midst of these thoughts I therefore looked up with prayers anxiously to God for my liberty; and at the same time used every honest means, and did all that was possible on my part to obtain it.

my friendly captain knew very well; this occasioned him sometimes to take liberties with me; but whenever he treated me waspishly I used plainly to tell him my mind, and that I would die before I would be imposed upon as other negroes were, and that to me life had lost its relish when liberty was gone. This I said although I foresaw my then well-being or future hopes of freedom (humanly speaking) depended on this man. However, as he could not bear the thoughts of my not failing with him, he always became mild on my threats. I therefore continued with him; and, from my great attention to his orders and his business, I gained him credit, and through his kindness to me I at last procured my liberty. While I thus went on, filled with the thoughts of freedom, and resisting oppression as well as I was able, my life hung daily
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0324600501:269"/>
in suspence, particularly in the surfs I have formerly mentioned, as I could not swim. These are extremely violent throughout the West Indies, and I was ever exposed to their howling rage and devouring fury in all the islands. I have seen them strike and toss a boat right up an end, and maim several on board. Once in the Grenada islands, when I and about eight others were pulling a large boat with two pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheons of water in it, a surf struck us, and drove the boat and all in it about half a stone's throw, among some trees, and above the high water mark. We were obliged to get all the assistance we could from the nearest estate to mend the boat, and launch it into the water again. At Montserrat one night, in pressing hard to get off the shore on board, the punt was overset with us four times; the first time I was very near being drowned;
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0324600501:270"/>
however the jacket I had on kept me up above water a little space of time, while I called on a man near me who was a good swimmer, and told him I could not swim; he then made haste to me, and, just as I was sinking, he caught hold of me, and brought me to sounding, and then he went and brought the punt also. As soon as we had turned the water out of her, lest we should be used ill for being absent, we attempted again three times more, and as often the horrid surfs served us as at first; but at last, the fifth time we attempted, we gained our point, at the eminent hazard of our lives. One day also, at Old Road in Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serrat, our captain, and three men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides myself, were going in a large canoe in quest of rum and sugar, when a single surf tossed the canoe an amazing distance from the water,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0324600501:271"/>
and some of us, near a stone's throw from each other: most of us were very much bruised; so that I and many more often said, and really thought, that there was not such another place under the heavens as this. I longed therefore much to leave it, and daily wished to see my master's promise per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of going to Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>While we lay in this place a very cruel thing happened on board of our sloop which filled me with horror; though I found afterwards such practices were frequent. There was a very clever and decent free young mulatto-man who sailed a long time with us: he had a free woman for his wife, by whom he had a child; and she was then living on shore, and all very happy. Our captain and mate, and other people on board, and several elsewhere, even the natives of Bermudas, all knew this
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0324600501:272"/>
young man from a child that he was always free, and no one had ever claimed him as their property: however, as might too often overcomes right in these parts, it happened that a <hi rend = "italic">Bermudas</hi> captain, whose vessel lay there for a few days in the road, came on board of us, and seeing the mulatto man, whose name was <hi rend = "italic">Joseph Clipson</hi>, he told him he was not free, and that he had orders from his master to bring him to <hi rend = "italic">Bermudas</hi>. The poor man could not believe the captain to be in earnest; but he was very soon undeceived, his men laying violent hands on him; and although he shewed a 
certificate of his being born free in <hi rend = "italic">St. Kitt's</hi>, and most people on board knew that he served his time to boat building, and always passed for a free man, yet he was forcibly taken out of our vessel. He then asked to be carried ashore before the secretary or magistrates, and these infernal invaders of human rights promised him he should; but, instead of that, they carried him on board of the other vessel: and the next day, without giving the poor man any hearing on shore, or suffering him even to see his wife or child, he was carried away, and probably doomed never more in this world to see them again. Nor was this the only instance of this kind of <ref target="a016" corresp="n016">barbarity</ref> <note xml:id="n016" target="a016" type="gloss">The use of the word "barbarity" is significant because during this time period, slaves were usually the ones that were dehumanized and deemed savages, whereas white people were considered civilized.</note> I was a witness to. I have since often seen in <hi rend = "italic">Jamaica</hi> and other islands, free men, whom I have known in <hi rend = "italic">America</hi>, thus villainously trepanned and held in bondage. I have heard of two similar practices even in <hi rend = "italic">Philadelphia</hi>: and were it not for the benevolence of the quakers in that city, many of the sable race, who now breathe the air of liberty, would, I believe, be groaning indeed
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0324600501:274"/>
under some planter's chains. These things opened my mind to a new scene of horror to which I had been before a stranger. Hitherto I had thought only slavery dreadful; but the state of a free negro appeared to me now equally so at least, and in some respects even worse, for they live in constant alarm for their liberty; which is but nominal, for they are universally insulted and plundered without the possibility of redress; for such is the equity of the <hi rend = "italic">West Indian</hi> laws, that no free negro's evidence will be admitted in their courts of justice. In this situation is it surprising that slaves, when mildly treated, should prefer even the misery of slavery to such a mockery of freedom? I was now completely disgusted with the <hi rend = "italic">West Indies</hi>, and thought I never should be entirely free until I had left them.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:0324600501:275"/>

            <p>I determined to make every exertion to obtain my freedom, and to return to <hi rend = "italic">Old England</hi>. For this purpose I thought a knowledge of navigation might be of use to me; for, though I did not intend to run away unless I should be ill used; yet, in such a case, if I understood navigation, I might attempt my escape in our <ref target="a017" corresp="n017">sloop</ref> <note xml:id="n017" target="a017" type="gloss">Oxford English Dictionary refers to a "sloop" as a "small, one-masted fore-and-aft rigged vessel" or a "relatively small ship-of-war carrying guns on the upper deck only."</note>, which was one of the swiftest sailing vessels in the <hi rend = "italic">West Indies</hi>, and I could be at no loss for hands to join me: and if I should make this attempt, I had intended to have gone for <hi rend = "italic">England</hi>; but this, as I said, was only to be in the event of my meeting with any ill usage. I
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0324600501:276"/>
therefore employed the mate of our vessel to teach me navigation, for which I agreed to give him twenty-four dollars, and actually paid him part of the money down; though when the captain, some time after, came to know that the mate was to have such a sum for teaching me, he rebuked him, and said it was a shame for him to take any money from me. However, my progress in this useful art was much retarded by the constancy of our work. Had I wished to run away I did not want opportunities, which frequently presented themselves; and particularly at one time, soon after this. When we were at the island of <hi rend = "italic">Gaudaloupe</hi> there was a large fleet of merchantmen bound for <hi rend = "italic">Old France</hi>; and, seamen then being very scarce, they gave from fifteen to twenty pounds a man for the run. Our mate, and all the white sailors,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0324600501:277"/>
left our vessel on this account, and went on board of the <hi rend = "italic">French</hi> ships. They would have had me also to go with them, for they regarded me; and swore to protect me, if I would go: and, as the fleet was to sail the next day, I really believe I could have got safe to <hi rend = "italic">Europe</hi> at that time. However, as my master was kind, I would not attempt to leave him; still remembering the old maxim, that <q rend="inline">'honesty is the best policy,'</q> I suffered them to go without me. Indeed my captain was much afraid of my leaving him and the vessel at that time, as I had so fair an opportunity: but, I thank God, this fidelity of mine turned out much to my advantage hereafter, when I did not in the least think of it; and made me so much in favour with the captain, that he used now and then to teach me some parts of navigation
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0324600501:278"/>
himself; but some of our passengers, and others, seeing this, found much fault with him for it, saying it was a very dangerous thing to let a negro know navigation; thus I was hindered again in my pursuits. About the latter end of the year 1764, my master bought a larger sloop, called the Prudence, about seventy or eighty tons, of which my captain had the command. I went with him into this vessel, and we took a load of new slaves for <hi rend = "italic">Georgia and Charles Town</hi>. My master now left me entirely to the captain, though he still wished for me to be with him; but I, who always much wished to lose sight of the <hi rend = "italic">West Indies</hi>, was not a little rejoiced at the thoughts of seeing any other country. Therefore, relying on the goodness of my captain, I got ready all the little venture I could; and, when the vessel
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0324600501:279"/>
was ready, we sailed to my great joy. When we got to our destined places, <hi rend = "italic">Georgia and Charles Town</hi>, I expected I should have an opportunity of selling my little property to advantage: but here, particularly in <hi rend = "italic">Charles Town</hi>, I met with buyers, white men, who imposed on me as in other places. Notwithstanding, I was resolved to have fortitude; thinking no lot or trial too hard when kind Heaven is the rewarder.</p>
            <p>We soon got loaded again, and returned to <hi rend = "italic">Montserrat</hi>; and there, amongst the rest of the islands, I sold my goods well; and in this manner I continued trading during the year 1764; meeting with various scenes of imposition, as usual. After this, my master fitted out his vessel for <hi rend = "italic">Philadelphia</hi>, in the year 1765; and during the time we were loading her, and getting
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0324600501:280"/>
ready for the voyage, I worked with redoubled alacrity, from the hope of getting money enough by these voyages to buy my freedom, in time, if it should please God; and also to see the town of <hi rend = "italic">Philadelphia</hi>, which I had heard a great deal about for some years past; besides which, I had always longed to prove my master's promise the first day I came to him. In the midst of these elevated ideas, and while I was about getting my little merchandize in readiness, one Sunday my master sent for me to his house. When I came there I found him and the captain together; and, on my going in, I was struck with astonishment at his telling me he heard that I meant to run away from him when I got to <hi rend = "italic">Philadelphia</hi>: <q rend="inline">'And therefore,'</q> said he, <q rend="inline">'I must sell you again: you cost me a great deal of money, no less than
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0324600501:281"/>
forty pounds sterling; and it will not do to lose so much. You are a valuable fellow,'</q> continued he; <q rend="inline">'and I can get any day for you one hundred guineas, from many gentlemen in this island.'</q> And then he told me of Captain <hi rend = "italic">Doran's</hi> brother-in-law, a severe master, who ever wanted to buy me to make me his overseer. My captain also said he could get much more than a hundred guineas for me in <hi rend = "italic">Carolina</hi>. This I knew to be a fact; for the gentleman that wanted to buy me came off several times on board of us, and spoke to me to live with him, and said he would use me well. When I asked what work he would put me to, he said, as I was a sailor, he would make me a captain of one of his rice vessels. But I refused: and fearing at the same time, by a sudden turn I saw in the captain's temper, he might
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0324600501:282"/>
mean to sell me, I told the gentleman I would not live with him on any condition, and that I certainly would run away with his vessel: but he said he did not fear that, as he would catch him again; and then he told me how cruelly he would serve me if I should do so. My captain, however, gave him to understand that I knew something of navigation: so he thought better of it; and, to my great joy, he went away. I now told my master I did not say I would run away in <hi rend = "italic">Philadelphia</hi>; neither did I mean it, as he did not use me ill, nor yet the captain: for if they did I certainly would have made some attempts before now; but as I thought that if it were God's will I ever should be freed it would be so, and, on the contrary, if it was not his will it would not happen; so I hoped if ever I were freed, whilst I was used
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0324600501:283"/>
well, it should be by honest means; but as I could not help myself, he must do as he pleased; I could only hope and trust to the God of Heaven; and at that instant my mind was big with inventions and full of schemes to escape. I then appealed to the captain whether he ever saw any sign of my making the least attempt to run away; and asked him if I did not always come on board according to the time for which he gave me liberty; and, more particularly, when all our men left us at <hi rend = "italic">Gaudaloupe</hi> and went on board of the <hi rend = "italic">French</hi> fleet, and advised me to go with them, whether I might not, and that he could not have got me again. To my no small surprise, and very great joy, the captain confirmed every syllable that I had said: and even more: for he said he had tried different times to see if I
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0324600501:284"/>
would make any attempt of this kind, both at <hi rend = "italic">St. Eustatia</hi> and in <hi rend = "italic">America</hi>, and he never found that I made the smallest; but on the contrary, I always came on board according to his orders; and he did really believe, if I ever meant to run away, that, as I could never have had a better opportunity, I would have done it the night the mate and all the people left our vessel at <hi rend = "italic">Guadaloupe</hi>. The captain then informed my master, who had been thus imposed on by our mate, (though I did not know who was my enemy,) the reason the mate had for imposing this lie upon him; which was, because I had acquainted the captain of the provisions the mate had given away or taken out of the vessel. This speech of the captain was like life to the dead to me, and instantly my soul glorified God; and still more so
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0324600501:285"/>
on hearing my master immediately say that I was a sensible fellow, and he never did intend to use me as a common slave; and that but for the entreaties of the captain, and his character of me, he would not have let me go from the stores about as I had done: that also, in so doing, he thought by carrying one little thing or other to different places to sell I might make money. That he also intended to encourage me in this, by crediting me with half a puncheon of rum and half a hogshead of sugar at a time; so that, from being careful, I might have money enough, in some time, to purchase my freedom; and, when that was the case, I might depend upon it he would let me have it for forty pounds sterling money, which was only the same price he gave for me. This sound gladdened my poor heart beyond measure; though
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0324600501:286"/>
indeed it was no more than the very idea I had formed in my mind of my master long before, and I immediately made him this reply: <q rend="inline">'sir, I always had that very thought of you, indeed I had, and that made me so diligent in serving you.'</q> He then gave me a large piece of silver coin, such as I never had seen or had before, and told me to get ready for the voyage, and he would credit me with a tierce of sugar, and another of rum; he also said that he had two amiable sisters in <hi rend = "italic">Philadelphia</hi>, from whom I might get some necessary things. Upon this my noble captain desired me to go aboard; and, knowing the <hi rend = "italic">African</hi> metal, he charged me not to say any thing of this matter to any body; and he promised that the lying mate should not go with him any more. This was a change indeed; in the same hour to
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0324600501:287"/>
feel the most exquisite pain, and in the turn of a moment the fullest joy. It caused in me such sensations as I was only able to express in my looks; my heart was so overpowered with gratitude that I could have kissed both of their feet. When I left the room I immediately went, or rather flew, to the vessel, which being loaded, my master, as good as his word, trusted me with a tierce of rum, and another of sugar, when we sailed, and arrived safe at the elegant town of <hi rend = "italic">Philadelphia</hi>. I soon sold my goods here pretty well; and in this charming place I found every thing plentiful and cheap.</p>
            <p>While I was in this place a very extraordinary occurrence befell me. I had been told one evening of a <hi>wise</hi> woman, a Mrs. <hi rend = "italic">Davis</hi>, who revealed secrets, foretold events, etc. I put little faith in this story at first, as I could
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0324600501:288"/>
not conceive that any mortal could foresee the future disposals of Providence, nor did I believe in any other revelation than that of the Holy Scriptures; however, I was greatly astonished at seeing this woman in a dream that night, though a person I never before beheld in my life; this made such an impression on me, that I could not get the idea the next day out of my mind, and I then became as anxious to see her as I was before indifferent; accordingly in the evening, after we left off working, I inquired where she lived, and being directed to her, to my inexpressible surprise, beheld the very woman in the very same dress she appeared to me to wear in the vision. she immediately told me I had dreamed of her the preceding night; related to me many things that had happened
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0324600501:289"/>
with a correctness that astonished me; and finally told me I should not be long a slave: this was the more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able news, as I believed it the more readily from her having so faithfully related the past incidents of my life. she said I should be twice in very great danger of my life within eighteen months, which, if I escaped, I should afterwards go on well; so giving me her blessing, we parted. After staying here some time till our vessel was loaded, and I had bought in my little traffic, we sailed from this agreeable spot for Montserrat, once more to encounter the raging surfs.</p>
            <p>We arrived safe at <hi rend = "italic">Montserrat</hi>, where we discharged our cargo; and soon after that we took slaves on board for <hi rend = "italic">St. Eustatia</hi>, and from thence to <hi rend = "italic">Georgia</hi>. I had always exerted myself and did double work, in order to
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0324600501:290"/>
make our voyages as short as possible; and from thus overworking myself while we were at Georgia I caught a fever and ague. I was very ill for eleven days and near dying; eternity was now exceedingly impressed on my mind, and I feared very much that awful event. I prayed the Lord therefore to spare me; and I made a promise in my mind to God, that I would be good if ever I should recover. At length, from having an eminent doctor to attend me, I was restored again to health; and soon after we got the vessel loaded, and set off for <hi rend = "italic">Montserrat</hi>. During the passage, as I was perfectly restored, and had much business of the vessel to mind, all my endeavours to keep up my integrity, and perform my promise to God, began to fail; and, in spite of all I could do, as we drew nearer and nearer to the

islands, my resolutions more and more declined, as if the very air of that country or climate seemed fatal to piety. When we were safe arrived at <hi rend = "italic">Montserrat</hi>, and I had got ashore, I forgot my former resolutions.—Alas! how prone is the heart to leave that God it wishes to love! and how strongly do the things of this world strike the senses and captivate the soul!—After our vessel was discharged, we soon got her ready, and took in, as usual, some of the poor oppressed natives of <hi rend = "italic">Africa</hi>, and other negroes; we then set off again for <hi rend = "italic">Georgia and Charlestown</hi>. We arrived at Georgia, and, having landed part of our cargo, proceeded to <hi rend = "italic">Charlestown</hi> with the remainder. While we were there I saw the town illuminated; the guns were fired, and bonfires and other demonstrations of joy shewn, on account of the repeal of the stamp

act. Here I disposed of some goods on my own account; the white men buying them with smooth promises and fair words, giving me, however, but very indifferent payment. There was one gentleman particularly who bought a puncheon of rum of me, which gave me a great deal of trouble; and, although I used the interest of my friendly captain, I could not obtain any thing for it; for, being a negro man, I could not oblige him to pay me. This vexed me much, not knowing how to act; and I lost some time in seeking after this Christian; and though, when the Sabbath came (which the negroes usually make their holiday) I was much inclined to go to public worship, I was obliged to hire some black men to help to pull a boat across the water to go in quest of this gentleman. When I found him, after much entreaty, both

from myself and my worthy captain, he at last paid me in dollars; some of them, however, were copper, and of consequence of no value; but he took advantage of my being a negro man, and obliged me to put up with those or none, although I objected to them. Immediately after, as I was trying to pass them in the market, amongst other white men, I was abused for offering to pass bad coin; and, though I shewed them the man I got them from, I was within one minute of being tied up and flogged without either judge or jury; however, by the help of a good pair of heels, I ran off, and so escaped the <ref target="a018" corresp="n018">bastinadoes</ref><note xml:id="n018" target="a018" type="gloss">Oxford English Dictionary refers to a "bastinado" as a "blow with a stick, usually on the soles of the feet."</note> I should have received. I got on board as fast as I could, but still continued in fear of them until we sailed, which I thanked God we did not long after; and I have never been amongst them since.</p>

We soon came to <hi rend = "italic">Georgia</hi>, where we were to complete our lading; and here worse fate than ever attended me: for one Sunday night, as I was with some negroes in their master's yard in the town of <hi rend = "italic">Savannah</hi>, it happened that their master, one Doctor <hi rend = "italic">Perkins</hi>, who was a very severe and cruel man, came in drunk; and not liking to see any strange negroes in his yard, he and a ruffian of a white man, he had in his service, beset me in an instant, and both of them struck me with the first weapons they could get hold of. I cried out as long as I could for help and mercy; but, though I gave a good account of myself, and he knew my captain, who lodged hard by him, it was to no purpose. They beat and mangled me in a shameful manner, leaving me near dead. I lost so much blood from the wounds I received,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0324600501:295"/>
that I lay quite motionless, and was so benumbed that I could not feel any thing for many hours. Early in the morning they took me away to the jail. As I did not return to the ship all night, my captain, not knowing where I was, and being uneasy that I did not then make my appearance, he made inquiry after me; and, having found where I was, immediately came to me. As soon as the good man saw me so cut and mangled, he could not forbear weeping; he soon got me out of jail to his lodgings, and immediately sent for the best doctors in the place, who at first declared it as their opinion that I could not recover. My captain on this went to all the lawyers in the town for their advice, but they told him they could do nothing for me as I was a negro. He then went to Doctor <hi rend = "italic">Perkins</hi>, the hero who had vanquished

me, and menaced him, swearing he would be revenged of him, and challenged him to fight.—But cowardice is ever the companion of cruelty—and the Doctor refused. However, by the skilfulness of one Doctor <hi rend = "italic">Brady</hi> of that place, I began at last to amend; but, although I was so sore and bad with the wounds I had all over me that I could not rest in any posture, yet I was in more pain on account of the captain's uneasiness about me than I otherwise should have been. The worthy man nursed and watched me all the hours of the night; and I was, through his attention and that of the doctor, able to get out of bed in about sixteen or eighteen days. All this time I was very much wanted on board, as I used frequently to go up and down the river for rafts, and other parts of our cargo, and stow them,

when the mate was sick or absent. In about four weeks I was able to go on duty; and in a fortnight after, having got in all our lading, our vessel set sail for Montserrat; and in less than three weeks we arrived there safe towards the end of the year. This ended my adventures in 1764; for I did not leave <hi rend = "italic">Montserrat</hi> again till the beginning of the following year.</p>
