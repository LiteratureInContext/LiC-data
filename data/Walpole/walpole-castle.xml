            <head>THE<lb/>TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.</head>
            <p> THE following work was found in the library of an ancient Catholic family in
               <placeName>the north of <hi rend="italic"><placeName type="TGN" key="7002445">England</placeName>.</hi></placeName> It was printed
               at <hi rend="italic"><placeName type="TGN" key="7003012">Naples</placeName>,</hi> in <ref>the black
                  letter</ref>, in the year <date>1529</date>. How much sooner it was written does
               not appear. The principal incidents are such as were believed in the darkest ages of
               Christianity; but the language and conduct have nothing that savours of barbarism.
               The stile is the purest <hi rend="italic">Italian.</hi> If the story was written near
               the time when it is supposed to have happened, it must have been between
                  <date>1095</date>, the aera of the first crusade, and <date>1243</date>, the date
               of the last, or not long afterwards. There is no other circumstance in the work, that
               can lead us to guess at <ref>the period in which the scene is laid</ref>: The names
               of the actors are evidently fictitious, and probably disguised on purpose: Yet the
                  <hi rend="italic">Spanish</hi> names of the domestics seem to indicate that this
               work was not <pb n="iv" facs="pageImages/iv.jpg"/> composed, until the establishment
               of the <hi rend="italic">Arragonian</hi> Kings in <hi rend="italic"><placeName type="TGN" key="7003012">Naples</placeName></hi> had
               made <hi rend="italic"> Spanish </hi> appellations familiar in that country. The
               beauty of the diction, and the zeal of the author [moderated, however, by singular
               judgment] concur to make <ref>me</ref> think that the date of the composition was
               little antecedent to that of the impression. Letters were then in their most
               flourishing state in <hi rend="italic"><placeName>Italy</placeName>,</hi> and
               contributed to dispel the empire of superstition, at that time so forcibly attacked
               by the reformers. It is not unlikely that an artful priest might endeavour to turn
               their own arms on the innovators; and might avail himself of his abilities as an
               author to confirm the populace in their ancient errors and superstitions. If this was
               his view, he has certainly acted with signal address. Such a work as the following
                  <ref>would enslave a hundred vulgar minds</ref> beyond half the books of
               controversy that have been written from the days of <hi rend="italic"
                     ><ref>Luther</ref></hi> to the present hour. </p>
            <p> This solution of the author's motives is however offered as a mere conjecture.
               Whatever his views were, or whatever effects the execution of them might have, his
               work can only be laid before the public <pb n="v" facs="pageImages/v.jpg"/> at
               present as a matter of entertainment. Even as such, some apology for it is necessary.
               Miracles, visions, necromancy, dreams, and other preternatural events, are exploded
               now even from <ref>romances</ref>. That was not the case when our author wrote; much
               less when the story itself is supposed to have happened. Belief in every kind of
               prodigy was so established in those dark ages, that an author would not be faithful
               to the <hi rend="italic">manners</hi> of the times, who should omit all mention of
               them. He is not bound to believe them himself, but he must represent his actors as
               believing them. </p>
            <p> If this <hi rend="italic">air</hi> of <hi rend="italic">the miraculous</hi> is
               excused, the reader will find nothing else unworthy of his perusal. Allow the
               possibility of the facts, and all the actors comport themselves as persons would do
               in their situation. There is no bombast, no similes, flowers, digressions, or
               unnecessary descriptions. Every thing tends directly to the catastrophe. Never is the
               reader's attention relaxed. The rules of the drama are almost observed throughout the
               conduct of the piece. The characters are well drawn, and still better maintained.
                  <ref>Terror, the author's principal engine</ref>, prevents the story from ever
               languishing; <pb n="vi" facs="pageImages/vi.jpg"/> and it is so often contrasted by
               pity, that the mind is kept up in a constant vicissitude of interesting passions. </p>
            <p> Some persons may perhaps think the characters of the domestics too little serious
               for the general cast of the story; but besides their opposition to the principal
               personages, the art of the author is very observable in his conduct of the
               subalterns. They discover many passages essential to the story, which could not be
               well brought to light but by their naivetè and simplicity: In particular, the
               womanish terror and foibles of <hi rend="italic">Bianca,</hi> in the last chapter,
               conduce essentially towards advancing the catastrophe. </p>
            <p> It is natural for a translator to be prejudiced in favour of his adopted work. More
               impartial readers may not be so much struck with the beauties of this piece as I was.
               Yet I am not blind to my author's defects. I could wish he had grounded his plan on a
               more useful moral than this; that <hi rend="italic"> the sins of fathers are visited
                  on their children to the third and fourth generation. </hi> I doubt whether, in
               his time, any more than at present, ambition curbed its appetite of dominion from the
               dread of so remote a punishment. And yet this moral is weakened by <pb n="vii"
                  facs="pageImages/vii.jpg"/> that less direct insinuation, that even such anathema
               may be diverted by devotion to St. <hi rend="italic">Nicholas.</hi> Here the interest
               of the Monk plainly gets the better of the judgment of the Author. However, with all
               its faults, I have no doubt but the <hi rend="italic">English</hi> reader will be
               pleased with a sight of this performance. The piety that reigns throughout, the
               lessons of virtue that are inculcated, and the rigid purity of the sentiments, exempt
               this work from the censure to which romances are but too liable. Should it meet with
               the success I hope for, I may be encouraged to re-print the original <hi
                  rend="italic">Italian,</hi> though it will tend to depreciate my own labour. Our
               language falls far short of the charms of the <hi rend="italic">Italian,</hi> both
               for variety and harmony. The latter is peculiarly excellent for simple narrative. It
               is difficult in <hi rend="italic"> English to relate </hi> without falling too low or
               rising too high; a fault obviously occasioned by the little care taken to speak pure
               language in common conversation. Every <hi rend="italic">Italian</hi> or <hi
                  rend="italic">Frenchman</hi> of any rank piques himself on speaking his own tongue
               correctly and with choice. I cannot flatter myself with having done justice to my
               author in this respect: His stile is as elegant, as his conduct <pb n="viii"
                  facs="pageImages/viii.jpg"/> of the passions is masterly. It is pity that he did
               not apply his talents to what they were evidently proper for, the theatre. </p>
            <p> I will detain the reader no longer, but to make one short remark. Though the
               machinery is invention, and the names of the actors imaginary, I cannot but believe,
               that the ground-work of the story is founded on truth. The scene is undoubtedly laid
               in some real castle. The author seems frequently, without design, to describe
               particular parts. <hi rend="italic">The chamber,</hi> says he, <hi rend="italic"> on
                  the right-hand; the door on the left-hand; the distance from the chapel to </hi>
               Conrad'<hi rend="italic">s apartment: </hi> These and other
               passages are strong presumptions that the author had some certain building in his
               eye. Curious persons, who have leisure to employ in such researches, may possibly
               discover in the <hi rend="italic"> Italian </hi> writers the foundation on which our
               author has built. If a catastrophe, at all resembling that which he describes, is
               believed to have given rise to this work, it will contribute to interest the reader,
               and will make the castle of <hi rend="italic">Otranto</hi> a still more moving story.

                  <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> Prince
                  of <hi rend="italic">Otranto,</hi> had one son and one daughter: The latter a most
                  beautiful virgin, aged eighteen, was called <hi rend="italic"
                           >Matilda</hi>. <hi
                     rend="italic">Conrad,</hi> the son,
                  was three years younger, a homely youth, sickly, and of no promising disposition;
                  yet he was the darling of his father, who never showed any <pb n="2"
                     facs="pageImages/002.jpg"/> symptoms of affection to <hi rend="italic"
                           >Matilda</hi>. <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred</hi> had
                  contracted a marriage for his son with the Marquis of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Vicenza</hi>'s daughter, <hi rend="italic"
                           >Isabella</hi> ; and she had
                  already been delivered by her guardians into the hands of <hi rend="italic"
                           >Manfred,</hi> that he might
                  celebrate the wedding as soon as <hi rend="italic"
                     >Conrad</hi>'s infirm state of health would permit. <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred</hi>'s
                  impatience for this ceremonial was remarked by his family and neighbours. The
                  former indeed, apprehending the severity of their Prince's disposition, did not
                  dare to utter their surmises on this precipitation. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita,</hi> his wife, an amiable lady, did
                  sometimes venture to represent the danger of marrying their only son so early,
                  considering his great youth, and greater infirmities; but she never received any
                  other answer than reflections on her own sterility, who had given him but one
                  heir. His <ref>tenants and subjects</ref> were less cautious in their discourses:
                  They attributed this hasty wedding to the Prince's dread of seeing accomplished an
                  ancient prophecy, which was said to have pronounced, that <hi rend="italic">the
                     Castle and Lordship of</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="pageImages/003.jpg"/> Otranto <hi rend="italic"> should pass from
                     the present family, whenever the real owner should be grown too large to
                     inhabit it. </hi> It was difficult to make any sense of this prophecy; and
                  still less easy to conceive what it had to do with the marriage in question. Yet
                  these mysteries, or contradictions, did not make the populace adhere the less to
                  their opinion. </p>
               <p> Young <hi rend="italic">Conrad</hi>'s birth-day was fixed
                  for his espousals. The company was assembled in the chapel of the Castle, and
                  every thing ready for beginning the divine office, when <hi rend="italic"
                        >Conrad</hi> himself was missing. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> impatient of the least delay, and who had
                  not observed his son retire, dispatched on of his attendants to summon the young
                  Prince. The servant, who had not staid long enough to have crossed the court to
                     <hi rend="italic">Conrad</hi>'s apartment, came running
                  back breathless, in a frantic manner, his eyes staring, and foaming at the mouth.
                  He said nothing, but pointed to the court. The company were struck with ter ror
                  and amazement. The Princess <hi rend="italic">Hippolita,</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="pageImages/004.jpg"/> without knowing what was the matter, but
                  anxious for her son, swooned away. <hi rend="italic"
                     >Manfred,</hi> less apprehensive than enraged at the
                  procrastination of the nuptials, and at the folly of his domestic, asked
                  imperiously, what was the matter? The fellow made no
                  answer, but continued pointing towards the court-yard; and at last, after repeated
                  questions put to him, cried out, oh! The helmet! the
                     helmet! In the mean time, some of the company had run into the court,
                  from whence was heard a confused noise of shrieks, horror, and surprise. <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> who began to be alarmed at not
                  seeing his son, went himself to get information of what occasioned this strange
                  confusion. <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi> remained
                  endeavouring to assist her mother, and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella</hi> staid for the same purpose, and to avoid
                  showing any impatience for the bridegroom, for whom, in truth, she had conceived
                  little affection. </p>
               <p> The first thing that struck <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi>'s
                  eyes was a groupe of his servants endeavouring to raise something that appeared to
                  him a mountain <pb n="5" facs="pageImages/005.jpg"/> of sable plumes. He gazed
                  without believing his sight. What are ye doing? cried
                     <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> wrathfully; where is my son? A volley of voices replied, Oh! My Lord! The Prince! the Prince, the helmet! the
                     helmet! shocked with these lamentable sounds, and dreading he know not
                  what; he advanced hastily,—but what a sight for a father's eyes!—he beheld his
                  child dashed to pieces, and almost buried under an enormous helmet, an hundred
                  times more large than any <ref>casque</ref> ever made for human being, and shaded
                  with a proportionable quantity of black feathers. </p>
               <p> The horror of the spectacle, the ignorance of all around how this misfortune had
                  happened, and above all, the tremendous phaenomenon before him, took away the
                  Prince's speech. Yet his silence lasted longer than even grief could occasion. He
                  fixed his eyes on what he wished in vain to believe a vision; and seemed less
                  attentive to his loss, than buried in meditation on the stupendous object that had
                  occasioned <pb n="6" facs="pageImages/006.jpg"/> it. He touched, he examined the
                  fatal casque; nor could even the bleeding mangled remains of the young Prince,
                  divert the eyes of <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> from the
                  portent before him. All who had known his partial fondness for young <hi
                     rend="italic">Conrad,</hi> were as much surprized at their
                  Prince's insensibility, as thunder-struck themselves at the miracle of the helmet.
                  They conveyed the disfigured corpse into the hall, without receiving the least
                  direction from <hi rend="italic">Manfred.</hi> As little was
                  he attentive to the Ladies who remained in the chapel: On the contrary, without
                  mentioning the unhappy Princesses, his wife and daughter, the first sounds that
                  dropped from <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi>'s lips were,
                     take care of the lady <hi rend="italic"
                           >Isabella</hi>. </p>
               <p> The domestics, without observing the singularity of this direction, were guided
                  by their affection to their mistress, to consider it as peculiarly addressed to
                  her situation, and flew to her assistance. They conveyed her to her chamber more
                  dead than alive, and indifferent to all the strange circumstances she heard,
                  except the <pb n="7" facs="pageImages/007.jpg"/> death of her son. <hi
                     rend="italic">Matilda,</hi> who doated on her mother,
                  smothered her own grief and amazement, and thought of nothing but assisting and
                  comforting her afflicted parent. <hi rend="italic"
                     >Isabella,</hi> who had been treated by <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita</hi> like a daughter, and who returned that
                  tenderness with equal duty and affection, was scarce less <ref>assiduous</ref>
                  about the Princess; at the same time endeavouring to partake and lessen the weight
                  of sorrow which she saw <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi> strove
                  to suppress, for whom she had conceived the warmest sympathy of friendship. Yet
                  her own situation could not help finding its place in her thoughts. She felt no
                  concern for the death of young <hi rend="italic">Conrad,</hi>
                  except commiseration; and she was not sorry to be delivered from a marriage which
                  had promised her little felicity, either from her destined bridegroom, or from the
                  severe temper of <hi rend="italic">
                     Manfred, </hi> who, though he had distinguished her by
                  great indulgence, had imprinted her mind with terror, from <ref>his causeless
                     rigour</ref> to such amiable Princesses as <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="pageImages/008.jpg"/> While the Ladies were conveying the wretched
                  mother to her bed, <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> remained in
                  the court, gazing on the ominous casque, and regardless of the crowd which the
                  strangeness of the event had now assembled around him. The few words he
                  articulated, tended solely to inquiries, whether any man knew
                     from whence it could have come? Nobody could give him the least
                  information. However, as it seemed to be the sole object of his curiosity, it soon
                  became so to the rest of the spectators, whose conjectures were as absurd and
                  improbable, as the catastrophe itself was unprecedented. In the midst of their
                  senseless guesses, a young peasant, whom rumour had drawn thither from a
                  neighbouring village, observed that the miraculous helmet was exactly like that on
                  the figure in black marble of <hi rend="italic">Alfonso</hi> the
                     Good, one of their former Princes, in <placeName>the church of St.
                        <hi rend="italic"> Nicholas. </hi></placeName>
                  Villain! What sayest thou! cried <hi rend="italic">
                     Manfred, </hi> starting from his trance in a tempest of
                  rage, and seizing the young man by the collar; <pb n="9" facs="pageImages/009.jpg"/>
                  how darest thou utter such treason? thy life shall pay for
                     it. The spectators, who as little comprehended the cause of the Prince's
                  fury as all the rest they had seen, were at a loss to unravel this new
                  circumstance. The young peasant himself was still more astonished, not conceiving
                  how he had offended the Prince: Yet recollecting himself, with a mixture of grace
                  and humility, he disengaged himself from <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi>'s gripe, and then with an obeisance,
                  which discovered more jealousy of innocence, than dismay; he asked, with respect,
                     of what he was guilty!
                  <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> more enraged at the vigour,
                  however decently exerted, with which the young man had shaken off his hold, than
                  appeased by his submission, ordered his attendants to seize him, and, if he had
                  not been withheld by his friends, whom he had invited to the nuptials, would have
                     <ref>poignarded</ref> the peasant in their arms. </p>
               <p> During this altercation, some of the vulgar spectators had run to the great
                  church, which stood near the castle, and came back <pb n="10"
                     facs="pageImages/010.jpg"/> open-mouthed, declaring, that the helmet was
                  missing from <hi rend="italic">Alfonso</hi>'s statue. <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> at this news, grew perfectly
                  frantic; and, as if he sought a subject on which to vent the tempest within him,
                  he rushed again on the young peasant, crying, Villain!
                     Monster! Sorcerer! 'tis thou hast done this! 'tis thou hast slain my
                     son! The mob, who wanted some object within the scope of their
                  capacities, on whom they might discharge their bewildered reasonings, caught the
                  words from the mouth of their Lord, and re-ecchoed, ay, ay;
                     'tis he, 'tis he: He has stolen the helmet from good <hi rend="italic"
                        >Alfonso</hi>'s tomb, and dashed out the brains of our young Prince with
                     it,—never reflecting how enormous the disproportion was between the
                  marble helmet that had been in the church, and that of steel before their eyes;
                  nor how impossible it was for a youth, seemingly not twenty, to weild a piece of
                  armour of so prodigious a weight. </p>
               <p> The folly of these ejaculations brought <hi rend="italic">
                     Manfred
                  </hi> to himself: Yet whether provoked at the <pb n="11" facs="pageImages/011.jpg"
                  /> peasant having observed the resemblance between the two helmets, and thereby
                  led to the farther discovery of the absence of that in the church; or wishing to
                  bury any fresh rumours under so impertinent a supposition; he gravely pronounced
                  that the young man was certainly a negromancer, and that till
                     the church could take cognizance of the affair, he would have the Magician,
                     whom they had thus detected, kept prisoner under the helmet itself,
                  which he ordered his attendants to raise, and place the young
                     man under it; declaring he should be kept there
                     without food, with which his own infernal art might furnish him. </p>
               <p> It was in vain for the youth to represent against this preposterous sentence: In
                  vain did <hi rend="italic">
                     Manfred
                  </hi>'s friends endeavour to divert him from this savage and ill-grounded
                  resolution. The generality were charmed with their Lord's decision, which, to
                  their apprehensions, carried great appearance of justice, as the Magician was to
                  be punished by the very instrument with which <pb n="12" facs="pageImages/012.jpg"
                  /> he had offended: Nor were they struck with the lest compunction at the
                  probability of the youth being starved, for they firmly believed, that, by his
                  diabolical skill, he could easily supply himself with nutriment. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> thus saw his commands even
                  chearfully obeyed, and appointing a guard with strict orders to prevent any food
                  being conveyed to the prisoner; he dismissed his friends and attendants, and
                  retired to his own chamber, after locking the gates of the castle, in which he
                  suffered none but his domestics to remain. </p>
               <p> In the mean time, the care and zeal of the young Ladies had brought the Princess
                     <hi rend="italic">Hippolita</hi> to herself, who amidst
                  the transports of her own sorrow, frequently demanded news of her Lord, would have
                  dismissed her attendants to watch over him, and at last enjoined <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda</hi> to leave her, and visit and comfort her
                  father. <hi rend="italic">Matilda,</hi> who <ref>wanted</ref>
                  no affectionate duty to <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi>
                  though she trembled at his austerity, obeyed the orders of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita,</hi> whom she tenderly recommended <pb
                     n="13" facs="pageImages/013.jpg"/> to <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella</hi> ; and enquiring of the domestics for her
                  father, was informed that he was retired to his chamber, and had commanded that
                     nobody should have admittance to him. Concluding
                  that he was immersed in sorrow for the death of her brother, and fearing to renew
                  his tears by the sight of his sole remaining child, she hesitated whether she
                  should break in upon his affliction; yet solicitude for him, backed by the
                  commands of her mother, encouraged her to venture disobeying the orders he had
                  given, a fault she had never been guilty of before. The gentle timidity of her
                  nature made her pause for some minutes at his door. She heard him traverse his
                  chamber backwards and forwards with disordered steps; a mood which increased her
                  apprehensions. She was however just going to beg admittance, when <hi
                     rend="italic">
                     Manfred
                  </hi> suddenly opened his door; and as it was now twilight, concurring with the
                  disorder of his mind, he did not distinguish the person, but asked angrily, who it was?
                  <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi> replied <pb n="14"
                     facs="pageImages/014.jpg"/> trembling, my dearest father,
                     it is I, your daughter.
                  <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> stepping back hastily, cried,
                     Begone, I do not want a daughter; and flinging back
                  abruptly, clapped the door against the terrified <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p> She was too well acquainted with her father's impetuosity to venture a second
                  intrusion. When she had a little recovered the shock of so bitter a reception, she
                  wiped away her tears to prevent the additional stab that the knowledge of it would
                  give to <hi rend="italic">Hippolita,</hi> who questioned her
                  in the most anxious terms on the health of <hi rend="italic">
                     Manfred, </hi> and how he bore his loss. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda</hi> assured her he was well, and supported
                  his misfortune with manly fortitude. But will he not let me
                     see him? said <hi rend="italic">Hippolita</hi>
                  mournfully; will he not permit me to blend my tears with
                     his, and shed a mother's sorrows in the bosom of her Lord? Or do you deceive
                     me, <hi rend="italic">Matilda?</hi> I know how <hi
                        rend="italic">Manfred</hi> doated on his son: Is not
                     the stroke too heavy for him? has he not sunk under it? —You do not answer
                     me—alas! I dread the <pb n="15" facs="pageImages/015.jpg"/> worst!—raise me, my
                     maidens; I will, I will see my Lord. Bear me to him instantly: He is dearer to
                     me even than my children.
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     Matilda
                  </hi> made signs to <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> to
                  prevent <hi rend="italic">Hippolita</hi>'s rising; and both
                  those lovely young women were using their gentle violence to stop and calm the
                  Princess, when a servant, on the part of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred,</hi> arrived and told <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella</hi> that his Lord
                     demanded to speak with her. </p>
               <p>
                  With me! cried <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella.</hi>
                  Go, said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita,</hi> relieved by a message from her Lord:
                     <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi>
                     cannot support the sight of his own family. He thinks you less disordered than
                     we are, and dreads the shock of my grief. Console him, dear <hi rend="italic"
                           >Isabella,</hi> and tell him I will smother my own
                     anguish rather than add to his.
               </p>
               <p> As it was now evening, the servant, who conducted <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella,</hi> bore a torch before her. When they came
                  to <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> who was walking
                  impatiently about the gallery, he started and said hastily, take away that light, and begone. Then shutting the door impetuously,
                  he flung <pb n="16" facs="pageImages/016.jpg"/> himself upon a bench against the
                  wall, and bad <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>
                  sit by him. She obeyed trembling. I sent for you, Lady, said he,—and then stopped under great appearance
                  of confusion. My Lord!
                  —Yes, I sent for you on a matter of great moment, resumed
                     he,—dry your tears, young Lady—you have lost your bridegroom.—Yes, cruel fate!
                     and I have lost the hopes of my race!—but <hi rend="italic"
                           >Conrad</hi> was not worthy of your
                     beauty—how! my Lord, said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella</hi> ; sure you do not
                     suspect me of not feeling the concern I ought: My duty and affection would have
                     always—think no more of him, interrupted <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred</hi> ; he was a
                     sickly puny child, and heaven has perhaps taken him away, that I might not
                     trust the honours of my house on so frail a foundation. The line of <hi
                        rend="italic">Manfred</hi> calls for numerous supports.
                     My foolish fondness for that boy blinded the eyes of my prudence—but it is
                     better as it is. I hope, in a few years, to have reason to rejoice at the death
                     of <hi rend="italic">Conrad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="pageImages/017.jpg"/> Words cannot paint the astonishment of <hi
                     rend="italic">
                     Isabella. </hi> At first she apprehended that grief had
                  disordered <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi>'s understanding.
                  Her next thought suggested that this strange discourse was designed to ensnare
                  her: She feared that <hi rend="italic">
                     Manfred
                  </hi> had perceived her indifference for his son: And in consequence of that idea
                  she replied, Good my Lord, do not doubt my tenderness: My
                     heart would have accompanied my hand. <hi rend="italic"
                           >Conrad</hi> would have engrossed all my care; and
                     wherever fate shall dispose of me, I shall always cherish his memory, and
                     regard your Highness and the virtuous <hi rend="italic"
                           >Hippolita</hi> as my parents.
                  Curse on <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita!</hi> cried <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred:</hi>
                  Forget her from this moment as I do. In short, Lady, you have
                     missed a husband undeserving of your charms: They shall now be better disposed
                     of. Instead of a sickly boy, you shall have a husband in the prime of his age,
                     who will know how to value your beauties, and who may expect a numerous
                     offspring. Alas! My Lord, said <hi
                     rend="italic">Isabella,</hi>
                  my mind is too sadly engrossed by the recent catastrophe <pb
                        n="18" facs="pageImages/018.jpg"/> in your family to think of another
                     marriage. If ever my father returns, and it shall be his pleasure, I shall
                     obey, as I did when I consented to give my hand to your son: But until his
                     return, permit me to remain under your hospitable roof, and employ the
                     melancholy hours in asswaging yours, <hi rend="italic"
                           >Hippolita</hi>'s, and the fair <hi rend="italic"
                           >Matilda</hi>'s affliction.</p>
               <p>
                  I desired you once before, said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> an grily, not to
                     name that woman: From this hour she must be a stranger to you, as she must be
                     to me;—in short, <hi rend="italic">Isabella,</hi> since I
                     cannot give you my son, I offer you myself.—Heavens! cried <hi rend="italic">Isabella,</hi>
                  waking from her delusion, what do I hear! You! My Lord! You!
                     My father-in-law! the father of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Conrad!</hi> the husband of the virtuous and tender
                        <hi rend="italic">Hippolita!</hi>
                  —I tell you, said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> imperiously, <hi
                        rend="italic">Hippolita</hi> is no longer my wife,
                        <ref>I divorce her</ref> from this hour. Too long has she cursed me by her
                     unfruitfulness: My fate depends on having sons,—and this night I trust will
                     give a new date to my <pb n="19" facs="pageImages/019.jpg"/> hopes. At
                  those words he seized the cold hand of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella,</hi> who was half-dead with fright and
                  horror. She shrieked and started from him. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> rose to pursue her, when the moon, which
                  was now up and gleamed in at the opposite casement, presented to his fight the
                  plumes of the fatal helmet, which rose to the height of the windows, waving
                  backwards and forwards in a tempestuous manner, and accompanied with a hollow and
                  rustling sound. <hi rend="italic">Isabella,</hi> who gathered
                  courage from her situation, and who dreaded nothing so much as <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi>'s pursuit of his declaration, cried,
                     Look! My Lord; see, heaven itself declares against your
                     impious intentions!
                  —Heaven nor hell shall impede my designs, said <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> advancing again to seize the
                  Princess. At that instant the portrait of his grandfather, which hung over the
                  bench where they had been sitting, uttered a deep
                     sigh, and heaved its breast. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella,</hi> whose back was turned to the picture,
                  saw not the motion, nor knew whence the sound came, but started, and said, Hark, my Lord! What sound was that?
                  <pb n="20" facs="pageImages/020.jpg"/> and at the same time made towards the door.
                     <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> distracted between the
                  flight of <hi rend="italic">
                     Isabella, </hi> who had now reached the stairs, and yet
                  unable to keep his eyes from the picture which began to move, had however advanced
                  some steps after her, still looking backwards on the portrait, when he saw it quit
                  its pannel, and descend on the floor with a grave and melancholy air. Do I dream? cried <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> returning, or are
                     the devils themselves in league against me? speak, infernal spectre! or, if
                     thou art my grandsire, why dost thou too conspire against thy wretched
                     descendent, who too dearly pays for—e'er he could finish the sentence,
                  the vision sighed again, and made a sign to <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred</hi> to follow him. Lead on! cried <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> ; I will follow thee
                     to the guiph of perdition. The spectre marched sedately, but dejected,
                  to the end of the gallery, and turned into a chamber on the right-hand. <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred</hi> accompanied him at a little
                  distance, full of anxiety and horror, but resolved. As he would have entered the
                  chamber, the door was clapped <pb n="21" facs="pageImages/021.jpg"/> to with
                  violence by an invisible hand. The Prince, collecting courage from this delay,
                  would have forcibly burst open the door with his foot, but found that it resisted
                  his utmost efforts. Since hell will not satisfy my
                     curiosity, said <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi>
                  I will use the human means in my power for preserving my
                     race; <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> shall not escape
                     me.
               </p>
               <p> That Lady, whose resolution had given way to terror the moment she had quitted
                     <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> continued her flight to
                  the bottom of the principal staircase. There she stopped, not knowing whither to
                  direct her steps, nor how to escape from the impetuosity of the Prince. The gates
                  of the castle she knew were locked, and guards placed in the court. Should she, as her heart prompted her, go and
                     prepare <hi rend="italic">Hippolita</hi> for the cruel
                     destiny that awaited her; she did not doubt but <hi rend="italic"
                           >Manfred</hi> would seek her there, and that his
                     violence would incite him to double the injury he meditated, without leaving
                     room for them to avoid the impetuosity of his passions. <pb n="22"
                        facs="pageImages/022.jpg"/> Delay might give him time to reflect on the
                     horrid measures he had conceived, or produce some circumstance in her favour,
                     if she could for that night at least avoid his odious purpose.—Yet where
                     conceal herself! how avoid the pursuit he would infallibly make throughout the
                     castle! As these thoughts passed rapidly through her mind, she
                  recollected a subterraneous passage which led from the vaults of the castle to
                     <placeName>the church of St. <hi rend="italic">Nicholas.</hi></placeName> Could
                  she reach the altar before she was overtaken, she knew even <hi rend="italic"
                     >Manfied</hi>'s violence would not dare to profane the sacredness of the place;
                  and she determined, if no other means of deliverance offered, to shut herself up
                  for ever among the holy virgins, whose convent was contiguous to the cathedral. In
                  this resolution, she seized a lamp that burned at the foot of the staircase, and
                  hurried towards <ref>the secret passage</ref>. </p>
               <p> The lower part of the castle was hollowed into several intricate cloysters; and
                  it was not easy for one under so much anxiety to find the <pb n="23"
                     facs="pageImages/022.jpg"/> door that opened into the cavern. An awful silence
                  reigned throughout those subterraneous regions, except now and then some blasts of
                  wind that shook the doors she had passed, and which grating on the rusty hinges,
                  were reecchoed through that long labyrinth of darkness. Every murmur struck her
                  with new terror; —yet more she dreaded to hear the wrathful voice of <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred</hi> urging his domestics to pursue
                  her. She trod as softly as impatience would give her leave,—yet frequently stopped
                  and listened to hear if she was followed. In one of those moments she thought she
                  heard a sigh. She shuddered, and recoiled a few paces. In a moment she thought she
                  heard the step of some person. Her blood curdled; she concluded it was <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred.</hi> Every suggestion that horror
                  could inspire rushed into her mind. She condemned her rash flight, which had thus
                  exposed her to his rage in a place where her cries were not likely to draw any
                  body to her assist ance. —Yet the sound seemed not to come from <pb n="24"
                     facs="pageImages/024.jpg"/> behind,—if <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> knew where she was, he must have followed
                  her: She was still in one of the cloysters, and the steps she had heard were too
                  distinct to proceed from the way she had come. Cheared with this reflection, and
                  hoping to find a friend in whoever was not the Prince; she was going to advance,
                  when a door that stood a jar, at some distance to the left, was opened gently: But
                  e'er her lamp, which she held up, could discover who opened it, the person
                  retreated precipitately on seeing the light. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Isabella,</hi> whom every incident was
                  sufficient to dismay, hesitated whether she should proceed. Her dread of <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred</hi> soon outweighed every other
                  terror. The very circumstance of the person avoiding her, gave her a sort of
                  courage. It could only be, she thought,
                     some domestic belonging to the
                     castle. Her gentleness had never raised her an enemy, and conscious
                  innocence bade her hope that, unless sent by the Prince's order to seek her, his
                  servants would <pb n="25" facs="pageImages/025.jpg"/>rather assist than prevent
                  her flight. Fortifying herself with these reflections, and believing by what she
                  could observe, that she was near the mouth of the subterraneous cavern, she
                  approached the door that had been opened; but a sudden gust of wind that met her
                  at the door, extinguished her lamp, and left her in total darkness. </p>
               <p> Words cannot paint the horror of the Princess's situation. Alone in so dismal a
                  place, her mind imprinted with all the terrible events of the day, hopeless of
                  escaping, expecting every moment the arrival of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred,</hi> and far from tranquil on knowing she was
                  within reach of somebody, she knew not whom, who for some cause seemed concealed
                  thereabouts, all these thoughts crouded on her distracted mind, and she was ready
                  to sink under her apprehensions. She addressed herself to every Saint in heaven,
                  and inwardly implored their assistance. For a considerable time she remained in an
                  agony of despair. At last, as softly as was possible, she <pb n="26"
                     facs="pageImages/026.jpg"/> felt for the door, and having found it, entered
                  trembling into the vault from whence she had heard the sigh and steps. It gave her
                  a kind of momentary joy to perceive an imperfect ray of clouded moonshine gleam
                  from the roof of the vault, which seemed to be fallen in, and from whence hung a
                  fragment of earth or building, she could not distinguish which, that appeared to
                  have been crushed inwards. She advanced eagerly towards this chasm, when she
                  discerned a human form standing close against the wall. </p>
               <p> She shrieked, believing it the ghost of her betrothed <hi rend="italic"
                        >Conrad.</hi> The figure advancing, said in a
                  submissive voice, be not alarmed, Lady; I will not injure
                     you.
                  <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> a little encouraged by the
                  words and tone of voice of the stranger, and recollecting that this must be the
                  person who had opened the door, recovered her spirits enough to reply, Sir, whoever you are, take pity on
                     a wretched Princess, standing on the brink of destruction: Assist me to escape
                     from this fatal castle, or in few moments I may be <pb n="27"
                        facs="pageImages/027.jpg"/> made miserable for ever.
                  Alas! said the stranger, what can
                     I do to assist you? I will die in your defence; but I am unacquainted with the
                     castle, and want—Oh! said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella,</hi> hastily interrupting him, help me but to find a trapdoor that must be hereabout, and it
                     is the greatest service you can do me, for I have not a minute to lose.
                  Saying these words, she felt about on the pavement, and directed the stranger to
                  search likewise for a smooth piece of brass inclosed in one of the stones. That, said she, is the lock, which
                     opens with a spring, of which I know the secret. If we can find that, I may
                     escape—if not, alas! courteous stranger, I fear, I shall have involved you in
                     my misfortunes: <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> will
                     suspect you for the accomplice of my flight, and you will fall a victim to his
                     resentment.
                  I value not my life, said the stranger, and it will be some comfort to lose it, in trying to deliver you
                     from his tyranny.
                  Generous youth, said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella,</hi>
                  how shall I ever requite— as she uttered those words,
                  a ray of moonshine <pb n="28" facs="pageImages/028.jpg"/>streaming through a
                  cranny of the ruin above shone directly on the lock they sought—Oh! transport! said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella,</hi>
                  here is the trap-door! and taking out a key, she
                  touched the spring, which starting aside, discovered an iron ring. Lift up the door, said the Princess. The stranger
                  obeyed; and beneath appeared some stone steps descending into a vault totally
                  dark. We must go down here, said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella:</hi>
                  Follow me; dark and dismal as it is, we cannot miss our way;
                     it leads directly to the church of St. <hi rend="italic"> Nicholas </hi>—but
                     perhaps, added the Princess modestly, you have no
                     reason to leave the castle, nor have I farther occasion for your service; in
                     few minutes I shall be safe from <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi>'s rage—only let me know to whom I am so
                     much obliged.
                  I will never quit you, said the stranger eagerly,
                     until I have placed you in safety—nor think me, Princess,
                     more generous than I am; though you are my principal care——the stranger
                  was interrupted by a sudden noise of voices that seemed approaching, and they soon
                  distinguished <pb n="29" facs="pageImages/029.jpg"/>these words: Talk not to me of necromancers: I tell you she must be in the
                     castle: I will find her in spite of enchantment—Oh! heavens, cried <hi rend="italic"
                     >Isabella,</hi>
                  it is the voice of <hi rend="italic"
                           >Manfred!</hi> make haste or we are ruined! and shut
                     the trapdoor after you. Saying this, she descended the steps
                  precipitately, and as the stranger hastened to follow her, he let the door slip
                  out of his hands: it fell, and the spring closed over it. He tried in vain to open
                  it, not having observed <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>'s
                  method of touching the spring: nor had he many moments to make an essay. The noise
                  of the falling door had been heard by <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred,</hi> who directed by the sound, hastened
                  thither, attended by his servants with torches. It must be
                        <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> ; cried <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred</hi> before he entered the vault;
                     she is escaping by the subterraneous passage, but she
                     cannot have got far.—What was the astonishment of the Prince, when,
                  instead of <hi rend="italic">Isabella,</hi> the light of the
                  torches discovered to him the young peasant, whom he thought consined under the
                  fatal <pb n="30" facs="pageImages/030.jpg"/> helmet: Traitor! said <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> how camest thou here? I thought thee in durance above in the
                     court.
                  I am no traitor, replied the young man boldly, nor am I
                     answerable for your thoughts.
                  Presumptuous villain! cried <hi rend="italic">
                     Manfred, </hi>
                  dost thou provoke my wrath? tell me; how hast thou escaped
                     from above? thou hast corrupted thy guards, and their lives shall answer
                     it.
                  My poverty, said the peasant calmly, will <ref>disculpate</ref> them: Though the ministers of a tyrant's wrath,
                     to thee they are faithful, and but too willing to execute the orders which you
                     unjustly imposed upon them.
                  Art thou so hardy as to dare my vengeance? said the
                     Prince—but tortures shall force the truth from thee. Tell
                     me, I will know thy accomplices.
                  There was my accomplice! said the youth smiling, and
                  pointing to the roof. <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> ordered
                  the torches to be held up, and perceived that one of the cheeks of the enchanted
                  casque had forced its way through the pavement of the court, as his servants had
                     <pb n="31" facs="pageImages/031.jpg"/> let it fall over the peasant, and had
                  broken through into the vault, leaving a gap through which the peasant had pressed
                  himself some minutes before he was found by <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella.</hi>
                  Was that the way by which thou didst descend? said <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred.</hi>
                  It was; said the youth.
                  But what noise was that, said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred,</hi>
                  which I heard as I entered the cloyster?
                  a door clapped: said the peasant; I heard it as well as you.
                  What door? said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> hastily. I am not
                     acquainted with your castle; said the peasant; this
                     is the first time I ever entered it; and this vault the only part of it within
                     which I ever was.
                  But I tell thee, said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> [wishing to find out if the youth had
                  discovered the trap-door] it was this way I heard the noise: My servants
                     heard it too—my Lord, interrupted one of
                  them officiously, to be sure it was the trap-door, and he
                     was going to make his escape.
                  Peace! blockhead, said the Prince angrily; if he was going to escape, how should he come on this side? I
                     will know from his <pb n="32" facs="pageImages/032.jpg"/>own mouth what noise
                     it was I heard. Tell me truly; thy life depends on thy veracity.
                  My veracity is dearer to me than my life; said the
                  peasant; nor would I purchase the one by forfeiting the
                     other.
                  Indeed! young philosopher! said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> contemptuously; tell
                     me then, what was the noise I heard?
                  Ask me what I can answer, said he, and put me to death instantly if I tell you a lie.
                  <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> growing impatient at the
                  steady valour and indifference of the youth, cried, Well
                     then, thou man of truth! answer; was it the fall of the trap-door that I
                     heard?
                  It was; said the youth. It
                     was! said the Prince; and how didst thou come to
                     know there was a trap-door here?
                  I saw the plate of brass by a gleam of moonshine;
                  replied he. But what told thee it was a lock? said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> ; How didst thou
                     discover the secret of opening it?
                  Providence, that delivered me from the helmet, was able to
                     direct me to the spring of a lock; said he. Providence should have gone a little farther, and have placed thee out of the
                     reach of my resentment,
                  <pb n="33" facs="pageImages/033.jpg"/>said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred:</hi>
                  When Providence had taught thee to open the lock, it
                     abandoned thee for a fool, who did not know how to make use of its favours. Why
                     didst thou not pursue the path pointed out for thy escape? Why didst thou shut
                     the trap-door before thou hadst descended the steps?
                  I might ask you, my Lord, said the peasant, how I, totally unacquainted with your castle, was to know that
                     those steps led to any outlet? but I scorn to evade your questions. Wherever
                     those steps lead to, perhaps I should have explored the way—I could not be in a
                     worse situation than I was. But the truth is, I let the trap-door fall: Your
                     immediate arrival followed. I had given the alarm— what imported it to me
                     whether I was seized a minute sooner or a minute later?
                  Thou art a resolute villain for thy years; said <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred</hi>
                  — yet on reflection I suspect thou dost but trifle with me:
                     Thou hast not yet told me how thou didst open the lock.
                  That I will show you, my Lord; said the Peasant, and
                  taking up a fragment <pb n="34" facs="pageImages/034.jpg"/>of stone that had
                  fallen from above, he laid himself on the trap-door, and began to beat on the
                  piece of brass that covered it; meaning to gain time for the escape of the
                  Princess. This presence of mind, joined to the frankness of the youth, staggered
                     <hi rend="italic">Manfred.</hi> He even felt a disposition
                  towards pardoning one who had been guilty of no crime. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> was not one of those savage tyrants who
                  wanton in cruelty unprovoked. The circumstances of his fortune had given an
                  asperity to his temper, which was naturally humane; and his virtues were always
                  ready to operate, when his passions did not obscure his reason. </p>

               <p> While the Prince was in this suspence, a confused noise of voices ecchoed through
                  the distant vaults. As the sound approached, he distinguished the clamours of some
                  of his domestics, whom he had dispersed through the castle in search of <hi
                     rend="italic">Isabella,</hi> calling out, where is my Lord? where is the Prince?
                  Here I am; said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred,</hi> as they came nearer; have you found <pb n="35" facs="pageImages/035.jpg"/>the
                     Princess? the first that arrived, replied, oh! my
                     Lord! I am glad we have found you—found me!
                  said <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> ; have you found the Princess!
                  We thought we had, my Lord, said the fellow, looking
                     terrified—but—but
                     what? cried the Prince; has she
                     escaped?— <hi rend="italic">Jaquez</hi> and I, my
                     Lord—yes, I and <hi rend="italic">Diego,</hi>
                  interrupted the second, who came up in still greater consternation— speak one of you at a time, said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> ; I ask you where is
                     the Princess?
                  We do not know; said they both together; but we are frightened out of our wits—so I think, blockheads, said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> ; what is it has
                     scared you thus?—oh! my Lord, said <hi
                     rend="italic">Jaquez</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Diego</hi> has
                     seen such a sight! your Highness would not believe our eyes—what new absurdity is this! cried <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi>
                  —give me a direct answer, or by heav'n—why, my Lord, if it please your Highness to hear me, said
                  the poor fellow; <hi rend="italic">Diego</hi> and
                     I—yes I and <hi rend="italic">Jaquez,</hi>
                  cried his comrade —did not I forbid you to speak both at a
                     time? said the Prince: You, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Jaquez,</hi> answer; <pb n="36" facs="pageImages/036.jpg"/>for the other
                     fool seems more distracted than thou art: What is the matter?
                  my gracious Lord, said <hi rend="italic">Jaquez,</hi>
                  if it please your Highness to hear me; <hi rend="italic"
                        >Diego</hi> and I according to your Highness's orders went to search for the
                     young Lady; but being comprehensive that we might meet the ghost of my young
                     Lord, your Highness's son, God rest his soul, as he has not received christian
                     burial—sot! cried <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> in a rage, is it
                     only a ghost then that thou hast seen?
                  oh! worse! worse! my Lord, cried <hi rend="italic"
                     >Diego:</hi>
                  I had rather have seen ten whole ghosts—grant me patience! said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> ; these blockheads
                     distract me—out of my sight, <hi rend="italic">Diego!</hi> and thou, <hi
                        rend="italic">Jaquez,</hi> tell me in one word, art thou sober? art thou
                     raving? thou wast wont to have some sense: has the other sot frightened himself
                     and thee too! speak; what is it he fancies he has seen?
                  Why, my Lord, replied <hi rend="italic">Jaquez</hi> trembling,
                     I was going to tell your Highness, that since the calamitous misfortune
                     of my young Lord, God rest his precious soul! not one of us your <pb n="37"
                        facs="pageImages/037.jpg"/> Highness's faithful servants, indeed we are, my
                     Lord, though poor men; I say, not one of us has dared to set a soot about the
                     castle, but two together: So <hi rend="italic">Diego</hi> and I, thinking that
                     my young Lady might be in the great gallery, went up there to look for her, and
                     tell her your Highness wanted something to impart to her—
                  O blundering fools! cried <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred:</hi>
                  And in the mean time she has made her escape, because you were afraid of
                     goblins!—Why, thou knave! she left me in the gallery; I came from thence
                     myself.
                  For all that, she may be there still for ought I know; said <hi
                     rend="italic">Jaquez</hi> ; but the devil shall have me before I seek her
                     there again!—poor <hi rend="italic">Diego!</hi> I do not believe
                     he will ever recover it!
                  recover what? said <hi rend="italic"
                     >Manfred</hi> ; am I never to learn what it is has
                     terrified these rascals?—but I lose my time; follow me slave; I will see if she
                     is in the gallery—for heaven's sake, my dear good Lord,
                  cried <hi rend="italic">Jaquez,</hi>
                  do not go to the gallery! Satan himself I believe is in the great chamber
                     next to the gallery —
                  <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> who hitherto had treated the
                     <pb n="38" facs="pageImages/038.jpg"/>terror of his servants as an idle panic,
                  was struck at this new circumstance. He recollected the apparition of the
                  portrait, and the sudden closing of the door at the end of the gallery—his voice
                  faltered, and he asked with disorder, what is in the great chamber?
                  my Lord, said <hi rend="italic">Jaquez,</hi>
                  when <hi rend="italic">Diego</hi> and I came into the gallery, he went
                     first, for he said he had more courage than I. So when we came into the
                     gallery, we found nobody. We looked under every bench and stool; and still we
                     found nobody—were all the pictures in their places? said
                     <hi rend="italic">Manfred.</hi>
                  Yes, my Lord, answered <hi rend="italic">Jaquez</hi> ; but we
                     did not think of looking behind them—well, well! said <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred,</hi>
                  proceed.
                  When we came to the door of the great chamber, continued <hi
                     rend="italic">Jaquez,</hi>
                  we found it shut—and could not you open it? said <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred.</hi>
                  Oh! yes, my Lord, would to heaven we had not! replied he—nay,
                     it was not I neither, it was <hi rend="italic">Diego:</hi> he was grown
                     fool-hardy, and would go on, though I advised him not—if ever I open a door
                     that is shut again—trifle <pb n="39" facs="pageImages/039.jpg"
                     />not, said <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi>
                  shuddering, but tell me what you saw in the great chamber on opening the
                     door—I! my Lord! said <hi rend="italic">Jaquez,</hi>
                  I saw nothing; I was behind <hi rend="italic">Diego</hi> ;—but I heard the
                     noise— <hi rend="italic">Jaquez,</hi> said <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred</hi> in a solemn tone of voice;
                     tell me I adjure thee by the souls of my ancestors, what was it thou
                     sawest? what was it thou heardst?
                  It was <hi rend="italic">Diego</hi> saw it, my Lord, it was not I;
                  replied <hi rend="italic">Jaquez</hi> ; I only heard the noise. <hi
                        rend="italic">Diego</hi> had no sooner opened the door, than he cried out,
                     and ran back—I ran back too, and said, is it the ghost? the ghost! no, no, said
                        <hi rend="italic">Diego,</hi> and his hair stood an end—it is a giant I
                     believe; he is all clad in armour, for I saw his foot and part of his leg, and
                     they are as large as the helmet below in the court. As he said these words, my
                     Lord, we heard a violent motion and the ratling of armour, as if the giant was
                     rising, for <hi rend="italic">Diego</hi> has told me since, that he believes
                     the giant was lying down, for the foot and leg were stretched at length on the
                     floor. Before we could get to <pb n="40" facs="pageImages/040.jpg"/>the end of
                     the gallery, we heard the door of the great chamber clap behind us, but we did
                     not dare turn back to see if the giant was following us—yet now I think on it,
                     we must have heard him if he had pursued us—but for heaven's sake, good my
                     Lord, send for the chaplain and have the castle exorcised, for, for certain, it
                     is enchanted.
                  Ay, pray do, my Lord, cried all the servants at once, or we
                     must leave your Highness's service—peace! dotards; said <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred,</hi>
                  and follow me; I will know what all this means.
                  We! my Lord! cried they with one voice, we would not go up to
                     the gallery for your Highness's revenue. The young peasant, who had
                  stood silent, now spoke. Will your Highness, said he, permit me to try this
                     adventure? my life is of consequence to nobody: I fear no bad angel, and have
                     offended no good one.
                  Your behaviour is above your seeming; said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred,</hi>
                  viewing him with surprise and admiration—hereafter I will reward your
                     bravery—but now, continued he with a sigh, <pb n="41" facs="pageImages/041.jpg"
                     /> I am so circumstanced, that I dare trust no eyes but my own—however, I give
                     you leave to accompany me.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> when he first followed <hi
                     rend="italic">Isabella</hi> from the gallery, had gone
                  directly to the apartment of his wife, concluding the Princess had retired
                  thither. <hi rend="italic">Hippolita,</hi> who knew his step,
                  rose with anxious fondness to meet her Lord, who she had not seen since the death
                  of their son. She would have flown in a transport mixed of joy and grief to his
                  bosom, but the pushed her rudely off, and said, Where is <hi
                        rend="italic">
                        Isabella?</hi>
                  <hi rend="italic">Isabella! </hi> My
                     Lord! said the astonished <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita.</hi>
                  Yes; <hi rend="italic"
                     >Isabella</hi> ; cried <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> imperiously; I want
                        <hi rend="italic">Isabella.</hi>
                  My Lord, replied <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda,</hi> who perceived how much his behaviour had
                  shocked her mother, she has not been with us since your
                     Highness summoned her to your apartment.
                  Tell me where she is; said the Prince; I do not want to know where she has been.
                  My good Lord, said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita,</hi>
                  your daughter tells you the truth: <hi rend="italic"
                           >Isabella</hi> left us by your command, <pb n="42"
                        facs="pageImages/042.jpg"/>and has not returned since;—but, my good Lord,
                     compose yourself: Retire to your rest: This dismal day has disordered you. <hi
                        rend="italic">
                        Isabella
                     </hi> shall wait your orders in the morning.
                  What then, you know where she is! cried <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred:</hi>
                  Tell me directly, for I will not lose an instant—and you,
                     woman, speaking to his wife, order your chaplain to attend me forthwith.
                  <hi rend="italic"
                     >Isabella,</hi> said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita</hi> calmly, is
                     retired, I suppose to her chamber: She is not accustomed to watch at this late
                     hour. Gracious my Lord, continued she, let me
                     know what has disturbed you: Has <hi rend="italic"
                           >Isabella</hi> offended you?
                  Trouble me not with questions, said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred,</hi>
                  but tell me where she is.
                  <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi> shall
                     call her, said the Princess—Sit down, my Lord, and resume your
                     wonted fortitude.—What, art thou jealous of <hi
                        rend="italic">Isabella,</hi> replied he, that you wish to be present at our interview?
                  Good heavens! my Lord, said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita,</hi>
                  what is it your Highness means?
                  Thou wilt know ere many minutes are passed; said the cruel
                     Prince. Send <pb n="43" facs="pageImages/043.jpg"/> your chaplain to me, and
                     wait my pleasure here. At these words he flung out of the room in search
                  of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> ; leaving the amazed
                  Ladies thunder-struck with his words and frantic deportment, and lost in vain
                  conjectures on what he was meditating. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> was now returning from the
                  vault, attended by the peasant and a few of his servants whom he had obliged to
                  accompany him. He ascended the stair-case without stopping till he arrived at the
                  gallery, at the door of which he met <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita</hi> and her chaplain. When <hi
                     rend="italic">Diego</hi> had been dismissed by <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred,</hi> he had gone directly to the Princess's
                  apartment with the alarm of what he had seen. That excellent Lady, who no more
                  than <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> doubted of the reality
                  of the vision, yet affected to treat it as a delirium of the servant. Willing,
                  however, to save her Lord from any additional shock, and prepared by a series of
                  grief not to tremble at any accession to it; she determined to make herself the
                  first sacrifice, if fate had marked the <pb n="44" facs="pageImages/044.jpg"
                  />present hour for their destruction. Dismissing the reluctant <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda</hi> to her rest, who in vain sued for leave
                  to accompany her mother, and attended only by her chaplain, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita</hi> had visited the gallery and great
                  chamber; and now with more serenity of soul than she had felt for many hours, she
                  met her Lord, and assured him that the vision of the gigantic leg and foot was all
                  a fable; and no doubt an impression made by fear, and the dark and dismal hour of
                  the night on the minds of his servants. She and the chaplain had examined the
                  chamber, and found every thing in the usual order. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> though persuaded, like his
                  wife, that the vision had been no work of fancy, recovered a little from the
                  tempest of mind into which so many strange events had thrown him. Ashamed too of
                  his inhuman treatment of a Princess, who returned every injury with new marks of
                  tenderness and duty; he felt returning love forcing itself into his eyes—but not
                  less ashamed of seeling remorse towards one, against whom <pb n="45"
                     facs="pageImages/045.jpg"/>he was inwardly meditating a yet more bitter
                  outrage; he curbed the yearnings of his heart, and did not dare to lean even
                  towards pity. The next transition of his soul was to exquisite villainy. Presuming
                  on the unshaken submission of <hi rend="italic"
                     >Hippolita,</hi> He flattered himself that she wou'd not
                  only acquiesce with patience to a divorce, but would obey if it was his pleasure,
                  in endeavouring to persuade <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>
                  to give him her hand —but e'er he could indulge this horrid hope, he reflected
                  that <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> was not to be found.
                  Coming to himself, he gave orders that every avenue to the castle should be
                  strictly guarded, and charged his domestics on pain of their lives to suffer
                  nobody to pass out. The young peasant, to whom he spoke favourably, he ordered to
                  remain in a small chamber on the stairs, in which there was a pallet-bed, and the
                  key of which he took away himself, telling the youth he would talk with him in the
                  morning. Then dismissing his attendants, and bestowing a sullen kind of half-nod
                  on <hi rend="italic">Hippolita,</hi> he retired to his own
                  chamber. </p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Matilda,</hi> who by <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita</hi>'s order, had retired to her apartment,
                  was ill-disposed to take any rest. The shocking fate of her brother had deeply
                  affected her. She was surprized at not seeing <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella:</hi> But the strange words which had fallen
                  from her father, and his obscure menace to the Princess his wife, accompanied by
                  the most furious behaviour, had filled her gentle mind with terror and alarm. She
                  waited anxiously for the return of <hi rend="italic">Bianca,</hi> a young damsel
                  that attended her, whom she had sent to learn what was become of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella. Bianca</hi> soon appeared and informed her
                  mistress of what she had gathered from the servants, that <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella</hi> was no where to be found. She related
                  the adventure of the young peasant, who <pb n="47" facs="pageImages/047.jpg"/>had
                  been discovered in the vault, tho' with many simple additions from the incoherent
                  accounts of the domestics; and she dwelled principally on the gigantic leg and
                  foot which had been seen in the gallery-chamber. This last circumstance had
                  terrified <hi rend="italic">Bianca</hi> so much, that she was rejoiced when <hi
                     rend="italic">Matilda</hi> told her that she would not go
                  to rest, but would watch till the Princess should rise. </p>
               <p> The young Princess wearied herself in conjectures on the flight of <hi
                     rend="italic">Isabella,</hi> and on the threats of <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred</hi> to her mother. But what
                     business could he have so urgent with the chaplain? said <hi
                     rend="italic">Matilda.</hi>
                  Does he intend to have my brother's body interred privately in the
                     chapel?
                  Oh! Madam, said <hi rend="italic">Bianca,</hi>
                  now I guess. As you are become his heiress, he is impatient to have you
                     married: He has always been raving for more sons; I warrant he is now impatient
                     for grandsons. As sure as I live, Madam, I shall see you a bride at last—Good
                     Madam, you won't cast off your faithful <hi rend="italic">Bianca:</hi> You wont
                        <pb n="48" facs="pageImages/048.jpg"/> put <hi rend="italic">Donna
                        Rosara</hi> over me, now you are a great Princess.
                  My poor <hi rend="italic">Bianca,</hi> said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda,</hi>
                  how fast your thoughts amble! I a great Princess! What hast thou seen in <hi
                        rend="italic">Manfred</hi>'s behaviour since my
                     brother's death that bespeaks any in crease of tenderness to me? No, <hi
                        rend="italic">Bianca</hi> ; his heart was ever a stranger to me—but he is my
                     father, and I must not complain. Nay, if heaven shuts my father's heart against
                     me, it overpays my little merit in the tenderness of my mother —O that dear
                     mother! yes, <hi rend="italic">Bianca,</hi> 'tis there I feel the rugged temper
                     of <hi rend="italic">Manfred.</hi> I can support his
                     harshness to me with patience; but it wounds my soul when I am witness to his
                     causeless severity towards her.
                  Oh! Madam, said <hi rend="italic">Bianca,</hi>
                  all men use their wives so, when they are weary of them—and yet
                     you congratulated me but now, said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda,</hi>
                  when you fancied my father intended to dispose of me.
                  I would have you a great Lady, replied <hi rend="italic">Bianca,</hi>
                  come what will. I do not wish to see you moped in a convent, as you would be
                     if you had your <pb n="49" facs="pageImages/049.jpg"/>will, and if my Lady,
                     your mother, who knows that a bad husband is better than no husband at all, did
                     not hinder you—bless me! what noise is that! St. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Nicholas</hi> forgive me! I was but in jest.
                  It is the wind, said <hi rend="italic"
                     >Matilda,</hi>
                  whistling through the battlements in the tower above: You have heard it a
                     thousand times.
                  Nay, said <hi rend="italic">Bianca,</hi>
                  there was no harm neither in what I said: It is no sin to talk of
                     matrimony—and so, Madam, as I was saying; if my Lord <hi rend="italic">
                        Manfred
                     </hi> should offer you a handsome young Prince for a bridegroom, you would drop
                     him a curtsy, and tell him you had rather take the veil.
                  Thank heaven! I am in no such danger, said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda:</hi>
                  You know how many proposals for me he has rejected—and you
                     thank him, like a dutiful daughter, do you, Madam?—but come, Madam; suppose,
                     to-morrow morning he was to send for you to the great council chamber, and
                     there you should find at his elbow a lovely young Prince, with large black
                     eyes, a smooth white forehead, and manly curling <pb n="50"
                        facs="pageImages/050.jpg"/> locks like jet; in short, Madam, a young Hero
                     resembling the picture of the good <hi rend="italic">Alfonso</hi> in the
                     gallery, which you sit and gaze at for hours together—do not speak
                     lightly of that picture, interrupted <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda</hi> sighing: I know the adoration with
                     which I look at that picture is uncommon —but I am not in love with a coloured
                     pannel. The character of that virtuous Prince, the veneration with which my
                     mother has inspired me for his memory, the orisons which I know not why she has
                     enjoined me to pour forth at his tomb, all have concurred to persuade me that
                     some how or other my destiny is linked with something relating to
                     him—Lord! Madam, how should that be? said <hi rend="italic"
                     >Bianca:</hi>
                  I have always heard that your family was no way related to his: And I am
                     sure I cannot conceive why my Lady, the Princess, sends you in a cold morning
                     or a damp evening to pray at his tomb: He is no Saint by the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Almanack.</hi> If you must pray, why does not she bid you address yourself
                     to our great St. <hi rend="italic">Nicholas?</hi> I am sure he <pb n="51"
                        facs="pageImages/051.jpg"/> is the Saint I pray to for a husband.
                  Perhaps my mind would be less affected, said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda,</hi>
                  if my mother would explain her reasons to me: But it is the mystery she
                     observes, that inspires me with this—I know not what to call it. As she never
                     acts from caprice, I am sure there is some fatal secret at bottom—nay, I know
                     there is: In her agony of grief for my brother's death she dropped some words
                     that intimated as much
                  —oh! dear Madam, cried <hi rend="italic">Bianca,</hi>
                  What were they?
                  No; said <hi rend="italic">Matilda,</hi>
                  if a parent lets fall a word, and wishes it recalled, it is not for a child
                     to utter it.
                  What! was she sorry for what she had said? asked <hi rend="italic"
                     >Bianca.</hi>
                  —I am sure, Madam, you may trust me—with my own little secrets,
                     when I have any, I may; said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda</hi> ; but never with my mother's: A
                     child ought to have no ears or eyes, but as a parent directs.
                     Well! to be sure, Madam, you was born to be a saint, said <hi
                     rend="italic">Bianca,</hi>
                  and there is no resisting one's vocation: You will end in a convent at last.
                     But there is my Lady <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>
                     <pb n="52" facs="pageImages/052.jpg"/>would not be so reserved to me: She will
                     let me talk to her of young men; and when a handsome cavalier has come to the
                     castle, she had owned to me that she wished your brother <hi rend="italic"
                           >Conrad</hi> resembled him.
                  <hi rend="italic">Bianca,</hi> said the Princess, I do not
                     allow you to mention my friend disrespectfully. <hi rend="italic"
                           >Isabella</hi> is of a chearful disposition, but her
                     soul is pure as virtue itself. She knows your idle babling humour, and perhaps
                     has now and then encouraged it, to divert melancholy, and enliven the solitude
                     in which my father keeps us—Blessed <hi rend="italic"
                     >Mary!</hi> said <hi rend="italic">Bianca</hi> starting, there it
                     is again!—dear Madam, Do you hear nothing?—this castle is certainly
                     haunted!—peace! said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda,</hi>
                  and listen! I did think I heard a voice—but it must be fancy; your terrors,
                     I suppose, have infected me.
                  In deed! indeed! Madam, said <hi rend="italic">Bianca,</hi>
                  half-weeping with agony, I am sure I heard a voice.
                  Does any body lie in the chamber beneath? said the Princess.
                     Nobody has dared to lie there, answered <hi rend="italic"
                     >Bianca,</hi>
                  since the great astrologer that was your <pb n="53"
                        facs="pageImages/053.jpg"/> brother's tutor, drowned himself. For certain,
                     Madam, his ghost and the young Prince's are now met in the chamber below—for
                     heaven's sake let us fly to your mother's apartment!
                  I charge you not to stir; said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda.</hi>
                  If they are spirits in pain, we may ease their sufferings by questioning
                     them. They can mean no hurt to us, for we have not injured them—and if they
                     should, shall we be more safe in one chamber than in another? Reach me my
                     beads; we will say a prayer, and then speak to them.
                  Oh! dear Lady, I would not speak to a ghost for the world; cried <hi
                     rend="italic">Bianca</hi> —as she said those words, they heard the casement of
                  the little chamber below <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi>'s
                  open. They listened attentively, and in few minutes thought they heard a person
                  sing, but could not distinguish the words. This can be no evil
                     spirit; said the Princess in a low voice: It is undoubtedly one of
                     the family— open the window, and we shall know the voice.
                  I dare not indeed, Madam; said <hi rend="italic">Bianca.</hi>
                  Thou art a very fool; said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda,</hi> opening the window gently herself. The
                  noise <pb n="54" facs="pageImages/054.jpg"/>the Princess made was however heard by
                  the person beneath, who stopped; and they concluded had heard the casement open.
                     Is any body below? said the Princess: If there is,
                     speak.
                  Yes; said an unknown voice. Who is it? said <hi
                     rend="italic">Matilda.</hi>
                  A stranger; replied the voice.
                  What stranger? said she; and how didst thou come there at this
                     unusual hour, when all the gates of the castle are locked?
                  I am not here willingly: Answered the voice—but pardon me, Lady, if I have
                     disturbed your rest: I knew not that I was overheard. Sleep had forsaken me: I
                     left a restless couch, and came to waste the irksome hours with gazing on the
                     fair approach of morning, impatient to be dismissed from this castle.
                  Thy words and accents, said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda,</hi>
                  are of a melancholy cast: If thou art unhappy, I pity thee. If poverty
                     afflicts thee, let me know it: I will mention thee to the Princess, whose
                     beneficent soul ever melts for the distressed; and she will relieve
                     thee.
                  I am indeed unhappy, said the stranger; and I know what wealth
                     is: But I do not complain of the <pb n="55" facs="pageImages/055.jpg"/>lot
                     which heaven has cast for me: I am young and healthy, and am not ashamed of
                     owing my support to myself—yet think me not proud, or that I disdain your
                     generous offers. I will remember you in my orisons, and will pray for blessings
                     on your gracious self and your noble mistress—if I sigh, Lady, it is for
                     others, not for myself.
                  Now I have it, Madam; said <hi rend="italic">Bianca,</hi> whispering
                  the Princess. This is certainly the young peasant; and by my conscience he
                     is in love—Well! this is a charming adventure! —do, Madam, let us sift him. He
                     does not know you, but takes you for one of my Lady <hi rend="italic"
                           >Hippolita</hi>'s women.
                  Art thou not ashamed, <hi rend="italic"> Bianca! </hi> said the
                  Princess: What right have we to pry into the secrets of this young man's
                     heart? he seems virtuous and frank, and tells us he is unhappy: Are those
                     circumstances that authorize us to make a property of him? how are we intitled
                     to his confidence?
                  Lord! Madam, how little you know of love! replied <hi rend="italic">
                     Bianca: </hi>
                  Why lovers have no pleasure equal to <pb n="56" facs="pageImages/056.jpg"
                     />talking of their mistress.
                  And would you have <hi rend="italic">me</hi> become a peasant's
                     confident? said the Princess. Well then, let me talk to him: Said <hi
                     rend="italic"> Bianca: </hi> Though I have the honour of being your Highness's
                  maid of honour, I was not always so great: Besides, if love levels ranks, it
                  raises them too: I have a respect for any young man in love—peace! simpleton; said
                  the Princess. Though he said he was unhappy, it does not follow that he must be in
                  love. Think of all that has happened to-day, and tell me if there are no
                  misfortunes but what love causes. Stranger, resumed the Princess, if thy
                  misfortunes have not been occasioned by thy own fault, and are within the compass
                  of the Princess <hi rend="italic">Hippolita</hi>'s power to
                  redress, I will take upon me to answer that she will be thy protectress. When thou
                  art dismissed from this castle, repair to holy fa ther <hi rend="italic"
                     >Jerome</hi> at the convent adjoining to the church of St. <hi rend="italic"
                     >Nicholas,</hi> and make thy story known to him, as far as thou thinkest meet:
                  He will not fail to inform the Princess, who is <pb n="57"
                     facs="pageImages/057.jpg"/> the mother of all that want her assistance.
                  Farewel: It is not seemly for me to hold farther converse with a man at this
                  unwonted hour. May the Saints guard thee, gracious Lady! replied the peasant—but
                  oh! if a poor and worthless stranger might presume to beg a minute's audience
                  farther—am I so happy?—the casement is not shut—might I venture to ask—speak
                  quickly; said <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi> ; the morning
                  dawns a pace: Should the labourers come into the fields and perceive us—What
                  wouldst thou ask?—I know not how—I know not if I dare—said the young stranger
                  faltering—yet the humanity with which you have spoken to me emboldens —Lady! dare
                  I trust you?—Heavens! said <hi rend="italic">Matilda,</hi>
                  What dost thou mean? with what wouldst thou trust me?—speak boldly, if thy secret
                  is fit to be entrusted to a virtuous breast —I would ask, said the Peasant,
                  recollecting himself, whether what I have heard from the domestics is true, that
                  the Princess is missing from the castle? What imports it to thee to <pb n="58"
                     facs="pageImages/058.jpg"/>know? replied <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda.</hi> Thy first words bespoke a prudent and
                  becoming gravity. Dost thou come hither to pry into the secrets of <hi
                     rend="italic">
                     Manfred? </hi> —Adieu. I have been mistaken in thee. Say
                  ing these words, she shut the casement hastily, without giving the young man time
                  to reply. I had acted more wisely, said the Princess to <hi rend="italic"
                     >Bianca</hi> with some sharpness, if I had let thee converse with this peasant:
                  His inquisitiveness seems of a piece with thy own. It is not fit for me to argue
                  with your Highness, replied <hi rend="italic"> Bianca </hi> ; but perhaps the
                  questions I should have put to him, would have been more to the purpose, than
                  those you have been pleased to ask him. Oh! no doubt; said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda</hi> ; you are a very discreet personage! may
                  I know what <hi rend="italic">you</hi> would have asked him? A by-stander often
                  sees more of the game than those that play: answered <hi rend="italic"
                     >Bianca.</hi> Does your Highness think, Madam, that his question about my Lady
                     <hi rend="italic">
                     Isabella
                  </hi> was the result of mere curiosity? No, no, Madam; there is more in it than
                  you great <pb n="59" facs="pageImages/059.jpg"/>folks are aware of. <hi
                     rend="italic">Lopez</hi> told me that all the servants believe this young
                  fellow contrived my Lady <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>'s
                  escape—now, pray, Madam, observe—you and I both know that my Lady <hi
                     rend="italic">Isabella</hi> never much fancied the Prince
                  your brother —Well! he is killed just in the critical minute—I accuse nobody. A
                  helmet falls from the moon—so, my Lord, your father says; but <hi rend="italic"
                     >Lopez</hi> and all the servants say that this young spark is a magician, and
                  stole it from <hi rend="italic">Alfonso</hi>'s tomb—have done with this rhapsody
                  of impertinence, said <hi rend="italic">Matilda.</hi> Nay,
                  Madam, as you please; cried <hi rend="italic">Bianca</hi> —yet it is very
                  particular tho', that my Lady <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>
                  should be missing the very same day, and that this young sorcerer should be found
                  at the mouth of the trap-door —I accuse nobody—but if my young Lord came honestly
                  by his death—Dare not on thy duty, said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda,</hi> to breathe a suspicion on the purity of
                  my dear <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>'s fame—purity, or not
                  purity, said <hi rend="italic">Bianca,</hi> gone she is—a stranger is found that
                  nobody knows: You question him <pb n="60" facs="pageImages/060.jpg"/>yourself: He
                  tells you he is in love, or unhappy, it is the same thing—nay; he owned he was
                  unhappy about others; and is any body unhappy about another, unless they are in
                  love with them? and at the very next word, he asks innocently, poor soul! if my
                  Lady <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> is missing—to be sure,
                  said <hi rend="italic">Matilda,</hi> thy observations are not
                  totally without foundation— <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>'s
                  flight amazes me: The curiosity of this stranger is very particular—yet <hi
                     rend="italic">Isabella</hi> never concealed a thought from
                  me—so she told you, said <hi rend="italic">Bianca,</hi> to fish out your
                  secrets—but who knows, Madam, but this stranger may be some Prince in
                  disguise?—do, Madam, let me open the window, and ask him a few questions. No,
                  replied, <hi rend="italic">Matilda,</hi> I will ask him
                  myself, if he knows aught of <hi rend="italic">Isabella:</hi>
                  He is not worthy that I should converse farther with him. She was going to open
                  the casement, when they heard the bell ring at the postern-gate of the castle,
                  which is on the right-hand of the tower, where <pb n="61"
                     facs="pageImages/061.jpg"/>
                  <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi> lay. This prevented the
                  Princess from renewing the conversation with the stranger. </p>
               <p> After continuing silent for some time; I am persuaded, said she to <hi
                     rend="italic">Bianca,</hi> that whatever be the cause of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella</hi>'s flight, it had no unworthy motive. If
                  this stranger was accessary to it, she must be satisfied of his fidelity and
                  worth. I observed, did not you, <hi rend="italic">Bianca?</hi> that his words were
                  tinctured with an uncommon effusion of piety. It was no ruffian's speech: His
                  phrases were becoming a man of gentle birth. I told you, Madam, said <hi
                     rend="italic">Bianca,</hi> that I was sure he was some Prince in disguise—yet,
                  said <hi rend="italic">Matilda,</hi> if he was privy to her
                  escape, how will you account for his not accompanying her in her flight? why
                  expose himself unnecessarily and rashly to my Father's resentment? As for that,
                     Madam, replied she, if he could get from under the helmet, he will find ways of
                  eluding your Father's anger. I do not doubt but he has some talisman or other
                  about him—You resolve every thing into magic; said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda</hi> —but a man, who has <pb n="62"
                     facs="pageImages/062.jpg"/>any intercourse with infernal spirits, does not dare
                  to make use of those tremendous and holy words, which he uttered. Didst thou not
                  observe with what fervour he vowed to remember <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to heaven
                  in his prayers?—yes; <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> was
                  cindoubtedly convinced of his piety. Commend me to the piety of a young fellow and
                  a damsel that consult to elope! said <hi rend="italic">Bianca.</hi> No, no, Madam;
                  my Lady <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> is of another guess
                  mould than you take her for. She used indeed to sigh and lift up her eyes in your
                  company, because she knows you are a Saint—but when your back was turned—You
                  wrong her; said <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi>:
                  <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> is no hypocrite: She has a due sense of
                  devotion, but never affected a call she has not. On the contrary, she always com
                  bated my inclination for the cloyster: And though I own the mystery she has made
                  to me of her flight, confounds me; though it seems inconsistent with the
                  friendship between us; I cannot forget the disinterested warmth with which she
                  always opposed my taking the veil: she <pb n="63" facs="pageImages/063.jpg"/>
                  wished to see me married, though my dower would have been a loss to her and my
                  brother's children. For her sake I will believe well of this young peasant. Then
                  you do think there is some liking between them; said <hi rend="italic">Bianca</hi>
                  —While she was speaking, a servant came hastily into the chamber and told the
                  Princess, that the Lady <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> was
                  found. Where? said <hi rend="italic">Matilda.</hi> She has
                  taken sanctuary in St. <hi rend="italic">Nicholas</hi>'s church; replied the
                  servant: Father <hi rend="italic">Jerome</hi> has brought the news himself: he is
                  below with his Highness. Where is my Mother! said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda.</hi> She is in her own chamber, Madam, and
                  has asked for you. </p>
               <!-- STOPPED ADDING SAIDs HERE -->
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> had risen at the first dawn of
                  light, and gone to <hi rend="italic">Hippolita</hi>'s
                  apartment, to inquire if she knew ought of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella.</hi> While he was questioning her, word was
                  brought that <hi rend="italic">Jerome</hi> demanded to speak with him. <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> little suspecting the cause of
                  the Friar's arrival, and knowing he was employed by <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita</hi> in her charities, ordered him to be
                  admitted, intending <pb n="64" facs="pageImages/064.jpg"/>to leave them together,
                  while he pursued his search after <hi rend="italic"
                     >Isabella.</hi> Is your business with me or the Princess?
                  said <hi rend="italic">Manfred.</hi> With both. Replied the
                  holy man. The Lady <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> — what of
                  her! interrupted <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> eagerly— is
                  at St. <hi rend="italic">Nicholas</hi>'s altar, replied <hi rend="italic"
                     >Jerome.</hi> That is no business of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita</hi> ; said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> with confusion. Let us retire to my
                  chamber, Father; and inform me how she came thither. No; my Lord; replied the good
                  man with an air of firmness and authority, that daunted even the resolute <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> who could not help revering
                  the saint-like virtues of <hi rend="italic">Jerome:</hi> My commission is to both;
                  and with your Highness's good-liking, in the presence of both I shall deliver
                  it—but first, my Lord, I must interrogate the Princess, whether she is acquainted
                  with the cause of the Lady <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>'s
                  retirement from your castle—no, on my soul; said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita:</hi> does <hi rend="italic">
                     Isabella
                  </hi> charge me with being privy to it?—Father, interrupted <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred,</hi> I pay due reverence to your holy
                  profession; but I am sovereign here, <pb n="65" facs="pageImages/065.jpg"/>and
                  will allow no meddling priest to interfore in the affairs of my domestic. If you
                  have ought to say, attend me to my chamber—I do not use to let my Wife be
                  acquainted with the secret affairs of my State; they are not within a woman's
                  province. My Lord, said the holy man, I am no intruder into the secrets of
                  families. My office is to promote peace, to heal divisions, to preach repentance,
                  and teach mankind to curb their headstrong passions. I forgive your Highness's
                  uncharitable apostrophe: I know my duty, and am the minister of a mightier prince
                  than <hi rend="italic">Manfred.</hi> Hearken to him who
                  speaks through my organs. <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi>
                  trembled with rage and shame <hi rend="italic"
                  >Hippolita</hi>'s countenance declared her astonishment and
                  impatience to know where this would end: her silence more strongly spoke her
                  observance of <hi rend="italic">Manfred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p> The Lady <hi rend="italic">Isabella,</hi> resumed <hi
                     rend="italic">Jerome,</hi> commends herself to both your Highnesses; she thanks
                  both for the kindness with which she has been treated in your castle: She deplores
                  the loss of your son, and her own misfortune in not becoming <pb n="66"
                     facs="pageImages/066.jpg"/>the daughter of such wise and noble Princes, whom
                  she shall always respect as <hi rend="italic"> Pa rents </hi> ; she prays for
                  uninterrupted union and felicity between you: <hi rend="italic"
                        >[Manfred</hi>'s colour changed] but as it is no longer
                  possible for her to be allied to you, she intreats your consent to remain in
                  sanctuary, till she can learn news of her father, or, by the certainty of his
                  death, be at liberty, with the approbation of her guardians, to dispose of herself
                  in suitable marriage. I shall give no such consent; said the Prince, but insist on
                  her return to the castle without delay: I am answerable for her person to her
                  guardians and will not brook her being in any hands but my own. Your Highness will
                  recollect whether that can any longer be proper: replied the Friar. I want no
                  monitor, said <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> colouring. <hi
                     rend="italic">Isabella</hi> 's conduct leaves room for
                  strange suspicions— and that young villain, who was at least the accomplice of her
                  flight, if not the cause of it—the cause! interrupted <hi rend="italic"
                     >Jerome</hi> ; was a young man the cause! This is not to be borne! cried <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred.</hi> Am I to be bearded in my <pb
                     n="67" facs="pageImages/067.jpg"/> own palace by an Insolent Monk! thou art
                  privy I guess, to their <ref>amours</ref>. I would pray to heaven to clear up your
                  uncharitable surmizes, said <hi rend="italic">Jerome,</hi> if your Highness were
                  not satisfied in your conscience how unjustly you accuse me. I do pray to heaven
                  to pardon that uncharitableness: And I implore your Highness to leave the Princess
                  at peace in that holy place, where she is not liable to be disturbed by such vain
                  and worldly fantasies as discourses of love from any man. <ref>Cant</ref> not to me, said <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> but return and bring the
                  Princess to her duty. It is my duty to prevent her return hither; said <hi
                     rend="italic">Jerome.</hi> She is where orphans and virgins are safest from the
                  snares and wiles of this world; and nothing but a parent's authority shall take
                  her thence. <ref>I am her parent</ref>, cried <hi rend="italic"
                     >Manfred,</hi> and demand her. She wished to have you for
                  her parent; said the Friar: But heaven that forbad that connection, has for ever
                  dissolved all ties betwixt you: And I announce to your Highness —stop! audacious
                  man, said <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> and dread my
                  displeasure. Holy father, said <hi rend="italic">
                     Hippolita, </hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="pageImages/068.jpg"/>it is your office to be no respecter of
                  persons: you must speak as your duty prescribes: But it is my duty to hear nothing
                  that it pleases not my Lord I should hear. Attend the Prince to his chamber. I
                  will retire to my oratory, and pray to the blessed virgin to inspire you with her
                  holy councils, and to restore the heart of my gracious Lord to its wonted peace
                  and gentleness. Excellent woman! said the Friar— my Lord, I attend your pleasure. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> accompanied by the Friar,
                  passed to his own apartment, where shutting the door, I perceive, father, said he,
                  that <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> has acquainted you with
                  my purpose. Now hear my resolve, and obey. <ref>Reasons of state, most urgent reasons,
                  my own and the safety of my people, demand that I should have a son.</ref> It is in vain
                  to expect an heir from <hi rend="italic">Hippolita.</hi> I
                  have made choice of <hi rend="italic">Isabella.</hi> You must
                  bring her back; and you must do more. I know the influence you have with <hi
                     rend="italic">Hippolita:</hi> her conscience is in your
                  hands. She is, I allow, a <pb n="69" facs="pageImages/069.jpg"/> faultless woman:
                  Her soul is set on heaven, and scorns the little grandeur of this world: you can
                  withdraw her from it intirely. Persuade her to consent to the dissolution of our
                  marriage, and to retire into a monastery—<ref>she shall endow one</ref> if she will; and she
                  shall have the means of being as liberal to your order as she or you can wish.
                  Thus you will divert the calamities that are hanging over our heads, and have the
                  merit of saving the principality of <hi rend="italic">Otranto</hi> from
                  destruction. You are a prudent man, and though the warmth of my temper betrayed me
                  into some unbecoming expressions, I honour your virtue, and wish to be indebted to
                  you for the repose of my life and the preservation of my family. </p>
               <p> The will of heaven be done! said the Friar. I am but its worthless instrument. It
                  makes use of my tongue, to tell thee, Prince, of thy unwarrantable designs. The
                  injuries of the virtuous <hi rend="italic">Hippolita</hi>
                  have mounted to the throne of pity. By me thou art reprimanded for thy <pb n="70"
                     facs="pageImages/070.jpg"/><ref>adulterous intention</ref> of repudiating her: By me thou
                  art warned not to pursue the <ref>incestuous design</ref> on thy contracted daughter. Heaven
                  that delivered her from thy fury, when the judgments so recently fallen on thy
                  house ought to have inspired thee with other thoughts, will continue to watch over
                  her. Even I, a poor and despised Friar, am able to protect her from thy violence
                  —I, sinner as I am, and uncharitably reviled by your Highness, as an accomplice of
                  I know not what amours, scorn the allurements with which it has pleased thee to
                  tempt mine honesty. I love my order; I honour devout souls; I respect the piety of
                  thy Princess—but I will not betray the confidence she reposes in me, nor serve
                  even the cause of religion by soul and sinful compliances—but <ref>for sooth</ref>! the
                  welfare of the state depends on your Highness having a son. Heaven mocks the
                  short-sighted views of man. But yester-morn, whose house was so great, so
                  flourishing as <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi>'s?— where is
                  young <hi rend="italic">Conrad</hi> now!—my Lord, I <pb
                     n="71" facs="pageImages/071.jpg"/>respect your tears—but I mean not to check
                  them—let them slow, Prince! they will weigh more with heaven towards the welfare
                  of thy subjects, than a marriage, which, founded on lust or policy, could never
                  prosper. <ref>The scepter, which passed from the race of <hi rend="italic">Alfonso</hi>
                  to thine</ref>, cannot be preserved by a match which the church will never allow. If it
                  is the will of the most High that <hi rend="italic"
                     >Manfred</hi>'s name must perish; resign yourself, my
                  Lord, to its decrees; and thus deserve a crown that can never pass away— come, my
                  Lord; I like this sorrow—let us return to the Princess: She is not apprised of
                  your cruel intentions; nor did I mean more than to alarm you. You saw with what
                  gentle patience, with what efforts of love, she heard, she rejected hearing the
                  extent of your guilt. I know she longs to fold you in her arms, and assure you of
                  her unalterable affection. Father, said the Prince, you mistake my compunction:
                  true; I honour <hi rend="italic">Hippolito</hi>'s virtues; I think her a Saint;
                  and wish it were for my soul's health <pb n="72" facs="pageImages/072.jpg"/> to
                  tie faster the knot that has united us—but alas! Father, you know not the
                  bitterest of my pangs! it is some time that I have had scruples on the legality of
                  our union: <hi rend="italic">Hippolita</hi> is related to me
                  in the fourth degree—it is true, we had <ref>a dispensation</ref>: But I have been informed
                  that she had also been contracted to another. This it is that sits heavy at my
                  heart: To this state of unlawful wedlock I impute the visitation that has fallen
                  on me in the death of <hi rend="italic">Conrad!</hi> — ease
                  my conscience of this burden: dissolve our marriage, and accomplish the work of
                  godliness which your divine exhortations have commenced in my soul. </p>
               <p> How cutting was the anguish which the good man felt, when he perceived this turn
                  in the wily Prince! He trembled for <hi rend="italic">
                     Hippolita, </hi> whose ruin he saw was determined; and he
                  feared if <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> had no hope of
                  recovering <hi rend="italic">Isabella,</hi> that his
                  impatience for a son would direct him to some other object, who might not be
                  equally proof against the temptation <pb n="73" facs="pageImages/073.jpg"/>of <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred</hi>'s rank. For some time the holy
                  man remained absorbed in thought. At length, conceiving some hope from delay, he
                  thought the wisest conduct would be to prevent the Prince from despairing of
                  recovering <hi rend="italic">Isabelia.</hi> Her the Friar knew he could dispose,
                  from her affection to <hi rend="italic">Hippolita,</hi> and
                  from the aversion she had expressed to him for <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi>'s addresses, to second his views, till
                  the censures of the church could be fulminated against a divorce. With this
                  intention, as if struck with the Prince's scruples, he at length said; my Lord, I
                  have been pondering on what your Highness has said; and if in truth it is delicacy
                  of conscience that is the real motive of your repugnance to your virtuous Lady,
                  far be it from me to endeavour to harden your heart. The church is an indulgent
                  mother: unfold your griefs to her: she alone can administer comfort to your soul,
                  either by satisfying your conscience, or upon examination of your scruples, by
                  setting you at liberty, and indulging you in the lawful <pb n="74"
                     facs="pageImages/074.jpg"/>means of continuing your lineage. In the latter
                  case, if the Lady <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> <ref>can be
                  brought to consent</ref>— <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> who
                  concluded that he had either over-reached the good man, or that his first warmth
                  had been but a tribute paid to appearance, was overjoyed at this sudden turn, and
                  repeated the most magnificent promises, if he should succeed by the Friar's
                  mediation. The well meaning Priest suffered him to deceive himself, fully
                  determined to traverse his views, instead of seconding them. </p>
               <p> Since we now understand one another, resumed the Prince, I expect, Father, that
                  you satisfy me in one point. Who is the youth that I found in the vault? He must
                  have been privy to <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>'s flight:
                  Tell me truly; is he her lover? or is he an agent for another's passion? I have
                  often suspected <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>'s
                  Indifference to my son: a thousand circumstances croud on my mind that confirm
                  that suspicion. She herself was so conscious of it, that while I discoursed her in
                  the gallery, she <pb n="75" facs="pageImages/075.jpg"/> outran my suspicions, and
                  endeavoured to justify herself from coolness to <hi rend="italic"
                        >Conrad.</hi> The Friar, who knew nothing of the youth,
                  but what he had learnt occasionally from the Princess, ignorant what was become of
                  him, and not sufficiently reflecting on the impetuosity of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi>'s temper, conceived that it might not be
                  amiss to sow the seeds of jealousy in his mind: they might be turned to some use
                  hereafter, either by prejudicing the Prince against <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella,</hi> if he persisted in that union; or by
                  diverting his attention to a wrong scent, and employing his thoughts on a
                  visionary intrigue, prevent his engaging in any new pursuit. With this unhappy
                  policy, he answered in a manner to confirm <hi rend="italic">Manfied</hi> in the
                  belief of some connection between <hi rend="italic"
                     >Isabella</hi> and the youth. The Prince, <ref>whose passions
                  wanted little fuel to throw them into a blaze</ref>, sell into a rage at the idea of
                  what the Friar suggested. I will fathom to the bottom of this intrigue; cried he;
                  and quitting <hi rend="italic">Jerome</hi> abruptly, with a command <pb n="76"
                     facs="pageImages/076.jpg"/> to remain there till his return, he hastened to the
                  great hall of the castle, and ordered the peasant to be brought before him. </p>
               <p> Thou hardened young impostor! said the Prince, as soon as he saw the youth; what
                  becomes of thy boasted veracity now? it was Providence, was it, and the light of
                  the moon, that discovered the lock of the trap-door to thee? Tell me, audacious
                  boy, who thou art, and how long thou hast been acquainted with the Princess—and
                  take care to answer with less equivocation than thou didst last night, or tortures
                  shall wring the truth from thee. The young man, perceiving that his share in the
                  flight of the Princess was discovered, and concluding that any thing he should say
                  could no longer be of service or detriment to her, replied, I am no impostor, my
                  Lord, nor have I deserved <ref>opprobrious</ref> language. I answered to every question your
                  Highness put to me last night with the same veracity that I shall speak now: And
                  that will not be from fear of your <pb n="77" facs="pageImages/077.jpg"/>
                  tortures, but because my soul abhors a falshood. Please to repeat your questions,
                  my Lord; I am ready to give you all the satisfaction in my power. You know my
                  questions, replied the Prince, and only want time to prepare an evasion. Speak
                  directly; who art thou? and how long hast thou been known to the Princess? I am a
                  labourer at the next village; said the peasant; my name is <hi rend="italic"
                     >Theodore.</hi> The Princess found me in the vault last night: Before that hour
                  I never was in her presence. I may believe as much or as little as I please of
                  this Said <hi rend="italic">
                     Manfred
                  </hi> ; but <ref>I will hear thy own story</ref>, before I examine into the truth of it. Tell
                  me, what reason did the Princess give thee for making her escape? thy life depends
                  on thy answer. She told me, replied <hi rend="italic">Theodore,</hi> that she was
                  on the brink of destruction, and that if she could not escape from the castle, she
                  was in danger in a few moments of being made miserable for ever. And on this
                  slight foundation, on a silly girl's report, said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred,</hi> thou didst hazard my displeasure?</p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="pageImages/078.jpg"/><p>I fear no man's displeasure, said <hi
                     rend="italic">Theodore,</hi> when a woman in distress puts herself under my
                  protection— During this examination, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda</hi> was going to the apartment of <hi
                     rend="italic">Hippolita.</hi> At the upper end of the
                  hall, where <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> sat, was a boarded
                  gallery with latticed windows, thro' which <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Bianca</hi> were to
                  pass. Hearing her father's voice, and seeing the
                  servants assembled round him, she stopped to learn the occasion. The prisoner soon
                  drew her attention: The steady and composed manner in which he answered, and the
                  gallantry of his last reply, which were the first words she heard distinctly
                  interested her in his favour. His person was noble, handsome, and commanding,
                  even in that situation: But his countenance soon engrossed her whole care. Heaven!
                     <hi rend="italic"> Bianca, </hi> said the Princess
                  softly, do I dream? or is not that youth the exact resemblance of <hi
                     rend="italic">Alfonso</hi>'s picture in the gallery? She could say no more, for
                  her father's voice grew louder at every word. This bravado, said he, surpasses all
                  thy former <pb n="79" facs="pageImages/079.jpg"/>insolence. Thou shalt experience
                  the wrath with which thou darest to trifle. Seize him, continued <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred,</hi> and bind him—the first news the Princess
                  hears of her champion shall be, that he has lost his head for her sake. The
                  injustice of which thou art guilty towards me, said <hi rend="italic"
                     >Theodore,</hi> convinces me that I have done a good deed in delivering the
                  Princess from thy tyranny. May she be happy, whatever be comes of me! This is a
                  Lover! cried <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> in a rage: A
                  peasant within sight of death is not animated by such sentiments. Tell me, tell
                  me, rash boy, who thou art, or the rack shall force thy secret from thee. Thou
                  hast threatened me with death already, said the youth, for the truth I have told
                  thee: If that is all the encouragement I am to expect for sincerity, I am not
                  tempted to indulge thy vain curiosity farther. Then thou wilt not speak! said <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred</hi> ; I will not replied he. Bear
                  him away into the court-yard: said <hi rend="italic"
                     >Manfred</hi> ; I will see his head this instant severed
                     <pb n="80" facs="pageImages/080.jpg"/> from his body— <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda</hi> fainted at hearing those words. <hi
                     rend="italic">Bianca</hi> shrieked, and cried, Help! help! the Princess is
                  dead! <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> started at this
                  ejaculation, and demanded what was the matter! The young peasant, who heard it
                  too, was struck with horror, and asked eagerly the same question; but <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred</hi> ordered him to be hurried into
                  the court, and kept there for execution, till he had informed himself of the cause
                  of <hi rend="italic">Bianca</hi>'s shrieks. When he learned the meaning, he
                  treated it as a womanish panic, and ordering <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda</hi> to be carried to her apartment, he rushed
                  into the court, and calling for one of his guards, bad <hi rend="italic"
                     >Theodore</hi> kneel down, and prepare to receive the fatal blow. </p>
               <p> The undaunted youth received the bitter sentence with a resignation that touched
                  every heart, but <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi>'s. He wished
                  earnestly to know the meaning of the words he had heard relating to the Princess;
                  but fearing to exasperate the tyrant more against her, he desisted. The only boon
                  he deigned to ask, was, that he <pb n="81" facs="pageImages/081.jpg"/> might be
                  permitted to have a confessor, and make his peace with heaven. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred,</hi> who hoped by the confessor's means to
                  come at the youth's history, readily granted his request: and being convinced that
                  Father <hi rend="italic">Jerome</hi> was now in his interest, he ordered him to be
                  called and <ref>shrieve</ref> the prisoner. The holy man, who had little foreseen the
                  catastrophe that his imprudence occasioned, fell on his knees to the Prince, and
                  adjured him in the most solemn manner not to shed innocent blood. He accused
                  himself in the bitterest terms for his indiscretion, endeavoured to disculpate the
                  youth, and left no method untried to soften the tyrant's rage. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred,</hi> more incensed than appeased by <hi
                     rend="italic">Jerome</hi>'s intercession, whose retractation now made him
                  suspect he had been imposed upon by both, commanded the friar to do his duty, tell
                  ing him he would not allow the prisoner many minutes for confession. Nor do I ask
                  many, my Lord: Said the unhappy young man. My sins, thank heaven! have not been
                  numerous; nor <pb n="82" facs="pageImages/082.jpg"/> exceed what might be expected
                  at my years. Dry your tears, good father, and let us dispatch: This is a bad
                  world; nor have I had cause to leave it with regret. Oh! wretched youth! said <hi
                     rend="italic">Jerome</hi> ; how canst thou bear the sight of me with patience?
                  I am thy murderer! it is I have brought this dismal hour upon thee! I forgive thee
                  from my soul, said the youth, as I hope heaven will pardon me. Hear my confession,
                  father; and give me thy blessing. How can I prepare thee for thy passage, as I
                  ought? said <hi rend="italic">Jerome.</hi> Thou canst not be saved without
                  pardoning thy foes—and canst thou forgive that impious man there! I can; said <hi
                     rend="italic">Theodore</hi> ; I do—And does not this touch thee! cruel Prince!
                  said the Friar. I sent for thee to confess him, said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> sternly; not to plead for him. Thou didst
                  first incense me against him —his blood be on thy head! It will! it will! said the
                  good man, in an agony of sorrow. Thou and I must never hope to go, where this
                  blessed youth is going! Dispatch! said <hi rend="italic">
                     Manfred: </hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="pageImages/083.jpg"/>I am no more to be moved by the whining of
                  priests, than by the shrieks of women. What! said the youth; is it possible that
                  my fate could have occasioned what I heard! is the Princess then again in thy
                  power? Thou dost but remember me of thy wrath; said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred:</hi> Prepare thee, for this moment is thy
                  last. The youth, who felt his indignation rise, and who was touched with the
                  sorrow which he saw he had infused into all the spectators, as well as into the
                  Friar, suppressed his emotions, and putting off his doublet, and unbuttoning his
                  collar, knelt down to his prayers. As he stooped, his shirt slipped down below his
                  shoulder, and discovered <ref>the mark of a bloody arrow</ref>. Gracious heaven! cried the
                  holy man starting, what do I see! it is my child! my <hi rend="italic"
                     >Theodore!</hi>
               </p>
               <p> The passions that ensued, must be conceived; they cannot be painted. The tears of
                  the assistants were suspended by wonder, rather than stopped by joy. They seemed
                  to inquire in the eyes of their Lord what they ought to feel. <pb n="84"
                     facs="pageImages/084.jpg"/>Surprise, doubt, tenderness, respect, suceeded each
                  other in the countenance of the youth. He received with modest submission the
                  effusion of the old man's tears and embraces: Yet afraid of giving a loose to
                  hope, and suspecting from what had passed the inflexibility of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi>'s temper, he cast a glance towards the
                  Prince, as if to say, canst thou be unmoved at such a scene as this? </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi>'s heart was capable of being
                  touched. He forgot his anger in his astonishment: Yet his pride forbad his owning
                  himself affected. He even doubted whether this discovery was not a contrivance of
                  the friar to save the youth. What may this mean? said he: How can he be thy son?
                  is it consistent with thy profession or reputed sanctity to avow a peasant's
                  offspring for the fruit of thy irregular amours! Oh! God, said the holy man, dost
                  thou question his being mine? could I feel the anguish I do, if I were not his
                  father? Spare him! good Prince, spare him! and revile me as thou pleasest. Spare
                     <pb n="85" facs="pageImages/085.jpg"/> him! spare him, cried the attendants,
                  for this good man's sake! Peace! said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> sternly: I must know more, ere I am
                  disposed to pardon. A Saint's bastard may be no saint himself. Injurious Lord!
                  said <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi> ; add not insult to cruelty. If I am this
                  venerable man's son, tho' no Prince, as thou art, know, the blood that flows in my
                  vains—yes, said the friar, interrupting him, his blood is noble; nor is he that
                  abject thing, my Lord, you speak him. He is my lawful son; and <hi rend="italic"
                     >Sicily</hi> can boast of few houses more ancient than that of <hi
                     rend="italic">Falconara</hi> — but alas! my Lord, what is blood! what is
                  nobility! We are all reptiles, miserable, sinful creatures. It is piety alone that
                  can distinguish us from the dust whence we sprung, and whither we must
                  return—Truce to your sermon! said <hi rend="italic"
                     >Manfred:</hi> You forget, you are no longer Friar <hi
                     rend="italic">Jerome,</hi> but the Count of <hi rend="italic">Falconara.</hi>
                  Let me know your history: You will have time to moralize hereafter, if you should
                  not happen to obtain the grace of that sturdy criminal there. <pb n="86"
                     facs="pageImages/086.jpg"/>Mother of God! said the Friar, is it possible my
                  Lord can refuse a father the life of his only, his long-lost child! Trample me, my
                  Lord, scorn, afflict me, accept my life for his, but spare my son! Thou canst feel
                  then, said <hi rend="italic">
                     Manfred, </hi> what it is to lose an only son!—a little
                  hour ago thou didst preach up resignation to me: <hi rend="italic">My</hi> House,
                  if fate so spleased, must perish —but the Counts of <hi rend="italic"
                     >Falconara</hi> —alas! my Lord, said <hi rend="italic">Jerome,</hi> I confess I
                  have offended; but aggravate not an old man's sufferings! I boast not of my
                  family, nor think of such vanities—it is nature that pleads for this boy; it is
                  the memory of the dear woman that bore him—is she <hi rend="italic">Theodore,</hi>
                  is she dead?—Her soul has long been with the blessed: Said <hi rend="italic"
                     >Theodore.</hi> Oh! how? cried <hi rend="italic">Jerome,</hi> tell me—No—she is
                  happy! Thou art all my care now!—most dread Lord! will you—will you grant me my
                  poor boy's life? Return to thy convent; answered <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> ; conduct the Princess hither; obey me in
                  what else thou knowest; and I promise thee the life <pb n="87"
                     facs="pageImages/087.jpg"/> of thy son.—Oh! my Lord, said <hi rend="italic"
                     >Jerome,</hi> is my honesty the price I must pay for this dear youth's
                  safety—for me! cried <hi rend="italic">Theodore:</hi> Let me die a thousand
                  deaths, rather than stain thy conscience. What is it the tyrant would exact of
                  thee? is the Princess still safe from his power? protect her, thou venerable old
                  man; and let all the weight of his wrath fall on me. <hi rend="italic">Jerome</hi>
                  endeavoured to check the impetuosity of the youth; and ere <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> could reply, the trampling of horses was
                  heard, and a brazen trumpet, which hung without the gate of the castle, was
                  suddenly sounded. At the same instant the sable plumes on the enchanted helmet,
                  which still remained at the other end of the court, were tempestuously agitated,
                  and nodded thrice, as if bowed by some invisible wearer. </p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi>'s heart mis-gave him when he
                  beheld <ref>the plumage on the miraculous casque shaken in concert with the sounding of
                  the brazen trumpet</ref>. Father! said he to <hi rend="italic">Jerome,</hi> whom he now
                  ceased to treat as Count of <hi rend="italic"> Falconara, </hi> what mean these
                  portents? If I have offended —the plumes were shaken with greater violence than
                  before. Unhappy Prince that I am! cried <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> —Holy Father! will you not assist me with
                  your prayers? My Lord, replied <hi rend="italic">Jerome,</hi> heaven is no doubt
                  displeased with your mockery of its servants. Submit yourself to the church; and
                  cease to persecute her ministers. Dismiss this innocent youth; and learn to
                  respect the holy character I wear: Heaven will not be trifled with: you see— the
                  trumpet sounded again. I acknowledge I have been too hasty: said <hi rend="italic">Manfred.</hi>
                  Father, <pb n="89" facs="pageImages/089.jpg"/> do you go to the <ref>wicket</ref>, and demand
                  who is at the gate. Do you grant me the life of <hi rend="italic">Theodore?</hi>
                  replied the Friar. I do; said <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi>
                  ; but inquire who is without! </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Jerome</hi> falling on the neck of his son, discharged a flood
                  of tears, that spoke the fullness of his soul. You promised to go to the gate;
                  said <hi rend="italic">Manfred.</hi> I thought replied the
                  Friar, your Highness would excuse my thanking you first in this tribute of my
                  heart. Go, dearest Sir, said <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi> ; obey the Prince: I
                  do not deserve that you should delay his satisfaction for me. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Jerome,</hi> inquiring who was without, was answered a Herald.
                  From whom? said he. <ref>From the Knight of the gigantic sabre</ref>; said the Herald; and I
                  must speak with <ref>the usurper of <hi rend="italic">Otranto</hi>.</ref> <hi rend="italic">Jerome</hi> returned to
                  the Prince, and did not fail to repeat the message in the very words it had been
                  uttered. The first sounds struck <hi rend="italic"
                     >Manfred</hi> with terror; but when he heard himself
                  styled usurper, his rage rekindled, and all his courage revived. Usurper!—insolent
                  villain! cried he, who dares to question my title? retire, <pb n="90"
                     facs="pageImages/090.jpg"/> Father; this is no business for Monks: I will meet
                  this presumptuous man myself. Go to your convent, and prepare the Princes's
                  return: Your Son shall be a hostage for your fidelity: His life depends on your
                  obedience. Good heaven! my Lord, cried <hi rend="italic">Jerome,</hi> <ref>your
                  Highness did but this instant freely pardon my child</ref>— have you so soon forgot the
                  interposition of heaven? Heaven, replied <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred,</hi> does not send Heralds to question the
                  title of a lawful Prince—I doubt whether it even notifies its will through
                  Friars—but that is your affair, not mine. At present you know my pleasure; and it
                  is not a saucy Herald, that shall save your son, if you do not return with the
                  Princess. </p>
               <p> It was in vain for the holy man to reply. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> commanded him to be conducted to the
                  postern-gate, and shut out from the castle: And he ordered some of his attendants
                  to carry <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi> to the top of the black tower, and guard
                  him strictly; scarce permitting the Father and son to exchange a hasty embrace at
                  parting. <pb n="91" facs="pageImages/091.jpg"/>He then withdrew to the hall, and
                  seating himself in princely state, ordered the Herald to be admitted to his
                  presence. </p>
               <p> Well! thou insolent! said the Prince, what wouldst thou with me! I come, replied
                  he, to thee, <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> usurper of the
                  principality of <hi rend="italic">Otranto,</hi> from the renowned and invincible
                  Knight, the Knight of the gigantic sabre: in the name of his Lord, <hi
                     rend="italic">Freaeric</hi> Marquis of <hi rend="italic">Vicenza,</hi> he
                  demands the Lady <hi rend="italic">Isabella,</hi> daughter of
                  that Prince, whom thou hast basely and traiterously got into thy power, by bribing
                  her false guardians during his absence: and he requires thee to resign the
                  principality of <hi rend="italic">Otranto,</hi> which thou hast usurped from the
                  said Lord <hi rend="italic">Frederic,</hi> the nearest of blood to the last
                  rightful Lord <hi rend="italic">Alfonso</hi> the good. If thou dost not instantly
                  comply with these just demands, he defies thee to single combat to the last
                  extremity. And so saying, the Herald cast down his <ref>warder</ref>. </p>
               <p> And where is this <ref>braggart</ref>, who sends thee? said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred.</hi> At the distance of a <ref>league</ref>, said <pb
                     n="92" facs="pageImages/092.jpg"/>the Herald: he comes to make good his Lord's
                  claim against thee, as he is a true Knight and thou an usurper and ravisher. </p>
               <p> Injurious as this challenge was, <hi rend="italic"
                     >Manfred</hi> reflected that it was not his interest to
                  provoke the Marquis. He knew how well-founded <ref>the claim of <hi rend="italic"
                     >Frederic</hi></ref> was; nor was this the first time he had heard of it. <hi
                     rend="italic">Frederic</hi>'s ancestors had assumed the style of Princes of <hi
                     rend="italic">Otranto,</hi> from the death of <hi rend="italic">Alfonso</hi>
                  the good without issue; but <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi>
                  his Father, and grandfather, had been too powerful for the house of <hi
                     rend="italic">Vicenza</hi> to dispossess them. <hi rend="italic">Frederic,</hi>
                  a martial and amorous young Prince, had married a beautiful young Lady, of whom he
                  was enamoured, and who had died in childbed of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella.</hi> Her death affected him so much, that he
                  had taken the cross and gone to the holy land, where he was wounded in an
                  engagement against the infidels, made prisoner, and reported to be dead. When the
                  news reached <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi>'s ears, he bribed
                  the guardians of the Lady <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> to
                  deliver her up <pb n="93" facs="pageImages/093.jpg"/>to him as a bride for his son
                     <hi rend="italic">Conrad,</hi> by which alliance he had
                  proposed to unite the claims of the two houses. This motive, on <hi rend="italic"
                        >Conrad</hi>'s death, had cooperated to make him so
                  suddenly resolve on espousing her himself; and the same reflection determined him
                  now to endeavour at obtaining the consent of <hi rend="italic">Frederic</hi> to
                  this marriage. A like policy inspired him with the thought of inviting <hi
                     rend="italic">Frederic</hi>'s champion into his castle, lest he should be
                  informed of <hi rend="italic">Isbella</hi>'s flight, which he strictly enjoined
                  his domestics not to disclose to any of the Knight's retinue. </p>
               <p> Herald, said <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> as soon as he
                  had digested these reflections, return to thy master, and tell him, e'er we
                  liquidate our differences by the sword, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> would hold some converse with him. Bid
                  him welcome to my castle, where by my faith, as I am a true Knight, he shall have
                  courteous reception, and full security for himself and followers. If we cannot
                  adjust our quarrel by amicable means, I swear he shall depart in safety, and shall
                  have full satisfaction <pb n="94" facs="pageImages/094.jpg"/>according to the laws
                  of arms: So help me God and his holy Trinity! the Herald made three obeissances
                  and retired. </p>
               <p> During this interview <hi rend="italic">Jerome</hi>'s mind was agitated by a
                  thousand contrary passions. He trembled for the life of his son, and his first
                  thought was to persuade <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> to
                  return to the castle. Yet he was scarce less alarmed at the thought of her union
                  with <hi rend="italic">Manfred.</hi> He dreaded <hi
                     rend="italic">Hippolita</hi>'s unbounded submission to the
                  will of her Lord; and though he did not doubt but he could alarm her piety not to
                  consent to a divorce, if he could get access to her; yet should <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> discover that the obstruction came from
                  him, it might be equally fatal to <hi rend="italic">Theodore.</hi> He was
                  impatient to know whence came the Herald, who with so little management had
                  questioned the title of <hi rend="italic">Manfred:</hi> yet
                  he did not dare absent himself from the convent, lest <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella</hi> should leave it, and her flight be
                  imputed to him. He returned disconsolately to the monastery, uncertain on what
                  conduct to resolve. A Monk, who met <pb n="95" facs="pageImages/095.jpg"/>him in
                  the porch and observed his melancholy air, said, alas! brother, is it then true
                  that we have lost our excellent Princess <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita?</hi> The holy man started, and cried, what
                  meanest thou, brother! I come this instant from the castle, and left her in
                  perfect health. <hi rend="italic">Martelli,</hi> replied the other Friar, passed
                  by the convent but a quarter of an Hour ago on his way from the castle, and
                  reported that her Highness was dead. All our brethren are gone to the chapel to
                  pray for her happy transit to a better life, and willed me to wait thy arrival.
                  They know thy holy attachment to that good Lady, and are anxious for the
                  affliction it will cause in thee—indeed we have all reason to weep; she was a
                  mother to our House—but this life is but a pilgrimage; we must not murmur—we shall
                  all follow her! may our end be like her's! good brother, thou dreamest, said <hi
                     rend="italic">Jerome:</hi> I tell thee I come from the castle, and left the
                  Princess well—where is the Lady <hi rend="italic"
                     >Isabella?</hi> —poor Gentlewoman! replied the Friar; I
                  told her the sad news, and <pb n="96" facs="pageImages/096.jpg"/> offered her
                  spiritual comfort; I reminded her of the transitory condition of mortality, and
                  advised her to take the veil: I quoted the example of the holy Princess <hi
                     rend="italic">Sanchia</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Arragon</hi> —thy zeal was
                  laudable, said <hi rend="italic">Jerome</hi> impatiently; but at present it was
                  unnecessary: <hi rend="italic">Hippolita</hi> is well— at
                  least I trust in the Lord she is; I heard nothing to the contrary—yet methinks,
                  the Prince's earnestness—well, brother, but where is the Lady <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella?</hi> I know not; said the Friar: She wept
                  much, and said she would retire to her chamber. <hi rend="italic">Jerome</hi> left
                  his comrade abruptly, and hasted to the Princess, but she was not in her chamber.
                  He inquired of the domestics of the convent, but could learn no news of her. He
                  searched in vain throughout the monastery and the church, and dispatched
                  messengers round the neighbourhood, to get intelligence if she had been seen; but
                  to no purpose. nothing could equal the good man's perplexity. He judged that <hi
                     rend="italic">Isabella,</hi> suspecting <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> of having precipitated his wife's death,
                     <pb n="97" facs="pageImages/097.jpg"/> had taken the alarm, and withdrawn
                  herself to some more secret place of concealment. This new flight would probably
                  carry the Prince's fury to the height. The report of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita</hi>'s death, though it seemed almost
                  incredible, increased his consternation; and though <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella</hi>'s escape bespoke her aversion of <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred</hi> for a husband, <hi
                     rend="italic">Jerome</hi> could feel no comfort from it, while it endangered
                  the life of his son. He determined to return to the castle, and made several of
                  his brethren accompany him to attest his innocence to <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred,</hi> and, if necessary, join their
                  intercession with his for <hi rend="italic">Theodore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p> The Prince, in the mean time, had passed into the court, and ordered the gates of
                  the castle to be flung open for the reception of the stranger Knight and his
                  train. In a few minutes the <ref>cavalcade</ref> arrived. First came two <ref>harbingers</ref> with
                  wands. Next a herald, followed by two <ref>pages</ref> and two trumpets. Then an hundred
                  foot-guards. These were attended by as many horse. After them fifty footmen,
                  cloathed in <pb n="98" facs="pageImages/098.jpg"/> scarlet and black, the colours
                  of the Knight. Then a led horse. Two heralds on each side of a gentleman on
                  horseback bearing a banner with <ref>the arms of <hi rend="italic">Vicenza</hi> and <hi
                     rend="italic">Otranto</hi> quarterly</ref> —a circumstance that much offended <hi
                     rend="italic">
                     Manfred
                  </hi> —but he stifled his resentment. Two more pages. The Knight's confessor
                  telling his beads. Fifty more footmen, clad as before. Two Knights habited in
                  complete armour, their beavors down, comrades to the principal Knight. The squires
                  of the two Knights, carrying their shields and devices. The Knight's own squire.
                  An hundred gentlemen bearing an enormous sword, and seeming to faint under the
                  weight of it. The Knight himself on a chestnut steed, in complete armour, his
                  lance in the rest, his face entirely concealed by his <ref>vizor</ref>, which was surmounted
                  by a large plume of scarlet and black feathers. Fifty foot-guards with drums and
                  trumpets closed the procession, which wheeled off to the right and left to make
                  room for the principal Knight. </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="pageImages/099.jpg"/>As soon as he approached the gate, he
                  stopped; and the herald advancing, read again the words of the challenge. <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred</hi>'s eyes were fixed on the
                  gigantic sword, and he scarce seemed to attend to the cartel: But his attention
                  was soon diverted by a tempest of wind that rose behind him. He turned and beheld
                  the plumes of the enchanted helmet agitated in the same extraordinary manner as
                  before. It required intrepidity like <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi>'s not to sink under a concur rence of
                  circumstances that seemed to announce his fate. Yet scorning in the presence of
                  strangers to betray the courage he had always manifested, he said boldly, Sir
                  Knight, whoever thou art, I bid thee welcome. If thou art of mortal <ref>mould</ref>, thy
                  valour shall meet its equal: And, if thou art a true Knight, thou wilt scorn to
                  employ sorcery to carry thy point. Be these omens from heaven or hell, <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred</hi> trusts to the righteousness of
                  his cause and to the aid of St. <hi rend="italic">Nicholas,</hi> who has ever
                  protected his house. Alight, Sir Knight, and repose thyself. Tomorrow <pb n="100"
                     facs="pageImages/100.jpg"/> thou shalt have a fair field; and heaven befriend
                  the juster side! </p>
               <p> The Knight made no reply, but dismounting, was conducted by <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> to the great hall of the castle. As they
                  traversed the court, the Knight stopped to gaze at the miraculous casque; and
                  kneeling down, seemed to pray inwardly for some minutes. Rising, he made a sign to
                  the Prince to lead on. As soon as they entered the hall, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> proposed to the stranger to disarm, but
                  the Knight shook his head in token of refusal. Sir Knight, said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred,</hi> this is not courteous; but by my good
                  faith I will not cross thee; nor shalt thou have cause to complain of the Prince
                  of <hi rend="italic">Otranto.</hi> No treachery is designed on my part; I hope
                  none is intended on thine: Here take <ref>my gage</ref>: [giving him his ring] your friends
                  and you shall enjoy the laws of hospitality. Rest here, until refreshments are
                  brought: I will but give orders for the accommodation of your train, and return to
                  you. The three Knights bowed as accepting his courtesy. <pb n="101"
                     facs="pageImages/101.jpg"/>
                  <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> directed the stranger's
                  retinue to be conducted to an adjacent hospital, founded by the Princess <hi
                     rend="italic">Hippolita</hi> for the reception of
                  pilgrims. As they made the circuit of the court to return towards the gate, the
                  gigantic sword burst from the supporters, and falling to the ground opposite to
                  the helmet, remained immoveable. <hi rend="italic"
                     >Manfred</hi> almost hardened to preternatural
                  appearances, surmounted the shock of this new prodigy; and returning to the hall,
                  where by this time the feast was ready, he invited his silent guests to take their
                  places. <hi rend="italic">
                     Manfred, </hi> however ill his heart was at ease,
                  endeavoured to inspire the company with mirth. He put several questions to them,
                  but was answered only by signs. They raised their vizors but sufficiently to feed
                  themselves, and that sparingly. Sirs, said the Prince, ye are the first guests I
                  ever treated within these walls, who scorned to hold any intercourse with me: Nor
                  has it oft been customary, I ween, for Princes to hazard their state and dignity
                  against strangers <pb n="102" facs="pageImages/102.jpg"/>and mutes. You say you
                  come in the name of <hi rend="italic">Frederic</hi> of <hi rend="italic"
                     >Vicenza:</hi> I have ever heard that he was a gallant and courteous Knight;
                  nor would he, I am bold to say, think it beneath him to mix in social converse
                  with a Prince that is his equal, and not unknown by deeds in arms.— Still ye are
                  silent—well! be it as it may— by the laws of hospitality and <ref>chivalry</ref> ye are
                  masters under this roof: Ye shall do your pleasures —but come, give me a goblet of
                  wine; ye will not refuse to pledge me to the healths of your fair mistresses. The
                  principal Knight sighed and crossed himself, and was rising from the board—Sir
                  Knight, said <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> what I said was
                  but in sport: I shall constrain you in nothing: Use your good liking. Since mirth
                  is not your mood, let us be sad. Business may hit your fancies better: Let us
                  withdraw; and hear if what I have to unfold, may be better relished than the vain
                  efforts I have made for your pastime. </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="pageImages/103.jpg"/>
                  <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> then conducting the three
                  Knights into an inner chamber, shut the door, and inviting them to be seated,
                  began thus, addressing himself to the chief personage. </p>
               <p> You come, Sir Knight, as I understand, in the name of the Marquis of <hi
                     rend="italic">Vicenza,</hi> to re-demand the Lady <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella</hi> his daughter, who has been contracted in
                  the face of holy church to my son, by the consent of her legal guardians; and to
                  require me to resign my dominions to your Lord, who gives himself for the nearest
                  of blood to Prince <hi rend="italic">Alfonso,</hi> whose soul God rest! I shall
                  speak to the latter article of your demands first. You must know, your Lord knows,
                  that I enjoy the principality of <hi rend="italic">Otranto</hi> from my father <hi
                     rend="italic">Don Manuel,</hi> as he received it from his father <hi
                     rend="italic">Don Ricardo</hi>. <ref><hi rend="italic">Alfonso,</hi> their predecessor, dying childess in
                  the Holy Land</ref>, bequeathed his estates to my grandfather <hi rend="italic">Don
                     Ricardo,</hi> in consideration of his faithful services—the stranger shook his
                  head—Sir Knight, said <hi rend="italic">
                     Manfred
                  </hi> warmly, <hi rend="italic">Ricardo</hi> was a valiant and upright <pb n="104"
                     facs="pageImages/104.jpg"/>man; he was a pious man, witness his <ref>munificent</ref>
                  foundation of the adjoining church and two convents. He was peculiarly patronized
                  by St. <hi rend="italic">Nicholas</hi> —my grandfather was incapable —I say, Sir,
                     <hi rend="italic">Don Ricardo</hi> was incapable—excuse me, your interruption
                  has disordered me. —I venerate the memory of my grandfather— well! Sirs, he held
                  this estate; he held it by his good sword and by the favour of St. <hi
                     rend="italic">Nicholas</hi> —so did my father; and so, Sirs, will I, come what
                  come will—but <hi rend="italic">Frederic,</hi> your Lord, is nearest in blood—I
                  have consented to put my title to the issue of the sword—does that imply a <ref>vitious</ref>
                  title?—I might have asked, where is <hi rend="italic">Frederic</hi> your Lord?
                  Report speaks him dead in captivity. You say, your actions say, he lives —I
                  question it not—I might, Sirs, I might—but I do not. Other Princes would bid <hi
                     rend="italic">Frederic</hi> take his inheritance by force, if he can: They
                  would not stake their dignity on a single combat: They would not submit it to the
                  decision of unknown mutes!—pardon me, Gentlemen, <pb n="105"
                     facs="pageImages/105.jpg"/> I am too warm: But suppose yourselves in my
                  situation: As ye are stout Knights, would it not move your <ref>choler</ref> to have your own
                  and the honour of your ancestors called in question?— but to the point. Ye require
                  me to deliver up the Lady <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>
                  —Sirs, I must ask if ye are authorized to receive her? The Knight nodded. Receive
                  her—continued <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> ; well! you are
                  authorized to receive her—but, gentle Knight, may I ask if you have full powers?
                  The Knight nodded. 'Tis well: Said <hi rend="italic"> Manfred: </hi> Then hear
                  what I have to offer—ye see, Gentlemen, before you the most unhappy of men! [he
                  began to weep] afford me your compassion; I am intitled
                  to it: Indeed I am. Know, I have lost my only hope, my joy, the support of my
                  house— <hi rend="italic">Conrad</hi> died yester morning. The
                  Knights discovered signs of surprise. Yes, Sirs, fate has disposed of my son. <hi
                     rend="italic">Isabella</hi> is at liberty—Do you then
                  restore her? cried the chief Knight, breaking silence. Afford me your patience:
                  Said <hi rend="italic">Manfred.</hi> I rejoice <pb n="106"
                     facs="pageImages/106.jpg"/> to find, by this testimony of your good-will, that
                  this matter may be adjusted without blood. It is no interest of mine dicates what
                  little I have farther to say. Ye behold in me a man disgusted with the world: The
                  loss of my son has weaned me from earthly cares. Power and greatness have no
                  longer any charms in my eyes. I wished to transmit the scepter I had received from
                  my ancestors with honour to my son—but that is over! Life itself is so indifferent
                  to me, that I accepted your defiance with joy: A good Knight cannot go to the
                  grave with more satisfaction than when falling in his vocation. Whatever is the
                  will of heaven, I submit; for alas! Sirs, I am a man of many sorrows. <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred</hi> is no object of envy—but no
                  doubt you are acquainted with my story. The Knight made signs of ignorance, and
                  seemed curious to have <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi>
                  proceed. Is it possible, Sirs, continued the Prince, that my story should be a
                  secret to you? have you heard nothing relating to me and the Princess <hi
                     rend="italic">
                     Hippolita? </hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="pageImages/107.jpg"/>They shook their heads—no! thus then, Sirs,
                  it is. You think me ambitious: Ambition alas! is composed of more rugged
                  materials. If I were ambitious, I should not for so many years have been a prey to
                  all the hell of conscientious scruples—but I weary your patience: I will be brief.
                  Know then, that I have long been troubled in mind on my union with the Princess
                     <hi rend="italic">Hippolita.</hi> —Oh! Sirs, if ye were
                  acquainted with that excellent woman! if ye knew that I adore her like a mistress,
                  and cherish her as a friend—but man was not born for perfect happiness! she shares
                  my scruples, and with her consent I have brought this matter before the church,
                  for <ref>we are related within the forbidden degrees</ref>. I expect every hour the
                  definitive sentence that must separate us for ever —I am sure you feel for me—I
                  see you do— pardon these tears! The Knights gazed on each other, wondering where
                  this would end. <hi rend="italic">
                     Manfred
                  </hi> continued. The death of my son betiding while my soul was under this
                  anxiety, I thought <pb n="108" facs="pageImages/108.jpg"/> of nothing but
                  resigning my dominions, and retiring for ever from the sight of mankind. My only
                  difficulty was to fix on a successor, who would be tender of my people, and to
                  dispose of the Lady <hi rend="italic">Isabella,</hi> who is
                  dear to me as my own blood. I was willing to restore the line of <hi rend="italic"
                     >Alfonso,</hi> even in his most distant kindred: And though, pardon me, I am
                  satisfied it was his will that <hi rend="italic">Ricardo</hi>'s lineage should
                  take place of his own relations; yet where was I to search for those relations? I
                  knew of none but <hi rend="italic">Frederic</hi> your Lord; he was a captive to
                  the infidels, or dead; and were he living, and at home, would he quit the
                  flourishing state of <hi rend="italic">Vicenza</hi> for the inconsiderable
                  principality of <hi rend="italic">Otranto?</hi> If he would not, could I bear the
                  thought of seeing a hard unfeeling Viceroy set over my poor faithful people?—for,
                  Sirs, I love my people, and thank heaven am beloved by them—but ye will ask,
                  whither tends this long discourse? briefly then, thus, Sirs. Heaven in your
                  arrival seems to point out a remedy for these difficulties and my misfortunes. The
                  Lady <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> is at liberty; I shall
                  soon <pb n="109" facs="pageImages/109.jpg"/> be so—I would submit to any thing for
                  the good of my people—were it not the best, the only way to extinguish the feuds
                  between our families, if I was to take the Lady <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella</hi> to wife —you start—but though <hi
                     rend="italic">Hippolita</hi>'s virtues will ever be dear
                  to me, a Prince must not consider himself; he is born for his people.—A servant at
                  that instant entering the chamber apprized <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> that <hi rend="italic">Jerome</hi> and
                  several of his brethren demanded immediate access to him. </p>
               <p> The Prince, provoked at this interruption, and fearing that the Friar would
                  discover to the strangers that <hi rend="italic"
                     >Isabella</hi> had taken sanctuary, was going to forbid
                     <hi rend="italic">Jerome</hi>'s entrance. But recollecting that he was
                  certainly arrived to notify the Princess's return, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> began to excuse himself to the Knights
                  for leaving them for a few moments, but was prevented by the arrival of the
                  Friars. <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> angrily reprimanded
                  them for their intrusion, and would have forced them back from the chamber; but
                     <hi rend="italic">Jerome</hi> was too much agitated to be repulsed. He declared
                  aloud <pb n="110" facs="pageImages/110.jpg"/>the flight of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella,</hi> with protestations of his own
                  innocence. <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> distracted at the
                  news, and not less at its coming to the knowledge of the strangers, uttered
                  nothing but incoherent sentences, now upbraiding the Friar, now apologizing to the
                  Knights, earnest to know what was become of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella,</hi> yet equally afraid of their knowing,
                  impatient to pursue her, yet dreading to have them join in the pursuit. He offered
                  to dispatch messengers in quest of her,—but the chief Knight no longer keeping
                  silence, reproached <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> in bitter
                  terms for his dark and ambiguous dealing, and demanded the cause of <hi
                     rend="italic">Isabella</hi>'s first absence from the
                  castle. <hi rend="italic">
                     Manfred, </hi> casting a stern look at <hi rend="italic"
                     >Jerome,</hi> implying a command of silence, pretended that on <hi
                     rend="italic">Conrad</hi>'s death he had placed her in
                  sanctuary until he could determine how to dispose of her. <hi rend="italic"
                     >Jerome,</hi> who trembled for his son's life, did not dare contradict this
                  falshood, but one of his brethren, not under the same anxiety, declared frankly
                  that she had fled to their church in the preceding <pb n="111"
                     facs="pageImages/111.jpg"/>night. The Prince in vain endeavoured to stop this
                  discovery, which overwhelmed him with shame and confusion. The principal stranger,
                  amazed at the contradictions he heard, and more than half persuaded that <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred</hi> had secreted the Princess,
                  notwithstanding the concern he expressed at her flight, rushing to the door, said,
                  thou traitor-Prince! <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> shall be
                  found. <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> endeavoured to hold
                  him, but the other Knights assisting their comrade, he broke from the Prince, and
                  hastened into the court, demanding his attendants. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> finding it vain to divert him from the
                  pursuit, offered to accompany him; and summoning his attendants, and taking <hi
                     rend="italic">Jerome</hi> and some of the Friars to guide them, they issued
                  from the castle; <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> privately
                  giving orders, to have the Knight's company secured, while to the Knight he
                  affected to dispatch a messenger to require their assistance. </p>
               <p> The company had no sooner quitted the castle, than <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda,</hi> who felt herself deeply interested <pb
                     n="112" facs="pageImages/112.jpg"/>for the young peasant, since she had seen
                  him condemned to death in the hall, and whose thoughts had been taken up with
                  concerting measures to save him, was informed by some of the female attendants
                  that <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> had dispatched all his
                  men various ways in pursuit of <hi rend="italic"
                     >Isabella.</hi> He had in his hurry given this order in
                  general terms, not meaning to extend it to the guard he had set upon <hi
                     rend="italic">Theodore,</hi> but forgetting it. The domestics, officious to
                  obey so peremptory a Prince, and urged by their own curiosity and love of novelty
                  to join in any pre cipitate chace, had to a man left the castle. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda</hi> disengaging herself from her women, stole
                  up to the black tower, and unbolting the door, presented herself to the astonished
                     <hi rend="italic">Theodore.</hi> Young man, said she, though filial duty, and
                  womanly modesty condemn the step I am taking, yet holy charity, surmounting all
                  other ties, justifies this act. Fly; the doors of thy prison are open: My father
                  and his domestics are absent; but they may soon return: Be gone <pb n="113"
                     facs="pageImages/113.jpg"/>in safety; and may the angels of heaven direct thy
                  course! Thou art surely one of those angels! said the enraptured <hi rend="italic"
                     >Theodore:</hi> None but a blessed saint could speak, could act—could look like
                  thee!—may I not know the name of my divine protectress! methought thou namedst thy
                  father: Is it possible! can <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi>'s
                  blood feel holy pity?—lovely lady, thou answerest not—but how art thou here
                  thyself? why dost thou neglect thy own safety, and waste a thought on a wretch
                  like <hi rend="italic">Theodore?</hi> let us fly together: The life thou bestowest
                  shall be dedicated to thy defence. Alas! thou mistakest; said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda</hi> sighing: I am <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi>'s daughter, but no dangers await me.
                  Amazement! said <hi rend="italic">Theodore:</hi> But last night I blessed myself
                  for yielding thee the service thy gracious compassion so charitably returns me
                  now. Still thou art in an error; said the Princess; but this is no time for
                  explanation. Fly, virtuous youth, while it is in my power to save thee: Should my
                  father return, thou and I both should indeed have <pb n="114"
                     facs="pageImages/114.jpg"/> cause to tremble. How! said <hi rend="italic"
                     >Theodore</hi> ; thinkest thou, charming maid, that I will accept of life at
                  the hazard of aught calamitous to thee? better I endured a thousand deaths, —I run
                  no risk, said <hi rend="italic">Matilda,</hi> but by thy
                  delay. Depart; it cannot be known that I assisted thy flight. Swear by the saints
                  above, said <hi rend="italic">Theodore,</hi> that thou canst not be suspected;
                  else here I vow to await whatever can befal me. Oh! thou art too generous; said
                     <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi> ; but rest assured that no
                  suspicion can alight on me. Give me thy beauteous hand in token that thou dost not
                  deceive me, said <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi> ; and let me bathe it with the
                  warm tears of gratitude,— forbear; said the Princess; this must not be. Alas! said
                     <hi rend="italic">Theodore,</hi> I have never known but calamity until this
                  hour—perhaps shall never know other fortune again: Suffer the chaste raptures of
                  holy gratitude: 'Tis my soul would print its effusions on thy hand. Forbear, and
                  be gone: Said <hi rend="italic">Matilda:</hi> —How would <hi
                     rend="italic">Isabella</hi> approve of seeing thee at my
                  feet? <ref>Who is <hi rend="italic">
                     Isabella?</hi></ref>
                  <pb n="115" facs="pageImages/115.jpg"/>said the young man with surprize. Ah me! I
                  fear, said the Princess, I am serving a deceitful one!—hast thou forgot thy
                  curiosity this morning? Thy looks, thy actions, all thy beauteous self seems an
                  emanation of divinity, said <hi rend="italic">Theodore,</hi> but thy words are
                  dark and mysterious, —speak, lady; speak to thy servant's comprehension.—Thou
                  understandest but too well! said <hi rend="italic"
                     >Matilda:</hi> But once more I command thee to be gone:
                  Thy blood, which, I may preserve, will be on my head, if I waste the time in vain
                  discourse. I go, lady, said <hi rend="italic"> Theodore, </hi> because it is thy
                  will, and because I would not bring the grey hairs of my father with sorrow to the
                  grave. Say but, adored lady, that I have thy gentle pity.—Stay; said <hi
                     rend="italic">Matilda</hi> ; I will conduct thee to the
                  subterraneous vault by which <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>
                  escaped; it will lead thee to the church of St. <hi rend="italic">Nicholas,</hi>
                  where thou mayst take sanctuary.—What! said <hi rend="italic">Theodore,</hi> was
                  it another, and not thy lovely self that I assisted to find the subterraneous
                  passage? It was; <pb n="116" facs="pageImages/116.jpg"/>said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda</hi> ; but ask no more: I tremble to see thee
                  still abide here: Fly to the sanctuary,— to sanctuary! said <hi rend="italic"
                     >Theodore:</hi> No, Princess; sanctuaries are for helpless damsels, or for
                  criminals. <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi> 's soul is free from guilt, nor will
                  wear the appearance of it. Give me a sword, lady, and thy father shall learn that
                     <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi> scorns an ignominious flight. Rash youth! said
                     <hi rend="italic">Matilda,</hi> thou wouldst not dare to
                  lift thy presumptuous arm against the Prince of <hi rend="italic">Otranto?</hi>
                  Not against thy father; indeed I dare not: said <hi rend="italic">Theodore:</hi>
                  Excuse me, lady; I had forgotten,—but could I gaze on thee, and remember thou art
                  sprung from the tyrant <hi rend="italic">Manfred?</hi> —but
                  he is thy father, and from this moment my injuries are buried in oblivion. <ref>A deep
                  and hollow groan</ref>, which seemed to come from above, startled the Princess and <hi
                     rend="italic">Theodore.</hi> Good heaven! we are overheard! said the Princess.
                  They listened; but perceiving no farther noise, they both concluded it the effect
                  of pent-up vapours: And the Princess <pb n="117" facs="pageImages/117.jpg"
                  />preceding <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi> softly, carried him to her father's
                  armory, where equipping him with a complete suit, he was conducted by <hi
                     rend="italic">Matilda</hi> to <ref>the postern-gate</ref>. Avoid the
                  town, said the Princess, and all the western side of the castle: 'Tis there the
                  search must be making by <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> and
                  the strangers: But <ref>hie</ref> thee to the opposite quarter. Yonder behind that forest to
                  the east is a chain of rocks, hollowed into <ref>a labyrinth of caverns</ref> that reach to
                  the seacoast. There thou mayst lie concealed, till thou canst make signs to some
                  vessel to put on shore and take thee off. Go! heaven be thy guide! —and sometimes
                  in thy prayers remember— <hi rend="italic">Matilda!
                     Theodore</hi> flung himself at her feet, and seizing her lilly hand, which with
                  struggles she suffered him to kiss, he vowed on the earliest opportunity to get
                  himself knighted, and fer vently intreated her permission to swear himself
                  eternally her knight—E'er the Princess could reply, a clap of thunder was suddenly
                  heard, that shook the battlements. <hi rend="italic">Theodore,</hi> regardless <pb
                     n="118" facs="pageImages/118.jpg"/> of the tempest, would have urged his suit;
                  but the Princess, dismayed, retreated hastily into the castle, and commanded the
                  youth to be gone with an air that would not be disobeyed. He sighed, and retired,
                  but with eyes fixed on the gate, until <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda</hi> closing it, put an end to an interview,
                  in which the hearts of both had drunk so deeply of a passion, which both now
                  tasted for the first time. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi> went pensively to the convent, to acquaint his
                  father with his deliverance. There he learned the absence of <hi rend="italic"
                     >Jerome,</hi> and the pursuit that was making after the lady <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella,</hi> with some particulars of whose story he
                  now first be came acquainted. The generous <ref>galantry</ref> of his nature prompted him to
                  wish to assist her; but the Monks could lend him no lights to guess at the route
                  she had taken. He was not tempted to wander far in search of her, for the idea of
                     <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi> had imprinted itself so
                  strongly on his heart, that he could not bear to absent himself at much distance
                  from her abode. The <pb n="119" facs="pageImages/119.jpg"/> tenderness <hi
                     rend="italic">Jerome</hi> had expressed for him concurred to confirm this
                  reluctance; and he even persuaded himself that silial affection was the chief
                  cause of his hovering between the castle and monastery. Until <hi rend="italic"
                     >Jerome</hi> should return at night; <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi> at length
                  determined to repair to the forest that <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda</hi> had pointed out to him. Arriving there,
                  he sought the gloomiest shades, as best suited to <ref>the pleasing melancholy</ref> that
                  reigned in his mind. In this mood he roved insensibly to the caves which had
                  formerly served as a retreat to hermits, and were now reported round the country
                  to be haunted by evil spirits. He recollected to have heard this tradition; and
                  being of a brave and adventurous disposition, he willingly indulged his curiosity
                  in exploring the secret recesses of this labyrinth. He had not penetrated far
                  before he thought he heard the steps of some person who seemed to retreat before
                  him. <hi rend="italic">Theodore,</hi> though firmly grounded in all our holy faith
                  enjoins to be believed, had no apprehension <pb n="120" facs="pageImages/120.jpg"
                  />that good men were abandoned without cause to the malice of the powers of
                  darkness. He thought the place more likely to be infested by robbers than by those
                  infernal agents who are reported to molest and bewilder travellers. He had long
                  burned with impatience to approve his valour—drawing his sabre, he marched
                  sedately onwards, still directing his steps, as the imperfect rustling sound
                  before him led the way. The armour he wore was a like indication to the person who
                  avoided him. <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi> now convinced that he was not
                  mistaken, redoubled his pace, and evidently gained on the person that fled, whose
                  haste increasing, <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi> came up just as a woman fell
                  breathless before him. He hasted to raise her, but her terror was so great, that
                  he apprehended she would saint in his arms. He used every gentle word to dispel
                  her alarms, and assured her that far from injuring, he would defend her at the
                  peril of his life. The lady recovering her spirits from his courteous demeanour,
                  and gazing on her protector, <pb n="121" facs="pageImages/121.jpg"/>said, sure I
                  have heard that voice before! not to my knowledge, replied <hi rend="italic"
                     >Theodore,</hi> unless as I conjecture thou art the lady <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella,</hi> —merciful heaven! cried she, thou art
                  not sent <ref>in quest of me</ref>, art thou? and saying those words, she threw herself at
                  his feet, and besought him not to deliver her up to <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred.</hi> To <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred!</hi> cried <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi>
                  —no, lady, I have once already delivered thee from his tyranny, and it shall fare
                  hard with me now, but I will place thee out of the reach of his daring. Is it
                  possible, said she, that thou shouldst be the generous unknown whom I met last
                  night in the vault of the castle? sure thou art not a mortal, but my guardian angel: On my knees let me thank—hold, gentle Princess,
                  said <hi rend="italic">Theodore,</hi> nor demean thyself before a poor and
                  friendless young man. If heaven has selected me for thy deliverer, it will
                  accomplish its work, and strengthen my arm in thy cause—but come, lady, we are too
                  near the mouth of the cavern; let us seek its inmost recesses: I <pb n="122"
                     facs="pageImages/122.jpg"/>can have no tranquillity till I have placed thee
                  beyond the reach of danger. Alas! what mean you, Sir? said she. Though all your
                  actions are noble, though your sentiments speak the purity of your soul, is it
                  fitting that I should accompany you alone into these perplexed retreats? should we
                  be found together, what would a censorious world think of my conduct? I respect
                  <ref>your virtuous delicacy</ref>, said <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi> ; nor do you harbour
                  a suspicion that wounds my honour. I meant to conduct you into the most private
                  cavity of these rocks, and then at the hazard of my life to guard their entrance
                  against every living thing. Besides, lady, continued he drawing a deep sigh,
                  beauteous and all perfect as your form is, and though my wishes are not guiltless
                  of aspiring, know, my soul is dedicated to another; and although —a sudden noise
                  prevented <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi> from proceeding. They soon distinguished
                  these sounds, <hi rend="italic">Isabella!</hi> what ho! <hi
                     rend="italic">Isabella!</hi> —the trembling Princess
                  relapsed into her former <pb n="123" facs="pageImages/123.jpg"/> agony of fear.
                     <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi> endeavoured to encourage her, but in vain. He
                  assured her he would die rather than suffer her to return under <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> 's power; and begging her to remain
                  concealed, he went forth to prevent the person in search of her from approaching. </p>
               <p> At the mouth of the cavern he found an armed Knight, discoursing with a peasant,
                  who assured him he had seen a lady enter the passes of the rock. The Knight was
                  preparing to seek her, when <hi rend="italic">Theodore,</hi> placing himself in
                  his way, with his sword drawn, sternly forbad him at his peril to advance. And who
                  art thou who darest to cross my way? said the Knight haughtily. One who does not
                  dare more than he will perform, said <hi rend="italic">Theodore.</hi> I seek the
                  lady <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> ; said the Knight, and
                  understand she has taken refuge among these rocks. Impede me not, or thou wilt
                  repent having provoked my resentment. Thy purpose is as odious, as thy resentment
                  is contemptible, said <hi rend="italic">Theodore.</hi> Return whence thou <pb
                     n="124" facs="pageImages/124.jpg"/> camest, or we shall soon know whose
                  resentment is most terrible. The stranger, who was the principal Knight that had
                  arrived from the marquis of <hi rend="italic">Vicenza,</hi> had galloped from <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred</hi> as he was busied in getting
                  information of the Princess, and giving various orders to prevent her falling into
                  the power of the three Knights. Their chief had suspected <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> of being privy to the Princess's
                  absconding; and this insult from a man, who he concluded was stationed by that
                  Prince to secrete her, confirming his suspicions, he made no reply, but
                  discharging a blow with his sabre at <hi rend="italic">Theodore,</hi> would soon
                  have removed all obstruction, if <hi rend="italic">Theodore,</hi> who took him for
                  one of <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi>'s captains, and who had
                  no sooner given the provocation than prepared to support it, had not received the
                  stroke on his shield. The valour that had so long been smothered in his breast,
                  broke forth at once; he rushed impetuously on the Knight, whose pride and wrath
                  were not less powerful incentives to hardy deeds. The combat was <pb n="125"
                     facs="pageImages/125.jpg"/>furious, but not long: <hi rend="italic"
                     >Theodore</hi> wounded the Knight in three several places, and at last disarmed
                  him as he fainted with the loss of blood. The peasant, who had fled at the first
                  onset, had given the alarm to some of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi>'s domestics, who by his orders were
                  dispersed through the forest in pursuit of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella.</hi> They came up as the Knight fell, whom
                  they soon discovered to be the noble stranger. <hi rend="italic">Theodore,</hi>
                  notwithstanding his hatred to <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi>
                  could not behold the victory he had gained without emotions of pity and
                  generosity: But he was more touched, when he learned the quality of his adversary,
                  and was informed that he was no retainer, but an enemy of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred.</hi> He assisted the servants of the latter
                  in disarming the Knight, and in endeavouring to staunch the blood that flowed from
                  his wounds. The Knight recovering his speech, said in a faint and faltering voice,
                  generous foe, we have both been in an error: I took thee for an instrument of the
                  tyrant; I perceive thou hast made <pb n="126" facs="pageImages/126.jpg"/>the like
                  mistake—it is too late for excuses—I faint—if <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella</hi> is at hand—call her—I have important
                  secrets to—He is dying! said one of the attendants; has nobody a crucifix about
                  them? <hi rend="italic">Andrea,</hi> do thou pray over him—fetch some water, said
                     <hi rend="italic">Theodore,</hi> and pour it down his throat, while I hasten to
                  the Princess—saying this, he flew to <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella,</hi> and in few words told her modestly,
                  that he had been so unfortunate by mistake as to wound a gentleman from her
                  father's court, who wished e'er he died to impart something of consequence to her.
                  The Princess, who had been transported at hearing the voice of <hi rend="italic"
                     >Theodore</hi> as he called to her to come forth, was astonished at what she
                  heard. Suffering herself to be conducted by <hi rend="italic">Theodore,</hi> the
                  new proof of whose valour recalled her dispersed spirits, she came where the
                  bleeding Knight lay speechless on the ground—but her fears returned, when she
                  beheld the domestics of <hi rend="italic">
                     Manfred. </hi> She would again have fled, if <hi
                     rend="italic">Theodore</hi> had not made her observe that they were unarmed,
                     <pb n="127" facs="pageImages/127.jpg"/> and had not threatened them with
                  instant death, if they should dare to seize the Princess. The stranger, opening
                  his eyes, and beholding a woman, said—art thou—pray tell me truly— art thou <hi
                     rend="italic">Isabella</hi> of <hi rend="italic"
                     >Vicenza?</hi> I am; said she: good heaven restore thee!—Then thou— then
                  thou—said the Knight, struggling for utterance—seest—thy father—give me one— oh!
                  amasement! horror! what do I hear! what do I see! cried <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella.</hi> <ref>My father! you my father!</ref> how came you
                  here, Sir? for heaven's sake speak!—oh! run for help, or he will expire!—'Tis most
                  true, said the wounded Knight, exerting all his force; I am <hi rend="italic">
                     Frederic </hi> thy father—yes, I came to deliver thee— It will not be—give me a
                  parting kiss, and take—Sir, said <hi rend="italic">Theodore,</hi> do not exhaust
                  yourself: suffer us to convey you to the castle— to the castle! said <hi
                     rend="italic">Isabella</hi> ; is there no help nearer than
                  the castle? would you expose my father to the tyrant? if he goes thither, I dare
                  not accompany him—and yet, can I <pb n="128" facs="pageImages/128.jpg"/>leave him!
                  my child, said <hi rend="italic">Frederic,</hi> it matters not for me whither I am
                  carried: A few minutes will place me beyond danger—but while I have eyes to doat
                  on thee, forsake me not, dear <hi rend="italic"
                     >Isabella!</hi> This brave Knight—I know not who he is,
                  will protect thy innocence—Sir, you will not abandon my child, will you! <hi
                     rend="italic"> Theodore </hi> shedding tears over his victim, and vowing to
                  guard the Princess at the expence of his life, persuaded <hi rend="italic"
                     >Frederic</hi> to suffer himself to be conducted to the castle. They placed him
                  on a horse belonging to one of the domestics, after binding up his wounds as well
                  as they were able. <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi> marched by his side; and the
                  afflicted <hi rend="italic">Isabella,</hi> who could not bear
                  to quit him, followed mournfully behind. </p>

               <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
               <p> THE sorrowful troop no sooner arrived at the castle, than they were met by <hi
                     rend="italic">
                     Hippolita
                  </hi> and <hi rend="italic">Matilda,</hi> whom <hi
                     rend="italic">Isabella</hi> had sent one of the domestics
                  before to advertise of their approach. The Ladies causing <hi rend="italic"
                     >Frederic</hi> to be conveyed into the nearest chamber, retired, while the
                  surgeons examined his wounds. <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi>
                  blushed at seeing <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella</hi> together; but endeavoured to conceal it
                  by embracing the latter, and condoling with her on her father's mischance. The
                  surgeons soon came to acquaint <hi rend="italic"
                     >Hippolita</hi> that none of the Marquis's wounds were
                  dangerous; and that he was desirous of seeing his daughter and the Princesses.
                     <hi rend="italic">Theodore,</hi> under pretence of expressing his joy at being
                  freed from his apprehensions of the combat being fatal to <hi rend="italic"
                     >Frederic,</hi> could not resist the <pb n="130" facs="pageImages/130.jpg"
                  />impulse of following <hi rend="italic">Matilda.</hi> Her
                  eyes were so often cast down on meeting his, that <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella,</hi> who regarded <hi rend="italic"
                     >Theodore</hi> as attentively as he gazed on <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda,</hi> soon devined who the object was that he
                  had told her in the cave engaged his affections. While this mute scene passed, <hi
                     rend="italic"> Hippolita </hi> demanded of <hi rend="italic">Frederic</hi> the
                  cause of his having taken that mysterious course for reclaiming his daughter; and
                  threw in various apologies to excuse her Lord for the match contracted between
                  their children. <hi rend="italic">Frederic.</hi> however incensed against <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> was not insensible to the
                  courtesy and benevolence of <hi rend="italic">Hippolita:</hi>
                  But he was still more struck with the lovely form of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda.</hi> Wishing to detain them by his bedside,
                  he informed <hi rend="italic">Hippolita</hi> of his story. He
                  told her, that, while prisoner to <ref>the infidels</ref>, he had dreamed that his daughter,
                  of whom he had learned no news since his captivity, was detained in a castle,
                  where she was in danger of the most dreadful misfortunes: And that if he obtained
                  his liberty, and repaired to a wood <pb n="131" facs="pageImages/131.jpg"/> near
                  <hi rend="italic"><placeName type="TGN" key="7001369">Joppa</placeName>,</hi> he would learn more. Alarmed at this dream, and
                  incapable of obeying the direction given by it, his chains became more grievous
                  than ever. But while his thoughts were occupied on the means of obtaining his
                  liberty, he received the agreeable news that the confederate Princes, who were
                  warring in <hi rend="italic"> <placeName type="TGN" key="7004540">Palestine</placeName>, </hi> had paid his ransom. He instantly
                  set out for the wood that had been marked in his dream. For three days he and his
                  attendants had wandered in the forest without seeing a human form: But on the
                  evening of the third they came to a cell, in which they found a venerable hermit
                  in the agonies of death. Applying rich cordials, they brought the saint-like man
                  to his speech. My sons, said he, I am bounden to your charity—but it is in vain—I
                  am going to my eternal rest—yet I die with the satisfaction of performing the will
                  of heaven. When first I repaired to this solitude, after seeing my country become
                  a prey to unbelievers— it is alas! above fifty years since I was witness <pb
                     n="132" facs="pageImages/132.jpg"/>to that dreadful scene! St. <hi
                     rend="italic">Nicholas</hi> appeared to me, and revealed a secret, which he bad
                  me never reveal to mortal man, but on my deathbed. This is that tremendous hour,
                  and ye are no doubt the chosen warriors to whom I was ordered to reveal my trust.
                  As soon as ye have done the last offices to this wretched <ref>corse</ref>, dig under the
                  seventh tree on the left-hand of this poor cave, and your pains will—Oh! good
                  heaven receive my soul! With those words the devout man breathed his last. By
                  break of day, continued <hi rend="italic">Frederic,</hi> when we had committed the
                  holy relicks to earth, we dug according to direction—but what was our
                  astonishment, when about the depth of six feet we discovered an enormous sabre—the
                  very weapon yonder in the court. On the blade, which was then partly out of the
                  scabbard, though since closed by our efforts in removing it, were written the
                  following lines—no; excuse me, Madam, added the Marquis, turning to <hi
                     rend="italic">Hippolita,</hi> if I forbear to repeat them:
                  I respect your sex and <pb n="133" facs="pageImages/133.jpg"/>rank, and would not
                  be guilty of offending your ear with sounds injurious to ought that is dear to
                  you—He paused. <hi rend="italic">Hippolita</hi> trembled. She
                  did not doubt but <hi rend="italic">Frederic</hi> was destined by heaven to
                  accomplish the sate that seemed to threaten her house. Looking with anxious
                  fondness at <hi rend="italic">Matilda,</hi> a silent tear
                  stole down her cheek: But recollecting herself, she said; proceed, my Lord: Heaven
                  does nothing in vain: Mortals must receive its divine behests with lowliness and
                  submission. It is our part to deprecate its wrath, or bow to its decrees. Repeat
                  the sentence, my Lord; we listen resigned. <hi rend="italic">Frederic</hi> was
                  grieved that he had proceeded so far. The dignity and patient firmness of <hi
                     rend="italic">Hippolita</hi> penetrated him with respect,
                  and the tender silent affection with which the Princess and her daughter regarded
                  each other, melted him almost to tears. Yet apprehensive that his forbearance to
                  obey, would be more alarming, he repeated in a faltering and low voice the
                  following lines:

                  What is there in these lines, said <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi>
                  impatiently, that affects these Princesses? why were they to be shocked by a

                     rend="italic">Theodore</hi>'s warmth, which she perceived was dictated by his
                  sentiments for <hi rend="italic">Matilda,</hi> discompose not
                  yourself for the glosing of a peasant's son: He forgets the reverence he owes you;
                  but he is not accustomed— <hi rend="italic">Hippolita,</hi>
                  concerned at the heat that had arisen, checked <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi> for
                  his boldness, but with an air acknowledging his zeal; and changing the
                  conversation, demanded of <hi rend="italic">Frederic</hi> where he had left her
                  Lord? As the Marquis was going to reply, they heard a noise <pb n="135"
                     facs="pageImages/135.jpg"/>without, and rising to inquire the cause, <hi
                     rend="italic">
                     Manfred, </hi>
                  <hi rend="italic">Jerome,</hi> and part of the troop, who had met an imperfect
                  rumour of what had happened, entered the chamber. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> advanced hastily towards <hi
                     rend="italic">Frederic</hi>'s bed to condole with him on his misfortune, and to
                  learn the circumstances of the combat, when starting in an agony of terror and
                  amazement, he cried, Ha! what art thou? thou dreadful spectre! is my hour come?
                  —my dearest, gracious Lord, cried <hi rend="italic"
                     >Hippolita,</hi> clasping him in her arms, what is it you
                  see? why do you fix your eye-balls thus!—What! cried <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> breathless—dost thou see nothing, <hi
                     rend="italic">Hippolita?</hi> is this ghastly phantom sent
                  to me alone—to me, who did not—for mercy's sweetest self, my Lord, said <hi
                     rend="italic">Hippolita,</hi> resume your soul, command
                  your reason. There is none here, but us, your friends—what is not that <hi
                     rend="italic">Alfonso?</hi> cried <hi rend="italic">
                     Manfred
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> ; Dost thou not see him? can it be my brain's delirium?—This! my Lord, said
                     <hi rend="italic">Hippolita</hi> ; this is <hi
                     rend="italic">Theodore,</hi> the youth who has been so unfortunate— <hi
                     rend="italic">Theodore!</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="pageImages/136.jpg"/>said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> mournfully, and striking his forehead —
                     <hi rend="italic">Theodore,</hi> or a phantom, he has unhinged the soul of <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred</hi> —but how comes he here? and how
                  comes he in armour? I believe he went in search of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella:</hi> Said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita.</hi> Of <hi rend="italic">
                     Isabella! </hi> said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred,</hi> relapsing into rage—yes, yes, that is
                  not doubtful—but how did he escape from <ref>durance</ref> in which I left him? was it <hi
                     rend="italic">Isabella,</hi> or this hypocritical old
                  Friar, that procured his enlargement?—and would a parent be criminal, my Lord,
                  said <hi rend="italic">Theodore,</hi> if he me ditated the deliverance of his
                  child? <hi rend="italic">Jerome</hi> amazed to hear himself in a manner accused by
                  his son, and without foundation, knew not what to think. He could not comprehend,
                  how <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi> had escaped, how he came to be armed, and to
                  encounter <hi rend="italic">Frederic.</hi> Still he would not venture to ask any
                  questions that might tend to inflame <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi>'s wrath against his son. <hi
                     rend="italic">Jerome</hi>'s silence convinced <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> that he had contrived <hi rend="italic"
                     >Theodore</hi>'s release—and is it thus, thou ungrateful old man, said the
                  Prince <pb n="137" facs="pageImages/137.jpg"/>addressing himself to the Friar,
                  that thou repayest mine and <hi rend="italic"
                  >Hippolita</hi>'s bounties? And not content with traversing
                  my heart's nearest wishes, thou armest thy bastard, and bringest him into my own
                  castle to insult me! My Lord, said <hi rend="italic">Theodore,</hi> you wrong my
                  father: Nor he nor I are capable of harbouring a thought against your peace. Is it
                  insolence thus to surrender myself to your Highness's pleasure? added he, laying
                  his sword respectfully at <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> 's
                  feet. Behold my bosom; strike, my Lord, if you suspect that a disloyal thought is
                  lodged there. There is not a sentiment engraven on my heart, that does not
                  venerate you and yours. The grace and fervour with which <hi rend="italic"
                     >Theodore</hi> uttered these words, interested every person present in his
                  favour. Even <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> was touched— yet
                  still possessed with his resemblance to <hi rend="italic"> Alfonso, </hi> his
                  admiration was dashed with secret horror. Rise; said he; thy life is not my
                  present purpose.—But tell me thy history, and how thou camest connected with this
                  old traitor here. <pb n="138" facs="pageImages/138.jpg"/>My Lord, said <hi
                     rend="italic">Jerome</hi> eagerly—peace? impostor! said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> ; I will not have him prompted. My Lord,
                  said <hi rend="italic">Theodore,</hi> I want no assistance: My story is very
                  brief. I was carried at five years of age to <hi rend="italic"><placeName type="TGN" key="7001314">Algiers</placeName></hi> with
                  my mo ther, who had been taken by <ref>corsairs</ref> from the coast of <hi rend="italic"
                     ><placeName type="TGN" key="7003122">Sicily</placeName>.</hi> She died of grief in less than a twelvemonth—the tears gushed
                  from <hi rend="italic">Jerome</hi>'s eyes, on whose countenance a thousand anxious
                  passions stood expressed. Before she died, continued <hi rend="italic"
                     >Theodore,</hi> she bound a writing about my arm under my garments, which told
                  me I was the son of the Count <hi rend="italic">Falconara</hi> —it is most true,
                  said <hi rend="italic">Jerome</hi> ; I am that wretched father—again I enjoin thee
                  silence: said <hi rend="italic">Manfred:</hi> Proceed. I
                  remained in slavery, said <hi rend="italic">Theodore,</hi> until within these two
                  years, when attending on my master in his <ref>cruizes</ref>, I was delivered by a Christian
                  vessel, which over-powered the pirate; and discovering myself to the captian, he
                  generously put me on shore in <hi rend="italic">Sicily</hi> —but alas! instead of
                  finding a father, I learned that his estate, <pb n="139" facs="pageImages/139.jpg"
                  />which was situated on the coast, had, during his absence, been laid waste by the
                  Rover, who had carried my mother and me into captivity: That his castle had been
                  burnt to the ground, and that my father on his return had sold what remained, and
                  was retired into religion in the kingdom of <hi rend="italic"><placeName type="TGN" key="7003012">Naples</placeName>,</hi> but
                  where no man could inform me. Destitute and friendless, hopless almost of
                  attaining the transport of a parent's embrace, I took the first opportunity of
                  setting sail for <hi rend="italic"><placeName type="TGN" key="7003012">Naples</placeName>,</hi> from whence, within these six
                  days, I wandered into this province, still supporting myself by the labour of my
                  hands; nor until yester-morn did I believe that heaven had reserved any lot for me
                  but peace of mind and contented poverty. This, my Lord, is <hi rend="italic"> Theo
                     dore </hi>'s story. I am blessed beyond my hope in finding a father; I am
                  unfortunate beyond my desert in having incurred your Highness's displeasure. He
                  ceased. A murmur of approbation gently arose from the audience. This is not all;
                  said <hi rend="italic">Frederic:</hi> I am bound in honour <pb n="140"
                     facs="pageImages/140.jpg"/> to add what he suppresses. Though he is modest, I
                  must be generous—he is one of the bravest youths on Christian ground. He is warm
                  too; and from the short knowledge I have of him, I will pledge myself for his veracity: If what he reports of himself were not true, he would not utter it—and for
                  me, youth, I honour a frankness which becomes thy birth. But now, and thou didst
                  offend me: Yet the noble blood which flows in thy vains, may well be allowed to
                  boil out, when it has so recently traced itself to its source. Come, my Lord
                  [turning to <hi rend="italic">Manfred]</hi> if I can pardon
                  him, surely you may: It is not the youth's fault, if you took him for a spectre.
                  This bitter taunt galled the soul of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred.</hi> If beings from another world, replied he
                  haughtily, have power to impress my mind with awe, it is more than living man can
                  do; nor could a stripling's arm —my Lord, interrupted <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita,</hi> your guest has occasion for repose:
                  Shall we not leave him to his rest? Saying this, and taking <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> by <pb n="141" facs="pageImages/141.jpg"
                  />the hand, she took leave of <hi rend="italic">Frederic,</hi> and led the company
                  forth. The Prince, not sorry to quit a conversation, which recalled to mind the
                  discovery he had made of his most secret sensations, suffered himself to be
                  conducted to his own apartment, after permitting <hi rend="italic">Theodore,</hi>
                  tho' under engagement to return to the castle on the morrow [a condition the young
                  man gladly accepted] to retire with his father to the convent. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella</hi> were too much occupied with their own
                  reflections, and too little content with each other, to wish for farther converse
                  that night. They separated each to her chamber, with more expressions of ceremony
                  and fewer of affection, than had passed between them since their childhood. </p>
               <p> If they parted with small cordiality, they did but meet with greater impatience,
                  as soon as the sun was risen. Their minds were in a situation that excluded sleep,
                  and each recollected a thousand questions which she wished she had put to the
                  other overnight. <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi> reflected
                  that <hi rend="italic">
                     Isabella
                  </hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="pageImages/142.jpg"/>had been twice delivered by <hi
                     rend="italic">Theodore</hi> in very critical situations, which she could not
                  believe accidental. His eyes, it was true, had been fixed on her in <hi
                     rend="italic">Frederic</hi>'s chamber; but that might have been to disguise his
                  passion for <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> from the fathers
                  of both. It were better to clear this up—She wished to know the truth, lest she
                  should wrong her friend by entertaining a passion for <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella</hi>'s lover. Thus jealousy prompted, and at
                  the same time borrowed an excuse from friendship to justify its curiosity. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Isabella,</hi> not less restless, had
                  better foundation for her suspicions. Both <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi>'s
                  tongue and eyes had told her his heart was engaged— it was true—yet perhaps <hi
                     rend="italic">Matilda</hi> might not correspond to his
                  passion—she had ever appeared insensible to love: All her thoughts were set on
                  heaven—why did I dissuade her? said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella</hi> to herself: I am punished for my
                  generosity— but when did they meet? where?—it cannot be: I have deceived
                  myself—perhaps last night was the first time they ever beheld each other <pb
                     n="143" facs="pageImages/143.jpg"/>—it must be some other object that has
                  prepossessed his affections—if it is, I am not so unhappy, as I thought; if it is
                  not my friend <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi> —how! can I
                  stoop to wish for the affection of a man, who rudely and unnecessarily acquainted
                  me with his indifference? and that at the very moment in which common courtesy
                  demanded at least expressions of civility. I will go to my dear <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda,</hi> who will confirm me in this becoming
                  pride—man is false—I will advise with her on <ref>taking the veil</ref>: She will rejoice to
                  find me in this disposition; and I will acquaint her that I no longer oppose her
                  inclination for the cloyster. In this frame of mind, and determined to open her
                  heart entirely to <hi rend="italic">Matilda,</hi> she went to
                  that Princess's chamber, whom she found already dresled, and leaning pensively on
                  her arm. This attitude, so correspondent to what she felt herself, revived <hi
                     rend="italic">Isabella</hi>'s suspicions, and destroyed
                  the confidence she had purposed to place in her friend. They blushed at meeting,
                  and were too much novices <pb n="144" facs="pageImages/144.jpg"/> to disguise
                  their sensations with address. After some unmeaning questions and replies, <hi
                     rend="italic">Matilda</hi> demanded of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella</hi> the cause of her flight? the latter, who
                  had almost forgotten <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi>'s
                  passion, so entirely was she occupied by her own, concluding that <hi
                     rend="italic">Matilda</hi> referred to her last escape
                  from the convent, which had occasioned the events of the preceding evening,
                  replied, <hi rend="italic">Martelli</hi> brought word to the convent that your
                  mother was dead—oh! said <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi>
                  interrupting her, <hi rend="italic">Bianca</hi> has explained that mistake to me:
                  on seeing me faint, she cried out, the Princess is dead! and <hi rend="italic"
                     >Martelli</hi> who had come for the usual dole to the castle—and what made you
                  faint? said <hi rend="italic">Isabella,</hi> indifferent to
                  the rest. <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi> blushed, and
                  stammered—my father— he was sitting in judgment on a criminal— what criminal? said
                     <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> eagerly—a young man; said
                     <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi> —I believe—I think it was
                  that young man that—what, <hi rend="italic">Theodore?</hi> said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella.</hi> Yes; answered she; I never saw him
                  before; I do not know how he had offended my father <pb n="145"
                     facs="pageImages/145.jpg"/>—but as he has been of service to you, I am glad my
                  Lord has pardoned him—served me? replied <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella</hi> ; do you term it serving me, to wound my
                  father, and almost occasion his death! Though it is but since yesterday that I am
                  blessed with knowing a parent, I hope <hi rend="italic">
                     Matilda
                  </hi> does not think I am such a stranger to filial tenderness as not to resent
                  the boldness of that audacious youth, and that it is impossible for me ever to
                  feel any affection for one who dared to lift his arm against the author of my
                  being. No, <hi rend="italic">Matilda,</hi> my heart abhors
                  him; and if you still retain the friendship for me that you have vowed from your
                  infancy, you will detest a man who has been on the point of making me miserable
                  for ever. <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi> held down her head,
                  and replied; I hope my dearest <hi rend="italic"
                     >Isabella</hi> does not doubt her <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda</hi>'s friendship: I never beheld that youth
                  until yesterday; he is almost a stranger to me: But as the surgeons have
                  pronounced your father out of danger, you ought not to harbour uncharitable
                  resentment <pb n="146" facs="pageImages/146.jpg"/>against one, who I am persuaded
                  did not know the Marquis was related to you. You plead his cause very
                  pathetically, said <hi rend="italic">
                     Isabella, </hi> considering he is so much a stranger to
                  you! I am mistaken, or he returns your charity. What mean you? said <hi
                     rend="italic">Matilda.</hi> Nothing: Said <hi
                     rend="italic">
                     Isabella, </hi> repenting that she had given <hi
                     rend="italic">Matilda</hi> a hint of <hi rend="italic"
                     >Theodore</hi>'s inclination for her. Then changing the discourse, she asked
                     <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi> what occasioned <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred</hi> to take <hi rend="italic"
                     >Theodore</hi> for a spectre? Bless me, said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda,</hi> did not you observe his extreme
                  resemblance to the portrait of <hi rend="italic"> Alfonso </hi> in the gallery? I
                  took notice of it to <hi rend="italic">Bianca</hi> even before I saw him in
                  armour; but with the helmet on, he is the very image of that picture. I do not
                  much observe pictures; said <hi rend="italic">Isabella:</hi>
                  Much less have I examined this young man so attentively as you seem to have
                  done—ah! <hi rend="italic">Matilda,</hi> your heart is in
                  danger—but let me warn you as a friend—he has owned to me that he is in love; it
                  cannot be with you, for yesterday was the first time you ever met—was <pb n="147"
                     facs="pageImages/147.jpg"/>it not? certainly: replied <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda</hi> ; but why does my dearest <hi
                     rend="italic">Isabella</hi> conclude from any thing I have
                  said, that—she paused—then continuing; he saw you first, and I am far from having
                  the vanity to thing that my little portion of charms could engage a heart devoted
                  to you—may you be happy, <hi rend="italic">Isabella,</hi>
                  whatever is the fate of <hi rend="italic">
                     Matilda! </hi> My lovely friend, said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella,</hi> whose heart was too honest to resist a
                  kind expression, it is you that <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi> admires; I saw it;
                  I am persuaded of it; nor shall a thought of my own happiness suffer me to
                  interfere with yours. This frankness drew tears from the gentle <hi rend="italic">
                     Matilda
                  </hi> ; and jealousy that for a moment had raised a coolness between these amiable
                  maidens, soon gave way to the natural sincerity and candour of their souls. Each
                  confessed to the other the impression that <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi> had
                  made on her; and this confidence was followed by a struggle of generosity, each
                  insisting on yielding her claim to her friend. At length, the dignity of <hi
                     rend="italic">
                     Isabella
                  </hi>'s virtue reminding her of the preference which <pb n="148"
                     facs="pageImages/148.jpg"/>
                  <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi> had almost declared for her rival, made her
                  determine to conquer her passion, and cede the beloved object to her friend. </p>
               <p> During this contest of <ref>amity</ref>, <hi rend="italic"
                     >Hippolita</hi> entered her daughter's chamber. Madam,
                  said she to <hi rend="italic">Isabella,</hi> you have so much
                  tenderness for <hi rend="italic">Matilda,</hi> and interest
                  yourself so kindly in whatever affects our wretched house, that I can have no
                  secrets with my child, which are not proper for you to hear. The Princesses were
                  all attention and anxiety. Know then, Madam, continued <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita,</hi> and you, my dearest <hi rend="italic">
                     Matilda, </hi> that being convinced by all the events of these two last
                  ominous days, that heaven purposes the sceptre of <hi rend="italic">Otranto</hi>
                  shuld pass from <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi>'s hands into
                  those of the Marquis <hi rend="italic"> Frederic, </hi> I have been perhaps
                  inspired with the thought of averting our total destruction by the union of our
                  rival houses. With this view I have been proposing to <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> my Lord to tender this dear, dear child
                  to <hi rend="italic">Frederic</hi> your father —me to lord <hi rend="italic"
                     >Frederic!</hi> cried <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi> —good
                  heavens! <pb n="149" facs="pageImages/149.jpg"/>my gracious mother—and have you
                  named it to my father? I have: Said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita:</hi> He listened benignly to my proposal,
                  and is gone to break it to the Marquis. Ah! wretched Princess! cried <hi
                     rend="italic">Isabella</hi> ; what hast thou done! what
                  ruin has thy inadvertent goodness been preparing for thyself, for me, and for <hi
                     rend="italic">Matilda!</hi> Ruin from me to you and to my
                  child! said <hi rend="italic">Hippolita</hi> ; what can this
                  mean? Alas! said <hi rend="italic">Isabella,</hi> the purity
                  of your own heart prevents your seeing the depravity of others. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred,</hi> your Lord, that impious man—hold; said
                     <hi rend="italic">Hippolita,</hi> you must not in my
                  presence, young lady, mention <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi>
                  with disrespect: He is my lord and husband, and—will not long be so, said <hi
                     rend="italic">Isabella,</hi> if his wicked purposes can be
                  carried into execution. This language amazes me; said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita.</hi> Your feeling, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella,</hi> is warm; but until this hour I never
                  knew it betray you into intemperance. What deed of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> authorizes you to treat him as a
                  murderer, an assassin? Thou virtuous, and too credulous Princess! <pb n="150"
                     facs="pageImages/150.jpg"/> replied <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella</hi> ; it is not thy life he aims at—it is to
                  separate himself from thee! to divorce thee! to—to divorce me! to divorce my
                  mother! cried <hi rend="italic">Hippolita</hi> and <hi
                     rend="italic">Matilda</hi> at once —yes; said <hi
                     rend="italic">Isabella</hi> ; and to compleat his crime,
                  he meditates—I cannot speak it! What can surpass what thou hast already uttered?
                  said <hi rend="italic">Matilda.
                        Hippolita</hi> was silent. Grief choaked her speech;
                  and the recollection of <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi>'s late
                  ambiguous discourses confirmed what she heard. Excellent, dear Lady! Madam!
                  Mother! cried <hi rend="italic">Isabella,</hi> flinging
                  herself at <hi rend="italic"> Hippolita </hi>'s feet in a transport of passion;
                  trust me, believe me, I will die a thousand deaths sooner than consent to injure
                  you, than yield to so odious —oh!—This is too much! cried <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita:</hi> What crimes does one crime suggest!
                  rise, dear <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> ; I do not doubt
                  your virtue. Oh! <hi rend="italic">
                     Matilda, </hi> this stroke is too heavy for thee! weep
                  not, my child; and not a murmur, I charge thee. Remember, he is <hi rend="italic"
                     >thy</hi> father still!—but you are my mother too; said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda</hi> servently; <pb n="151"
                     facs="pageImages/151.jpg"/>and <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are virtuous, <hi
                     rend="italic">you</hi> are guiltless!—Oh! must not I, must not I complain? You
                  must not: Said <hi rend="italic">Hippolita</hi> —come, all
                  will yet be well. <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> in the
                  agony for the loss of thy brother, knew not what he said: perhaps <hi
                     rend="italic">Isabella</hi> misunderstood him: His heart
                  is good—and, my child, thou knowest not all! There is a destiny hangs over us; the
                  hand of Providence is stretched out—Oh! could I but save thee from the wreck!—yes,
                  continued she in a firmer tone; perhaps the sacrifice of myself may atone for
                  all—I will go and offer myself to this divorce—it boots not what becomes of me. I
                  will withdraw into the neighbouring monastery, and waste the remainder of life in
                  prayers and tears for my child and—the Prince! Thou art as much too good for this
                  world, said <hi rend="italic"> Isabella, </hi> as <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> is execrable—but think not, Lady, that
                  thy weakness shall determine for me. I swear, hear me all ye angels—stop, I adjure
                  thee; cried <hi rend="italic">Hippolita:</hi> Remember thou
                  dost not depend on thyself; thou hast a father <pb n="152"
                     facs="pageImages/152.jpg"/>—my father is too pious, too noble, interrupted <hi
                     rend="italic">Isabella,</hi> to command an impious deed.
                  But should he command it; can a father enjoin a cursed act? I was contracted to
                  the son? can I wed the father?—no, Madam, no; force should not drag me to <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred</hi>'s hated bed. I loath him, I
                  abhor him: Divine and human laws forbid—and my friend, my dearest <hi
                     rend="italic">
                     Matilda! </hi> would I wound her tender soul by injuring
                  her adored mother? my own mother—I never have known another—Oh! she is the mother
                  of both! cried <hi rend="italic">Matilda:</hi> Can we, can
                  we, <hi rend="italic">
                     Isabella, </hi> adore her too much? My lovely children,
                  said the touched <hi rend="italic">Hippolita,</hi> your
                  tenderness overpowers me—but I must not give way to it. It is not ours to make
                  election for ourselves: Heaven, our fathers, and our husbands must decide for us.
                  Have patience until you hear what <hi rend="italic"
                     >Manfred</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Frederic</hi> have
                  determined. If the Marquis accepts <hi rend="italic"
                     >Matilda</hi>'s hand, I know she will readily obey. Heaven
                  may interpose and prevent the rest. What means my child? continued <pb n="153"
                     facs="pageImages/153.jpg"/>she, seeing <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda</hi> fall at her feet with a flood of
                  speechless tears—but no; answer me not, my daughter: I must not hear a word
                  against the pleasure of thy father. Oh! doubt not my obedience, my dreadful
                  obedience to him and to you! said <hi rend="italic"
                     >Matilda.</hi> But can I, most respected of women, can I
                  experience all this tenderness, this world of goodness, and conceal a thought from
                  the best of mothers? What art thou going to utter? said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella</hi> trembling. Recollect thyself, <hi
                     rend="italic">Matilda.</hi> No, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella,</hi> said the Princess, I should not deserve
                  this incomparable parent, if the inmost recesses of my soul harboured a thought
                  without her permission— nay, I have offended her; I have suffered a passion to
                  enter my heart without her avowal— but here I disclaim it; here I vow to heaven
                  and her—My child! my child! said <hi rend="italic"
                     >Hippolita,</hi> what words are these! what new calamities
                  has fate in store for us! Thou, a passion! Thou, in this hour of destruction—Oh! I
                  see all my guilt! said <hi rend="italic">Matilda.</hi> I
                  abhor myself, if I cost <pb n="154" facs="pageImages/154.jpg"/>my mother a pang.
                  She is the dearest thing I have on earth—oh! I will never, never behold him more!
                     <hi rend="italic">Isabella,</hi> said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita,</hi> thou art conscious to this unhappy
                  secret, whatever it is. Speak—what! cried <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda,</hi> have I so forfeited my mother's love,
                  that she will not permit me even to speak my own guilt? oh! wretched, wretched <hi
                     rend="italic">Matilda!</hi> Thou art too cruel; said <hi
                     rend="italic">Isabella</hi> to <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita:</hi> Canst thou behold this anguish of a
                  virtuous mind, and not commiserate it? Not pity my child! said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita,</hi> catching <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda</hi> in her arms—Oh! I know she is good, she
                  is all virtue, all tenderness, and duty. I do forgive thee, my excellent, my only
                  hope! The Princesses then revealed to <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita</hi> their mutual inclination for <hi
                     rend="italic">Theodore,</hi> and the purpose of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella</hi> to resign him to <hi rend="italic">
                     Matilda. Hippolita
                  </hi> blamed their imprudence, and shewed them the improbability that either
                  father would consent to bestow his heiress on so poor a man, though nobly born.
                  Some comfort it gave her to find their passion of so recent a date, <pb n="155"
                     facs="pageImages/155.jpg"/> and that <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi> had had
                  but little cause to suspect it in either. She strictly enjoined them to avoid all
                  correspondence with him. This <hi rend="italic">
                     Matilda
                  </hi> servently promised: But <hi rend="italic"
                     >Isabella,</hi> who flattered
                  herself that she meant no more than to promote his union with her friend, could
                  not determine to avoid him; and made no reply. I will go to the convent, said <hi
                     rend="italic">Hippolita,</hi> and order new masses to be
                  said for a deliverance from these calamities.—Oh! my mother, said <hi
                     rend="italic">Matilda,</hi> you mean to quit us: You mean
                  to take sanctuary, and to give my father an opportunity of pursuing his fatal
                  intention. Alas! on my knees I supplicate you to forbear— will you leave me a prey
                  to <hi rend="italic">Frederic?</hi> I will follow you to the convent—Be at peace,
                  my child: said <hi rend="italic">Hippolita:</hi> I will
                  return instantly. I will never abandon thee, until I know it is the will of
                  heaven, and for thy benefit. Do not deceive me: said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda.</hi> I will not marry <hi rend="italic"
                     >Frederic</hi> until thou commandest it—Alas! What will become of me? Why that
                  exclamation? <pb n="156" facs="pageImages/156.jpg"/> said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita.</hi> I have promised thee to return —ah! my
                  mother, replied <hi rend="italic">Matilda,</hi> stay and save
                  me from myself. A frown from thee can do more than all my father's seve rity. I
                  have given away my heart, and you alone can make me recal it. No more: Said <hi
                     rend="italic">Hippolita:</hi> thou must not relapse, <hi
                     rend="italic">Metilda.</hi> I can quit <hi rend="italic">Theodore,</hi> said
                  she, but must I wed another? let me attend thee to the altar, and shut myself from
                  the world for ever. Thy fate depends on thy father; said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita:</hi> I have ill bestowed my tenderness, if
                  it has taught thee to revere aught beyond him. Adieu! my child: I go to pray for
                  thee. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hippolita</hi>'s real purpose was to demand
                  of <hi rend="italic"> Jerome, </hi> whether in conscience she might not consent
                  to the divorce. She had oft urged <hi rend="italic">
                     Manfred
                  </hi> to resign the principality, which the delicacy of her conscience rendered
                  an hourly burthen to her. These scruples concurred to make the separation from her
                  husband appear less <pb n="157" facs="pageImages/157.jpg"/> dreadful to her, than
                  it would have seemed in any other situation. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Jerome,</hi> at quitting the castle overnight, had questioned
                     <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi> severely why he had accused him to <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred</hi> of being privy to his escape.
                     <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi> owned it had been with design to prevent <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred</hi>'s suspicion from alighting on
                     <hi rend="italic">
                     Matilda
                  </hi> ; and added, the holiness of <hi rend="italic">Jerome</hi>'s life and
                  character secured him from the tyrant's wrath. <hi rend="italic">Jerome</hi> was
                  heartily grieved to discover his son's inclination for that Princess; and leaving
                  him to his rest; promised in the morning to acquaint him with important reasons
                  for con quering his passion. <hi rend="italic">Theodore,</hi> like <hi
                     rend="italic">Isabella,</hi> was too recently acquainted
                  with parental authority to submit to its decisions against the impulse of his
                  heart. He had little curiosity to learn the Friar's reasons, and less disposition
                  to obey them. The lovely <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi> had
                  made stronger impressions on him than filial affection. All night he pleased
                  himself with visions of love; and it was not till late after <ref>the morning-office</ref>,
                     <pb n="158" facs="pageImages/158.jpg"/> that he recollected the Friar's
                  commands to attend him at <hi rend="italic">Alfonso</hi>'s tomb. </p>
               <p> Young man, said <hi rend="italic">Jerome,</hi> when he saw him, this tardiness
                  does not please me. Have a father's commands already so little weight? <hi
                     rend="italic"> Theodore </hi> made awkward excuses, and attributed his delay to
                  having overslept himself. And on whom were thy dreams employed? said the Friar
                  sternly. His son blushed. Come, come, resumed the Friar, inconsiderate youth, this
                  must not be: Eradicate this guilty passion from thy breast—guilty passion! cried
                     <hi rend="italic">Theodore:</hi> Can guilt dwell with innocent beauty and
                  virtuous modesty? It is sinful, replied the Friar, to cherish those whom heaven
                  has doomed to destruction. A tyrant's race must be swept from the earth to the
                  third and fourth generation. Will heaven visit the innocent for the crimes of the
                  guilty? said <hi rend="italic">Theodore.</hi> The fair <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda</hi> has virtues enough—to undo thee:
                  Interrupted <hi rend="italic"> Jerome. </hi> Hast thou so soon forgotten that
                  twice the savage <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> has
                  pronounced thy sentence? <pb n="159" facs="pageImages/159.jpg"/> Nor have I forgotten, Sir, said <hi
                     rend="italic"> Theodore, </hi> that the charity of his daughter delivered me
                  from his power. I can forget injuries, but never benefits. The injuries thou hast
                  received from <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi>'s race, said the
                  Friar, are beyond what thou canst conceive.—Reply not, but view this holy image!
                  Beneath this marble monument rest the ashes of the good <hi rend="italic"
                     >Alfonso</hi> ; a Prince adorned with every virtue: The father of his people!
                  the delight of mankind! Kneel, head strong boy, and list, while a father unfolds a
                  state of horror, that will expel every sentiment from thy soul, but sensations of
                  sacred vengeance— <hi rend="italic">Alfonso!</hi> much-injured Prince! let thy
                  unsatisfied shade sit awful on the troubled air, while these trembling lips—ha!
                  who comes there?—The most wretched of women! said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita,</hi> entering the choir. Good Father, art
                  thou at leisure?—but why this kneeling youth? what means the horror imprinted on
                  each countenance? why at this venerable tomb —alas! hast thou seen aught? We were
                  pouring <pb n="160" facs="pageImages/160.jpg"/> forth our <ref>orisons</ref> to heaven,
                  replied the Friar with some confusion, to put an end to the woes of this
                  deplorable province. Join with us, Lady! thy spotless soul may obtain an exemption
                  from the judgments which the portents of these days but too speakingly denounce
                  against thy house. I pray servently to heaven to divert them: said the pious
                  Princess. Thou knowest it has been the occupation of my life to wrest a blessing
                  for my Lord and my harmless children— One alas! is taken from me! would heaven but
                  hear me for my poor <hi rend="italic">Matilda!</hi> Father!
                  intercede for her!—Every heart will bless her: Cried <hi rend="italic"
                     >Theodore</hi> with rapture—Be dumb, rash youth! said <hi rend="italic"
                     >Jerome.</hi> And thou fond Princess contend not with the Powers above! The
                  Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away: Bless his holy name, and submit to his
                  decrees. I do most devoutly: Said <hi rend="italic"
                     >Hippolita:</hi> But will he not spare my only comfort?
                  must <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi> perish too?— ah! Father,
                  I came—but dismiss thy son. No ear but thine must hear what I have to utter. <pb
                     n="161" facs="pageImages/161.jpg"/> May heaven grant thy every wish, most
                  excellent Princess! said <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi> retiring. <hi
                     rend="italic">Jerome</hi> frowned. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hippolita</hi> then acquainted the Friar
                  with the proposal she had suggested to <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred,</hi> his approbation of it, and the tender of
                     <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi> that he was gone to make to
                     <hi rend="italic">Frederic. Jerome</hi> could not conceal his dislike of the
                  motion, which he covered under pretence of the improbability that <hi
                     rend="italic">Frederic,</hi> the nearest of blood to <hi rend="italic"
                     >Alfonso,</hi> and who was come to claim his succession, would yield to an
                  alliance with the usurper of his right. But nothing could equal the perplexity of
                  the Friar, when <hi rend="italic">Hippolita</hi> confessed
                  her readiness not to oppose the separation, and demanded his opinion on the
                  legality of her acquiescence. The Friar catched eagerly at her request of his
                  advice, and without explaining his aversion to the proposed marriage of <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella,</hi> he painted to <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita</hi> in the most alarming colours the
                  sinfulness of her consent, denounced judgments against her if she complied, and
                  enjoined <pb n="162" facs="pageImages/162.jpg"/>her in the severest terms to treat
                  any such proposition with every mark of indignation and refusal. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> in the mean time, had broken
                  his purpose to <hi rend="italic">Frederic,</hi> and proposed the double marriage.
                  That weak Prince, who had been struck with the charms of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda,</hi> listened but too eagerly to the offer.
                  He forgot his enmity to <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> whom
                  he saw but little hope of dispossessing by force; and flattering himself that no
                  issue might succeed from the union of his daughter with the Tyrant, he looked upon
                  his own succession to the principality as facilitated by wedding <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda.</hi> He made faint opposition to the
                  proposal; affecting, for form only, not to acquiesce unless <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita</hi> should consent to the divorce. <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred</hi> took that upon himself.
                  Transported with his success, and impatient to see himself in a situation to
                  expect sons, he hastened to his wife's apartment, determined to extort her
                  compliance. He learned with indignation that she was absent at the convent. His
                     <pb n="163" facs="pageImages/163.jpg"/>guilt suggested to him that she had
                  probably been informed by <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> of
                  his purpose. He doubted whether her retirement to the con vent did not import an
                  intention of remaining there, until she could raise obstacles to their divorce;
                  and the suspicions he had already entertained of <hi rend="italic">Jerome,</hi>
                  made him apprehend that the Friar would not only traverse his views, but might
                  have inspired <hi rend="italic">Hippolita</hi> with the
                  resolution of taking sanctuary. Impatient to unravel this clue, and to defeat its
                  success, <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> hastened to the
                  convent, and arrived there, as the Friar was earnestly exhorting the Princess
                  never to yield to the divorce. </p>
               <p> Madam, said <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> what business
                  drew you hither? why did you not await my return from the Marquis? I came to
                  implore a blessing on your councils: Replied <hi
                     rend="italic">Hippolita.</hi> My councils do not need a
                  Friar's intervention: Said <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi>
                  —and of all men living is that hoary traitor the only one whom you delight to
                  confer with? Profane Prince! said <hi rend="italic">Jerome</hi> ; is <pb n="164"
                     facs="pageImages/164.jpg"/>it at the altar that thou chusest to insult the
                  servants of the altar?—but, <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi>
                  thy impious schemes are known. Heaven and this virtuous Lady know them—nay, frown
                  not, Prince. The church despises thy menaces. Her thunders will be heard above thy
                  wrath. Dare to proceed in thy curst purpose of a divorce, until her sentence be
                  known, and here I lance <ref>her Anathema</ref> at thy head. Audacious rebel! said <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> endeavouring to conceal the
                  awe with which the Friar's words inspired him; Dost thou presume to threaten the
                     lawful Prince? Thou art no lawful Prince; said <hi rend="italic"
                     >Jerome</hi> ; thou art no Prince—go, discuss thy claim with <hi rend="italic">
                     Frederic </hi> ; and when that is done—it is done: Replied <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred: Frederic</hi> accepts <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda</hi>'s hand, and is content to wave his claim,
                  unless I have no male issue—as he spoke those words, three drops of blood fell
                  from the nose of <hi rend="italic"> Alfonso </hi>'s statue. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> turned pale, and the Princess sunk on her
                  knees. Behold! said the Friar; mark this miraculous indication that the <pb
                     n="165" facs="pageImages/165.jpg"/>blood of <hi rend="italic">Alfonso</hi> will
                  never mix with that of <hi rend="italic">Manfred!</hi> My
                  gracious Lord, said <hi rend="italic">Hippolita,</hi> let us
                  submit ourselves to heaven. Think not thy ever obedient wife rebels against thy
                  authority. I have no will but that of my Lord and the church. To that reverend tribunal let us apply. It does not depend on us to burst the bonds that
                  unite us. If the church shall approve the dissolution of our marriage, be it so —I
                  have but few years, and those of sorrow to pass. Where can they be worn away so
                  well as at the foot of this altar, in prayers for thine and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda</hi>'s safety?—but thou shalt not remain here
                  until then: Said <hi rend="italic">Manfred.</hi> Repair with
                  me to the castle, and there I will advise on the proper measures for a
                  divorce;—but this meddling Friar comes not thither: My hospitable roof shall never
                  more harbour a traitor—and for thy Reverence's offspring, continued he, I banish
                  him from my dominions. He, I ween, is no sacred personage, nor under the
                  protection of the church. Whoever weds <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella,</hi> it shall <pb n="166"
                     facs="pageImages/166.jpg"/>not be Father <hi rend="italic">Falconara</hi>'s
                  started-up son. They start up, said the Friar, who are suddenly beheld in the seat
                  of lawful Princes; but they wither away like the grass, and their place knows them
                  no more. <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> casting a look of
                  scorn at the Friar, led <hi rend="italic">Hippolita</hi>
                  forth; but at the door of the church, whispered one of his attendants to remain
                  concealed about the convent, and bring him instant notice, if any one from the
                  castle should repair thither. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. V.</head>
               <p>EVERY reflection which <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> made
                  on the Friar's behaviour, conspired to persuade him that <hi rend="italic"
                     >Jerome</hi> was privy to an amour between <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Theodore.</hi> But
                     <hi rend="italic">Jerome</hi>'s new presumption, so dissonant from his former
                  meekness, suggested still deeper apprehensions. The Prince even suspected that the
                  Friar depended on some secret support from <hi rend="italic">Frederic,</hi> whose
                  arrival <pb n="167" facs="pageImages/167.jpg"/> coinciding with the novel
                  appearance of <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi> seemed to bespeak a correspondence.
                  Still more was he troubled with the resemblance of <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi>
                  to <hi rend="italic">Alfonso</hi>'s portrait. The latter he knew had
                  unquestionably died without issue. <hi rend="italic">Frederic</hi> had consented
                  to bestow <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> on him. These
                  contradictions agitated his mind with numberless pangs. He saw but two methods of
                  extricating himself from his difficulties. The one was to resign his dominions to
                  the Marquis —Pride, ambition, and his reliance on ancient prophecies, which had
                  pointed out a possibility of his preserving them to his posterity, combated that
                  thought. The other was to press his marriage with <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella.</hi> After long ruminating on these anxious
                  thoughts, as he marched silently with <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita</hi> to the castle, he at last discoursed
                  with that Princess on the subject of his disquiet, and used every insinuating and
                  plausible argument to extract her consent to, even her promise of promoting the
                  divorce. <hi rend="italic">Hippolita</hi> needed little
                  persuasion to bend her to <pb n="168" facs="pageImages/168.jpg"/> his pleasure.
                  She endeavoured to win him over to the measure of resigning his dominions; but
                  finding her exhortations fruitless, she assured him, that as far as her conscience
                  would allow, she would raise no opposition to a separation, though without better
                  founded scruples than what he yet alledged, she would not engage to be active in
                  demanding it. </p>
               <p> This compliance, though inadequate, was sufficient to raise <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi>'s hopes. He trusted that his power and
                  wealth would easily advance his suit at the court of <hi rend="italic"><placeName>Rome</placeName>,</hi>
                  whither he resolved to engage <hi rend="italic">Frederic</hi> to take a journey on
                  purpose. That Prince had discovered so much passion for <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda,</hi> that <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> hoped to obtain all he wished by holding
                  out or withdrawing his daughter's charms, according as the Marquis should appear
                  more or less disposed to co-operate in his views. Even the absence of <hi
                     rend="italic">Frederic</hi> would be a material point gained, until he could
                  take farther measures for his security. </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="pageImages/169.jpg"/>Dismissing <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita</hi> to her apartment, he repaired to that
                  of the Marquis; but crossing the great hall through which he was to pass, he met
                     <hi rend="italic">Bianca.</hi> That damsel he knew was in the confidence of
                  both the young Ladies. It immediately occurred to him to sift her on the subject
                  of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                     >Theodore.</hi> Calling her aside into the recess of <ref>the oriel window</ref> of the
                  hall, and soothing her with many fair words and promises, he demanded of her
                  whether she knew ought of the state of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella</hi>'s affections. I! my Lord! no, my
                  Lord—yes, my Lord— poor Lady! she is wonderfully alarmed about her father's
                  wounds; but I tell her he will do well, don't your Highness think so? I do not ask
                  you, replied <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> what she thinks
                  about her father: But you are in her secrets: Come, be a good girl and tell me; is
                  there any young man—ha!—you understand me—Lord bless me! understand your Highness,
                  no, not I: I told her a few vulnerary herbs and repose—I am not talking, replied
                  the Prince impatiently, <pb n="170" facs="pageImages/170.jpg"/> about her father:
                  I know he will do well— Bless me, I rejoice to hear your Highness say so; for
                  though I thought it not right to let my young Lady despond, methought his
                  Greatness had a wan look, and a something—I remember when young <hi rend="italic"
                     >Ferdinand</hi> was wounded by the <hi rend="italic"> Venetian </hi> —Thou
                  answerest from the point, interrupted <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> ; but here, take this jewel, perhaps that
                  may fix thy attention—nay, no reverences; my favour shall not stop here— come,
                  tell me truly; how stands <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> 's
                  heart. Well! your Highness has such a way! said <hi rend="italic">Bianca</hi> —to
                  be sure—but can your Highness keep a secret? if it should ever come out of your
                  lips—it shall not, it shall not: Cried <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> —nay, but swear, your Highness—by my
                  <ref>halidame</ref>, if it should ever be known that I said it—why, truth is truth, I do not
                  think my Lady <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> ever much
                  affectioned my young Lord your Son—yet he was a sweet youth as one should see—I am
                  sure, if I had been a Princess—but bless me! I must attend <pb n="171"
                     facs="pageImages/171.jpg"/>my Lady <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda</hi> ; she will marvel what is become of
                  me—stay; cried <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> thou hast not
                  satisfied my question. Hast thou ever carried any message, any letter—I! good
                  gracious! cried <hi rend="italic">Bianca</hi> ; I carry a letter? I would not to
                  be a Queen. I hope your Highness thinks, though I am poor, I am honest—did your
                  Highness never hear what Count <hi rend="italic">Marsigli</hi> offered me, when he
                  came a wooing to my Lady <hi rend="italic">Matilda?</hi> I
                  have not leisure, said <hi rend="italic">
                     Manfred, </hi> to listen to thy tales. I do not question
                  thy honesty: But it is thy duty to conceal nothing from me. How long has <hi
                     rend="italic">Isabella</hi> been acquainted with <hi
                     rend="italic">Theodore?</hi> Nay, there is nothing can escape your Highness!
                  said <hi rend="italic">Bianca</hi> — not that I know any thing of the matter— <hi
                     rend="italic"> Theodore, </hi> to be sure, is a proper young man, and, as my
                  Lady <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi> says, the very image of
                  good <hi rend="italic">Alfonso:</hi> Has not your Highness remarked it? yes,
                  yes,—no—thou torturest me: Said <hi rend="italic"
                     >Manfred:</hi> Where did they meet? when?— who! My Lady
                     <hi rend="italic">Matilda?</hi> said <hi rend="italic"
                     >Bianca.</hi> No, <pb n="172" facs="pageImages/172.jpg"/>no, not <hi
                     rend="italic">Matilda: Isabella</hi>
                  ; when did <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> first become
                  acquainted with this <hi rend="italic"> Theodore? Virgin Mary! </hi> said <hi
                     rend="italic">Bianca,</hi> how should I know? Thou dost know; said <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred</hi> ; and I must know; I will—Lord!
                  your Highness is not jealous of young <hi rend="italic">Theodore!</hi> said <hi
                     rend="italic">Bianca</hi> —jealous! no, no: Why should I be jealous?— perhaps I
                  mean to unite them—if I were sure <hi rend="italic"
                     >Isabella</hi> would have no repugnance—repugnance! no,
                  I'll warrant her; said <hi rend="italic">Bianca</hi> ; he is as comely a youth as
                  ever trod on Christian ground: We are all in love with him, there is not a soul in
                  the castle, but would be rejoiced to have him for our Prince—I mean, when it shall
                  please heaven to call your Highness to itself—indeed! said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> ; has it gone so far! oh! this cursed
                  Friar!—but I must not lose time—go, <hi rend="italic">Bianca,</hi> attend <hi
                     rend="italic">Isabella</hi> ; but I charge thee, not a
                  word of what has passed. Find out how she is affected towards <hi rend="italic"
                     >Theodore:</hi> bring me good news, and that ring has a companion. Wait at the
                  foot of the winding staircase: <pb n="173" facs="pageImages/173.jpg"/> I am going
                  to visit the Marquis, and will talk farther with thee at my return. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> after some general
                  conversation, desired <hi rend="italic">Frederic</hi> to dismiss the two Knights
                  his companions, having to talk with him on urgent affairs. As soon as they were
                  alone, he began in artful guise to sound the Marquis on the subject of <hi
                     rend="italic">Matilda</hi> ; and finding him disposed to
                  his wish, he let drop hints on the difficulties that would attend the celebration
                  of their marriage, unless—at that instant <hi rend="italic">Bianca</hi> burst into
                  the room with a wildness in her look and gestures that spoke the utmost terror.
                  Oh! my Lord, my Lord! cried she; we are all undone! it is come again! it is come
                  again! What is come again? cried <hi rend="italic"
                     >Manfred</hi> amazed—oh! the hand! the Giant! the
                  hand!—support me! I am terrified out of my senses: Cried <hi rend="italic"
                     >Bianca,</hi> I will not sleep in the castle to-night; where shall I go? my
                  things may come after me to-morrow —would I had been content to wed <hi
                     rend="italic"> Francisco! </hi> this comes of ambition! What has terrified <pb
                     n="174" facs="pageImages/174.jpg"/> thee thus, young woman? said the Marquis:
                  Thou art safe here; be not alarmed. Oh! your Greatness is wonderful good, said <hi
                     rend="italic">Bianca,</hi> but I dare not—no, pray, let me go— I had rather
                  leave every thing behind me, than stay another hour under this roof. Go to, thou
                  hast lost thy senses: Said <hi rend="italic">Manfred.</hi>
                  Interrupt us not; we were communing on important matters—my Lord, this wench is
                  subject to fits—come with me, <hi rend="italic">Bianca</hi> —oh! the Saints! no,
                  said <hi rend="italic">Bianca</hi> —for certain it comes to warn your Highness;
                  why should it appear to me else? I say my hours morning and evening— oh! if your
                  Highness had believed <hi rend="italic">Diego!</hi> 'Tis the same hand that he saw
                  the foot to in the gallery-chamber—Father <hi rend="italic">Jerome</hi> has often
                  told us the prophecy would be out one of these days — <hi rend="italic"
                     >Bianca,</hi> said he, mark my words—thou ravest; said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> in a rage; be gone, and keep these
                  fooleries to frighten thy companions —what! my Lord, cried <hi rend="italic"
                     >Bianca,</hi> do you think I have seen nothing? go to the foot of the <pb
                     n="175" facs="pageImages/175.jpg"/>great stairs yourself—as I live I saw it.
                  Saw what? tell us, fair maid, what thou hast seen: Said <hi rend="italic"
                     >Frederic.</hi> Can your Highness listen, said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred,</hi> to the delirium of a silly <ref>wench</ref>, who
                  has heard stories of apparitions until she believes them? This is more than fancy,
                  said the Marquis; her terror is too natural and too strongly impressed to be the
                  work of imagination. Tell us, fair maiden, what it is has moved thee thus. Yes, my
                  Lord, thank your Greatness; said <hi rend="italic">Bianca</hi> —I believe I look
                  very pale; I shall be better when I have recovered myself—I was going to my Lady
                     <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>'s chamber by his
                  Highness's order—we do want the circumstances; interrupted <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred:</hi> Since his Highness will have it so,
                  proceed; but be brief. Lord! your Highness thwarts one so! replied <hi
                     rend="italic">Bianca</hi> —I fear my hair—I am sure I never in my life—well! as
                  I was telling your Greatness, I was going by his Highness's order to my Lady <hi
                     rend="italic">Isabella</hi>'s chamber: She lies in the
                  watchet-coloured chamber, on the right-hand, one pair <pb n="176"
                     facs="pageImages/176.jpg"/> of stairs. So when I came to the great stairs— I
                  was looking on his Highness's present here —grant me patience! said <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> will this wench never come to
                  the point? what imports it to the Marquis, that I gave thee a bawble for thy
                  faithful attendance on my daughter? we want to know what thou sawest. I was going
                  to tell your Highness, said <hi rend="italic">Bianca</hi> ; if you would permit
                  me.—So as I was rubbing the ring—I am sure I had not gone up three steps, but I
                  heard the rattling of armour; for all the world such a clatter, as <hi
                     rend="italic">Diego</hi> says he heard when the Giant turned him about in the
                  gallery-chamber —what does she mean, my Lord! said the Marquis; is your castle
                  haunted by giants and goblins? Lord! what, has not your Greatness heard the story
                  of the Giant in the gallery-chamber? cried <hi rend="italic">Bianca.</hi> I marvel
                  his Highness has not told you—may hap you do not know there is a prophecy—This
                  trifling is intolerable; interrupted <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred.</hi> Let us dismiss this silly wench, my
                  Lord? we have more important <pb n="177" facs="pageImages/177.jpg"/>affairs to
                  discuss. By your favour, said <hi rend="italic">Frederic,</hi> these are no
                  trifles: The enormous sabre I was directed to in the wood, you casque, its fellow
                  —are these visions of this poor maiden's brain? —so <hi rend="italic">Jaquez</hi>
                  thinks, may it please your Greatness: Said <hi rend="italic">Bianca.</hi> He says
                  <ref>this moon will not be out without our seeing some strange revolution</ref>. For my part
                  I should not be surprized if it was to happen to-morrow; for, as I was saying,
                  when I heard the clattering of armour, I was all in a cold sweat—I looked up, and,
                  if your Greatness will believe me, I saw upon the uppermost banister of the great
                  stairs a hand in armour as big, as big—I thought I should have swooned—I never
                  stopped until I came hither —would I were well out of this castle! My Lady <hi
                     rend="italic">Matilda</hi> told me but yester-morning that
                  her Highness <hi rend="italic">Hippolita</hi> knows
                  something—Thou art an insolent! cried <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> —Lord Marquis, it much misgives me that
                  this scene is concerted to affront me. Are my own domestics suborned to spread
                  tales injurious to my honour? Pursue <pb n="178" facs="pageImages/178.jpg"/>your
                  claim by manly daring; or let us bury our feuds, as was proposed, by the
                  intermarriage of our children: But, trust me, it ill becomes a Prince of your
                  bearing to practice on mercenary wenches—I scorn your imputation; said <hi
                     rend="italic">Frederic:</hi> until this hour I never set eyes on this damsel: I
                  have given her no jewel!—my Lord, my Lord, your conscience, your guilt accuses
                  you, and would throw the suspicion on me— but keep your daughter, and think no
                  more of <hi rend="italic">Isabella:</hi> The judgments
                  already fallen on your house forbid my matching into it. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> alarmed at the resolute tone
                  in which <hi rend="italic">Frederic</hi> delivered these words, endeavoured to
                  pacify him. Dismissing <hi rend="italic">Bianca,</hi> he made such submissions to
                  the Marquis, and threw in such artful encomiums on <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda,</hi> that <hi rend="italic">Frederic</hi> was
                  once more staggered. However, as his passion was of so recent a date, it could not
                  at once surmount the scruples he had conceived. He had gathered enough from <hi
                     rend="italic">Bianca</hi>'s discourse to persuade him that heaven declared
                  itself against <pb n="179" facs="pageImages/179.jpg"/>
                  <hi rend="italic">Manfred.</hi> The proposed marriages too
                  removed his claim to a distance; and the principality of <hi rend="italic"
                     >Otranto</hi> was a stronger temptation, than the contingent reversion of it
                  with <hi rend="italic">Matilda.</hi> Still he would not
                  absolutely recede from his engagements; but purposing to gain time, he demanded of
                     <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> if it was true in fact
                  that <hi rend="italic">
                     Hippolita
                  </hi> consented to the divorce. The Prince, transported to find no other obstacle,
                  and depending on his influence over his wife, assured the Marquis it was so, and
                  that he might satisfy himself of the truth from her own mouth. </p>
               <p> As they were thus discoursing, word was brought that the banquet was prepared.
                     <hi rend="italic">
                     Manfred
                  </hi> conducted <hi rend="italic">Frederic</hi> to the great hall, where they were
                  received by <hi rend="italic">Hippolita</hi> and the young
                  Princesses. <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> placed the Marquis
                  next to <hi rend="italic">Matilda,</hi> and seated himself
                  between his wife and <hi rend="italic">Isabella.
                        Hippolita</hi> comported herself with an easy gravity;
                  but the young Ladies were silent and melancholy. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred,</hi> who was determined to pursue his point
                  with the Marquis in the <pb n="180" facs="pageImages/180.jpg"/>remainder of the
                  evening, pushed on the feast until it waxed late; affecting unrestrained gaiety,
                  and plying <hi rend="italic">Frederic</hi> with repeated goblets of wine. The
                  latter, more upon his guard than <hi rend="italic"
                     >Manfred</hi> wished, declined his frequent challenges, on
                  pretence of his late loss of blood; while the Prince, to raise his own disordered
                  spirits, and to counterfeit unconcern, indulged himself in plentiful draughts,
                  though not to the intoxication of his senses. </p>
               <p> The evening being far advanced, the banquet concluded. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> would have withdrawn with <hi
                     rend="italic">Frederic</hi> ; but the latter pleading weakness and want of
                  repose, retired to his chamber, galantly telling the Prince, that his daughter
                  should amuse his Highness until himself could attend him. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> accepted the party, and to the no small
                  grief of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> accompanied her to
                  her apartment. <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi> waited on her
                  mother to enjoy the freshness of the evening on the ramparts of the castle. </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="pageImages/181.jpg"/>Soon as the company were dispersed their
                  several ways, <hi rend="italic">Frederic,</hi> quitting his chamber, enquired if
                     <hi rend="italic">Hippolita</hi> was alone, and was told
                  by one of her attendants, who had not noticed her going forth, that at that hour
                  she gene rally withdrew to her oratory, where he probably would find her. The
                  Marquis during the repast had beheld <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda</hi> with increase of passion. He now wished
                  to find <hi rend="italic">Hippolita</hi> in the disposition
                  her Lord had promised. The portents that had alarmed him, were forgotten in his
                  desires. Stealing softly and unobserved to the apartment of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita,</hi> he entered it with a resolution to
                  encourage her acquiescence to the divorce, having perceived that <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> was resolved to make the possession of
                     <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> an unalterable condition,
                  before he would grant <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi> to his
                  wishes. </p>
               <p> The Marquis was not surprized at the silence that reigned in the Princess's
                  apartment. Concluding her, as he had been advertized, in her oratory, he passed
                  on. The door was ajar; <pb n="182" facs="pageImages/182.jpg"/>the evening gloomy
                  and overcast. Pushing open the door gently, he saw a person kneeling before the
                  altar. As he approached nearer, it seemed not a woman, but one in a long woollen
                  <ref>weed</ref>, whose back was towards him. The person seemed absorbed in prayer. The
                  Marquis was about to return, when the figure rising, stood some moments fixed in
                  meditation, without regarding him. The Marquis, expecting the holy person to come
                  forth, and meaning to excuse his uncivil interruption, said, reverend Father, I
                  sought the Lady <hi rend="italic">
                     Hippolita
                  </hi> — <hi rend="italic">Hippolita!</hi> replied a hollow
                  voice? camest thou to this castle to seek <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita?</hi> — and then the figure, turning slowly
                  round, discovered to <hi rend="italic">Frederic</hi> the fleshless jaws and empty
                  sockets of a skeleton, wrapt in a hermit's cowl. Angels of grace, protect me!
                  cried <hi rend="italic">Frederic</hi> recoiling. Deserve their protection! said
                  the Spectre. <hi rend="italic">Frederic</hi> falling on his knees, adjured the
                  Phantom to take pity on him. Dost thou not remember me? said the apparition.
                  Remember <pb n="183" facs="pageImages/183.jpg"/> the wood of <hi rend="italic"
                     ><placeName>Joppa</placeName>!</hi> Art thou that holy Hermit? cried <hi rend="italic">Frederic</hi>
                  trembling—can I do ought for thy eternal peace?—Wast thou delivered from bondage,
                  said the spectre, to pursue carnal delights? Hast thou forgotten the buried sabre,
                  and the behest of Heaven engraven on it?—I have not, I have not; said <hi
                     rend="italic">Frederic</hi> —but say, blest spirit, what is thy errand to me?
                  what remains to be done? To forget <hi rend="italic"
                     >Matilda!</hi> said the apparition—and vanished. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Frederic</hi>'s blood froze in his veins. For some minutes he
                  remained motionless. Then falling prostrate on his face before the altar, he
                  besought the intercession of every saint for pardon. A flood of tears succeeded to
                  this transport; and the image of the beauteous <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda</hi> rushing in spite of him on his thoughts,
                  he lay on the ground in a conflict of penitence and passion. E'er he could recover
                  from this agony of his spirits, the Princess <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita</hi> with a <ref>taper</ref> in her hand entered the
                  oratory alone. Seeing a <pb n="184" facs="pageImages/184.jpg"/>man without motion
                  on the floor, she gave a shriek, concluding him dead. Her fright brought <hi
                     rend="italic">Frederic</hi> to himself. Rising suddenly, his face bedewed with
                  tears, he would have rushed from her presence; but <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita</hi> stopping him, conjured him in the most
                  plaintive accents to explain the cause of his disorder, and by what strange chance
                  she had found him there in that posture. Ah! virtuous Princess! said the Marquis,
                  penetrated with grief—and stopped. For the love of Heaven, my Lord, said <hi
                     rend="italic">Hippolita,</hi> disclose the cause of this
                  transport! what mean these doleful sounds, this alarming exclamation on my name?
                  What woes has heaven still in store for the wretched <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita?</hi> —yet silent!—by every pitying angel, I
                  adjure thee, noble Prince, continued she falling at his feet, to disclose the
                  purport of what lies at thy heart— I see thou feelest for me; thou feelest the
                  sharp pangs that thou inflictest—speak for pity!— does ought thou knowest concern
                  my child?— <pb n="185" facs="pageImages/185.jpg"/>I cannot speak; cried <hi
                     rend="italic">Frederic,</hi> bursting from her—Oh! <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda!</hi>
               </p>
               <p> Quitting the Princess thus abruptly, he hastened to his own apartment. At the
                  door of it he was accosted by <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi>
                  who flushed by wine and love had come to seek him, and to propose to waste some
                  hours of the night in music and revelling. <hi rend="italic">Frederic,</hi>
                  offended at an invitation so dissonant from the mood of his soul, pushed him
                  rudely aside, and entering his chamber, flung the door intemperately against <hi
                     rend="italic"> Manfred, </hi> and bolted it inwards. The haughty Prince,
                  enraged at this unaccountable behaviour, withdrew in a frame of mind capable of
                  the most fatal excesses. As he crossed the court, he was met by the domestic whom
                  he had planted at the convent as a spy on <hi rend="italic">Jerome</hi> and <hi
                     rend="italic">Theodore.</hi> This man, almost breathless with the haste he had
                  made, informed his Lord, that <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi> and some lady from
                  the castle were at that instant in private conference at the tomb of <hi
                     rend="italic">Alfonso</hi> in St. <hi rend="italic">Nicholas</hi>'s church. He
                  had dogged <pb n="186" facs="pageImages/186.jpg"/>
                  <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi> thither, but the gloominess of the night had
                  prevented his discovering who the woman was. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> whose spirits were inflamed,
                  and whom <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> had driven from her
                  on his urging his passion with too little reserve, did not doubt but the
                  inquietude she had expressed, had been occasioned by her impatience to meet <hi
                     rend="italic"> Theodore. </hi> Provoked by this conjecture, and enraged at her
                  father, he hastened secretly to the great church. Gliding softly between the
                  isles, and guided by an imperfect gleam of moonshine that shone saintly through
                  the illuminated windows, he stole towards the tomb of <hi rend="italic"> Alfonso,
                  </hi> to which he was directed by indistinct whispers of the persons he sought.
                  The first sounds he could distinguish were—Does it alas! depend on me? <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred</hi> will never permit our union—No,
                  this shall prevent it! cried the tyrant, drawing his dagger, and plunging it over
                  her shoulder into the bosom of the person that spoke—ah! me, I am slain! <pb
                     n="187" facs="pageImages/187.jpg"/>cried <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda</hi> sinking; good heaven, receive my soul!
                  Savage, inhuman monster! what hast thou done! cried <hi rend="italic"
                     >Theodore,</hi> rushing on him, and wrenching his dagger from him—Stop, stop
                  thy impious hand! cried <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi> ; it
                  is my father! <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> waking as from
                  a trance, beat his breast, twisted his hands in his locks, and endeavoured to
                  recover his dagger from <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi> to dispatch himself. <hi
                     rend="italic">Theodore</hi> scarce less distracted, and only mastering the
                  transports of his grief to assist <hi rend="italic"
                     >Matilda,</hi> had now by his cries drawn some of the
                  monks to his aid. While part of them endeavoured in concert with the afflicted <hi
                     rend="italic"> Theodore </hi> to stop the blood of the dying Princess, the rest
                  prevented <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> from laying violent
                  hands on himself. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi> resigning herself patiently to
                  her fate, acknowledged with looks of grateful love the zeal of <hi rend="italic"
                     >Theodore.</hi> Yet oft as her faintness would permit her speech its way, she
                  begged the assistants to comfort her father. <hi rend="italic">Jerome</hi> by this
                  time had learnt the fatal news, and reached the <pb n="188"
                     facs="pageImages/188.jpg"/>church. His looks seemed to reproach <hi
                     rend="italic">Theodore:</hi> but turning to <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred,</hi> he said, now, tyrant! behold the
                  completion of woe fulfilled on thy impious and devoted head! The blood of <hi
                     rend="italic">Alfonso</hi> cried to heaven for vengeance; and heaven has
                  permitted its altar to be polluted by assassination, that thou mightest shed thy
                  own blood at the foot of that Prince's <ref>sepulchre</ref>!—Cruel man! cried <hi
                     rend="italic">Matilda,</hi> to aggravate the woes of a
                  parent! may heaven bless my father, and forgive him as I do! My Lord, my gracious
                  Sire, dost thou forgive thy child? indeed I came not hither to meet <hi
                     rend="italic">Theodore:</hi> I found him praying at this tomb, whither my
                  mother sent me to intercede for thee, for her—dearest father, bless your child,
                  and say you forgive her—forgive thee! murderous monster! cried <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manfred</hi> —can assassins forgive? I took thee for
                     <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> ; but heaven directed my
                  bloody hand to the heart of my child!—oh! <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda</hi> —I cannot utter it—canst thou forgive the
                  blindness of my rage! I can, I do! and may heaven confirm it! said <hi
                     rend="italic">Matilda</hi> —but <pb n="189"
                     facs="pageImages/189.jpg"/> while I have life to ask it—Oh! my mother! what
                  will she feel!—will you comfort her, my Lord? will you not put her away? indeed
                  she loves you—oh! I am faint! bear me to the castle—can I live to have her close
                  my eyes? </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi> and the monks besought her earnestly to suffer
                  herself to be born into the convent; but her instances were so pressing to be
                  carried to the castle; that placing her on a litter, they conveyed her thither as
                  she requested. <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi> supporting her head with his arm,
                  and hanging over her in an agony of despairing love, still endeavoured to inspire
                  her with hopes of life. <hi rend="italic"> Je rome </hi> on the other side
                  comforted her with discourses of heaven, and holding a crucifix before her, which
                  she bathed with innocent tears, prepared her for her passage to immortality. <hi
                     rend="italic">
                     Manfred
                  </hi> plunged in the deepest affliction, followed the litter in despair. </p>
               <p> E'er they reached the castle, <hi rend="italic"
                     >Hippolita,</hi> in formed of the dreadful catastrophe,
                  had flown to meet her murdered child: but when she saw <pb n="190"
                     facs="pageImages/190.jpg"/>the afflicted procession, the mightiness of her
                  grief deprived her of her senses, and she fell lifeless to the earth in a swoon.
                     <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> and <hi rend="italic">
                     Frederic, </hi> who attended her, were overwhelmed in almost equal sorrow. <hi
                     rend="italic">Matilda</hi> alone seemed in sensible to her
                  own situation: every thought was lost in tenderness for her mother. Ordering the
                  litter to stop, as soon as <hi rend="italic">Hippolita</hi>
                  was brought to herself, she asked for her father. He approached, unable to speak.
                     <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi> seizing his hand and her
                  mother's, locked them in her own, and then clasped them to her heart. <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred</hi> could not support this act of
                  <ref>pathetic</ref> piety. He dashed himself on the ground, and cursed the day he was born.
                     <hi rend="italic">Isabella,</hi> apprehensive that these
                  struggles of passion were more than <hi rend="italic"
                     >Matilda</hi> could support, took upon herself to order
                     <hi rend="italic">
                     Manfred
                  </hi> to be borne to his apartment, while she caused <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda</hi> to be conveyed to the nearest chamber.
                     <hi rend="italic">Hippolita,</hi> scarce more alive than
                  her daughter, was regardless of every thing but her: but when the tender <hi
                     rend="italic">Isabella</hi>'s care would have <pb n="191"
                     facs="pageImages/191.jpg"/> likewise removed her, while the surgeons examined
                     <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi>'s wound, she cried, remove
                  me! never! never! I lived but in her, and will expire with her. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda</hi> raised her eyes at her mother's voice,
                  but closed them again without speaking. Her sinking pulse and the damp cold ness
                  of her hand soon dispelled all hopes of recovery. <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi>
                  followed the surgeons into the outer chamber, and heard them pronounce the fatal
                  sentence with a transport equal to frenzy— Since she cannot live mine, cried he,
                  at least she shall be mine in death!—Father! <hi rend="italic">Jerome!</hi> will
                  you not join our hands? cried he to the Friar, who with the Marquis had
                  accompanied the surgeons. What means thy distracted rashness? said <hi
                     rend="italic">Jerome</hi> ; is this an hour for marriage! It is, it is, cried
                     <hi rend="italic">Theodore,</hi> alas! there is no other! Young man, thou art
                  too unadvised: said <hi rend="italic"> Frederic: </hi> dost thou think we are to
                  listen to thy fond transports in this hour of fate? what pretensions hast thou to
                  the Princess? Those of a Prince; said <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi> ; of the
                  sovereign of <hi rend="italic">Otranto.</hi>
                  <pb n="192" facs="pageImages/192.jpg"/>This reverend man, my father, has informed
                  me who I am. Thou ravest: said the Marquis: there is no prince of <hi

                        >Manfred</hi> by murder, by sacrilegious murder, has
                  forfeited all pretensions. My Lord, said <hi rend="italic">Jerome,</hi> assuming
                  an air of command, he tells you true. It was not my purpose the secret should have
                  been divulged so soon; but fate presses onward to its work. What his hot headed
                  passion has revealed, my tongue confirms. Know, Prince, that when <hi
                     rend="italic">Alfonso</hi> set sail for <placeName>the Holy Land</placeName>— is this a season for
                  explanations? cried <hi rend="italic">Theodore.</hi> Father, come and unite me to
                  the Princess; she shall be mine—in every other thing I will dutifully obey you. My

                     rend="italic">Theodore,</hi> rushing back into the inner chamber, will you not

                     >Isabella</hi> made signs to him to be silent,
                  apprehending the Princess was near her end. What is she dead? cried <hi
                     rend="italic">Theodore</hi> ; is it possible? The violence of his exclamations
                  brought <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi> to herself. Lifting up
                  her eyes, <pb n="193" facs="pageImages/193.jpg"/> she looked round for her
                  mother—Life of my soul! I am here: cried <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita</hi> ; think not I will quit thee! Oh! you
                  are too good; said <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi> —but weep
                  not for me, my mother! I am going where sorrow never dwells— <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella,</hi> thou hast loved me; wot thou not supply
                  my fondness to this dear, dear woman?—indeed I am faint! Oh! my child! my child!
                  said <hi rend="italic">
                     Hippolita
                  </hi> in a flood of tears, can I not withhold thee a moment!—It will not be; said
                     <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi> —commend me to heaven—where
                  is my father? forgive him, dearest mother—forgive him my death; it was an
                  error—Oh! I had forgotten— dearest mother, I vowed never to see <hi rend="italic"
                     >Theodore</hi> more—perhaps that has drawn down this calamity— but it was not
                  intentional—can you pardon me?—Oh! wound not my agonizing soul! said <hi
                     rend="italic">Hippolita</hi> ; thou never couldst offend
                  me—alas I she faints! help! help!—I would say something more, said <hi
                     rend="italic">Matilda</hi> struggling, but it wonnot be—
                     <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> — <hi rend="italic"
                     >Theodore</hi> —for my sake—Oh!—she expired. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella</hi> and her women <pb n="194"
                     facs="pageImages/194.jpg"/> tore <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita</hi> from the corse; but <hi rend="italic"
                     >Theodore</hi> threatened destruction to all who attempted to remove him from
                  it. He printed a thousand kisses on her clay-cold hands, and uttered every
                  expression that despairing love could dictate. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Isabella,</hi> in the mean time, was
                  accompanying the afflicted <hi rend="italic">Hippolita</hi>
                  to her apartment; but, in the middle of the court, they were met by <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> who, distracted with his own
                  thoughts, and anxious once more to behold his daughter, was advancing to the
                  chamber where she lay. As the moon was now at its height, he read in the
                  countenances of this unhappy company the event he dreaded. What! is she dead!
                  cried he in wild confusion—a clap of thunder at that instant shook the castle to
                  its foundations; the earth rocked, and the clank of more than mortal armour was
                  heard behind. <hi rend="italic">Frederic</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Jerome</hi>
                  thought the last day was at hand. The latter, forcing <hi rend="italic"
                     >Theodore</hi> along with them, rushed into the court. The moment <hi
                     rend="italic">Theodore</hi> appeared, the walls of the castle behind <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred</hi> were <pb n="195"
                     facs="pageImages/195.jpg"/>thrown down with a mighty force, and the form of <hi
                     rend="italic">Alfonso,</hi> dilated to an immense magnitude, appeared in the center of the ruins. Behold in <hi rend="italic"
                     >Theodore</hi> the true heir of <hi rend="italic">Alfonso!</hi> said the
                  vision: And having pronounced those words, accompanied by a clap of thunder, it
                  ascended solemnly towards heaven, where the clouds parting asunder, the form of
                  St. <hi rend="italic">Nicholas</hi> was seen, and receiving <hi rend="italic"
                     >Alfonso</hi>'s shade, they were soon wrapt from mortal eyes in a blaze of
                  glory. </p>
               <p> The beholders fell prostrate on their faces, acknowledging the divine will. The
                  first that broke silence was <hi rend="italic"
                     >Hippolita.</hi> My Lord, said she to the desponding <hi
                     rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> behold the vanity of human
                  greatness! <hi rend="italic">Conrad</hi> is gone! <hi
                     rend="italic">Matilda</hi> is no more! in <hi
                     rend="italic">Theodore</hi> we view the true Prince of <hi rend="italic"
                     >Otranto.</hi> By what miracle he is so, I know not—suffice it to us, our doom
                  is pronounced! shall we not, can we but dedicate the few deplorable hours we have
                  to live, in deprecating the farther wrath of heaven? heaven ejects us —whither can
                  we fly, but to yon holy cells <pb n="196" facs="pageImages/196.jpg"/>that yet
                  offer us a retreat?—Thou guiltless but unhappy woman! unhappy by my crimes!
                  replied <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> my heart at last is
                  open to thy devout admonitions. Oh! could—but it cannot be—ye are lost in
                  wonder—let me at last do justice on myself! To heap shame on my own head is all
                  the satisfaction I have left to offer to offended heaven. My story has drawn down
                  these judgments: Let my confession atone —but ah! what can atone for usurpation
                  and a murdered child! a child murdered in a consecrated place!—List, Sirs, and may
                  this bloody record be a warning to future tyrants! </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Alfonso,</hi> ye all know, died in the holy land —ye would
                  interrupt me; ye would say he came not fairly to his end—it is most true— why else
                  this bitter cup which <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> must
                  drink to the dregs? <hi rend="italic">Ricardo,</hi> my grandfather, was his
                  chamberlain—I would draw a veil over my ancestor's crimes—but it is in vain! <hi
                     rend="italic">Alfonso</hi> died by poison. A fictitious will declared <hi
                     rend="italic"> Ricardo </hi> his heir. His crimes pursued him—yet he <pb
                     n="197" facs="pageImages/197.jpg"/>lost no <hi rend="italic"
                        >Conrad,</hi> no <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda!</hi> I pay the price of usurpation for all! A
                  storm overtook him. Haunted by his guilt, he vowed to St. <hi rend="italic"
                     >Nicholas</hi> to found a church and two convents, if he lived to reach <hi
                     rend="italic">Otranto.</hi> The sacrifice was accepted: the saint appeared to
                  him in a dream, and promised that <hi rend="italic">Ricardo</hi>'s posterity
                  should reign in <hi rend="italic">Otranto,</hi> until the rightful owner should be
                  grown too large to inhabit the castle, and as long as issue-male from <hi
                     rend="italic">Ricardo</hi>'s loins should remain to enjoy it—Alas! alas! nor
                  male nor female, except myself, remains of all his wretched race!—I have done—the
                  woes of these three days speak the rest. How this young man can be <hi
                     rend="italic">Alfonso</hi>'s heir, I know not—yet I do not doubt it. His are
                  these dominions; I resign them—yet I knew not <hi rend="italic">Alfonso</hi> had
                  an heir—I question not the will of heaven—poverty and prayer must fill up the
                  woeful space, until <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> shall be
                  summoned to <hi rend="italic">Ricardo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p> What remains, is my part to declare, said <hi rend="italic">Jerome.</hi> When <hi
                     rend="italic">Alfonso</hi> set sail for the holy land, <pb n="198"
                     facs="pageImages/198.jpg"/>he was driven by a storm to the coast of <hi
                     rend="italic"><placeName>Sicily</placeName>.</hi> The other vessel, which bore <hi rend="italic"
                     >Ricardo</hi> and his train, as your <hi rend="italic">Lordship</hi> must have
                  heard, was separated from him. It is most true, said <hi rend="italic">
                     Manfred
                  </hi> ; and the title you give me is more than an outcast can claim—well! be it
                  so—proceed. <hi rend="italic">Jerome</hi> blushed, and continued. For three months
                  Lord <hi rend="italic">Alfonso</hi> was wind bound in <hi rend="italic"
                     ><placeName>Sicily</placeName>.</hi> There he became enamoured of a fair virgin named <hi
                     rend="italic">Victoria.</hi> He was too pious to tempt her to forbidden
                  pleasures. They were married. Yet deeming this amour incongruous with the holy vow
                  of arms by which he was bound, he determined to conceal their nuptials, until his
                  return from the Crusado, when he purposed to seek and acknowledge her for his
                  lawful wife. He left her pregnant. During his absence she was delivered of a
                  daughter: But scarce had she felt a mother's pangs, ere she heard the fatal rumour
                  of her Lord's death, and the succession of <hi rend="italic">Ricardo.</hi> What
                  could a friendless, helpless woman do? would her testimony avail?—yet, <pb n="199"
                     facs="pageImages/199.jpg"/>my Lord, I have <ref>an authentic writing</ref>—It needs not;
                  said <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> ; the horrors of these
                  days, the vision we have but now seen, all corroborate thy evidence beyond a
                  thousand parchments. <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi> 's death
                  and my expulsion— Be composed, my Lord, said <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita</hi> ; this holy man did not mean to recal
                  your griefs, <hi rend="italic">Jerome</hi> proceeded. </p>
               <p> I shall not dwell on what is needless. The daughter of which <hi rend="italic"
                     >Victoria</hi> was delivered, was at her maturity bestowed in marriage on me.
                     <hi rend="italic">Victoria</hi> died; and the secret remained locked in my
                  breast. <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi>'s narrative has told the rest. </p>
               <p> The Friar ceased. The disconsolate company retired to the remaining part of the
                  castle. In the morning <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> signed
                  his abdication of the principality, with the approbation of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippolita,</hi> and each took on them the habit of
                  religion in the neighbouring convents. <hi rend="italic">Frederic</hi> offered his
                  daughter to the new Prince, which <hi rend="italic"
                     >Hippolita</hi>'s tenderness for <hi rend="italic"
                        >Isabella</hi> concurred to <pb n="200"
                     facs="pageImages/200.jpg"/> promote: But <hi rend="italic">Theodore</hi>'s
                  grief was too fresh to admit the thought of another love; and it was not until
                  after frequent discourses with <hi rend="italic"
                     >Isabella</hi> of his dear <hi rend="italic"
                        >Matilda,</hi> that he was persuaded he could know no
                  happiness but in the society of one with whom he could for ever indulge the
                  melancholy that had taken possession of his soul. </p>
