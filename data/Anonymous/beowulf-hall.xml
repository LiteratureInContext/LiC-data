<head type="sub">THE STORY.</head>
<p>
Hrothgar, king of the Danes, or Scyldings, builds a great mead-hall, or
palace, in which he hopes to feast his liegemen and to give them presents. The
joy of king and retainers is, however, of short duration. Grendel, the monster,
is seized with hateful jealousy. He cannot brook the sounds of joyance that
reach him down in his fen-dwelling near the hall. Oft and anon he goes to
the joyous building, bent on direful mischief. Thane after thane is ruthlessly
carried off and devoured, while no one is found strong enough and bold enough
to cope with the monster. For twelve years he persecutes Hrothgar and his
vassals.
</p>
<p>
Over sea, a day’s voyage off, Beowulf, of the Geats, nephew of Higelac,
king of the Geats, hears of Grendel’s doings and of Hrothgar’s misery. He
resolves to crush the fell monster and relieve the aged king. With fourteen
chosen companions, he sets sail for Dane-land. Reaching that country, he soon
persuades Hrothgar of his ability to help him. The hours that elapse before
night are spent in beer-drinking and conversation. When Hrothgar’s bedtime
comes he leaves the hall in charge of Beowulf, telling him that never before has
he given to another the absolute wardship of his palace. All retire to rest,
Beowulf, as it were, sleeping upon his arms.
</p>
<p>
Grendel comes, the great march-stepper, bearing God’s anger. He seizes
and kills one of the sleeping warriors. Then he advances towards Beowulf.
A fierce and desperate hand-to-hand struggle ensues. No arms are used, both
combatants trusting to strength and hand-grip. Beowulf tears Grendel’s
shoulder from its socket, and the monster retreats to his den, howling and
yelling with agony and fury. The wound is fatal.
</p>
<p>
The next morning, at early dawn, warriors in numbers flock to the hall
Heorot, to hear the news. Joy is boundless. Glee runs high. Hrothgar and
his retainers are lavish of gratitude and of gifts.
</p>
<p>
Grendel’s mother, however, comes the next night to avenge his death. She
is furious and raging. While Beowulf is sleeping in a room somewhat apart



<pb n="page_x"/>


from the quarters of the other warriors, she seizes one of Hrothgar’s favorite
counsellors, and carries him off and devours him. Beowulf is called. Determined
to leave Heorot entirely purified, he arms himself, and goes down to look
for the female monster. After traveling through the waters many hours, he
meets her near the sea-bottom. She drags him to her den. There he sees
Grendel lying dead. After a desperate and almost fatal struggle with the
woman, he slays her, and swims upward in triumph, taking with him Grendel’s
head.
</p>
<p>
Joy is renewed at Heorot. Congratulations crowd upon the victor.
Hrothgar literally pours treasures into the lap of Beowulf; and it is agreed
among the vassals of the king that Beowulf will be their next liegelord.
</p>
<p>
Beowulf leaves Dane-land. Hrothgar weeps and laments at his departure.
</p>
<p>
When the hero arrives in his own land, Higelac treats him as a distinguished
guest. He is the hero of the hour.
</p>
<p>
Beowulf subsequently becomes king of his own people, the Geats. After he
has been ruling for fifty years, his own neighborhood is wofully harried by a
fire-spewing dragon. Beowulf determines to kill him. In the ensuing struggle
both Beowulf and the dragon are slain. The grief of the Geats is inexpressible.
They determine, however, to leave nothing undone to honor the memory
of their lord. A great funeral-pyre is built, and his body is burnt. Then a
memorial-barrow is made, visible from a great distance, that sailors afar may
be constantly reminded of the prowess of the national hero of Geatland.
</p>
<p>
The poem closes with a glowing tribute to his bravery, his gentleness, his
goodness of heart, and his generosity.

from the fens.</note>
<l n="1">’Neath the cloudy cliffs came from the moor then</l>

<l n="15">Open the entrance. Early thereafter</l>
<l n="16">The foeman trod the shining hall-pavement,</l>
<note type="sidenote">He strides furiously
into the hall.</note>
<l n="17">Strode he angrily; from the eyes of him glimmered</l>
<l n="18">A lustre unlovely likest to fire.</l>
<l n="19">He beheld in the hall the heroes in numbers,</l>

<l n="20">A circle of kinsmen sleeping together,</l>
<note type="sidenote">He exults over his

<l n="21">A throng of thanemen: then his thoughts were exultant,</l>

<l n="24">Ere morning came, since fate had allowed him</l>
<note type="sidenote">Fate has decreed

Beowulf suffers
from suspense.</note>

<l n="25">The prospect of plenty. Providence willed not</l>
<l n="26">To permit him any more of men under heaven</l>
<l n="27">To eat in the night-time. Higelac’s kinsman</l>
<l n="28">Great sorrow endured how the dire-mooded creature</l>

<l n="29">In unlooked-for assaults were likely to bear him.</l>

<l n="30">No thought had the monster of deferring the matter,</l>

<note type="sidenote">Beowulf and Grendel

<l n="39">Caught he quickly the cunning deviser,</l>

<l n="40">On his elbow he rested. This early discovered</l>
<l n="41">The master of malice, that in middle-earth’s regions,</l>
<l n="42">’Neath the whole of the heavens, no hand-grapple greater</l>
<note type="sidenote">The monster is

<l n="43">In any man else had he ever encountered:</l>

<l n="45">Not off could betake him; death he was pondering,</l>
<note type="sidenote">He is anxious to
flee.</note>
<l n="46">Would fly to his covert, seek the devils’ assembly:</l>
<l n="47">His calling no more was the same he had followed</l>

boast of the evening,
and determines
to fulfil it.</note>
<l n="49">Of Higelac minded his speech of the evening,</l>

<l n="50">Stood he up straight and stoutly did seize him.</l>
<l n="51">His fingers crackled; the giant was outward,</l>
<l n="52">The earl stepped farther. The famous one minded</l>
<l n="53">To flee away farther, if he found an occasion,</l>
<l n="54">And off and away, avoiding delay,</l>

<l n="55">To fly to the fen-moors; he fully was ware of</l>
<l n="56">The strength of his grapple in the grip of the foeman.</l>
<note type="sidenote">’Twas a luckless
day for Grendel.</note>
<l n="57">’Twas an ill-taken journey that the injury-bringing,</l>

<l n="59">The palace re-echoed; to all of the Danemen,</l>

<l n="60">Dwellers in castles, to each of the bold ones,</l>
<l n="61">Earlmen, was terror. Angry they both were,</l>
<l n="62">Archwarders raging. Rattled the building;</l>
<pb n="28"/>
<l n="63">’Twas a marvellous wonder that the wine-hall withstood then</l>
<l n="64">The bold-in-battle, bent not to earthward,</l>

<l n="65">Excellent earth-hall; but within and without it</l>
<l n="66">Was fastened so firmly in fetters of iron,</l>
<l n="67">By the art of the armorer. Off from the sill there</l>
<l n="68">Bent mead-benches many, as men have informed me,</l>
<l n="69">Adorned with gold-work, where the grim ones did struggle.</l>

<l n="70">The Scylding wise men weened ne’er before</l>

<l n="72">Might break it in pieces, bone-decked, resplendent,</l>

<note type="sidenote">Grendel’s cries terrify
the Danes.</note>

<l n="14">The brand was brilliant, brightly it glimmered,</l>

<l n="16">The torch of the firmament. He glanced ’long the building,</l>

<l n="18">Raging and wrathful raised his battle-sword</l>
<l n="19">Strong by the handle. The edge was not useless</l>

<l n="20">To the hero-in-battle, but he speedily wished to</l>
<l n="21">Give Grendel requital for the many assaults he</l>
<l n="22">Had worked on the West-Danes not once, but often,</l>
<l n="23">When he slew in slumber the subjects of Hrothgar,</l>
<l n="24">Swallowed down fifteen sleeping retainers</l>

<l n="25">Of the folk of the Danemen, and fully as many</l>
<l n="26">Carried away, a horrible prey.</l>
<l n="27">He gave him requital, grim-raging champion,</l>
<note type="sidenote">Beowulf sees the
body of Grendel,
and cuts off his
head.</note>
<l n="28">When he saw on his rest-place weary of conflict</l>
<l n="29">Grendel lying, of life-joys bereavèd,</l>

<l n="30">As the battle at Heorot erstwhile had scathed him;</l>
<l n="31">His body far bounded, a blow when he suffered,</l>
<l n="32">Death having seized him, sword-smiting heavy,</l>

<l n="34">The clever carles who as comrades of Hrothgar</l>

<l n="35">Gazed on the sea-deeps, that the surging wave-currents</l>

<l n="44">Homeward betook him. The strangers sat down then</l>

<l n="45">Soul-sick, sorrowful, the sea-waves regarding:</l>

melts.</note>

<l n="69">That to see him safe and sound was granted them.</l>

<l n="70">From the high-minded hero, then, helmet and burnie</l>
<l n="71">Were speedily loosened: the ocean was putrid,</l>

<l n="10">Though that weapon was worthy, but the Wielder of earth-folk</l>
<note type="sidenote">God was fighting
with me.</note><l n="11">Gave me willingly to see on the wall a</l>

<l n="18">Seizing the hilt, from my foes I offbore it;</l>

<l n="68">The friend of the Scyldings, with gold that was plated,</l>
<l n="69">With ornaments many, much requited me,</l>

<l n="70">When daylight had dawned, and down to the banquet</l>
<l n="71">We had sat us together. There was chanting and joyance:</l>

<l n="73">And of old-times related; oft light-ringing harp-strings,</l>
<l n="74">Joy-telling wood, were touched by the brave one;</l>

<l n="75">Now he uttered measures, mourning and truthful,</l>
<l n="76">Then the large-hearted land-king a legend of wonder</l>

<note type="sidenote">The old king is

<l n="12">As in days of yore some one of men of</l>

<l n="20">Of long-lasting treasure. A barrow all-ready</l>
<l n="21">Stood on the plain the stream-currents nigh to,</l>

<l n="23">The keeper of rings carried within a</l>
<l n="24">Ponderous deal of the treasure of nobles,</l>

<l n="25">Of gold that was beaten, briefly he spake then:</l>
<note type="sidenote">The ring-giver bewails
the loss of
retainers.</note>
<l n="26">“Hold thou, O Earth, now heroes no more may,</l>
<l n="27">The earnings of earlmen. Lo! erst in thy bosom</l>
<l n="28">Worthy men won them; war-death hath ravished,</l>
<l n="29">Perilous life-bale, all my warriors,</l>

<l n="34">The hardy helmet behung with gilding</l>

<l n="35">Shall be reaved of its riches: the ring-cleansers slumber</l>

<pb n="77"/>
<l n="38">O’er breaking of war-shields the bite of the edges</l>
<l n="39">Moulds with the hero. The ring-twisted armor,</l>

<l n="40">Its lord being lifeless, no longer may journey</l>
<l n="41">Hanging by heroes; harp-joy is vanished,</l>
<l n="42">The rapture of glee-wood, no excellent falcon</l>
<l n="43">Swoops through the building, no swift-footed charger</l>
<l n="44">Grindeth the gravel. A grievous destruction</l>

<l n="45">No few of the world-folk widely hath scattered!”</l>
<l n="46">So, woful of spirit one after all</l>
<l n="47">Lamented mournfully, moaning in sadness</l>
<l n="48">By day and by night, till death with its billows</l>
<note type="sidenote">The fire-dragon</note>
<l n="49">Dashed on his spirit. Then the ancient dusk-scather</l>

<l n="50">Found the great treasure standing all open,</l>
<l n="51">He who flaming and fiery flies to the barrows,</l>
<l n="52">Naked war-dragon, nightly escapeth</l>
<l n="53">Encompassed with fire; men under heaven</l>
<l n="54">Widely beheld him. ’Tis said that he looks for</l>

<l n="55">The hoard in the earth, where old he is guarding</l>
<l n="56">The heathenish treasure; he’ll be nowise the better.</l>
<note type="sidenote">The dragon meets
his match.</note>
<l n="57">So three-hundred winters the waster of peoples</l>
<l n="58">Held upon earth that excellent hoard-hall,</l>
<l n="59">Till the forementioned earlman angered him bitterly:</l>

<l n="60">The beat-plated beaker he bare to his chieftain</l>
<l n="61">And fullest remission for all his remissness</l>
<l n="62">Begged of his liegelord. Then the hoard was discovered,</l>
<l n="63">The treasure was taken, his petition was granted</l>
<note type="sidenote">The hero plunders
the dragon’s den</note>
<l n="64">The lorn-mooded liegeman. His lord regarded</l>

<l n="65">The old-work of earth-folk—’twas the earliest occasion.</l>
<l n="66">When the dragon awoke, the strife was renewed there;</l>
<l n="67">He snuffed ’long the stone then, stout-hearted found he</l>
<pb n="78"/>
<l n="68">The footprint of foeman; too far had he gone</l>
<l n="69">With cunning craftiness close to the head of</l>

<l n="70">The fire-spewing dragon. So undoomed he may ’scape from</l>
<l n="71">Anguish and exile with ease who possesseth</l>
<l n="72">The favor of Heaven. The hoard-warden eagerly</l>
<l n="73">Searched o’er the ground then, would meet with the person</l>
<l n="74">That caused him sorrow while in slumber reclining:</l>

<l n="75">Gleaming and wild he oft went round the cavern,</l>
<l n="76">All of it outward; not any of earthmen</l>
<l n="77">Was seen in that desert. Yet he joyed in the battle,</l>
<l n="78">Rejoiced in the conflict: oft he turned to the barrow,</l>
<l n="79">Sought for the gem-cup; this he soon perceived then</l>
<note type="sidenote">The dragon perceives
that some
one has disturbed
his treasure.</note>

<l n="80">That some man or other had discovered the gold,</l>
<l n="81">The famous folk-treasure. Not fain did the hoard-ward</l>
<l n="82">Wait until evening; then the ward of the barrow</l>
<l n="83">Was angry in spirit, the loathèd one wished to</l>
<l n="84">Pay for the dear-valued drink-cup with fire.</l>

<l n="85">Then the day was done as the dragon would have it,</l>
<l n="86">He no longer would wait on the wall, but departed</l>
<note type="sidenote">The dragon is infuriated.</note>
<l n="87">Fire-impelled, flaming. Fearful the start was</l>

<l n="12">In the wall and his war-might: the weening deceived him.</l>
<note type="sidenote">Beowulf hears of
the havoc wrought
by the dragon.</note>

<l n="14">Early forsooth, that his own native homestead,</l>

him for some
crime.</note>
<l n="18">The wise one weened then that wielding his kingdom</l>
<l n="19">’Gainst the ancient commandments, he had bitterly angered</l>

<l n="20">The Lord everlasting: with lorn meditations</l>
<l n="21">His bosom welled inward, as was nowise his custom.</l>
<l n="22">The fire-spewing dragon fully had wasted</l>
<l n="23">The fastness of warriors, the water-land outward,</l>

useless.</note>
<l n="28">Wholly of iron: fully he knew then</l>
<l n="29">That wood from the forest was helpless to aid him,</l>

<l n="30">Shield against fire. The long-worthy ruler</l>
<l n="31">Must live the last of his limited earth-days,</l>

<l n="33">Though he long had been holding hoard-wealth in plenty.</l>

<l n="65">And that one carry on journey to death-pyre</l>
<l n="66">Who ring-presents gave us. Not aught of it all</l>
<l n="67">Shall melt with the brave one—there’s a mass of bright jewels,</l>
<l n="68">Gold beyond measure, grewsomely purchased</l>
<l n="69">And ending it all ornament-rings too</l>

<l n="70">Bought with his life; these fire shall devour,</l>
<l n="71">Flame shall cover, no earlman shall wear</l>
<l n="72">A jewel-memento, nor beautiful virgin</l>
<l n="73">Have on her neck rings to adorn her,</l>
<l n="74">But wretched in spirit bereavèd of gold-gems</l>

<l n="75">She shall oft with others be exiled and banished,</l>
<l n="76">Since the leader of liegemen hath laughter forsaken,</l>
<pb n="102"/>
<l n="77">Mirth and merriment. Hence many a war-spear</l>
<l n="78">Cold from the morning shall be clutched in the fingers,</l>
<l n="79">Heaved in the hand, no harp-music’s sound shall</l>

<l n="80">Waken the warriors, but the wan-coated raven</l>
<l n="81">Fain over fey ones freely shall gabble,</l>
<l n="82">Shall say to the eagle how he sped in the eating,</l>
<l n="83">When, the wolf his companion, he plundered the slain.”</l>
<l n="84">So the high-minded hero was rehearsing these stories</l>

<l n="85">Loathsome to hear; he lied as to few of</l>
<note type="sidenote">The warriors go
sadly to look at
Beowulf’s lifeless
body.</note>
<l n="86">Weirds and of words. All the war-troop arose then,</l>
<l n="87">’Neath the Eagle’s Cape sadly betook them,</l>
<l n="88">Weeping and woful, the wonder to look at.</l>
<l n="89">They saw on the sand then soulless a-lying,</l>

<l n="90">His slaughter-bed holding, him who rings had given them</l>
<l n="91">In days that were done; then the death-bringing moment</l>
<l n="92">Was come to the good one, that the king very warlike,</l>
<l n="93">Wielder of Weders, with wonder-death perished.</l>
<l n="94">First they beheld there a creature more wondrous,</l>
<note type="sidenote">They also see the
dragon.</note>

<l n="95">The worm on the field, in front of them lying,</l>
<l n="96">The foeman before them: the fire-spewing dragon,</l>
<l n="97">Ghostly and grisly guest in his terrors,</l>
<l n="98">Was scorched in the fire; as he lay there he measured</l>
<l n="99">Fifty of feet; came forth in the night-time</l>

<l n="100">To rejoice in the air, thereafter departing</l>
<l n="101">To visit his den; he in death was then fastened,</l>
<l n="102">He would joy in no other earth-hollowed caverns.</l>
<l n="103">There stood round about him beakers and vessels,</l>
<l n="104">Dishes were lying and dear-valued weapons,</l>

<l n="105">With iron-rust eaten, as in earth’s mighty bosom</l>
<l n="106">A thousand of winters there they had rested:</l>
<note type="sidenote">The hoard was
under a magic
spell.</note>
<l n="107">That mighty bequest then with magic was guarded,</l>
<l n="108">Gold of the ancients, that earlman not any</l>
<l n="109">The ring-hall could touch, save Ruling-God only,</l>
<pb n="103"/>

<l n="110">Sooth-king of Vict’ries gave whom He wished to</l>

give access to it.</note>
<l n="111">(He is earth-folk’s protector) to open the treasure,</l>

<head type="sub"> XLII. WIGLAF’S SAD STORY.—THE HOARD CARRIED OFF.</head>
<l n="1">Then ’twas seen that the journey prospered him little</l>
<l n="2">Who wrongly within had the ornaments hidden</l>
<l n="3">Down ’neath the wall. The warden erst slaughtered</l>
<l n="4">Some few of the folk-troop: the feud then thereafter</l>

<l n="5">Was hotly avengèd. ’Tis a wonder where,</l>
<l n="6">When the strength-famous trooper has attained to the end of</l>
<l n="7">Life-days allotted, then no longer the man may</l>
<l n="8">Remain with his kinsmen where mead-cups are flowing.</l>
<l n="9">So to Beowulf happened when the ward of the barrow,</l>

<l n="10">Assaults, he sought for: himself had no knowledge</l>
<l n="11">How his leaving this life was likely to happen.</l>
<l n="12">So to doomsday, famous folk-leaders down did</l>
<l n="13">Call it with curses—who ’complished it there—</l>
<pb n="104"/>
<l n="14">That that man should be ever of ill-deeds convicted,</l>

<l n="15">Confined in foul-places, fastened in hell-bonds,</l>
<l n="16">Punished with plagues, who this place should e’er ravage.</l>
<l n="17">He cared not for gold: rather the Wielder’s</l>
<l n="18">Favor preferred he first to get sight of.</l>
<note type="sidenote">Wiglaf addresses
his comrades.</note>
<l n="19">Wiglaf discoursed then, Wihstan his son:</l>

<l n="20">“Oft many an earlman on one man’s account must</l>
<l n="21">Sorrow endure, as to us it hath happened.</l>
<l n="22">The liegelord belovèd we could little prevail on,</l>
<l n="23">Kingdom’s keeper, counsel to follow,</l>
<l n="24">Not to go to the guardian of the gold-hoard, but let him</l>

<l n="25">Lie where he long was, live in his dwelling</l>
<l n="26">Till the end of the world. Met we a destiny</l>
<l n="27">Hard to endure: the hoard has been looked at,</l>
<l n="28">Been gained very grimly; too grievous the fate that</l>
<l n="29">The prince of the people pricked to come thither.</l>

<l n="30">I was therein and all of it looked at,</l>
<l n="31">The building’s equipments, since access was given me,</l>
<l n="32">Not kindly at all entrance permitted</l>
<note type="sidenote">He tells them of
Beowulf’s last

<l n="33">Within under earth-wall. Hastily seized I</l>
<l n="34">And held in my hands a huge-weighing burden</l>

<l n="35">Of hoard-treasures costly, hither out bare them</l>
<l n="36">To my liegelord belovèd: life was yet in him,</l>
<l n="37">And consciousness also; the old one discoursed then</l>

<l n="39">Bade that remembering the deeds of your friend-lord</l>

<l n="40">Ye build on the fire-hill of corpses a lofty</l>
<l n="41">Burial-barrow, broad and far-famous,</l>
<l n="42">As ’mid world-dwelling warriors he was widely most honored</l>
<l n="43">While he reveled in riches. Let us rouse us and hasten</l>
<pb n="105"/>
<l n="44">Again to see and seek for the treasure,</l>

<l n="45">The wonder ’neath wall. The way I will show you,</l>
<l n="46">That close ye may look at ring-gems sufficient</l>
<l n="47">And gold in abundance. Let the bier with promptness</l>

<note type="sidenote">Wiglaf charges
them to build a
funeral-pyre.</note>
<l n="51">Then the son of Wihstan bade orders be given,</l>

<l n="53">Holders of homesteads, that they hither from far,</l>
<l n="54">Leaders of liegemen, should look for the good one</l>

<l n="55">With wood for his pyre: “The flame shall now swallow</l>
<l n="56">(The wan fire shall wax) the warriors’ leader</l>
<l n="57">Who the rain of the iron often abided,</l>
<l n="58">When, sturdily hurled, the storm of the arrows</l>
<l n="59">Leapt o’er linden-wall, the lance rendered service,</l>

<l n="60">Furnished with feathers followed the arrow.”</l>
<l n="61">Now the wise-mooded son of Wihstan did summon</l>
<l n="62">The best of the braves from the band of the ruler</l>
<note type="sidenote">He takes seven
thanes, and enters
the den.</note>
<l n="63">Seven together; ’neath the enemy’s roof he</l>
<l n="64">Went with the seven; one of the heroes</l>

<l n="65">Who fared at the front, a fire-blazing torch-light</l>
<l n="66">Bare in his hand. No lot then decided</l>
<l n="67">Who that hoard should havoc, when hero-earls saw it</l>
<l n="68">Lying in the cavern uncared-for entirely,</l>
<l n="69">Rusting to ruin: they rued then but little</l>

<l n="70">That they hastily hence hauled out the treasure,</l>
<note type="sidenote">They push the
dragon over the
wall.</note>
