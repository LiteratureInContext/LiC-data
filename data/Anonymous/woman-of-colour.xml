						<opener><dateline><placeName>At Sea, on board the **.** </placeName><lb/> <date>180 - </date></dateline></opener>

						<p>LAUNCHED on a new world, what can have power to console me for leaving
							the scenes of my infancy, and the friend of my youth? Nothing but the
							consciousness of acting in obedience to the commands of my departed
							father. Oh, dearest Mrs. Milbanke! your poor girl is every minute
							wishing for your friendly guidance, your maternal counsel, your sober
							judgment! - Every day, as it takes me farther from Jamaica, as it brings
							me nearer to England, heightens my fears of the future, and makes my
							presaging heart sink within itself! You charged me to confide to you its
							every throb; and till it ceases to beat, it will turn with the warmest
							affection to my earliest and best friend; my governess, my instructress!
							- and I cannot help asking why am I sent from her? why was it necessary
							for Olivia Fairfield to tempt the untried deep, and untried friends? -
							But I check these useless interrogatories, these vain regrets, by
							recollecting that it was the will of him who always studied the
							happiness of his child.</p>
						<p>My dear father, doatingly fond as he was of his Olivia, saw her situation
							in a point of view which distressed his feeling heart. The illegitimate
							offspring of his slave could never be considered in the light of
							equality by the English planters. Such is their prejudice, such is the
							wretched state of degradation to which my unhappy fellow-creatures are
							sunk in the western hemisphere. We are considered, my dear Mrs.
							Milbanke, as an inferior race, but little removed from the brutes,
							because the Almighty Maker of all-created beings has tinged our skins
							with jet instead of ivory! - I say our, for though the jet has been
							faded to the olive in my own complexion, yet I am not ashamed to
							acknowledge ym affinity with the swarthiest negro that was ever brought
							from Guinea’s coast! - All, all are brethren, children of one common
							Parent!</p>
						<p>The soul of my mother, though shrouded in a sable covering, broke through
							the gloom of night, and shone celestial in her sparkling eyes! - Sprung
							from a race of native kings and heroes, with folded hands, and tearful
							eyes, she saw herself torn from all the endearing ties of affinity, and
							relative intercourse! A gloomy, yet a proud sorrow, filled her indignant
							breast; and when exhibited on the shores of my native island, the
							symmetry and majesty of her form, the inflexible haughtiness of her
							manner, attracted the attention of Mr. Fairfield. He purchased the
							youthful Marcia; his kindness, his familiarity, his humanity, soon
							gained him an interest in her grateful heart! She loved her master! She
							had not learned the art of concealing her sentiments, she knew not that
							she was doing wrong in indulging them, and she yielded herself to her
							passion, and fell victim of gratitude! - But as her understanding became
							enlightened, and her manners improved, she was eager for information; my
							father yielded it to her from the rich stores of his own capacious mind;
							and while he poured into her attentive and docile ear, those truths for
							which the soul of Marcia panted, he made her start with horror at the
							crime of which she had been innocently guilty: and the new Christian
							pointed her finger at him, who, educated under the influence of the
							Gospel, lived in direct opposition to its laws!</p>
						<p>My father felt the justice of the reproof; for though his offence was
							considered as a venial error by all with whom he lived, yet his
							conscience was not so easily appeased. He knew that the difference of
							climate, or of colour, made no difference in the crime; and that if the
							seducer of innocence was always guilty, the case must be greatly
							aggravated where benefit and kindnesses were the weapons employed
							against untutored ignorance and native simplicity. Marcia was not
							"almost but altogether a Christian!" - with the knowledge of her crime
							she abjured a continuance in it; with tears and sighs she confessed her
							love for her betrayer, at the same time that she deplored her fall from
							virtue! The scholar taught her master - The wild and uncivilized African
							taught a lesson of noble self-denial and self-conquest to the
							enlightened and educated European.</p>
						<p>Mr. Fairfield dared not combat a resolution which appeared to him to be
							almost a command of heaven. He loved Marcia with fervour; but the pride
							of the man, the quick feeling of the European, the prejudices which he
							had imbibed in common with his countrymen, forbade his making this
							affectionate and heroic girl his wife. Marcia’s was a strong soul, but
							it inhabited a weak tenement of clay. In giving birth to me she paid the
							debt of nature and went down to that grave, where the captive is made
							free!</p>
						<p>You will ask me why I recapitulate these events? events which are so well
							known to you. It is that I love to dwell on the character of my mother;
							it is that here I see the distributions of Providence are equally
							bestowed, and that it is culture not capacity, which the negro wants! It
							was from my father that I adopted this opinion of my mother - I caught
							the enthusiasm of his manner and learned to venerate the memory of this
							sable heroine (for a heroine I must call her) from the time that my mind
							has been enabled to distinguish between vice and virtue.</p>
						<p>My father saw the sensibility of my disposition; he saw that it was daily
							wounded, at witnessing the wrongs of my fellow-beings; his wishes, and
							his principles, would have led him to reform abuses, but his health was
							daily declining, and he could not give the tone of morals to an island;
							he could not adopt a line of conduct which would draw on him the odium
							of all his countrymen: he contented himself, therefore, with seeing that
							slaves on his estate were well kept and fed, and treated with humanity,
							- but their minds were suffered to remain in the dormant state in which
							he found them!</p>
						<p>I see the generous intention of my father’s will; I see that he meant at
							once to secure to his child a proper protector in a husband, and to
							place her far from scenes which were daily hurting her sensibility and
							the pride of human nature! - But, ah! respected Mrs. Milbanke! in
							guarding against these evils may he not have opened the way to those
							which are still more dangerous for your poor Olivia?</p>
						<p>I sometimes think, that had my dear parent left me a decent competence, I
							could have placed myself in some tranquil nook of my native island, and
							have been happily and usefully employed in meliorating the sorrows of
							the poor slaves who came within my reach, and in pouring into their
							bruised souls the sweet consolations of religious hope! - But my father
							willed it otherwise - Lie still, then, rebellious and repining
							heart!</p>
						<p>Mrs. Milbanke, I yet behold your tearful eye - I yet hear your fond adieu
							- I yet feel your fervent embrace! The recollection is almost
							insupportable; for the present, I lay down my pen!</p>
					</div>
					<div type="entry">

						<head type="sub">IN CONTINUATION</head>
						<p>WAS my mind in any other state, I could be much amused and entertained by
							the novel customs of a ship’s company, and the novel situation (to me)
							of a sea voyage. How wonderful is the construction of this vessel, which
							is now ploughing its way on the ocean! but how much more wonderful that
							Almighty Pilot, which steers it in safety through the horrors of the
							deep!</p>
						<p>Mrs. Honeywood is all that your skill in physiognomy predicted. Separated
							from my beloved Mrs. Milbanke, I question if I could have met with a
							preferable Compagnon du Voyage. I fear that her native country will not
							restore her health; but I dare not hint an idea of the sort to her
							watchful and attentive son. Honeywood possesses all the enthusiasm of
							your Olivia; and when I hear his sanguine hopes of his mother’s
							recovery, and his visionary schemes of long years of happiness to be
							enjoyed in her highly-prized society, I sigh with prophetic sadness,
							and, looking on the colour of my robes, I remember such was the fallacy
							of my own wishes!</p>
						<p>Mrs. Honeywood seems perfectly acquainted with the particulares of my
							father’s will, and frequently and studiously refers to my intended
							marriage with my cousin. If you will not accuse me of vanity, my dearest
							madam, I should be almost tempted to fancy, that she sometimes wished to
							remind her son of this; and yet there is nothing to fear for him. An
							unportioned girl of my colour, can never be a dangerous object; but in
							the habits of intimacy which our present situation naturally produces,
							confidence usurps the place of common-place politeness, and I insensibly
							talk to Honeywood as I should do to a brother. Had his familiarity any
							thing of boldness in it ,was there any thing assuming in his manners, my
							sensitive heart would shrink, and I should then feel as reserved and
							constrained as I now do the reverse.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="entry">

						<head type="sub">IN CONTINUATION</head>
						<p>YOU bid me tell you every thing that should occur; and, in the absence of
							events and incidents, I must give you conversations and reflections,
							even at the hazard of appearing in the character of an egotist. I am
							just returned to my own little cabin, after a pretty long tête-à-tête
							with Mrs. Honeywood; I call it a tête-à-tête for though my faithful Dido
							formed the third of the party, yet her half-broken language did not bear
							a principal share in the conversation; but, as you well know, she will
							be heard on all occasions when she deems it right to speak. Honeywood
							had retired to study; he usually passes a great portion of the morning
							amongst his books: and that he reads with advantage and improvement, a
							more superficial observer than your Olivia would soon discover. He
							possesses a discriminating judgment, and a fine taste; and, without
							attempting at wit or humour, he never fails to please when he wishes
							it.</p>
						<p>But to return to my proposed detail: - I was seated with my drawing
							implements before me, finishing a little sketch which I had taken from
							the Fairfield PLantation a few days before I quitted it; Mrs. Honeywood
							sat opposite to me, knitting; while Dido, ever officiously happy and
							busy about her "Missee," was standing behind the sofa (which she had
							drawn towards the table), and very assiduously watching for the colours
							I wanted, and rubbing them on the slab, pretending to be occupied, in
							order to retain her station; and at intervals I felt her removing and
							replacing the combs of my hair, and smoothing it gently down with her
							hands, then looking over my shoulder, marking the progress of my pencil,
							and exclaiming, "Ah, my goody Heaven! if my dear Missee be not making
							the own good Massee’s plantation, and all of dis little bit of brush,
							and dis bit of paper!"</p>
						<p>Mrs. Honeywood lifted her head; looking at us through her spectacles, "I
							would give something to be able to take dat brush and dat bit of paper,
							Dido," said she, laughingly imitating her, "and paint your lady and
							yourself, as you are now placed before my eyes."</p>
						<p>Dido grinned, while Mrs. Honeywood still looking at me, said, -</p>
						<p>"I never view you on that seat, with Dido standing in ehr place of
							attendance, without figuring you in my imagination as some great
							princess going over to her betrothed lord."</p>
						<p>"Iss, iss, my Missee be de queen of Indee, going over to marry wid de
							prince in England," said Dido, nodding very significantly.</p>
						<p>"Such alliances do not very often turn out happily," said I, sighing.</p>
						<p>"And how should they?" asked Mrs. Honeywood; "A total ignorance of
							persons can indeed be, in some measure, set aside by the painter, but
							the manners, the customs of different countries are so widely different,
							and there ought to be so many corresponding traits of character, to form
							any thing like comfort in the connubial state, that it is my wonder when
							any one of these matches turns out merely tolerable."</p>
						<p>"You are looking grave, Miss Fairfield."</p>
						<p>"Indeed, my dear madam, I am; and have I not cause? My manners, my
							pursuits, my whole deportment, may be stranger and disagreeable to him
							whom I have pledged myself to receive as a husband! and further, - oh,
							madam! - my person may disgust him!"</p>
						<p>"No, not so, Miss Fairfield: your sensitive mind, and delicate
							imagination, lead you to see things in too strong a light."</p>
						<p>"No light can be too strong to convey to me a knowledge of that
							wretchedness which would be my portion, were I to be beheld with disgust
							and abhorrence by the man whom I have sworn to receive as my
							husband!"</p>
						<p>"Sworn, my dear girl?"</p>
						<p>"Yes, madam, sworn!"</p>
						<p>"You astonish me! - and could Mr. Fairfield, could your father extort
							such an oath, such a blind submission from you? - you, whose
							understanding he must have seen superior to the generality of your sex,
							- you, whose judgement could only have elected where it had
							approved!"</p>
						<p>"My father acted from the best of motives. If he erred, madam; if the
							sequel could prove that he has erred, give him credit, I conjure you,
							for the best intentions; his whole soul recoiled at the idea of leaving
							me in Jamaica, or of uniting me to any of the planters there: for to
							them he knew that his money would be the only bait. In England, in his
							native country, he deemed, that a more liberal, a more distinguishing
							spirit had gone abroad;" - (dear Mrs. Milbanke, I thought a sceptical
							expression overspread the marked countenance of Mrs. Honeywood) - "a
							connexion with his own family, with the son of a dearly beloved sister,
							was what his most sanguine hopes rested on for the security of his
							Olivia’s happiness!"</p>
						<p>"Your father knew this nephew?"</p>
						<p>"No, madam, only by report; and that that report was very liberal in
							praise of his accomplishments and virtues, I need not say, when my
							father resolved to hazard the happiness of his child to his care. Mr.
							Merton, the husband of my deceased aunt, is, as you may have heard, a
							wealthy merchant, and has maintained a character of strict honour and
							probity. Mrs. Merton died within the last two years; she always spoke
							highly of her husband, and expressed the most fervent fondness for her
							son, Augustus, whom she frequently styled, in her letters to Jamaica,
							the ’image of her dear brother.’ It was easy to perceive that Augustus
							was the mother’s favourite; and I fancy, that my father surmised that
							the elder young man ranked highest in Mr. Merton’s esteem. Indeed, my
							dear madam, I must be tiring you with my details, and I frequently
							think, that I can talk as coolly, and with as little mauvaise honte of
							this intended alliance as if I was a mere state machine! - conveyed over
							the water at the instigation of political contrivance; yet believe me,
							my dear madam, I have a sense of my sex’s more exclusive feeling
							delicacy. My heart revolts, it shrinks within me, as every day draws me
							nearer to the scene of my trial; and the anxiety with which I, at some
							moments await the period, is frequently changing into a desolating
							revulsion of every feeling, when I recollect that I must appear in so
							very humiliating a situation when I reach England!"</p>
						<p>"No, not humiliating," said Mrs. Honeywood, "for every generous mind will
							feel for the peculiarity of it, and exert every art to win you to
							self-confidence. You have great powers of exertion, Miss Fairfield; your
							father knew the strength of your mind; he knew that it could bear itself
							up in circumstances which would overwhelm half the female world!"</p>
						<p>"You are good to embolden me, madam," said I, "my trust is in Him who has
							promised to strengthen the weak-hearted. I hope the name of Fairfield
							shall never be disgraced by me."</p>
						<p>"I am sure it will not," said Mrs. Honeywood, "but your ingenuousness
							invites my curiosity; on your side I perfectly understand the terms. You
							have promised to accept Mr. Augustus Merton as your husband. Has a
							similar promise been received on the gentleman’s part? not that I mean
							to infer, that there could be so undiscerning an Englishman found, as to
							refuse the offered hand off Miss Fairfield!"</p>
						<p>"Do not say offered, dear Mrs. Honeywood; it sounds so - so very
							forward!" She smiled - "Ah, my dear madam, I know you pity me!"</p>
						<p>"From the bottom of my heart!" said she with fervour.</p>
						<p>"Pittee, no pitted," said Dido; "beauty lady - great deal monies - going
							marry fine gentleman as soon as she be come to England town; - me don’t
							pitted dear Missee one bit - one bit!" But Dido covered my hands with
							tears, and kissed it a hundred times, while she said, she did not
							"pittee Missee one bit - one bit." Her manner affected me; she saw it,
							and, letting her hands fall on each side of her, she stole out of the
							cabin. I tried to assume cheerfulness: "I bear with me a dover of nearly
							sixty thousand pounds," said I, "which is to become the property of my
							cousin Augustus Merton on his becoming my husband, and taking the name
							Fairfield, within one month after my arrival in England."</p>
						<p>Mrs. Honeywood seemed to look at me with the most painful and quickened
							attention "but if," said she, "he should, that is, I mean" -</p>
						<p>"I know what you mean," said I, smiling; "if Augustus refuses to accept
							these terms, the whole fortune devolves to his brother, and my
							maintenance exclusively devolves on him also!"</p>
						<p>"Strange and unheard of clause!" said Mrs. Honeywood, rising hastily from
							her seat, and turning to the window, her back towards me.</p>
						<p>"You must see it, as I see it, dear Mrs. Honeywood!" said I, going to
							her, and taking her hand; "even though you do not see poor Olivia with
							her father’s eyes, he thought that no one could refuse his girl!"</p>
						<p>"And on one could, who knew her!" said Mrs. Honeywood, straining me
							affectionately to her bosom. "Sweetest Miss Fairfield, may your
							happiness be equal to your virtues! may your cousin properly appreciate
							your worth!"</p>
						<p>"Thank you, - thank you!" returned I, with a voice almost too full for
							utterance. I then quitted this warm-hearted woman, and hastened to
							relieve myself, in my usual method, writing to you.</p>

						<head type="sub">IN CONTINUATION</head>
						<p>I HAVE frequently thought, ym dearest friend, that few young men would
							have resolution to refuse sixty thousand pounds; for the wife would be a
							very trifiling embargo to most of our gay West Indians, - I can speak of
							the world only as I have seen it. - Mrs. Milkbanke, I do not wish to be
							uncharitable or harsh in my judgement; but did we not every day see
							matches made in Jamaica, for which gold was the only inducement? And why
							do I encourage my overweening expectations - why do I expect my cousin
							to be different from the rest of his sex? Conscious of my own inferior
							powers of attraction, to what can I impute his acceptance of my mind?
							Hope will sometimes whisper, that gratitude will ensure kindness - but
							the cold feeling which alone springs from a grateful principle - could
							my warm heart be satisfied with that? - Vain, weak Olivia! go to thy
							mirror, and ask what is it thou canst expect more?</p>
					</div>
					<div type="entry">

						<head type="sub">IN CONTINUATION</head>
						<p>WEAK and impotent beings that we are, we know not what we wish, nor what
							we hope. - I retired last night to my cabin in a frame of mind which I
							should vainly seek to describe. The conversation which I had with Mrs.
							Honeywood, had made a forcible impression on my mind. I fancied that I
							was hastening to England, to be immolated at the shrine of avarice; all
							the bright prospects of my youth seemed blighted; I was friendless -
							fatherless - forlorn - journeying towards a land of strangers, who would
							despise and insult me. Bitter tears coursed each other down my cheeks; I
							wrung my hands in agony together - my heart sank within me - I had no
							resolution - no confidence left - I believed myself the most forlorn of
							human creatures, and I thought that a cessation of being, would be a
							cessation of misery. Ah! my dear friend, I am proving to you what you
							have long known, that your Olivia is no heroine! I was awakened from
							this agonizing trance to the tumultuous waves, which hove the ship with
							boisterous violence; the wind rattled in the shrouds, and increased in
							violence with each moment, while at intervals it was drowned by the long
							and reverberating peals of deep-toned thunder, and my cabin was as
							frequently illuminated by vivid lightning. There was a noise of bustle
							and alarm on the deck, and the voice of the sailors was distinguished
							amidst the horrors of the storm. Dido, shaking with affright and terror,
							bust into my cabin, -</p>
						<p>"Oh, Missee, we be going down - we be going sink in the very, very deep
							sea!"</p>
						<p>Alas! I thought so likewise; and in this hour of real danger I prayed for
							a deliverance from that death which I believed I could have fearlessly
							met, nay, had almost courted, the preceding hour. This taught me how
							very short a progress I had made in self-knowledge, and while Dido
							rolled herself up and made a sort of pillow at my meet, I tried to
							collect my thoughts, and to lift up my soul to him who "walketh on the
							wings of the wind," and to beseech him to give me a patient and
							contented spirit. The tempest still raged with redoubled violence; a
							soft tap at my door roused Dido: - "Me be here" was answered by the
							voice of Honeywood.</p>
						<p>"I could not be easy," said he, "without asking after your lady."</p>
						<p>"Oh it be very bad terrible storm, sir; me be much fear’d we must go down
							to the bottom."</p>
						<p>"Oh no, not so," said Honeywood, in the most soothing voice; "assure Miss
							Fairfield, my good Dido, that there is nothing to fear. Tell her I am
							now come from the deck, where I have been the last two hours; the
							captain assures me, the storm is abating, and I am now returning to my
							hammock: pray don’t distress Miss Fairfield: I beseech you do not
							heighten her alarm!"</p>
						<p>I heard every word, you find, my dear madam; and so friendly were they,
							so truly benevolent, and the manner, too, in which they were spoken,
							that I felt the utmost gratitude for his attention. The interest which
							he had expressed for me was grateful to my self-love, whilst my fears
							were allayed by his assurances of our safety. The storm did abate, and
							your Olivia is snatched from the horrors of the deep. I trust I shall
							not be forgetful of the mercy of that Being who has been graciously
							pleased to preserve my life!</p>
					</div>

						<p>"THEY that go down to the sea in ships, and occupy their business in
							great waters, these men see the mercies of the Lord and his wonders in
							the deep!"</p>
						<p>These words have been in my thoughts the whole of this day. The storm
							still rages in my mind’s eye. How fearful, how tremendous - Surely, if
							"by night an atheist half believes a God," he must hear him, he must see
							him, in the scene I have so recently witnessed, and a doubt could never
							more find entrance in his soul!</p>
						<p>Honeywood eagerly advanced to me as I made my appearance at breakfast and
							renewed his inquiries. I felt confused: this confusion seemed
							infectious; for, as I tried to express my thanks to him for the friendly
							interest he had evinced for me, he suddenly let go the hand which he had
							taken, coloured, sighed, and let me take my place in silence. Mrs.
							Honeywood at this moment appeared, and broke a silence which had
							succeeded, as if by a mutual inclination, to our first civilities. The
							first topic was, of course, the recent storm, and the sickly countenance
							and dimmed eye of the poor invalid, proved that a wakeful night was much
							to be dreaded for her. She congratulated me on my safety and said, -</p>
						<p>"You were very courageous in not quitting your cabin. Fear, in general,
							renders us all sociable; and I expected every moment to may seen you
							come to me. I could not pacify Charles till he had gone to you; but I
							question whether you were much comforted by his assurances of your
							safety, as he is a fresh-water sailor."</p>
						<p>I answered that I was; and Mrs. Honeywood, pursuing the subject, said, -
							"For myself, I had not much to regret in leaving a world to which an
							attenuated thread alone holds me!" Her countenance had that patient
							serenity on it, which gave it an expression which nearly comes up to my
							idea of celestial, and, though apparently talking to me, I imagined that
							she meant more particularly to address her son.</p>
						<p>"Youth, beauty, talent, virtue, and riches, to be consigned at once to
							the o’erwhelming wave, would, indeed, be a sad contemplation," said she,
							"and even where death has long been anticipated, the thoughts of
							resigning life, by any other than the common lot of humanity, is
							appalling. If it please the Almighty to let me reach my native shores, I
							think I can summon fortitude to meet the stroke as a Christian!"</p>
						<p>"My dearest mother, rive not my heart!" said Honeywood.</p>
						<p>"Charles, you are not philosopher," said Mrs. Honeywood, attempting to
							smile, as she held out her hand to him; he took it, - never shall I
							forget with what an expression of love and reverence he held it to his
							lips in silence, then pressed it to his breast.</p>
						<p>"If philosophy is to steel my heart against such feelings as these," said
							he, wiping off the starting tear with the back of his hand, "my mother,
							who shall teach it me? But Heaven, in its mercy, will long preserve to
							me a parent for whom alone I would wish to live!"</p>
						<p>"When I am laid in the peaceful tomb, my Charles, your heart shall seek
							another being, whose life shall be sweetened, as mine long as been, by
							your cares and attentions. Your mother will be changed for the closer -
							the yet more endearing tie of wife. With a companion of your own age,
							whose pursuits are similar to your own, whose mind has been cultivated,
							and whose principles are good, you are formed, my son, to partake with
							such a woman the very acmé of human happiness."</p>
						<p>The eyes of Honeywood sought mine, for a moment, with an expression which
							I cannot define; then hastily pressing his hand on his forehead, as if
							in pain, he rose from his seat, and said -</p>
						<p>"Never, never! my dearest madam; you unman me quite!" and left the
							cabin.</p>
						<p>"‘Tis always thus," said Mrs. Honeywood; "nothing that I can say will
							open the dear boy’s eyes to my danger; and, with his impetuous, his
							ardent feelings, I dread for him the shock of an event for which he will
							not be prepared! Talk to him, for me, my good Miss Faifield; you have
							great influence over him; he will listen to you: tell him that he must
							make up his mind to resign his parent!"</p>
						<p>"Alas!" sighed I, "I am ill qualified for such an office, - I that
							continue to mourn the loss of the best of fathers! - My loss is certain,
							my dear madam; Mr. Honeywood’s is only in prospective - I feel the sad
							reality - he shudders at the supposition - how then shall I teach him
							that fortitude which I cannot practise myself? The loss of a parent can
							never be supplied to a child! - My father was my guide, my counsellor,
							my friend; he was the impulse of my life; he was the guide of my every
							action; almost the director of my thoughts! When I lost my father, I
							lost every thing which could make life desirable; and when poor
							Honeywood shall lose you, he will then know the wretchedness of my
							situation!"</p>
					</div>
					<div type="entry">

						<head type="sub">IN CONTINUATION</head>
						<p>WHERE there is any thing conciliate regard or esteem, how soon do we get
							attached! I already feel as if I had been known to Mrs. Honeywood all my
							life, and I regret that when I lose sight of her, and of her amiable
							son, on our landing, it must be among the chance events of the future,
							whether we may ever meet again.</p>
						<p>I sat for two hours of the last evening on the deck watching the mildly
							radian moon, and the thousand sparkling rays which were caused by her
							shadow on the tranquil ocean; no longer heaving with tumultuous waves as
							on the preceding night, but peaceful as the translucent lake. Honeywood
							attached himself to my side, his mother was apprehensive of the night
							air, and remained in the cabin -</p>
						<p>"How still is the water!" said Honeywood; "how bright the lustre of that
							celestial orb! what a contrast is this scene to that which I last night
							witnessed in this place!"</p>
						<p>"And how doubly are we interested in the beauty of this night from that
							very contrast which you have remarked!" said I. - "So it is in life, we
							recover from the dreadful shock of some fearful calamity, to those
							placid and calm sensations, which such a contemplation as this is
							calculated to produce: we remember when we have suffered, and we are
							doubly grateful to Him who has enabled us to endure afflictions, and
							caused the storm to pass over our heads!"</p>
						<p>"You can extract good from every evil," said Honeywood, "morality from
							every passing occurence - you can find sermons in stones, and God in
							every thing!" - He spoke this with enthusiasm. "Indeed, Miss Fairfield,
							I know of no one like you - you will shame our English ladies - or
							rather, you are going where your virtues will not be known or
							appreciated!"</p>
						<p>"How am I to understand you?" asked I, willing to take the compliment
							that my moralizing disposition has extorted as applicable; "how then
							shall I account for the latter part of your speech without accusing you
							of vanity? Does Mr. Honeywood imagine that he only has discernment to
							discover those great and extraordinary virtues which I possess?"</p>
						<p>"By no means," said he, answering gravely to my tone of raillery - "by no
							means; but the superficial characters of our modern females, their
							frivolous pursuits, their worse than childish conversation - oh! you
							will soon be sickened of them; and, if I do not mistake your
							disposition, the sensitive plant will then recoil, and never expand
							itself again, till drawn out by an assimilating look, or spark of
							sentiment!"</p>
						<p>"Oh, what a fearful prospect!" said I, still affecting to trifle - "Am I
							then so very fastidious a being, Mr. Honeywood? Believe me, I look not
							for perfection in an imperfect state; my own faults are great and
							manifold and, I trust, I can behold those of my fellow-mortals with
							charity, and make allowances in proportion!"</p>
						<p>"That you can do all, and more than this, I am well satisfied," said
							Honeywood; "but if your heart is not interested, I mean if no kindred
							emotion - that is - I believe," said he, "like many others who set out
							in discussing a subject, I have confused myself, and want somebody to
							explain my own meaning."</p>
						<p>He then reverted to his mother’s health, a topic which never fails to
							interest.</p>
						<p>"When I consider," said he, "that her illness may be in some measure
							traced to a three years’ residence in your warm climate (for though the
							latent seeds of the disease might have been in her constitution, yet it
							was there that they first burst forth), and that she undertook the
							voyage merely on my account, in order to gather up the wreck of a
							shattered fortune for my use, I know not how to estimate the sacrifice;
							and that affection which I feel for her, tells me that the independence
							which she has secured to me, has been too dearly earned for me to enjoy
							it, if bought with the price of her health, perhaps her life!" - He
							paused a moment as if to recover the power of articulation -</p>
						<p>"On the other hand," said he, "I remember the anxiety with which this
							dear parent passed the lingering days previous to her setting out for
							the West Indies. I was brought up to the prospect of inheriting a large
							fortune, and was then too old to enter into either of the professions
							with advantage to myself. - She had seen enough of the world to know
							that a proud and a sensitive spirit struggling with adversity, was a
							most pitiable situation. My mother has had her share of sorrows - My
							father was not able to appreciate her worth or her uncomplaining
							fortitude - ‘tis a sad story, my dear Miss Fairfield, one day you may
							perhaps hear it - for I cannot, I will not think," said he, taking my
							hand "that our acquaintance shall cease with this voyage!"</p>
						<p>"I hope not," said I.</p>
						<p>"Say it shall not," said he, with earnestness.</p>
						<p>"We can speak with certainty of nothing," said I, "and you must remember,
							that from the moment when I set my foot on your land of liberty, I yield
							up my independence - my uncle’s family are then to be the disposers of
							my future fate; and, though they can never teach my heart to forego its
							nature, or my mind its principles, yet in all irrelevant points, and in
							all local opinions, I must resolve to yield myself to their
							guidance!"</p>
						<p>"If such be your determination; if you thus at once resolve to give up
							the liberty of action - farewell for ever when we separate!" said
							Honeywood with some asperity: "we shall never be allowed to prosecute
							our acquaintance with our interesting companion!"</p>
						<p>"And why should you think so? why should you suppose that the family of
							Mr. Merton was illiberal or unjust?"</p>
						<p>"I judge by myself - a fair standard you will allow," said he: "and I
							know that if I was in the place of these Mertons (you observe, my dear
							friend, he was too delicate to refer to Augustus only) I should be a
							monopolizer of the time, the conversation, even the looks of Miss
							Fairfield!" He reddened as he spoke these words; he probably thought he
							had said too much - I felt that he had, however - and sought Mrs.
							Honeywood.</p>
					</div>

						<head type="sub">IN CONTINUATION</head>
						<p>I AM not without my sex’s vanity, dearest Mrs. Milbanke, perhaps indeed I
							have a larger portion of it than generality, from the knowledge that I
							owe nothing to the score of my personal attractions; yet I must be blind
							if I did not perceive that Honeywood beholds me with a more than common
							degree of partiality. Were I a romantic beauty, in the noble compassion
							of my nature I should say that it would give me pleasure, on his
							account, when our voyage was ended - but I am not so far gone as this. I
							know that the charms of mind divested of a prepossessing exterior, can
							only captivate the judgment, not mislead the heart; and that a
							preference originating in reason, will be referable to reason for its
							extinction.</p>
						<p>Honeywood is certainly a very estimable young man; I like his
							conversation extremely; and without feeling any thing more for him than
							I should for an amiable brother, I confess that I shall be much
							mortified if Augustus Merton is not a little like him in sentiment and
							principle. In this case, although you may laugh at me for such an idea,
							yet I really think the miniature of Augustus has been serviceable to me.
							When I have felt a more than common interest for HOneywood, I have
							retired to my cabin, and spent some moments in contemplating the
							inanimate resemblance of him to whom I am affianced. I never behold the
							picture without emotion - the likeness to my dear father is so very
							striking, although the countenance is much handsomer, and there is a
							speaking sensibility in the eye which rivets my attention; for there I
							fondly imagine I behold all that I seek for of mind and sentiment in my
							destined husband - and yet perhaps, my dear madam, I do but flatter
							myself, as the artist has flattered his employer.</p>

						<p>IT is the sweet bard of Avon, I believe who so well expresses an idea

							recollect the lines from my remote reference, and you will know the

							hopes and the fears of this beating heart.</p>
						<p>That period will surely fix the fiat of my destiny. - I shall have your
							prayers - I shall offer my own; - and shall I not be encompassed by the
							guardian spirit of my father? - Oh! if it be permitted from the realms

						<p>WE are already in the Bristol Channel, and in a few hours shall expect to

							if she expected to do instantaneous execution, she had, within five
							minutes, put her large gold rings into her ears, which had been
							carefully laid in cotton during the voyage. I felt the blood forsake my

						<p>WE are anchored, my beloved friend; already have the eyes of your Olivia

						<p>I MOMENTARILY expect Mr. Merton; figure to yourself the nature of my
							present feeling. I write in order to divert my mind; for, to dwell on my
							own thoughts during this period of suspense, is agony. We came to this
							place last evening. Mrs. Honeywood, her son, and servant, myself, and
							Dido. What an evening it was! Surely nothing was ever so serenely
							beautiful; surely, nothing was ever more romantically picturesque, than
							the wooded cliffs, and the boldly gigantic rocks, on either side the
							river, as we swiftly glided along its surface! The moon shone with
							unclouded brightness; the air was soft and mellow; the nightingales
							warbled from amidst their leafy coverts; and, at intervals, a French
							horn and a clarionet breathed forth their shrill tones, softening as
							they issued from the tremendous heights above our heads; while the soft
							dashing of the oars, and the sparkling play of the waters in the
							moonbeam, made up this scene of enchantment. Spite of the conflicting
							emotions of my mind, I was wrapt in enthusiastic admiration. Mrs.
							Honeywood enjoyed the scene; while her son fixed his eyes alternately on
							me and on the water, with an expression of melancholy resignation in his
							countenance.</p>
						<p>When we got nearer to the large and mercantile city of Bristol, - when I
							could distinguish the "busy hum of men," and could discern the traits of
							active life which even at the still hour of evening are to be seen on
							the quay’s of this place, my heart seemed to be thrown back upon itself,
							and I felt that I was entering into a world of strangers. All resolution
							- all self-confidence was banished with this idea. I leant back in the
							boat, and sobbed with apprehensive sorrow. Mrs. Honeywood did not
							observe my emotion, and if her son did, he knew that at such moments as
							these the voice of consolation cannot be heard.</p>
						<p>Honeywood carefully assisted us in landing; a hackney-coach was in
							waiting: for Mrs. Honeywood, long disused as she has been to any
							exercise, was incapable of walking the shortest distance. In less than
							ten minutes, we were set down at this bustling tavern, where the noise,
							the closeness, and the gloom of the apartments, exceed any thing that I
							could have imagined. We chilly beings, however, were soon seated around
							a cheerful fire. Dido walked off with Mrs. Honeywood’s maid, in great
							admiration and surprise at every thing which met her eye; and in the
							tone and voice of affection, which a fond parent would have used towards
							a favourite child, Mrs. Honeywood took my hand in hers, and
							congratulated me on my safe arrival in England.</p>
						<p>How grateful is the expression of kindness to the human ear! - "Alas!"
							thought I, "how do I know if this is not the last time when I shall call
							forth the sympathetic regard of another?"</p>
						<p>As I made this reflection, I lifted her hand to my lips, and while I held
							it there, I almost bathed it in my tears.</p>
						<p>At this moment, the master of the inn entered the room, and respectfully
							addressing himself to Honeywood, inquired if either lady’s name was
							Fairfield: on being directed towards me, he presented me a letter which
							he held in his hand.</p>
						<p>"This, madam, was left with me by Mr. Merton himself, and he has made
							daily inquiries concerning the arrival of the *** every day for the last
							fortnight."</p>
						<p>My hand trembled so, that I let the letter drop from between my fingers.
							Honeywood picked it up, but he was infected by my tremor as he returned
							it to me. The landlord retired, and I read the following words:</p>

						<floatingText type="letter">
							<body>

								<opener>"TO MISS FAIRFIELD."</opener>
								<p>"My dearest Miss Fairfield! We are waiting your arrival in
									England with the greatest anxiety; and that you may experience
									the least possible inconvenience at landing in a strange
									country, understanding that the ****, in which your passage was
									taken, is bound for the port of Bristol, Augustus and myself
									have taken a house at Clifton; and Mrs. George Morton, the wife
									of my eldest son, has kindly accompanied us from London, in
									order, if possible, to do away every feeling of embarrassment in
									your situation. On your landing be kind enough to send a
									messenger to me, No. - Gloucester-row, Clifton, and half an hour
									will bring to you, your affectionate relatives.</p>
								<closer><salute>"I have the honour to be, dearest madam, your
										obliged friend, and uncle,<lb/></salute>
									<signed>"GEORGE MERTON."</signed></closer>
							</body>
						</floatingText>

						<p>A faint sickishness seemed to overcome me as I read this letter: I
							mechanically threw it into Mrs. Honeywood’s lap, and hid my face with
							both my hands. Mrs. Honeywood perused it, and returning it to me, said,
							- </p>
						<p>"It is a very proper and considerate letter: and much as I must grieve
							that our separation is so near, yet I am pleased to observe the
							affectionate solicitude which Mr. Merton evinces towards you!"</p>
						<p>"Our separation is near, certainly," said Honeywood; "but surely, madam,
							Miss Fairfield need not instantaneously make her arrival known to the
							Mertons; they may be abridged of her company a few short hours, just
							while she recovers from the fatigue of the voyage. Consider, from
							henceforth she will be always with them, while we -"</p>
						<p>He stopped. - "Miss Fairfield must judge for herself," said Mrs.
							Honeywood with some gravity in her manner: "I will most readily be her
							chaperon, while she stays here, and shall be but too much gratified in
							her society. But -"</p>
						<p>"But it would be extremely improper," said I, hastily interrupting her,
							"to let my uncle remain in ignorance of my arrival after to-morrow
							morning. This night, my dear madam," said I, "shall be passed here, and
							under your protection and vainly shall I endeavour to express my sense
							of your more than maternal care and attention."</p>
						<p>Ah, dearest Mrs. Milbanke! -an elegant chariot stops at the door. I am
							summoned, - how - how shall I support this trying interview!</p>

						<p>You used to like my description of persons and characters as they struck
							my eye; and I the more readily indulge my pen in being minute. Yes! I
							will write what I think, my dear madam, even a hazard of being thought
							severe; for you will not accuse your Olivia of ill-natured severity, and
							to no other will my remarks be open. You perceive that I have outlived
							yesterday, that I can even be a trifler to daym, and from these facts
							your warm heart will augur all that is good. I will try to be
							methodical. I reached the dining-room we occupied before my visitors;
							Mrs. Honeywood and her son offered to withdraw. I could not speak, but I
							motioned to Honeywood, and grasped the arm of his mother to detain her.
							Dido officiously threw open the door, and as my fearful eyes met hers, I
							could perceive a triumphant and consequential toss, which always
							designates her manner when she is particularly pleased.</p>
						<p>"How fleet is a glance of the mind!" says our own dear Cowper: -
							immediately, there entered a very fashionable and showy looking young
							woman, leaning on the arm of a tall man, of a good though stiff figure.
							I was conscious that a third person followed them but I dared not look
							beyond. Mrs. Honeywood most kindly acted as mistress of ceremonies, and
							announced the trembling, agitated Olivia, as Miss Fairfield, while Mr.
							Merton said, as he advanced towards me, - "My dear niece, let me
							introduce you to Mrs. George Merton.</p>
						<p>I believe I held out my hand, and that lady was very near taking it in
							hers; but I fancy its colour disgusted her, for she recoiled a few paces
							with a blended curtesy and shrug, and simpering, threw herself on a
							sofa. My uncle seemed to have no prejudices; he held me to his breast,
							and pressed his lips on my cheek; he then led his son to me, but again
							my eyes sought the carpet, though I was conscious of the trembling hand
							which held mine, he stammered out some words of pleasure and happiness.
							Honeywood was then introduced by his mother; the languid drawl of the
							fine lady, Mrs. Merton, detained him in conversation. My Merton paid me
							the utmost attention, and, in part, relieved me from my embarrassment. I
							looked up, and for the first time saw Augustus Merton: - he seemed to
							have been examining me with scrutinizing attention. -Alas! I fear it was
							but a melancholy contemplation in a double sense; for I thought I
							distinguished a suppressed sigh, as he hastily addressed himself to
							Honeywood!</p>
						<p>No, my dear friend! The painter did not flatter! Were I to draw a model
							of manly beauty and grace, I would desire Augustus Merton to sit for the
							likeness. And yet, I do not know, that his face is so regularly
							handsome; but there is an expression in his eye of tender melancholy,
							which is irresistibly interesting; and his smile has more sweetness, if
							possible, than had my father’s! The likeness to him is very strong, and
							his voice has the very tones which used to bless my ear! Can I, then,
							fail to listen, when Augustus speaks? His manners are elegant, without
							being studied or coxcomical. As yet he has not talked much, but I
							suspect the singular situation in which we are placed has been the cause
							of his taciturnity; for I have now and then observed an arch turn of
							humour, not quite free from sarcasm, when he has addressed himself to
							Mrs. Merton, but more of this hereafter.</p>
						<p>I am not likely to lose my senses and fall in love, as it is called; but
							I freely confess to you, my dear Mrs Milbanke, that I think my cousin is
							a singularly prepossessing young man, - most probably his opinion of
							your Olivia is quite the reverse. But to proceed. -</p>
						<p>After half an hour’s conversation, in which Mrs. Merton and my uncle were
							the speakers, the latter proposed our departure, expressing his sense of
							obligation to Mrs. Honeywood in high terms of politeness. I could only
							throw myself into the arms of this kind friend, whom, in all human
							probability, I shall never see again. My heart was too full for
							utterance, but she felt and understood its beatings. I tore myself from
							her, and giving my hand to Honeywood, I indistinctly murmured farewel;
							he pressed it to his lips, his "God bless you!" was fervently audible,
							and it drew forth the affected smile of Mrs. Merton, as she preceded us
							down the stairs with a languid careless step, which could not have been
							exceeded by the most die-away lady in the whole island of Jamaica.</p>
						<p>My uncle was leading me; but, as if fearful that there should be any
							failure of attention, he said, "Augustus, assist Mrs. Merton." The son
							was obedient, and the lady’s - "I do very well, I thank you," was said
							in a tone of restrained mortification.</p>
						<p>Mrs. Merton would be thought pretty by any person who looks for feature
							only. She is very fair, and very fat; her eyes are the lightest blue,
							her cheeks exhibit a most beautiful (but I am apt to believe not a
							natural) carmine; her hair is flaxen; her teeth are dazzlingly white;
							her hand and arm would rival alabaster. Yet with all these concomitants
							to beauty, she fails to interest or to please your Olivia. And you must
							allow, my dear friend, that I am not usually difficult; and you remember
							that I have frequently told you, that I had not a greater pleasure, than
							in studying the countenance of a beautiful woman of our country. Whence,
							then,is this change of sentiment, you will say, in regard to Mrs.
							Merton? - Ah! Whence is it, indeed! for I am but too well inclined to
							behold my uncle’s family with partiality.</p>
						<p>I do not think this lady seems endowed with a more than common portion of
							feeling; this may be her misfortune, and not her fault: or rather, I
							should say, that too much feeling is to be considered as a misfortune to
							the possessor; therefore, on this score, I should be invidious and
							unchristian-like, to judge harshly of Mrs. Merton: but there is such a
							splenetic tendency in every word she utters, such a look of design,
							accompanied with so much self-importance, and so large a portion of
							conceit and affectation, with such frivolous conversation, that I seem
							hardly to consider her as a rational being; though she is a wholly
							inoffensive once to me, for I can never be hurt by the manners of a
							person whom I do not respect; and that she considers me as but one
							remove from the brute creation, is very evident.</p>
						<p>So here, perhaps, we meet on equal terms. Mrs. Merton was a cit-yheiress,
							with a large fortune, which she thinks entitles her to a large portion
							of respect and attention; - and my good uncle administers it
							unceasingly. Perhaps he thinks it necessary to be doubly assiduous from
							seeing the carelessness of Augustus, who, without being rude (which I
							suspect is not in his nature), seems perfectly indifferent to all the
							imposing claims of his fair sister-in-law.</p>
						<p>Mr. Merton appears about sixty years of age; he wears his own thin and
							grey hair, nicely dressed and powdered; his person is tall, but not
							graceful, for there is a stiffness in it which he cannot shake off,
							though he tries to divest himself of it by an invariable politeness and
							attention. His dress is plain, but remarkably near; and his polished
							shoes, and silk stockings, are always in print. He treats me with the
							most studied regard, - "My dear niece, - my dearest Miss Fairfield, -
							and my beloved ward," - are the appellations which he distinguishes me
							by, - and could I suspect myself of so speedily inspiring regard, I
							should judge that he already felt for me a paternal affection; but while
							he addresses me in this style, to Mrs. Merton he is, on the other hand,
							as kind and as tender: - "My dear madam, my good daughter," and such
							pleasing expressions, are dealt in equal, if not larger portions to her;
							as, perhaps, he guesses that this lady would not be very well pleased to
							have a rival even in his favour. My uncle’s conversation is formal and
							precise: he tries to be what is called a lady’s man, but does not quite
							know the way to set about it. Subjects on which he talks to them, are
							not, I can easily perceive, those on which he is the most conversant. I
							suspect, that he devoted too many years to the compting-house, to make
							him an agreeable trifler. Yet his principles appear honest and upright,
							and I dare say he is a man who has passed through the world, maintaining
							a strict character for probity and integrity as a merchant. As I have
							said before, I have seen too little of Augustus, to judge of his
							talents, or his qualities. Ah! my dear friend, a prepossessing exterior
							has oft been known to veil a deformed mind! Yet, surely, this cannot be
							the case here; - and if it were - if I were to make the fatal discovery,
							what should I gain, when a month, - a short month, will probably unite
							me to him for life: probably, I say, for it is optional for Augustus.
							You know, my dear Mrs. Milbanke, he has the liberty of refusing me, and
							when, at times, I perceive an abstraction of manner, when I see the
							melancholy expressions which overspreads his countenance, I am ready to
							spring from my seat, to fall on my knees before him, and to beseech him,
							not to make a sacrifice of his own and of my happiness; till called to
							order, by an address of his father, an application for his opinion, or a
							reference to his judgment, the smile plays round his mouth, and his
							whole countenance is illumined by an expression of sweetness and
							placidity which makes me a sceptic to my preconceived opinion.</p>

						<p>IF I may judge by the servants, carriages, &amp;c. which I see, Mrs.
							Merton and his son both live in a style of princely magnificence. There
							is something, I think, not very far removed from ostentation in the
							manner of Mr. Merton; he loves to talk of thousands and tens of
							thousands, in the indifferent careless way with which another would
							speak of pence. Persons who have risen to importance by their own means,
							often fall into this failing. I have frequently remarked it among some
							of our wealthy planters. I must proceed with my history when an
							opportunity offers, therefore you will have a packet of mutilated
							scraps.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="entry">
						<head type="sub">IN CONTINUATION</head>
						<p>THE first day was passed by my uncle in inquiries concerning the
							Fairfield estate, its situation, its produce, and other topics on which
							he thought I was conversant. I felt the kindness of his intention, and
							gave him all the information which I thought might entertain him:
							insensibly I lost the timidity of my manner, and became unrestrained and
							at ease. I am naturally of a communicative, and, I hope, of a cheerful
							temper; I felt that I could gain nothing by silence and seeming
							stupidity. I knew that my first appearance could not have been very
							prepossessing, and by gently sliding into my natural character, I should
							show my new relatives wha they might expect; and, I confess, to be
							thought favourably of by them (ah! why should I deny it? by Augustus in
							particular) is a wish very near my heart. Mr. Merton, all politesse and
							attention, seemed much pleased by my remarks. Mrs. Merton affected to
							take no interest or share in the conversation, but played, by turns,
							with her little boy, about three years of age, and her pug dog: it would
							be difficult to say which was the greatest pet, if the partiality of
							grand-papa did not obviously turn the scale on the side of the child,
							who would really be a most lovely creature if mamma did not so entirely
							spoil him. All this is to be understood in parenthesis. Augustus said
							little: he seemed distrait and embarrassed in his manner, yet he
							occasionally roused himself; and more than once, when I bore honest
							testimony to the virtues of my father, which a reference to his estates,
							and their management, naturally produced from me, he seemed affected by
							my manner, and looked at me with an expression of solicitude which made
							my heart flutter, and my cheeks glow.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="entry">
						<head type="sub">IN CONTINUATION</head>
						<p>I CAN see that there is not a being in creation for whom Mrs. Merton had
							a stronger portion of contempt, than for myself: if her husband is of
							her disposition, how dreadful would be a state of dependence on such a
							pair! And yet, if Augustus Merton refuses her offered hand, such must be
							the situation of your poor Olivia! - Perhaps this city lady, whose ideas
							are all centred in self, and in money, as the grand minister to all her
							capricious indulgences - perhaps this lady might have no objection to
							become the protectress of a poor girl of colour, or to receive an
							acquisition of fortune at the same time; and for this reason she may be
							acting politically, by trying to infect Augustus with a portion of that
							distaste and antipathy which she invariably evinces towards me; thinking
							that she may thus induce him to forego his claim to me and to my fortune
							- but a generous mind would not thus be warped - Mrs. Merton foils
							herself. The very means she employs to humble and mortify me, excites
							the attention and the respectful consideration of Augustus. This
							inactive lady cannot leave her bed very soon of a morning. I had some
							time waited a summons to breakfast, when at least I ventured down
							stairs; Dido having assured me that Mr. Augustus’s man had dressed his
							master more than two hours: however, there was no sign of breakfast
							below, and I returned to my own room, and wrote the foregoing page
							before the bell had sounded; but, in returning to my apartment, the door
							of a room being a-jar, my eyes caught the figure of Augustgus Merton.
							His arms were folded, his head almost rested on his breast, and he
							looked the very image of melancholy despondence. - Alas! was I, then,
							the cause of these sorrowful reflections? was he meditating on the
							sacrifice he was so soon required to make? - A sacrifice, perhaps, of
							the cherished affections of his heart - a sacrifice of his happiness! -
							Oh, Mrs. Milbanke, how fraught with misery is the idea!</p>
					</div>
					<div type="entry">
						<head type="sub">IN CONTINUATION</head>
						<p>IN an elegant morning dishabille, Mrs. Merton reclined on an ottoman: she
							just made the morning salutation as I entered, and then relapsed again
							into the intent and important study (as it appeared) of "Bell’s Belle
							Assembly, or Gallery of Fashion:" a modern periodical publication, where
							the ladies have coloured specimens of the costume and habits in which
							they are to array themselves every month. Mr. Merton was reading the
							newspapers, but he laid them down on seeing me; advanced - took my hand
							- made particular inquiries after my health - drew a chair for me - and
							placed himself next me. The urn steamed before her, but the fashionable
							fair did not notice it, till gently reminded by Mr. Merton with, -
							"Shall I assist you in putting some water in the tea-pot, Mrs.
							Merton?"</p>
						<p>"Oh, by all means," said she, yawning, "and make the tea also; for it is
							a terrible bore!"</p>
						<p>"I see you are engaged in an interesting study," said Mr. Merton; "you
							ladies employ every opportunity in rendering yourselves, if possible,
							more irresistible than you were formed by nature!" And the old gentleman
							very accommodatingly took the tea-chest in his hand.</p>
						<p>"You must suffer me to do this, sir," said I; "I like the office; it is
							one which I have been accustomed to; and you see I am perfectly
							disengaged."</p>
						<p>"I yield it with pleasure into abler hands," said Mr. Merton, bowing
							gallantly as he resigned it to me.</p>
						<p>Augustus now came in, and paid his compliments in a cheerful,
							unconstrained manner. "So soon put in employ, Miss Fairfield?" said
							he.</p>
						<p>"Oh yes, the lady is of an active turn I find," said Mrs. Merton, still
							meditating on the coloured print which she held in her hand.</p>
						<p>A servant now entered with a large plate of boiled rice. Mrs. Merton half
							raised her head, saying - "Set it there," pointing towards the part of
							the table where I sat.</p>
						<p>"What is this?" asked Mr. Merton.</p>
						<p>"Oh, I thought that Miss Fairfield - I understood that people of your - I
							thought that you almost lived upon rice," said Mrs. Merton, "and so I
							ordered some to be got, - for my own part, I never tasted it in my life,
							I believe!"</p>
						<p>Mrs. Milbanke, this was evidently meant to mortify your Olivia; it was
							blending her with the poor negro slaves of the West Indies! It was meant
							to show her, that, in Mrs. Merton’s idea, there was no distinction
							between us - you will believe that I could not be wounded at being
							classed with my brethren!</p>
						<p>Augustus coloured, and looked indignantly toward Mrs. Merton: his father
							tried palliate, by saying, if I would give him leave, he would help
							himself to a little of it; while I, perfectly unabashed, and mistress of
							myself, pretended to take the mischievous officiousness, or impertinence
							(which you will), of Mrs. Merton in a literal sense; and, turning
							towards her, said, - "I thank you for studying my palate, but I assure
							you there is no occasion; I eat just as you do, I believe: and though,
							in Jamaica, our poor slaves (my brothers and sisters, smiling) are kept
							upon rice as their chief food, yet they would be glad to exchange it for
							a little of your nice wheaten bread here;" taking a piece of baked bread
							in my hand.</p>
						<p>The lady looked rather awkward, I thought, bue she was doubly diligent in
							the study of the fashions; while Augustus offered me the butter, and my
							father’s smile played round his mouth.</p>
						<p>I am confident, that at this moment his countenance expressed approbation
							of your Olivia. Presently, little George came running into the room,
							and, without noticing the opened arms of his grandfather, he ran to his
							mother - "Oh. Mamma! mamma! look at poor George’s face - that nasty
							black woman has been kissing me, and dirtying my face all over!"</p>
						<p>"Hush, hush!" said Mrs. Merton, pretending to silence the child on my
							account, while the pleased expression of her countenance could not be
							misconstrued.</p>
						<p>"No, I don’t mean her," said George pointing at me, "but one much, much
							dirtier - so very dirty, you can’t think, mamma! - Nasty woman, to dirty
							my face!"</p>
						<p>"You must go to your room, George, if you do not hold your tongue
							directly!"</p>
						<p>"Pray do not check him, Mrs. Merton," said I; "there is something
							bewitchingly charming in infantine simplicity. - How artless is this
							little fellow! his lips utter the sentiments of his heart - and those
							alone! - My love, you will soon lose that beautiful character of your
							mind, ingenuousness; for it is a sad and melancholy truth, that as we
							grow older, we grow acquainted with dissimulation."</p>
						<p>"It is too true, indeed!" said Mr. Merton.</p>
						<p>Augustus sighed deeply.</p>
						<p>"Come hither, my little fellow," said I, "and I promise I will not kiss
							you!"</p>
						<p>"Why, I should not so much mind if you were to kiss me," said he; "for
							your lips are red, and besides, your face is not so very, very
							dirty."</p>
						<p>"Go to Miss Fairfield, George," said Augustus.</p>
						<p>"With all my heart, uncle!" said he.</p>
						<p>I took him on my lap, and holding his hand in mine, I said, - "You see
							the difference in our hands?"</p>
						<p>"Yes, I do, indeed," said he, shaking his head. "Mine looks clean and
							yours looks not so very dirty."</p>
						<p>"I am glad it does not look so very dirty," said I; "but you will be
							surprised when I tell you that mine is quite as clean as your own, and
							that the black woman’s below, is as clean as either of them."</p>
						<p>"Oh now, what nonsense are you telling me!" said he, lifting up both his
							hands in astonishment.</p>
						<p>"No," returned I, "it is very good sense: do you know who made you?"</p>
						<p>"My grand-papa said God," answered he.</p>
						<p>"Oh, if you mean that, he is very backward in his catechism," said Mrs.
							Merton: "I am sure I could not pretend to teach it to him."</p>
						<p>"So I should imagine, if you think Miss Fairfield put the first question
							of it to him," said Augustus, rather sarcastically.</p>
						<p>"The same God that made you made me," continued I - "the poor black woman
							- the whole world - and every creature in it! A great part of this world
							is peopled by creatures with skins as black as Dido’s, and as yellow as
							mine. God chose it should be so, and we cannot make our skins white, any
							more than you can make yours black."</p>
						<p>"Oh! But I can make mine black if I choose it," said he, "by rubbing
							myself with coals."</p>
						<p>"And so can I make mine white by rubbing myself with chalk," said I; "but
							both the coal and the chalk would be soon rubbed off again."</p>
						<p>"And won’t yours and hers rub off?" said he.</p>
						<p>"Try," said I, giving him the corner of my handkerchief; and to work the
							little fellow went with all his might.</p>
						<p>"George, you are very rude and troublesome to Miss Fairfield," said Mr.
							Merton.</p>
						<p>"Not in the least," said I; "it is right that he should prove the truth
							of what I have been telling him, he will then believe me another
							time."</p>
						<p>"Yes, that I shall," said he, sighing and resigning his employment, as if
							it had wearied him.</p>
						<p>"What do you sigh for, George?" asked Augustus.</p>
						<p>"I could wish," said he, looking at me, "that God had made you white,
							ma’am, because you are so very good-natured; but I will kiss you, if you
							like."</p>
						<p>"Thank you for the wish, my dear child, and for the favour conferred upon
							me," said I, pressing his cherub lips to mine. "I am not a little proud
							of this as I consider it a conquest over prejudice!"</p>
						<p>"Your arguments are irresistible, you find, Miss Fairfield," said my
							uncle, smiling.</p>
						<p>"Prejudices imbibed in the nursery are frequently attached to the being
							of ripened years," said Augustus; "and to eradicate them as they appear,
							is a labour well worth the endeavour of the judicious preceptor."</p>
						<p>"Suppose I proceed a little further," said I, "for at present I have
							gained but half a victor. - So you still dislike my poor Dido,
							George?"</p>
						<p>"She is very dirty," said he, again shaking his head; but colouring, he
							said, "I mean very black."</p>
						<p>"She is a poor negro, you know," said Mrs. Merton, in a most sneering and
							contemptuous tone.</p>
						<p>"But she is the most faithful of creatures, George," said I, not deigning
							to answer his mother, "and I love her dearly!"</p>
						<p>"Do you love her dearly?" said he, looking up in my face, with a very
							scrutinizing expression. "Only think grand-papa, only think uncle, Miss
							Fairfield says she loves the blackamoor dearly!"</p>
						<p>"I dare say she has reason to estimate her," said Mr. Merton.</p>
						<p>"Indeed I have, sir, as your grandson shall hear: - She was born upon my
							papa’s estate," said I, addressing my attentive little hearer; "her
							father and her mother were slaves, or, as you would call them, servants
							to him."</p>
						<p>"But these black slaves are no better than horses over there," said
							George, interrupting me; "for I heard the coachment telling one of the
							grooms so, in the servants’ hall, last night."</p>
						<p>"You should not go into the servants’ hall, George," said his
							grandfather.</p>
						<p>"I only went to ask about your black mare, sir," said the little fellow
							"you know you told me yourself that she was lame!"</p>
						<p>There was no resisting this sweet and simple apology.</p>
						<p>"Well, do not interrupt Miss Fairfield, when she is so good as to talk to
							you," said Mr. Merton, smiling significantly at Augustus; for Mrs.
							Merton now appeared to think the conversation as great a bore as making
							tea, and, walking to the further part of the room, she was patting her
							pug dog, and humming a tune at the same time.</p>
						<p>"Those black slaves are, by some cruel masters, obliged to work like
							horses," said I; "but God Almighty created them men, equal with their
							masters, if they had the same advantages, and the same blessings of
							education."</p>
						<p>"But what right have their naughty masters got to make them slave like
							horses? for I’m sure they can’t like it - I shouldn’t like to work like
							mamma’s coach-horses, and stand shivering for hours in the wet and cold,
							as they do."</p>
						<p>"There will be no end of this conversation, if we come to the right and
							the wrong," said I.</p>
						<p>"It is beginning to wear an interesting form, I think," said Mr. Merton.
							"George, we shall have your sentiments on the abolition presently."</p>
						<p>"Miss Fairfield’s rather!" said Mrs. Merton.</p>
						<p>"Mine will, I hope, be immediately understood; the feelings of humanity,
							the principles of my religion, would lead me, as a Christian, I trust,
							to pray for the extermination of this disgraceful traffic, while kindred
							claims (for such I must term them) would likewise impel me to be anxious
							for the emancipation of my more immediate brethren!"</p>
						<p>"Born, as you were, in the West Indies, your father a planter, I should
							have imagined that you would have entertained quite the contrary side of
							the question," said Mrs. Merton, who now thought she had found a subject
							on which to attack me.</p>
						<p>I slightly answered, "you did not know my father, madam!"</p>
						<p>But I could not pursue my story with George; something swelled at my
							throat and I was obliged to leave the room, though little George took my
							promised vindication of Dido upon trust, and running after me said -
							"Miss Fairfield, if you are going to Dido, let me go with you."</p>
						<p>I fear I shall tire you, my friend, by this prolix narration, but I was
							willing to give you a complete surfeit of Mrs. Merton, even though I may
							frequently be under the necessity of repeating the dose.</p>

						<p>HOW many pages have I written without having mentioned the dear
							Honeywoods; but they have not been forgotten; their kindness and
							sympathetic attention will often force the unbidden tear to roll over my
							cheek, when I am retired to my own apartment, and to rumination. Mrs.
							Honeywood promised to write to me, and I impatiently wait for the
							fulfillment of it; - but, alas! my fearfully foreboding heart tells me

						<closer><signed>OLIVIA FAIRFIELD!</signed></closer>
					</div>
					<div type="entry">
						<head type="sub">IN CONTINUATION</head>
						<p>ARE my letters to be constantly filled with sarcastic observations on
							Mrs. Merton? I must speak of what I see, and while she is my exclusive
							female companion, I fear I shall have but too many opportunities of
							noticing the - what shall I call it - give her behaviour a name, dearest
							Mrs. Milbanke - I would not willingly be too harsh; I ought not be so,
							for I suspect that the respectful attention which Augustus pays me, is
							from his witnessing the uniform negligence or insolence of this woman. -
							I mark the deep flush which crimsons his countenance, when a new
							instance of either kind falls under his notice, and the dexterity with
							which he contrives to evince his disapprobation without being personal
							to his sister, and the generous consideration which bids him respect my
							feelings - whilst his even-handed father goes on smoothly, looking to
							the right and the left by turns, now complimenting and now smiling,
							temporizing and glossing over, and never swerving from the rule which he
							has laid down for his conduct. And yet I think, that could I dive to the
							bottom of his complaisant heart, I should discover that I ranked pretty
							high in his favour. I walk with him arm in arm over the beautiful downs
							near this place; a favour which I shrewdly suspect Mrs. Merton never
							conferred upon him; for with regard to the use which she has made of
							them during the few days that I have been here, a casual observer might
							have been led to inquire, whether she had any legs; for she certainly
							seems to derive no manner of assistance from them! - You taught me
							activity, both mental and bodily, my beloved friend; and nothing more
							frequently excited my surprise, and I may add, disgust, than the languid
							affection and supine manners of some of our West Indians; but I never
							saw any one of them who could in the least compare with Mrs. Merton, who
							seems to have attained the very height of inaction. In our walks we are
							sometimes joined by Augustus, and to give you my reason for imputing his
							general conduct to his dislike of Mrs. Merton’s behaviour to me, he is
							then thoughtfully silent, and leaves his father to keep up the ball of
							conversation without interruption on his part. - Ah, my dear madam! my
							heart flutters while I make this observation even to myself - a
							thoughtful, an abstracted companion, to one of my open - my
							communicative turn of mind - no confidence, no reciprocal interchange of
							opinions and sentiments! - What a blank! - what a chasm does existence
							appear, taken in this view! - It is in the mercy of my heavenly Father
							that I look for support through the trials which await me, and how
							thankful am I to my dear Father for implanting, and to you for
							nourishing, in my mind a strong sense of superintending Providence. If I
							was at this moment destitute of religion, I should be the most pitiable
							of human beings; for, indeed, my dearest friend, there are so many
							conflicting emotions in this poor bosom - I am transplanted into a scene
							so perfectly new - Mrs. Merton’s manners are so different from any
							person’s with whom the petted Olivia ever associated - and then, the
							short period which is allotted me by my father’s will, ere I am to
							change my situation - with no friend into whose ear I can pour the
							presaging fears with which, at times, my heart is fraught - the delicacy
							of my situation - the seeming impossibility of my learning the real
							sentiments of Augustus - if, I say, it was not for my firm faith in God,
							how could I support myself? And, amidst every unpleasantry by which I am
							surrounded, it is an inexpressible source of satisfaction, to be in a
							country where the rites of religion are duly and properly performed. Our
							great distance from a place of worship, when at the Fairfield estate,
							was, you know, frequently lamented by us all. In England the "sound of
							the church-going bell" will always reach the ear on the morning of the
							Sabbath, and I trust that your Olivia shall never be unmindful of the
							pious summons.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="entry">
						<head type="sub">IN CONTINUATION</head>
						<p>YOU have frequently remarked, that I walk in a manner peculiar to myself.
							You have termed it majestic and graceful; I have been fearful that it
							carried something of a proud expression: but I believe it is very
							difficult to alter the natural gait, and I am too much above the common
							size, with regard to height, to walk like the generality of my sex.
							There must surely, however, be something very particular in my air; for
							I find I am an object of general curiosity, and many a gentleman follows
							to repass me, and to be mortified at his folly when he has caught a view
							of my mulatto countenance. I laugh at this, and tell Mr. Merton to
							observe them, while he most gallantly, retains all the fine things that
							he hears (or fancies he hears) on my shape and person, and very
							injudiciously has retailed them before his daughter-in-law, whose form
							being any thing but elegant or graceful, you may conceive that the old
							gentleman soon found out that he had been "all in the wrong;"
							especially, when, after hearing a remark of the kind, Mrs. Merton turned
							round with great nonchalance to me, saying, -</p>
						<p>"Pray, Miss Fairfield, did you ever learn to tread the stage?"</p>
						<p>"I am now learning, madam," returned I (but without any pettishness of
							manner, if I know myself), "to tread on the great stage of the world,
							and, I fear, I shall find it very difficult to play my part as I could
							wish."</p>
						<p>"It is the peculiar province of real merit, to be diffident of its
							powers," said Augustus. -</p>
						<p>"Even while its superiority is acknowledged by an admiring multitude,"
							said his father.</p>
						<p>"A tragedy-queen would suit you vastly, I should think," said Mrs.
							Merton, pursing up her lip.</p>
						<p>"I should prefer comedy, both in real and artificial scenes," said I.</p>
						<p>"But you have nothing comic about you," rejoined she.</p>
						<p>‘"Except temper and inclination," said I. "I bless God, that will I had
							the misfortune of losing my dear parent, I was always one of the
							‘laughter-loving crew.’"</p>
						<p>"How mistaken have I been in your character!"</p>
						<p>"So I think," said Augustus, drily.</p>
						<p>I never know when to lay down my pen, when addressing my earliest friend,
							but I must break off, as it is high time to attend to the toilette; for
							tonight I am going to the ball with Mrs. Merton, and Dido is almost out
							of patience with her "Missee."</p>
					</div>
					<div type="entry">
						<head type="sub">IN CONTINUATION</head>
						<p>YOU will expect an account of the first English ball which I have ever
							seen, and I will not tell you that I thought it an unpleasant one, for
							my partner was Augustus Merton. I never saw him so agreeable, so
							animated, or so attentive before; he gave me confidence in myself, his
							gaiety inspired mine, and, I believe, I danced with more than my usual
							spirit. I wore a black sarsnet, made in the mode, of course, and had no
							ornaments but a large string of corals round my neck. I could observe
							that I was an object of pretty general curiosity, as I entered the room.
							In such a place as this, the wealth of the Mertons makes them generally
							known. My colour, you know, renders me remarkable, and, no doubt, the
							Clifton world are well acquainted with the particulars of my father’s
							will, and, seeing me leaning on the arm of Augustus, gave it general
							publicity; for Mrs. Merton, on stepping from the carriage, seized the
							arm of the old gentleman, and I was, consequently, thrown upon the
							protection of his son. But Augustus came forwards with the utmost
							promptitude; and this readiness on his part, gave me resolution to
							acquit myself in as unconstrained a manner as I could have wished. I
							could even listen, with much entertainment, to the remarks which escaped
							him from time to time, and became, in my turn, communicative.</p>
						<p>Surely, my dearest Mrs. Milbanke, it is the fashion to be very affected,
							or very rude: there seems, in the generality of the people that I see
							here, to be no medium between these extremes. Some of the ladies, so
							mincing, so simpering, so lisping, and others so bold, so loud, so
							confident; all the same-facedness of the sex, which was once thought a
							charm by the wisest of men, seems entirely exploded: and the men - also
							believe me - they walked up in pairs, hanging one on another’s arm, and,
							with a stare of effrontery, eyed your Olivia, as if they had been
							admitted purposely to see the untamed savage at a shilling a piece!
							While Augustus, was engaged in conversation at a little distance, I
							heard one of these animals say to another -</p>
						<p>"Come, let’s have a stare at Gusty’s black princess!"</p>
						<p>And with the greatest sand froid they slouched (for it could not be
							called walking) up to me; one of them placed his glass most leisurely to
							his eye, then shrugging his shoulders, as he looked, he said -</p>
						<p>"Pauvre diable! how I pity him! - a hundred thousand wouldn’t be enough
							for the cursed sacrifice! - Allons Alex. Let’s ‘keep moving.’ I’ve had
							enough - no more - I thank you - quite satisfied, ‘pon honour."</p>
						<p>Then, touching the shoulder of Mrs. Merton, he said, -</p>
						<p>"Ah, ma bella Merton, is this you? - What! you sport a native to-night, I
							find."</p>
						<p>"I do, en vérité," said she, smiling, and appearing thoroughly to
							understand his knowing wink.</p>
						<p>"In native elegance unrivalled!" said a gentleman, who stood at his
							elbow, and had, some minutes before, been attentively surveying me.
							"More grace, more expression, more characteristic dignity, I never yet
							beheld in one female figure!"</p>
						<p>Mrs. Milbanke, you will not accuse me of any foolish vanity in retailing
							these hyperbolical compliments on myself.</p>
						<p>"Monkland is ever in the sublime," said my quizzing beau. "Dear Monkland,
							now do fall desperately in love with this sable goddess, and strive to
							wrest the palm of victory from the enviable Augustus Merton!"</p>
						<p>"No," said he, "I love Merton woo well to envy him his happiness; but I
							will get introduced to Miss Fairfield immediately, for I must know if
							she is really what her countenance bespeaks."</p>
						<p>"Exactly, believe me!" said Mrs. Merton.</p>
						<p>Mr. Monkland, however, did not, or would not, hear; he was instantly
							introduced to me by Augustus. - Perhaps I was flattered by having
							overheard his favourable opinion of me; we entered into conversation,
							and I found him a pleasant though an eccentric and visionary being; he
							made sarcastic observations on every body he saw, and seemed to wield
							his talent for satire with no light hand. I was introduced to several
							more of both sees whose names I have forgotten, for summon characters
							passing indiscriminately, leave no impression on the mind or the memory;
							but as I Was standing in the dance; I was somewhat surprised to see Mrs.
							Merton led to the top of it by a gentleman, who footing it off with her
							at the moment when my eyes caught them, so forcible was the contrast,
							that I could scarcely refrain from laughter - Indeed I have a great
							taste for the ridiculous, and here I am likely to have it improved, -
							improved is a bad word for such a taste my dear governess will say, but
							she has been used to see the spontaneous effusions of her pupil’s mind -
							so it shall pass. I have described the person of Mrs. Merton to you
							before, she is certainly not formed with the "light fantastic toe," but
							languishes, or rather glides, down a dance in the most careless and
							indifferent manner you can imagine. Her partner appeared to have nearly
							reached his grand climacteric, yet he had taken wonderful pains in
							trying to put himself back at least thirty years, by powdering and
							pomatuming his grey hairs, making his whiskers as large and as well
							shaped as possible, half closing his light green eyes, to give them an
							insinuating expression, though that expression was lost in the inflamed
							circles which surrounded their orbits; his nice cravat was well stuffed
							round his throat, his clothes were of the most fashionable and jemmy
							make, and the well turned leg was still an object of admiration, as it
							had been through many a revolving season, to its owner! His determined
							activity, his strict attention to the figure of the dance, to the step,
							to his partner; the smile which was always to be seen on his
							countenance, so self-satisfied, so conscious of unimpaired powers of
							attraction, the agility which he evidently laboured to exert, and his
							thin figure, were all in such direct opposition to the little fat formed
							and composed manner of Mrs. Merton, that I carelessly turned round to
							the lady who stood the next couple to me, and said - "Pray, ma’am, can
							you tell me the name of the gentleman now going down the dance?" "He is
							my brother, ma’am, Colonel Singleton" - the flippant answer of the lady
							arrested my attention. - Surely the Colonel and Miss Singleton must have
							been twin children! I never saw such proximity of character and manner
							as in this brother and sister: they must never marry, but grow young
							(for old they can never be) together. Miss Singleton’s labours must be
							as arduous as her brother’s, though her face looks at last, more
							weather-beaten than does the gallant colonel’s. Her natural complexion
							is not far removed from your Olivia’s, and I thought a white satin was a
							bad choice for a robe; and pitied her poor shrivelled and thin neck,
							which, with some of her brother’s wadding, would have looked to more
							advantage, than adorned by her superb necklace of diamonds. Feathers of
							the ostrich were mounted in several directions from her head, while her
							bared ears, and elbows, and back, and bosom, gave to her whole contour,
							so freezing and so forlorn an appearance, while her volatility, and
							frisky and girlish airs, made her person so very conspicuous, that I
							could not help surveying her with the utmost curiosity, as a species of
							animal which had never before fallen under my notice. She was dancing
							with a boy, who aped the man, as much as his partner threw herself back
							into the girl: and the pleased attention with which she listened to all
							he said; the air of maiden consciousness which she adopted, while he
							held her minikin fan and she whispered into the youthful Adonis’s ear;
							the tap which the said fan now gave him on the cheek - oh, Mrs.
							Milbanke, you could not have forgotten a scene so ridiculous! And then
							the captivating colonel holding his ungloved and white hand (so as to
							exhibit a ring of sparkling brilliants) at the side of his face, while
							Mrs. Merton spoke, as if to draw the attention of the company to
							something with which they must not be acquainted, and then holding his
							handkerchief to be perfumed from Mrs. Merton’s otto of roses! - You
							cannot wonder at my thinking of the line in the song, "Sure such a pair
							were never seen!" You will say I am very light-hearted to descant so
							largely on such frivolous subjects - and I should call myself so if I
							were sure that no splenetic feelings aided my pen; but I am disappointed
							in England: I expected to meet with sensible, liberal, well informed and
							rational people, and I have not found them; I see a compound of folly
							and dissimulation - but hold! let me not be harsh or hasty in my
							judgement, a ball-room is not the place to meet with the persons I
							expected, neither must I look for them within the circle of Mrs.
							Merton’s friends. I can see that Augustus has an utter distaste to the
							general frivolity which reigns in these places; I suspect he will prefer
							my plan of a country life and retirement: but nothing has yet been said
							on the subject, and time steals on. Ah, my dearest friend! shall I ever
							more enjoy that placid happiness, that calm tranquility, which
							surrounded me at the Fairfield plantation? Heaven alone can tell - But
							in all situations, in all places, I am still, and ever shall be,</p>

						<head type="sub">IN CONTINUATION</head>

						<p>I HAVE not been able to write; my mind has been in too great a tumult to
							put pen to paper, and the time I usually employed in writing, my ever
							dear friend, has been spent in walking to and fro my apartment, with
							restless step and a perturbed heart!</p>
						<p>The morning after I last wrote, I Received a formal message from my
							uncle, and, according to the summons, attended him in the room, which is
							appropriated to this morning avocations; he rose at my entrance, met me
							at the door, and, with his usual formal politeness, handed my to a seat.
							-</p>
						<p>"Pardon the liberty I have taken, my dear Miss Fairfield, in requesting
							the favour of your company; but I wished to have your approbation with
							regard to settlement, &amp;c. previous to giving my lawyer necessary
							instructions - Augustus refers entirely to us, to make arrangements as
							we think proper!"</p>
						<p>I felt uncomfortably as Mr. Merton spoke - I could not answer him.</p>
						<p>"Your late father’s will," continued -</p>
						<p>I started from my seat - "Full well I know its contents!" cried I - "Oh,
							Mr. Merton, I cannot, I must not refuse your son the fatal interdiction
							of my father! - a vow - an irrevocable vow, forbids me! But, sir, your
							son is not so bound, he has still the exercise of his reason, he is a
							free agent - surely then a fear of hurting my feelings (for I cannot for
							a moment imagine Mr. Augstus Merton to be actuated by mercenary views)
							will not lead him to barter his liberty and his happiness, and to unite
							himself to a woman who is not the object of his affection!"</p>
						<p>I believe I appeared much agitated; and that I expressed myself with
							great warmth and energy!</p>
						<p>Mr. Merton looked in silence for a moment, but with extreme surprise
							evidently depicted on his countenance, and then said, -</p>
						<p>"My dear young lady, if my son is so unfortunate as to be beheld by you
							with disapprobation, I sincerely pity him; but am sure he will readily
							forego all claim to your hand, rather than you should unite yourself
							where you cannot love!"</p>
						<p>Ah, Mrs. Milbnanke! had Mr. Merton understood the language of the looks,
							my emotion at this moment, my burning blushes, would have proclaimed
							another tale! I cast down my eyes to the ground in conscious confusion,
							they dared not meet his, but Mr. Merton proceeded -</p>
						<p>"You may have seen another object prior to your introduction to Augustus,
							who may have gained an interest in your heart, Miss Fairfield - if so, I
							pity my poor boy!"</p>
						<p>"No, indeed, sir, that is not the case!" said I, with eager warmth. -</p>
						<p>"Then my interesting friend," said my uncle, taking my hand, "if it be
							not so, I greatly pity you - a state of nominal dependence (for such I
							trust would be the case if George Merton were your protector) would
							still be a severe trial to one, who has been educated as you have been.
							- Your father’s will was singular, very singular; I make no doubt that
							he acted from consideration: but yet it has always struck me as not
							being the kind of will, which most men in his situation would have made
							- Well, let it pass, we cannot alter it, we must even act by its
							authority; and I repeat my fear, that a state of wardship would he
							rather disagreeable to a lady of your liberal notions?"</p>
						<p>"Servitude, salvery, in its worst form, would be preferable," said I, "to
							finding myself the wife of a man by whom I was not beloved!"</p>
						<p>"My dear niece" -</p>
						<p>"My dear sir, I know what you are going to say - You would say (though
							you might word it in softer terms), how can you expect to be the
							selected object of the affections of Augustus Merton, when he never knew
							you till within a few days? - Ah, sir! I too well know the impossibility
							of the thing to expect it - I am aware of my own person - I know that I
							am little less than a disgusting object to an Englishman - I know that
							your son (supposing for a moment that he could get over his own
							prejudices as to colour) would have to encounter all the sarcastic
							innuendoes and jeering remarks of his companions; it would be said with
							confidence, and with truth, that he had sold himself for money; he would
							feel that he had done so; he would never look at me without seeing the
							witness of the sacrifice. I should be neglected and despised!"</p>
						<p>"My beloved Miss Fairfield, you are voluntarily raising up bugbears to
							disturb your happiness; the chimeras of your own imagination affright
							you, and hurt your piece of mind!"</p>
						<p>"Alas! My dear sir, it is but too true, that every feeling of my soul is
							wounded in my present situation - Oh, my dearest father, my misjudging
							father, you could not foresee the humiliating state in which you placed
							your child! - Suing for the hand of a man, to whom she is an object of
							indifference, if not aversion!"</p>
						<p>"Again let me entreat you to calm your emotions, my dear young lady, and
							to see things in a different point of view."</p>
						<p>"I see them as they are, sir," said I, shaking my head.</p>
						<p>"Not so, believe me, - through a prejudiced medium you now look - I am
							confident that my son admires and esteems you - I am sure that he will
							devote his life to the study of your happiness, and that you will never
							have reason to repent the choice which your good father has made for
							you."</p>
						<p>Ah, dearest friend, esteemed Mrs. Milbanke! how could I say to Mr. Merton
							all with which my full heart was bursting? But if Augustus had
							entertained a common regard, even an esteem, for your Olivia, would he
							have deputed his father to have entered into this conversation, which he
							seems to have avoided with the most scrupulous care? In a few days, am I
							to unite my fate with that of a man, who has never said that it is his
							wish, that it should be so! As well might my fortune only have crossed
							the ocean, the nominal wife might still have remained in Jamaica - And,
							oh that she was still there - oh that Mrs. Milbanke, with kind counsel
							and friendly advice, was yet near her.</p>

					<div type="entry">
						<head type="sub">IN CONTINUATION</head>
						<p>INDEED, my dear madam, I know not what to do; the reserve of Augustus
							increases rather than diminishes, I think, as time moves on - Good
							heavens! my dearest friend, how can I resolve to give him my hand, if he
							still retains this constrained manner? - A depression seems to hang on
							his spirits, melancholy clouds his brow. I think he strives to conceal
							this from his father and from me; but I cannot be blinded: and yet he is
							so interesting, his manners are so gentle, even his look of melancholy
							carries with it to me an air so touching, that I think to sooth his
							sorrows, to meliorate his afflictions, would constitute my
							happiness!</p>
						<p>Do not despise me for my weakness my dear friend - to no other would I
							acknowledge it - and why not? Is it then a crime to love the man who is
							to become my husband? Alas! it is lowering to the pride of my sex to
							love where I am not beloved again.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="entry">
						<head type="sub">IN CONTINUATION</head>
						<p>AUGUSTUS referred to his father all matters of settlement; I referred
							them to him also: so the old gentleman is prime agent in this business.
							I believe he understands these affairs better than the affairs of the
							heart. But I cannot be easy, dearest Mrs. Milbanke; I must come to an
							explanation with Augustus - and he seems to avoid a tête-à-tête with me,
							at least I fancy so.</p>
						<p>Diamonds and pearls have been brought to me for inspection, these are not
							the precious gems I covet; the pearl of my husband’s heart would be
							preferred by me to all the jewels of the east! - Mrs. Merton’s sarcastic
							remarks on the gravity and the absence of Augustus, are made in my
							hearing, and in order to mortify and to wound me; but no remarks of hers
							can now have the power to add to the poignancy of my feelings. - The
							agitation of my mind mocks description - I have no power to retreat -
							and yet to advance with such a cheerless perspective in view - how can I
							have courage?</p>
					</div>
					<div type="entry">
						<head type="sub">IN CONTINUATION</head>
						<p>A WEEK has elapsed since I had last the resolution of addressing my
							beloved friend. At length, then, I have ventured beyond the limits
							usually prescribed to my sex. I have sought an interview with Augustus
							Merton. Indeed, my dearest Mrs. Milbanke, reason seemed to totter on her
							throne, while I imagined myself in danger of becoming the wife of a man,
							to whom I was an object of aversion. But why should I weary you with a
							tedious recapitulation of fears and feelings, which, knowing the
							sanguine temper of your poor girl, you have long ere now imagined?</p>
						<p>I tried to argue myself into something like courage, when I formed the
							desperate resolution of asking to speak to Augustus alone; but it all
							forsook me when he entered the room, and the trembling abashed woman
							stood before him. He saw, and seemed to sympathize in, my confusion; he
							gently took my hand, and, leading me to a seat, placed his own near it,
							and seemed to wait for me to speak, with a respectful, though by no
							means a composed air.</p>
						<p>"Mr. Merton," said I, at length breaking a silence painful to both, "you
							know the respective situations in which we are placed by the will of my
							ever-to-be-regretted parent?"</p>
						<p>He bowed his head in token of assent; a word would have emboldened me,
							but this forbidding silence struck like a damp upon my heart. I had lost
							all command of myself - I rose, and, clasping my hands together in a
							beseeching attitude, I stood before him, saying, -</p>
						<p>"It is not too late for you to recede. Oh, Mr. Merton, think how much
							misery will be spared to us, if you refuse the proffered terms. You have
							the power of doing so. A tame acquiescence to the will of my father,
							will secure to you the enjoyment of his fortune, certainly; but can it
							secure your happiness, if it is to unite you to an object, for whom you
							feel no regard. Do not fear to mortify me by such a rejection; I have
							the common failings of my sex, but I am fully acquainted with the
							numerous disadvantages under whch, as a stranger, and a mulatto West
							Indian, I labour here. The good qualities which I possess (I hope I have
							some, or barren indeed would have been the soil which experienced the
							hand of the skilful labourer for many successive years), - I say the
							good qualities, which I may possess, are not to be discerned in my
							countenance. The very short time, which, by the unfortunate tenour of my
							father’s will, is to elapse before this matter is decided, will preclude
							your coming to a knowledge of my temper and disposition. Indeed, indeed,
							I shall not be offended, I will bless you for saying, that you cannot
							accept my fortune on the terms with which it is offered you, if such
							terms are to be the shipwreck of your happiness!"</p>
						<p>I paused, - Augustus looked earnestly in my face, he heaved a deep
							sigh.</p>
						<p>"You surprise and painfully astonish me, my dearest Miss Fairfield!" said
							he; "is it possible that you can for a moment suppose, that I feel no
							regard for you? Are you so insensible to your own numerous and
							unrivalled virtues and perfections? Heaven is my witness, that I am
							warmly, sincerely interested for your happiness! And that thought of
							your being, for one moment, a dependant on my mercenary brother, and his
							weak and envious wife, would give me the cruellest uneasiness! But as
							this is the alternative to which you reduce yourself, if you are
							resolved on refusing my hand," -</p>
						<p>"I resolve to refuse your hand?" cried I, scarcely knowing what I said,
							"Oh, Mr. Merton how can you - If, indeed" -</p>
						<p>"Ingenuous, interesting Miss Fairfield! it is, at this moment, that I
							feel my utter unworthiness of this precious treasure. -Oh! May you never
							repent your goodness!"</p>
						<p>Well! I have repeated enough of this tête-à-tête. To show, my dear
							friend, that we came to an écclaircissement. And yet I am neither
							satisfied with myself nor with Augustus. I fancy that I must have
							appeared forward, and perhaps, have now obtained from his principles and
							his pity, what he must have ever denied from a stronger feeling. I am
							again at my old stumbling-block you will say; and I begin to suspect,
							that these womanish fears will be the very bane of my happiness!</p>
						<p>I have, at last, received a letter from Mrs. Honeywood: it is written,
							like herself; - but, alas! it contains sad accounts of her health,
							though the spirit of piety and resignation which pervades it, would
							leave me nothing to regret in her being removed from this painful world,
							except the loss of her friendship to myself, and the overthrow of her
							son’s happiness, for his mother is the acting impulse of his life. Her
							physicians have ordered her from London to the sea; a "forlorn hope,"
							she terms it; and thus I shall lose the chance of ever meeting her
							again. I had agreed to Mr. Merton’s proposition of going to London on ym
							marriage the more readily, as I had hoped to behold this dear friend
							once more. But it is not to be. The fleet sails to-morrow; I must,
							therefore, make up my large packet.</p>

						<opener><salute>My dear Mrs. Milbanke,</salute></opener>
						<p>THE hasty lines which I wrote you on the morning that I quitted Clifton,
							and which you received with my packet, will ere this have informed you,
							that your Olivia had become the wife of her cousin! In that moment of
							confusion, I had no time for particularly, and the hurry and bustle
							which has ensued, has scarcely afforded me leisure for an hour of calm
							reflection. Yet, believe me, my beloved friend, I am happy; and the
							attention and indulgence of my husband exceeds my highest expectations.
							- And yet, I had formed high expectations of the character of Augustus
							Merton (Fairfield he is now become). If i can be instrumental to his
							happiness, I shall have reason to bless my father for my happy lot.</p>
						<p>"And why that if, Olivia?" methinks I hear you inquire.</p>
						<p>Ah, madam! I doubt myself; I doubt my own abilities; I sometimes fear, -
							I think, - I fancy a thousand things, when I hear the deep sigh of my
							Augstus, when, I observe the pensive cast of his features. You will
							laugh at me, - you will, perhaps, do more - you will chide me for giving
							way to these fears, which now I know to be foolish, if not criminal. But
							what will you say of your Olivia, your pupil, when you hear that she is
							become the victim of superstition also, of nameless terrors, of - alas!
							she knows now what; - but she has been used to recount all her
							weaknesses to her friend, and she shall have the recital!</p>
						<p>It was settled by Mr. Merton, that our nuptials were to take place at
							Clifton, and that from the church door, we were to set off for London.
							The old gentleman stood in the place of my father; Mrs. Merton did not
							particularly wish to be my attendant, and her presence could give me
							neither confidence nor comfort; so at breakfast I took leave of her, and
							she promised to follow us to town, with Mr. Merton and the retinue, in
							less than a week.</p>
						<p>A neat and new post-chaise drove me to the church door, accompanied by my
							uncle; Augustus was there in readiness to hand me out. The morning had
							been fine, but as I entered the church, I felt the most sultry and
							overpowering heat that I ever experienced. The clergyman was ready, - we
							approached the altar! I leant on the arm of Mr. Merton, but I felt
							resolute and collected. I was obeying the will of my father. I was
							acting in consonance with the impulse of my own heart. I believed the
							man to whom I was about to be united was worthy of my fondest regard,
							and I secretly besought the blessing of Heaven!</p>
						<p>The ceremony began. I did not cast my eyes towards Augustus, till the
							priest was in the act of joining our hands, and had put to us the
							questions, and we had repeated the answers after him. - At the moment
							when I felt the hand of Augstus, a flash of vivid lightning came from
							the window over the altar; it was followed by a loud and tremendous peal
							of thunder. A cold sweat seemed to moisten the hand of Augustus, - it
							trembled in mine. I looked towards him, an icy paleness overspread his
							features - he leaned against the rails of the altar - his brow was
							rumpled - his hair stood erect! - a deep sigh issued from his bosom! -
							Yes, my friend it is too true, - for it pierced into the inmost recesses
							of the heart of his wife! The irrevocable vow was, indeed, passed; it
							seemed, as if the Almighty had condescended to ratify it, - it seemed -
							a thousand superstitious fears stole over my soul! Augustus’s disorder
							had infected me, and it was some time ere I could recover my former tone
							of mind. The remembrance will never be erased from it, - it was
							something so awful, so singular. - Oh, Mrs. Milbanke, how
							terror-stricken must I then have stood, if I had borne about with me the
							weight of any unacknowledged crime, at the moment when I had united my
							fate with that of my unsuspecting husband!</p>
						<p>But, I will turn over a new leaf and get to a new subject; for, if this
							be half as frightful to you as it has been to me, you will long since
							have wished me to drop it.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="entry">
						<head type="sub">IN CONTINUATION</head>
						<p>I HAVE been rattled over this vast metropolis, and have seen sights and
							spectacles without number. There is something very striking in this
							wondrous pile of novelty. I have partaken of every species of amusement
							with much satisfaction; for i have been accompanied by Augustus, and his
							kindness and indulgence, in showing "this native" (as Mrs. Merton would
							say) all the places and the curiosities, which he has so often been
							fatigued with, has given me a pretty good idea of his patience, while
							his readiness in answering all the questions of my inquisitive mind, has
							exhibited manifest proofs of his good-nature. So you find, I have had a
							"double debt to pay;" and whilst visiting the London lions, I have been
							finding out the amiable qualities of my husband!</p>
						<p>Mr. Merton’s house, in which we are at present inmates, is fitted up in a
							style which proves the wealth of its owner. He is fond of showing off
							his own consequence; and the credit and high reputation of the London
							merchant, is his never-ending theme, - and a theme which cannot weary,
							while I behold, as I do in this city, their boundless liberality in
							providing for the distresses of their necessitous fellow-citizens!</p>
						<p>Oh, Mrs. Milbanke, England is, sure, the favoured isle, where benevolence
							has taken up her abode! Here she dwells, here she smiles, while, toward
							my native island, she turns her "far surveying," her compassionate eye.
							She descries the sufferings of the poor negro, and promises benign
							assistance. - Yes! the cause of Afric’s injured sons is heard in
							England; and soon shall the slave be free!</p>
						<p>But think not that my visits have been wholly confined to places of
							public amusement and diversion; I have visited places of public worship
							also. I have been delighted and instructed, while hearing the words of
							inspiration explained by the lips of eloquence, combined with great
							ability and piety. And I have seen Westminster Abbey, with that
							enthusiastic awe which must ever strike a feeling mind on beholding this
							vast mausoleum of valour, genius, and worth! - While I read the
							inscriptions of heroes, and the epitaphs of poets, I could not help
							explaining, "Oh transitory state of human things!" I could not help
							reflecting on the nothingness of those, who were once the greatest on
							the earth. But, as the benefit of example is undisputed, it is right
							that their memories should be preserved by something more lasting than
							the evanescent praise of others, which is frequently carried on the
							fleeting breath of popular applause. Posthumous honour is coveted by
							all, and yet there cannot be a more uncertain distinction; we see it
							frequently refused to those, who, during their lives, were overwhelmed
							with praise. The son of genius and misfortune perishes unnoticed and
							unhonoured; his remains moulder at the side of one whom idleness and
							illiberality alone distinguished in life, but whose rich coffers, have,
							at his death, purchased for him the name of every virtue, which,
							surrounded by trophies of fame, are engraven on a monumental inscription
							of brass! How, then, can we covet these uncertain and indiscriminating
							distinctions?</p>
						<p>Mr. George Merton is just what I had depicted him; fond of his own
							consequence, and anxious to increase it, by any unwearied application to
							the business of getting money; yet partial to the indulgences of the
							table, and tenacious of his opinion. There appears none of that sympathy
							of disposition and sentiment between him and his wife which we look for
							in the connubial state. He seems gratified at beholding her pretty face,
							set off by every expensive adornment, at the head of his sumptuous
							entertainments, dispensing the luxuries of the feast to their various
							guess; and she seems perfectly indifferent who is at the bottom of the
							table, provided it is filled with a large party. Her fondness for the
							admiration and the attention fo the other sex, is very apparent; and she
							is weak enough to be flattered with the silly compliments of the vainest
							and most shallow coxcombs. There is no reciprocity between the two
							brothers; they are coolly polite towards each other: but the confidence,
							which is usually and naturally induced from their relative affinity, is,
							from a total disparity of character, entirely done away.</p>
						<p>My Augustus is, I can perceive, by no means fond of a London life; it is
							not at all consonant to my taste; and the sooner we can leave it, the
							better I shall be pleased. Perhaps the people have tainted my opinion of
							the place, for I am fatigued by the formal stiffness of Mr. Merton; I am
							sick of the affectation and vanity of Mrs. Merton, and disgusted at her
							selfish and mercenary husband. I long to be free from the restraints,
							and the dissimulation, which the common rules of good breeding impose in
							my behaviour towards them. My mind seems hampered, and I think I shall
							breathe more freely in the pure air, and amongst the sylvan scenes of
							the country. The plodding track of cent. per cent. and addition on
							addition, never suited the taste of Augustus; and, leaving his brother
							to accumulate thousands upon thousands, he is content to live on the
							fortune which my father’s will bequeathed to him with his wife. The wise
							father, and the plodding brother, may laugh, but they cannot persuade
							him, that a "man’s life consisteth in the abundance of the things which
							hs posesseth," when the Word of God, and his own heart, both teach him
							the contrary.</p>
						<p>Yet, though I talk with pleased anticipation of the country, mistake me
							not, dearest Mrs. mIlbanke; I by no means wish for perfect seclusion. I
							am not so vain as to imagine, that my society could form the exclusive
							happiness of my husband. No! I would fly as far from the extreme of
							solitude on the one hand, as from unrestrained dissipation on the other.
							Dissipation enervates the mind; it unfits it for every rational and
							domestic enjoyment; it deadens the feelings; in the vortex of pleasure,
							the heart is often corrupted, and the principles are sacrificed: - many
							very amiable characters have been ruined by the prevalence of
							fashionable example, the fear of being thought singular, and the dread
							of ridicule. "Who is sufficient for these things?" not your doubting
							Olivia! and, therefore she would</p>

							cherished; the manners lose their polish; the warm affections of the
							heart no longer expand in a full tide of benevolence, but return to
							their source, and freeze before the "genial current" of social
							intercourse.</p>
						<p>I have got a fine Utopian scheme of domestic happiness in my head, and
							the country must be the birth-place of it. The conversation of my
							husband, a contemplation of the beauties of nature, the society of
							rational and well-informed friends; books, music, drawing; the power of
							being useful to my fellow creatures, - to my poorer neighbours; - the
							exercise of religious duties,- and the grateful heart, pouring out its

									<p>You will laugh at me, and well you might, had I no other

									<p><quote>"Hell has no fury like a woman scorn’d;"</quote>
</p>
									<p>And that the thought of revenge, glorious revenge, can give a

										her eyes are, I believe, good, but black eyes are, in my
										opinion, so frightful; - her teeth, they say, are white, but
										any teeth would look white, I believe, when contrasted by
										such a skin! As to her manners, they are abominably
										disgusting; she is full of sentiment, and religion, and all
										that - and talks and expatiates, and is so firm and so
										decided - at the same moment that she would have it appear
										she she is all feeling and tenderness - such a compound! She
										has read a good deal I fancy; these bookish ladies are
										insufferable bores! But, daddy Merton is all upon the
										complimentary order with her, and has made sixty thousand
										bows for her sixty thousand pounds! - I do not think I could
										hold out the probationary month if I dissembled; but by
										showing how much I am disgusted with Miss Blacky, I draw out
										sensitive Augustus, and put him on his metal; as I slight,
										he is doubly diligent - he will marry her to rescue her from
										the "tyrannic fangs" of Mrs. George Merton! And I will -
										what will I not do? I have now raised your curiosity I know,

									<p>UNWILLING as I was to accompany my father to this place, and
										averse in bestowing any portion of my thoughts towards that
										clause in my uncle’s will which referred to myself, I yet at
										this moment behold things in a very different light; and

										interested for Olivia Fairfield, than I ever thought again
										to have been for any human being.</p>

									<p><quote>"’Tis not a set of features or complexion,<lb/> The
										tincture of a skin, that I admire."</quote></p>

									<p>No, my friend, it is not; for I will confess to you, that the
										moment when my eyes were first cast on the person of my
										cousin, I started back with a momentary feeling nearly
										allied to disgust; for I beheld a skin approaching to the
										hue of a negro’s, in the woman whom my father introduced to
										me as my intended wife! I that had been used to contemplate
										a countenance, and a transparent skin of ivory, were
										Suckling’s expression of "even her body thought" might have
										aptly originated. I that - ah! why pursue the reflection? -
										that such things were, I too well know; else why this weight
										of sorrow which has so long oppressed my weary frame? A very
										few hours served to convince me, that whatever might have
										been the transient impression made by the colour of Olivia,
										her mind and form were cast in no common mould. She has a
										noble and a dignified soul, which speaks in her words and
										actions; her person is raised above the standard of her sex,
										as much as her understanding and capacity. In her energy,
										her strength of expression, in the animation of her
										brilliantly black eye, there is something peculiarly
										interesting. At one moment, I feel for her situation and
										pity her, - a stranger in a strange country, where she is
										more likely to receive contumely than consideration; at the
										next, I see in her a superior being; and again I behold the
										child of humanity, the citizen of the world, with a heart
										teeming with benevolence and mercy towards every living
										creature! - She is accomplished and elegant; but her
										accomplishments are not the superficial acquirements of the
										day, - they are the result of application and genius in
										unison; her elegance is not the studied attitude of a modern
										belle, but the spontaneous emotion of a graceful mind: while
										in her conversation there is combined, with sound judgement
										and reflection, a naïf simplicity, and a characteristic turn
										of expression, which at once pleases and entrances the
										observer. The decision and promptitude with which she
										delivers her opinions, though accompanied by an air of
										modest timidity, prove that she has a spirit which will
										never suffer her to yield her principles or her sentiments,
										where her conscience tells her she is right: and that,
										though trampled upon, she will yet retain her native dignity
										of character!</p>
									<p>You will think me raving, my friend; and so I am nearly, when
										I think that it is I alone who must rescue her from a state
										of miserable dependence. It is on me that her future
										happiness depends: on me, who, like a shipwrecked mariner,
										have seen my heart’s only treasure snatched from my longing
										arms, and am become a bankrupt in all I coveted on earth! -
										In what a cruel predicament am I placed by my uncle’s will -
										yet can I refuse Olivia, and see her eating the bitter bread
										of sorrow and dependence under my brother and his wife. -Oh,
										Monkland! I have seen the "Tender mercies" of this woman! I
										have seen her cruel, her unfeeling treatment of a meek and
										unoffending angel! I know her equal to any species of
										tyranny, to any plot of low malice and contrivance: she is
										envious of all virtue and merit, because she possesses
										neither herself! - She has no heart, no mind! And shall the
										only child of my mother’s brother, shall the polished, the
										amiable Olivia Fairfield be reduced to such a situation? -
										Better had she perished on the ocean, better had the
										tempestuous billows overwhelmed her, ere she set her foot on
										this inhospitable shore! Yet, what have I to offer her? Will
										a widowed heart, blighted hopes, and settled melancholy,
										will these be fit offerings for the rich prize of her
										affections and her love? Can I with these hope to secure her
										happiness?</p>
									<p>How if I was to disclose to her the state of my heart - how
										if I was to divulge to her that secret which is known alone
										to you and to the grave? - I know the result of such a
										disclosure, - the generous Olivia would scorn to receive
										from my compassion what I could not grant from my love; her
										soul is too noble to bestow a thought upon selfish
										considerations, and she would not hesitate in preferring a
										dependence upon my brother, to laying an embargo on my
										principles, in which she would fancy my heart and no share.
										Yet, Heaven is my witness, inasmuch as I trust I am a lover
										of goodness and virtue, my heart, my soul is interested for
										this charming maid! My heart does not beat with the rapture
										of passion, - my soul is not overcome by soft emotions at
										her approach as heretofore. - Again am I giving way to
										useless retrospections. In hearing Miss Fairfield, in
										witnessing the chaste dignity of her manners, and the action
										which characterizes and enforces her expressions, I receive
										undissembled satisfaction; but sensible of our peculiar
										situation, whilst I could hang on every word she utters in
										company, and in her absence delight to recall them to my
										memory with the appropriate expression by which they were
										accompanied; yet, strange as it may appear, I fly from a
										tête-à-tête overcome by a weak fear almost unaccountable to
										myself. How can I assail her with professions of love,
										whilst conscious that my heart can never more feel that
										passion? How can I ask her to acknowledge herself interested
										for me, when I know that the silent tomb covers all for
										which I would have lived? and yet, how can I meet my wife,
										my affianced wife, and not enter into such conversation? My
										friend, you will pity me - to you, and to you alone, are my
										struggles and my sorrows known; with you I shall be
										acquitted of mercenary views, even though I should become
										the husband of Olivia - you will know that the same spirit,
										which once taught me to refuse a wealthy bride and to oppose
										my father’s direct command, would have supported me in this
										instance also, if a stronger motive had not influenced me on
										the other side. - Farewel! Whatever may be my fate, to you I
										shall always lay open my heart, conscious of your friendship

						<head type="sub">PACKET THE THIRD OLIVIA FAIRFIELD TO MRS. MILBANKE</head>
						<div type="entry">
							<opener><dateline><placeName>New Park, Devonshire.</placeName></dateline></opener>

							<p>AS I heard of no ship sailing for Jamaica, I have let my pen lie idle
								on my standwish, my dearest madam, for the last three weeks, whilst
								I have been arranging my household, and making myself quite at home.
								In this, as in every thing, mr. Fairfield has acted with the
								greatest indulgence. Your Olivia has only to breathe a wish, and it
								is accomplished; so that, in fact, I have nothing left to wish
								for.</p>
							<p>This house is situated in a romantic part of Devonshire, near a bold
								and noble shore; the hills and dales are beautifully picturesque,
								and the diversity of wood, and lawn, and down, is very striking. It
								is a highly cultivated country, and a populous neighbourhood; and
								while the little town of ****, about three miles distant, supplies
								our table with excellent fish, it promises also to supply us with
								society from its summer visitants; as I understand it is a place of
								genteel resort in the season. The house is not too large to be
								comfortable; it is calculated for sociability, more than for show
								and gives you an idea of a contended habitation, which some of the
								lofty villas of Nabobs, in the neighbourhood, cannot impress on the
								mind with all their grandeur.</p>
							<p>Dido is delighted; it is like the "dear Fairfield estate," and she
								has entered into all the mysteries of housekeeping, and bears about
								the insignia of her office, in the bunch of keys at her side, and
								the important expression of her face. Already she has made
								acquaintances with some of the peasants in the vicinity, and she
								bids fair to rival her mistress in the favour of the little rustics.
								Never did a warmer heart glow in a human bosom, than in that of this
								faithful creature; She considers herself as the sister of the whole
								human race, and loves them with a relative affection.</p>
							<p>And yet, I have seen none of my visiting neighbours, expect the
								clergyman of the parish; I both saw and heard him at church: and if
								I may form an opinion of the man, from his discourse and delivery in
								the pulpit, I promise myself profit and pleasure from his
								acquaintance; his subject was well chosen, and well handled, - his
								manner was devout and impressive!</p>
						</div>
						<div type="entry">
							<head type="sub">IN CONTINUATION</head>
							<p>MR. FAIRFIELD seems to enjoy himself in the country, as much as your
								Olivia; never did I witness a more sensible alteration, than that
								which took place in him, when we had fairly turned our backs upon
								London. The insipid routine of a town life, where a man has no
								regular avocation, and is too far plunged into the ceremonials of
								the world to spend his time as he chooses, must surely be very
								irksome. Fairfield is of a contemplative and studious disposition;
								he has too much refinement and Christian benevolence in his
								composition to make, what is termed, a country ’squire; but he has
								sentiment, and a taste for the beauties of nature, to render him a
								rural though not a modern philosopher.</p>
							<p>I was reading a paper this morning in one of your excellent
								periodical works, viz. The Tatler, when the following paragraph
								struck me as being applicable to my Augustus, that I will not
								apologize to you for transcribing it: -</p>
							<p><quote>"With great respect to country sports, I may say, this
									gentleman could pass his time agreeably, if there were not a
									hare, or a fox, in his country. That calm and elegant
									satisfaction, which the vulgar call melancholy, is the true
									proper delight of men of knowledge and virtue. What we take for
									diversion, which is a kind of forgetting ourselves, is but a
									mean way of entertainment, in comparison of that, which is
									considering, knowing, and enjoying ourselves. The pleasures of
									ordinary people are in their passions; but the seat of this
									delight is in the reason and understanding. Such a frame of mind
									raises that sweet enthusiasm, which warms the imagination of the
									sight of every work of nature, and turns all round you into
									picture and landscape." - Tatler, No. 89.</quote></p>
							<p>Mr. Fairfield has patience with me in all my wild strolls, and sees a
								beautiful view of the sea, a disjointed rock, or a lofty tree, with
								an enthusiasm which equals mine. He is also interested and
								entertained with the simple and untutored urchins of the cottages;
								and I daily perceive, with renewed delight, that our sentiments, our
								opinions, and our principles coalesce. I am thankful to Heaven, for
								my happy, thrice happy lot; and humbly pray, that my Augustus’s
								happiness may be as perfect as my own. I sometimes fancy that there
								has been a time, when his spirits and his gaiety must have been
								greater than they are at present; for I observe, the bright flashes
								of pleasantry, the sudden corruscations of his wif, the
								"scintillations of a playful mind," while they sometimes gild his
								conversation, with a ray, bright and dazzling as meridian day, are
								instantaneously obscured, as if by a sudden recollection; and an
								uncontrollable feeling of sorrow imperiously absorbs every trait of
								hilarity. But these transitions are unfrequent, though, in general,
								the even tenour of his demeanor exhibits more the temper of patient
								resignation, than of undissembled happiness.</p>
							<p>You will smile at my nice definitions; but be assured, that whilst he
								is as worthy of the best affections of my heart, as he is at
								present, I will not quarrel with my husband, because his cup of
								felicity does not overflow. Nay, such is the interest that he now
								excites in my bosom from imagining him to have felt the shaft of
								undeserved misfortune, that I am sure I love him the better for it.
								And if I have a wish ungratified, it is the possession of his entire
								confidence, not for the gratification of a low and unworthy feminine
								curiosity; but that I might offer him all the consolation and
								comfort in my power.</p>
							<p>Adieu, for the present, my dearest madam! - to you, without reserve,
								I unfold all the feelings of my heart; I cannot blush to acknowledge
								its soft emotions; when awakened by so deserving an object. I can
								never forget, that when addressing you, I am writing to my most
								valued and tried friend!</p>

							<p>LAST week was devoted almost exclusively to the receiving and paying
								of visits; I am not sorry that I now find myself a little more my
								own mistress; perhaps I shall discover many of my neighbours to be
								very estimable characters on a further acquaintance; but a
								succession of visitors, where all are equally strangers and the
								mistress of the house is expected to find conversation, and to make
								herself agreeable, where too (as in my case) she knows that she is
								viewed with no common curiosity, is not only fatiguing, but awkward.
								Augustus endeavoured to ease me of the burden, however, and
								succeeded in no small degree. He has wonderful facility in general
								conversation, and can adapt himself to the capacities and tastes of
								any, whom he condescends to entertain, except they should be of that
								class, which we used to call, the genteel vulgar, meaning those
								important shallow-pated beings, who have but one recommendation,
								viz. money! - We saw enough of these in the West Indies, where
								riches are speedily amassed, - and that disgraceful traffic, which
								hardens the heart, and deadens the feelings, while it fills the
								purse, was eagerly prosecuted by such characters!</p>
							<p>But I digress from my subject, and should not find an excuse for such
								a desultory way of writing as I have fallen into of late, with any
								other than my own Mrs. Milbanke! I must not indulge in caricaturing;
								and yet you will, perhaps, think I am doing so, if I merely describe
								things as they appear to me. Is it, that I see through a magnifying
								glass to discover defects? - Heaven preserve me from such an
								unchristian-like vision!</p>
							<p>Within two miles of us, situated on a fine eminence, which overhangs
								the sea, and overlooks the beautiful little bay of ****, stands the
								Pagoda, the newly-raised edifice of Sir Marmaduke Ingot. Every order
								of architecture has been blended in this structure; and Augustus not
								unaptly remarked the other morning as we viewed it at a little
								distance, that it wanted but the bells which usually decorate the
								Chinese buildings, from whence its name is derived, to obtain
								another which would be as appropriate, viz. the temple of folly! The
								eastern nabob seemed to have harnessed his fleetest Arabian coursers
								to his chariot, when he came to pay his comp;liments to us; he
								really cut an appearance quite magnifique, as his gay equipage and
								dashy attendants drove through the park; - we knew there could be
								only one family so dazzling in this neighbourhood, and were
								therefore prepared for the guests, who made their entrée.</p>
							<p>My lady is a masculine woman; very hard-favoured, and of a forbidding
								countenance; her voice is nervous (I do not mean nervously weak, but
								nervously strong), her utterance clear, and her conversation vastly
								above the common level of her sex; so much so, that I understand she
								is the general terror of the females in the vicinity, as she usually
								engrosses a great portion of the conversation, and will make herself
								heard, if not understood. But Sir Marmaduke, having acquired a very
								considerable fortune at Bengal, and liking to keep a hospitable and
								showy table, and to have his house filled with company; of course
								Lady Ingot gets a few attentive hearers of both sexes; and the good
								dinners, the turtle, and the curries at the Pagoda, obtain for her
								ladyship general sufferance, if not general favour. It was a very
								sultry morning, but Lady Ingot was wrapped in a most superb oriental
								shaw, while a fine lace veil descended almost to the ground, in some
								measure softening the asperity of her features by its partial shade.
								Sir Marmaduke’s countenance is neither interesting nor disgusting;
								his cheeks are distended by a perpetual smile, and the powder on his
								head, seems to be laid on with no sparing hand, to cover the
								depredations of time. Mr. Ingot, a youth of about fifteen years of
								age, entered with his parents; he also was wrapped in a shawl, and
								his delicate fingers were warmed in a muff of the finest ermine,
								almost as large as himself (for he is very effeminate and diminutive
								in his person). His head was adorned by a hat, turned up before,
								with a gold button and loop, and ornamented by a plume of feathers;
								he is really a pretty looking stripling, if he was not made so mere
								a monkey of, and dressed in such a non-descript manner.</p>
							<p>After the first compliments, her ladyship began, and, with facility
								of expression, and great choice of words, felicitated herself on the
								pleasure she anticipated in my acquaintance; assured me, that she
								very rarely met with any thing like polished or cultivate society in
								the uncivilized part of the world, in which Sir Marmaduke had fixed
								the Pagoda. The situation had some advantages, - that of air, for
								instance, which she allowed might be salubrious to those whose
								corporeal frames were formed to come in contact with it. - "But, my
								dear exotic," continued she, "my tender sensitive sapling Frederic,
								is nearly annihilated by its keenness. I assure you, Mrs. Fairfield,
								it requires all my maternal vigilance and precaution to guard him
								from the eastern blast, which beats against us!"</p>
							<p>"And yet, ma’am, the young gentleman looks well."</p>
							<p>"Hectic, mere hectic! pull off your shawl, and lay down your muff, my
								love, - recline a little on the sofa; Mrs. Fairfield will have the
								goodness to excuse you."</p>
							<p>I bowed acquiescence, and her ladyship proceeded: -</p>
							<p>"Again I must repeat the pleasing anticipations in which I fondly
								indulge myself, Mrs. Fairfield, on forming a confidential
								intercourse with you. - Alas! I have wofully felt myself thrown out
								of my level in this abstracted country."</p>
							<p>"The country is a hilly one, assuredly, Lady Ingot," said Sir
								Marmaduke, who heard only what she had last said, and answered
								literally; and then resume a conversation into which he had drawn
								Augustus, respecting a project which he had in contemplation of
								turning the turnpike road to put it to a greater distance from the
								Pagoda, as the mail-coach can now be seen as it passes, from the
								salle à manger windows; and some days, the guard’s horn can be
								distinctly heard, when the wind is in the south.</p>
							<p>"We have but few southern breezes, have we, mamma?" said Mr. Ingot,
								lisping, as he lay recumbent.</p>
							<p>"I mean to get an act of Parliament," said Sir Marmaduke, "if I
								cannot do it any other way. In India we manage matters more
								concisely; for there, we men in power have the law vested in our
								hands."</p>
							<p>"A summary mode of proceeding, if justice be faithfully and
								impartially administered, has its advantages no doubt," answered
								Augustus; "but in the case you are mentioning, I should imagine you
								will easily gain the consent of Parliament, Sir Marmaduke, as I
								conclude that it can be easily proved, that the alteration in
								question will be a convenience to you, without inconveniencing the
								public."</p>
							<p>"Oh, not a jot, sir," replied the knight; "the objections that are
								started, are merely childish, and I can easily discern from whence
								they originate: - the opposing and unsuccessful candidate for the
								borough of ***** as he could not oust me out of my seat in
								Parliament, thinks proper to exert all his interest, to get a
								protest against me. But let him try his utmost, I shall not mind a
								few more thousands in this contest!"</p>
							<p>"What may be his plea?" said Augustus.</p>
							<p>"Oh, that by turning the road, I shall make it two miles further for
								the mail-coach, and more on the ascent; and that the post master at
								***, will be obliged to sit up half an hour later, and burn half an
								inch more of his farthing rushlight!"</p>
							<p>"Upon my honour, papa, you make me quite laugh," drawled out, Mr.
								Ingot, - "talking of the half-inch of candle!"</p>
							<p>"This is an inconvenience to the public, surely," said Augustus.</p>
							<p>"By no means, sir, - by no means, my good sir," said Sir Marmaduke,
								with warmth. "All the innkeepers, from *** to **** are to a man on
								my side; and you will acknowledge them to be part of the public, -
								for are they not publicans?"</p>
							<p>"Sir Marmaduke, how often have I told you that I cannot bear a pun,"
								said Lady Ingot.</p>
							<p>"You told him so the last time he said it, ma’am," cried young
								Hopeful.</p>
							<p>"I will allow them to be a part of the public, certainly," said
								Augustus, "but I fear a very interested part; and that it is their
								interest to be paid for two more miles in a stage is obvious."</p>
							<p>The knight’s answer escaped me, -not so his reddened countenance.
								Lady Ingot seemed to think her husband did not shine; and therefore
								she called off my attention to herself.</p>
							<p>"Believe me, Mrs. Fairfield, there is scarcely a female besides
								yourself in this neighbourhood, who has ever set her foot out of
								England. Conceive what narrow minded, prejudiced beings they must
								be? Not an idea but what was planted in them at their births and has
								been handed down by mothers and grandmothers, and
								great-grandmothers, through countless generations!"</p>
							<p>"It proves," said I, "that those ideas are worthy retaining? and I
								confess, I think our mothers and grandmothers were sensible beings.
								I rather learn towards old customs, and old notions, and can trace
								one of my ideas as bar back as the Old Testament, where a lady of
								some note, being asked, whether she would be spoken of to the king
								or the captain of the boat, answered, with true feminine modesty -
								‘I dwell amongst my own people!’ It has always struck me as a most
								beautiful reply. Retirement seems the peculiar and appropriate
								situation of our sex; and, the enlargement of the mind, and the
								conquest of prejudice, is not always achieved, perhaps, by visiting
								foreign climes!"</p>
							<p>"You speak like a perfect English woman," said Lady Ingot; "I see you
								have already imbibed our air."</p>
							<p>"I thank your ladyship for the compliment," said I: "I do not
								consider myself as more than half an English woman, and, it has
								always been my ardent wish to prove myself worthy of the title!"</p>
							<p>"Oh, you interesting enthusiast!" said Lady Ingot; "with that action,
								that expression of countenance, so perfectly extraneous, and talking
								of belonging to this yea nay clime, where the plants indigienous to
								the soil, almost to a woman, sit with her hands before them, bolt
								upright and neither verging to the right not to the left, -look as
								if they had creaked necks, and cramped joints."</p>
							<p>"I have remarked a very different deportment," said I, "and seem to
								have hitherto seen only those who diverge to the contrary extreme, -
								neither stiffened joints, nor limbs have prevented them from
								reclining and lounging with an air of ease, which I thought quite
								‘the rage.’"</p>
							<p>"Oh! there are some who have imitated us East Indians," said Lady
								Ingot, wrapping her shawl round her coarse limbs, in the style of
								drapery, and gradually inclining more towards the back of the chair
								on which she sat, - "we have had an opportunity of seeing the
								graceful languishment of Circassian loveliness, unrivalled for
								voluptuous and attractive elegance; and these degenerate imitators
								of that luxurious ease, which they have never felt, are the greatest
								treat to us, who see the distorted barbarism of the likeness!"</p>
							<p>My dear Mrs. Milbanke, you have had a long specimen of the Ingots
								during their first visit. You have gained by it (if no
								entertainment) a perfect insight into their characters; therefore, I
								will not tell you what I think of them.</p>
							<p>Augustus calls me to the evening walk. Adieu.</p>

							<p>MRS. HONEYWOOD is no more! - I have just read the account of her
								death in the papers. I was preparing to write you a long letter, -
								but, alas! I cannot. I have been recalling to my grateful memory the
								numberless proofs of kindness, and of maternal consideration, which
								I received from this regretted friend during our long voyage. She
								was an excellent woman, and prepared for death. But was her son
								prepared to lose her? - Poor Honeywood! my heart bleeds for him. I
								know the acuteness of his present feelings, for I witnessed the
								strength of his affection; and I could only compare it to that which
								I felt for my father: but I received the benign consolations of my
								beloved Mrs. Milbanke!</p>
							<p>Augustus saw my emotion, at reading the death of this worthy woman, -
								he kissed off the tear from my cheek, and lamented, that he did not
								know the address of Honeywood: - "For did I," said he, "I would
								avail myself of the title of your husband, and invite him to a
								dwelling, where he would find comfort personified in my Olivia?"</p>
							<p>I pressed his hand with grateful emotion.</p>

							<p>THE long list of our daily-increasing acquaintance must be omitted;
								the characters will develop themselves, as many of them came
								forwards at a grand dinner of the nabob knight’s, which we partook
								of yesterday; we wish to be on good terms with all our neighbours;
								and Augustus or myself have no partiality for what is called a
								feast, yet, being long-invited guests (or rather, I believe, this
								said feast being prepared on our account), we went. I need not
								describe my dress, you know I have one plain unornamented style.
								Augustus approves it, and of course I do not depart from it; but
								Dido bids me "be sure tell Mrs. Milbanke that I wore my new diamonds
								in my hair, which looked very pretty and charming." Oriental
								magnificence was in full blaze at the Pagoda. Except not a
								description of its splendour from the poor pen of your Olivia; she
								must refer you to fabled palaces of the genii, and to the gay
								castles of fairy princes, and other eastern knights. The party was a
								large one. Colonel and Miss Singleton were the only persons, except
								the inhabitants of the mansion, whose faces I recognized in the
								group; and with the most gallant air on the part of the colonel, and
								the most girlish vivacity on that of his sister, they both ran,
								rather than walked, up to pay their compliments. At the same moment
								that the hand of Augustus was seized by a lady, who, fixing her bold
								dark eyes full in his face, congratulated him on his marriage, and
								expressed her delight at this unexpected meeting. The colour faded
								in the countenance of my Augustus - I thought his lips quivered - he
								certainly looked confused and embarrassed - he let his hand remain
								in hers, without appearing to know that he did so - and the would-be
								interesting colonel putting his hand to the side of his face, and
								grinning till he showed rather more than he intended (viz. besides
								all his white teeth, two vacancies on either side), whispered, -</p>
							<p>"The mutual pleasure evinced by a certain party, is evident enough,
								to call forth a disagreeable emotion on your part, if aught
								disagreeable could lurk under a form so tender!"</p>
							<p>I had not time to answer this complimentary whisper, had I been
								prepared; for my tender form was at this minute presented by
								Augustus to Miss Danby, and I bent my flexible joints to her in a
								courtesy. Assuredly, there was much constraint and embarrassment in
								Mr. Fairfield’s manner, even whilst he made this introduction; but
								with the assured ease of a girl used to the world, the lady stared
								at me with an expression of unbridled curiosity, which made my
								cheeks glow. -What was the cause of Augustus’s confusion? My dear
								Mrs. Milbanke, I asked myself this question. The humbled and
								mortified Olivia could answer it only thus (for neither the manners
								nor person of Miss Danby could ever have been interesting to
								Augustus; of this I was well aware): My husband is, then, ashamed of
								me - he is ashamed of my person - he dreads my being seen by any of
								his former acquaintances as his wife; - I must then be still
								disgusting in his eyes - he yet has not courage to face the "world’s
								dread laugh!" These bitter reflections passed in my mind, as I
								observed that Augustus escaped from the rude survey which Miss Danby
								seemed to be taing of my person, as though he could not stand the
								scrutiny. - I hope it was only for a moment that I suffered these
								thoughts to ruffle my tranquility! - Augustus, too, soon recovered
								himself; and Miss Danby offering him her hand with great nonchalance
								(on seeing the nabob take mine, to lead me into the dining-room), he
								gallantly lifted it to his lips as he took it.</p>
							<p>"We used to be famous flirts, you know," said Miss Danby. "Even so,
								believe me, Mrs. Fairfield;" said she, nodding familiarly at me
								across the table.</p>
							<p>"And we mean to resume our old habits, of course," said Augustus
								laughing.</p>
							<p>"And will you not retaliate?" said Colonel Singleton, who seated at
								my right hand, threw his most agreeable smile into his face as he
								asked the question.</p>
							<p>"I don’t know how far it would be proper," said I.</p>
							<p>"Would ladies of the present century always stop to consider of
								propriety before they venture on this retaliation, I think we should
								soon find a material improvement in manners as well as morals," said
								a grave-looking elderly gentleman, who sat towards the bottom of the
								table. "But you ladies do not give yourselves time for reflection."
								And as he said this, he turned his head towards Miss Singleton, who,
								arrayed in pink muslin, and adorned with pearls looked as gay and
								airy, as her very gay and very airy dress could make her.</p>
							<p>"As to giving ourselves time, you ought to know that it is not at our
								own command," said she. "I protest to you, that, for my own part,
								fom year’s end to year’s end, I have not a day which I can call my
								own."</p>
							<p>"Oh happy you!" said Miss Danby; "What an enviable being!" said she,
								apparently spoke from her heart.</p>
							<p>"Nay, do you really think so?" said Miss Singleton, simpering with
								conscious pleasure. "To be sure, society has imperious claims upon
								persons in a certain sphere; and I have a very large circle of
								acquaintance, which is continually expanding."</p>
							<p>"The expansion of a circle: that is not badly expressed," said Lady
								Ingot, in a half-whisper, to Augustus.</p>
							<p>"And a magic circle too!" said a young ensign, who sat on one side of
								the speaker.</p>
							<p>"The colonel has also a great many friends," continued Miss
								Singleton.</p>
							<p>"A charming, elegant man! I am sure, ma’am, he must have friends
								wherever he is seen!" said an elderly and highly-rouged window, who
								seemed to be particularly attentive to Colonel Singleton.</p>
							<p>"A vast acquaintance my brother has, ma’am - and people who live in
								the world have such various claims upon them; what with dinner
								parties, routs, concerts, plays, balls, and suppers, at Bath in the
								winter, London in the spring, and at all the fashionable
								watering-places in rotation during the summer, I have not a moment,
								that I can call my own, of the twenty-four hours. My brother and
								myself seldom retire till three or four in the morning, as we can
								find no other period than an hour before we court repose, to talk
								over the adventures of the preceding day, and settle a plan of
								engagements for the next."</p>
							<p>"Does this mode of life never weary?" asked the grave looking
								gentleman.</p>
							<p>"We must never allow that pleasure can weary," said Miss Danby, with
								gaiety. "It would be a contradiction in terms. - But pray, Mr.
								Fairfield, do tell me, how is my friend Mrs. George Merton? Speaking
								of pleasure reminds me of her - she used to be a dear dissipated
								creature, you know."</p>
							<p>"She is just as you remember her," said Fairfield; but again his
								features underwent an alteration. Miss Danby fixed her
								keenly-scrutinizing eyes on his face, and said,</p>
							<p>"Pray, Mr. Fairfield, what is become of Miss Forrester?"</p>
							<p>Here seemed the very climax of Augustus’s embarrassment. Indeed, my
								dearest friend, I saw him start; his face was convulsed; the most
								deadly expression of anguish overspread his features. I was just
								going to put a glass of wine to my lips; I had bowed to Colonel
								Singleton, in return to his drinking my health; but the tremulous
								movement of my hand obliged me to set the glass again on the table;
								and, without knowing what I was doing, I sought for my
								smelling-bottle, and, had I not checked the first impulsive movement
								of my soul, I should have handed it across the table to my husband,
								- and should, most probably, have drawn on myself, if not on him
								also, the ridicule of the whole company. Miss Danby does not appear
								to want penetration, however destitute she may be o feeling; I am
								sure that she saw my emotion, and that the disorder of Augustus did
								not pass unobserved, for she followed up the question with -</p>
							<p>"Poor Angelina! I should really like to know where she is. There was
								something vastly good about her; and though I used to laugh at her,
								yet I loved, her. - Pray, do you not know where she is Mr.
								Fairfield?"</p>
							<p>"She is in heaven!" sighed out Augustus in a tone of voice scarcely
								audible, and, at the same moment, letting his fork fall on the plate
								he hastily averted his head from Miss Danby, and filling a bumper of
								wine, he eagerly swallowed it. Even Miss Danby seemed intimidated
								from asking him any more questions.</p>
							<p>Lady Ingot turned towards, me - said, "A very mal-à-propos question
								that of Miss Danby’s - perfectly English! ‘How is she,’ and ‘where
								is she’; expecting verse after verse, like Chevy Chace. Mr.
								Fairfield has very concisely given her the dénouement in four words:
								for my own part, I always hold it as a matter of conscience not to
								make inquiries after absent friends, lest I should wound the
								feelings of those to whom I am addressing myself. People are so very
								soon married, or dead, or buried, and gone Heaven knows where, that
								I think it quite a solecism on good-breeding; but in India we
								discriminate with great nicety on every point of sentiment and
								manners, and, instead of making our conversation assume the features
								of a Moore’s almanac, or a monthly obituary, raise the lively idea,
								and point the brilliant repartee!"</p>
							<p>That I heard this ridiculous speech is certain, because I am able to
								retail it; but, my beloved friend, you would have pitied your poor
								Olivia, had you beheld her at this moment, as much as she did her
								agitated Augustus; evidently Miss Danby had struck the chord which
								jarred through his frame! - This Miss Forrester, then - this
								Angelina - she was the object of my husband’s warmest affections - I
								am sure she was - his sighs - his melancholy abstractions - they are
								all - all for Angelina - and - I was going to say, that I almost
								envied the shade of Angelina - But I will try to be more
								rational.</p>
							<p>When the gentlemen joined us in the drawing-room, Augustus was in
								high spirits, or appeared to be so; they were either affected, or
								produced by his having taken more than his usual quantity of wine.
								He seated himself next Miss Danby; she laughed, and chatted, and
								unceasingly rattled; talked of her poor Mrs. George Merton, in a
								pitying contemptuous tone, which intimated, that though she was her
								dear friend, she had a most hearty contempt for her. She asked, how
								long Mr. George Merton meant to plod on at the cent. per cent.;
								wondered why Augustus had thought fit to quarrel with the world, and
								leave it in dudgeon, when he was so formed for its enjoyment!</p>
							<p>"I have not quarrelled with it, believe me," said Augustus; "I am,
								just now, better pleased with it, than I have been all my life
								before: I live according to my notions of happiness! (and he looked
								with an expression of grateful satisfaction towards your Olivia):
								and can I call myself out of the world, when I have, at this moment,
								the pleasure of sitting next to one of its gayest belles?"</p>
							<p>"Oh nonsense, agreeable flatterer! nonsense!" said Miss Danby. "I am
								merely a bid of passage. Lady Ingot was obliging enough to give me
								an invitation to the Pagoda, and entre nous, I thought I wanted a
								little bracing for the winter’s campaign, and my father having eben
								overwhelmed by the host of faro, it was a scheme of economics for me
								to come here, rather than to be in hired lodgings at Weymouth, or
								dear delightful Brighton - But don’t blab for your life. - I do
								assure you that I felt quite charmed to find that you were in the
								vicinity, and mean to be vastly intimate with Mrs. Fairfield. I feel
								a very great predilection for her already. - Upon my honour she is
								not near so dark as I expected to find her, and for one of that sort
								of people, she is really very well looking!"</p>
							<p>"She is one of that sort of people whose mind is revealed in the
								countenance," said Augustus, warmly, - "and hers is the seat of
								every virtue!"</p>
							<p>I wonder I did not get up to clasp his hand in mine; and you will
								wonder, Mrs. Milbanke, how I could overhear this conversation,
								without standing confessed a curious listener: but, in fact, I
								appeared, at this time, to be attending to a most florid description
								which Miss Singleton was giving of the plumage of a fine bird of
								Paradise, which had been entirely spoilt by her feather-man, to whom
								she had sent it to be dressed.</p>
							<p>During the whole of the day, I had observed that the elderly
								gentleman whom I have previously mentioned, had been very little
								regarded by the major part of the company, and that by the master
								and mistress of the mansion, he had been wholly overlooked; while
								Mr. Ingot had amused himself with making faces in derision at his
								back, and pointing out the unfashionable cut of his coat, and his
								silver buckles, to any one who would attend to him. A very
								interesting looking young clergyman tried in vain, by looks and mild
								persuasions, to deter him, but finding that he was wholly
								unsuccessful, he seemed in despair to give up the point, and to
								redouble his own respectful attentions to the old gentleman.
								Curiosity impelled me to inquire of her ladyship the names of these
								two gentlemen.</p>
							<p>"Do you mean that antiquity?" asked she; "a relative of Sir
								Marmaduke’s, I believe. His benevolence leads him to make the Pagoda
								almost a public receptacle. But as to collateral and genealogical
								descent, my dear mrs. Fairfield, you will credit me that I never
								trouble myself about it; he may or may not be related: but I think
								his head is truly Grecian, and if it had the genuine rust, it would
								be invaluable. As it is, I like very well to see it at the table; it
								is of a good cast, a classical subject certainly."</p>
							<p>"It bespeaks goodness as much as any countenance I ever saw," said
								I.</p>
							<p>"I suspect you are physiognomist," said her ladyship; "I confess that
								I am no Lavaterian: my notions on the point of face-reading are
								deduced from the genuine Roman and Grecian antiques (of which I have
								some curious specimens in my cabinet of medals). As to the sublime
								and beautiful, and as to the grotesque and singular, I look at those
								for subjects of entertainment and laughter in this study."</p>
							<p>"But there is a countenance," said I, "which, having neither a Roman
								nor Grecian, grotesque nor singular cast, is yet so interesting a
								one, that I cannot help asking your ladyship his name also?"</p>
							<p>"His name!" repeated she, turning up her lips rather contemptuously,
								"he is a poor student of Salamanca, or, to speak, in a more
								common-place manner, he is an Oxford scholar, of the name Waller,
								who is here in the capacity of tutor to Mr. Ingot; though, Heaven
								knows what he teaches him, for I cannot find out that Frederic is
								improved by his instructions. His manners I fashion myself Mrs.
								Fairfield - that essential part of education, I told Sir Marmaduke,
								I must have the sole management of. I have read in some obsolete
								author, "Train up a child in the way he should go;" - now I could
								never bear to see the heir of Sir Marmaduke Ingot, stiffened and
								braced, to look as if he had been pulled out at a wire-drawer’s.
								Ease and elegance are, in my opinion, terms nearly synonymous; hence
								I have made a point of letting him lounge, and loll, and curvet, in
								every interesting and careless attitude, from his cradle to the
								present period. OBserve my Frederic as he now lies serpenting on the
								carpet, Mrs. Fairfield - his form is symmetry itself - no ungraceful
								curve, no angular asperities of attitude - there reclines the true
								harmony of proportion!"</p>
							<p>At that moment the young gentleman threw out one polished limb
								(commonly called a leg), as the old gentleman was coming near the
								part of the room where he lay; I saw the movement, and by an
								involuntary impulse sprang forwards, and, catching him by the arm,
								prevented him from falling.</p>
							<p>"You are very good, madam," said he, "thus to prop an old man, from
								the mischievous tricks of an urchin."</p>
							<p>Mr. Waller (the tutor) took the hand of Mr. Ingot, "Pray rise, sir,"
								said he; "I am ashamed to see that you tried to throw your uncle on
								the carpet, and that you suffered a lady to assist him, while you
								continued in this lazy and disgraceful posture!"</p>
							<p>"Uncle, indeed!" repeated he; "how often must you be told that her
								ladyship cannot bear that word, Waller? I assure you, sir, she will
								tell you it is the quintessence of vulgarity to use any of those
								appellations in good company!"</p>
							<p>"I am not to be intimidated from speaking my sentiments, sir," said
								Mr. Waller; "and if the age and character of that venerable
								gentleman is no check on your impertinent behaviour towards him, I
								was in hopes that his relative claim might compel you to adopt a
								more decent mode of conduct!"</p>
							<p>Mr. Ingot made a polite bow, smiled in Mr. Waller’s face, and then
								reeled off to her ladyship, practicing the last new step; with great
								action he continued to whisper into her ear: she reddened and looked
								angrily towards poor Waller, who did not notice her I fancy; and the
								hopeful heir of the Ingots then fell back on the sofa, and amused
								himself with playing with the brilliant pendant which hung at her
								ladyship’s ear. Mr Bellfield (for so is the old gentleman called),
								turning towards me, said -</p>
							<p>"You have here, madam, a pretty fair sample of an only child! - Poor
								fellow! I pity him - but I doubly pity his misguided parents - what
								a store of unhappiness are they not laying up for themselves?"</p>
							<p>I had nothing to urge in extenuation of so much folly, ostentation,
								and self-conceit, as the Ingots had displayed, but I contrived to
								change the subject, and found Mr. Bellfield a very sensible and
								entertaining old man, somewhat cynical in his opinions, and quaint
								in his expressions; his manners are not modeled from the present
								times, but they take their tone, from his principles, which are
								fixed and firm, and can stand against any modern innovations and
								refinements.</p>
							<p>You will think I never mean to throw my pen aside. I must for the
								present wave the introduction of any new characters, to talk of
								myself, and of my dearer self, my husband. Augustus returned home
								dispirited and abstracted; I avoided inquiries; for, alas! I knew
								that Miss Danby had recalled those thoughts which oppressed him.
								Unsuspicious of my being acquainted with this, he yet felt it
								necessary to account for his alteration of manner, and complained of
								a head-ache. In my turn I dissembled, and feigned sleep, when the
								heart-piercing sighs of my husband kept me waking at his side,
								during the greater part of the night; my tears flowed in silence:
								and thus I was an unknown participator in his sorrows. Oh, Mrs.
								Milbanke, how happy, how blest would be the lot of your Olivia, if
								her Augustus would but repose his cares in her faithful bosom! I
								would console him, I would listen to him while he talks of her whom
								he has lost for ever! I would throw off the weakness of my sex, I
								would patiently listen to his animated descrition of her beauties
								and her virtues, and I would daily strive to bemore like the object
								of his sorrowing heart! but while he retains to himself this secret
								suffering, while he denies me the blessed privilege of sharing and
								soothing his sorrows, I feel that I am not half his wife - I am the
								partner of his bed - but not of his heart! There is so much to
								admire in the character of my Augustus, every day discovers so much
								amiability, such benevolence, such commiseration for the sufferings
								of others, that my regard increases with every added hour; and his
								dead, his lamented Angelina, could not, I am sure, have loved him
								with a more fervent affection. Adieu, dearest madam, </p>

							<p>WHEN we returned from church this morning,I found Miss Danby seated
								with her netting, and seeming to be very busily engaged at it, as if
								she had quite forgotten that six days of the week were sufficient to
								employ so frivolously, without trespassing on a sacred commandment.
								- Lady Ingot was playing at "Colonella" with Mr. Ingot, who
								languidly caught the shuttlecock as he reclined on a sofa, letting
								his mother stoop for it when he missed, which happened more than
								nine times out of ten. I stated at seeing the party assembled in the
								breakfast room, and more, at seeing how they were severally engaged
								- for Augustus and myself had walked to church, which is not above a
								quarter of a mile distant, and had entered the house by a private
								door. -</p>
							<p>"And where, in God’s name, have you been these two hours?" asked Lady
								Ingot. "We found the mansion depopulated, we walked in at the hall
								door, made our way here, and have been unmolested by a human
								being!"</p>

							<p>"Not a male in the house,</p>
							<p>Not as much as a mouse?"</p>
							<p>said Miss Danby.</p>
							<p>"That is pretty true, I believe," said Augustus. "My olivia is not
								content with being good herself, she makes others so likewise, and
								all our male servants go to church on a Sunday: we leave one female
								at home, to see that the house is not run away with, - if some of
								our good neighbours (smiling) do not perform that kind office for
								us!"</p>
							<p>"To church! and have you, in reality, been at church?" asked Lady
								Ingot: "I had forgotten that it was Sunday!"</p>
							<p>"If Mr. Bellfield and Waller had not reminded you of it, mamma, by
								coming in their very best suits to breakfast - don’t you recollect"
								- said Mr. Ingot - "I am sure the old gentleman’s square-toe’d shoes
								were polished as highly as his silver buckles; and I believe the
								well powdered locks of Waller did not escape the ken of Miss Danby,
								for I watched her eyeing him most intently during the déjeûné."</p>
							<p>"What spirits you are in mon cher Frederic!" said Lady Ingot; "you
								will exhaust yourself."</p>
							<p>"His spirits run away with him," said Miss Danby, "the idea of my
								eyeing Waller is ridiculous enough, to be sure!"</p>
							<p>"Nay, if you come to that, I have been eyeing him in church," said I,
								"and am not ashamed to confess it; there is something vastly
								prepossessing in the countenance of that young man; and his
								attention to the respectable Mr. Bellfield, and their mutual
								devotion, is a very pleasing sight. Piety, true fervid piety, is a
								delightful contemplation!"</p>
							<p>Lady Ingot writhed herself into a new Circassian attitude, and
								putting as much softness as she could into her voice, said, -</p>
							<p>"Pray, were you not very cold? I never set my foot in that church but
								once, and then I was absolutely starved to death. I told Sir
								Marmaduke it was hazarding the very existence of our tender one
								there (looking at her son), if he ever let him enter it, unless he
								could portion off a large space for our separate use, and have it
								well stuffed and carpeted, and a chimney built, and a good register
								stove put in; but it seems there are great difficulties, in the way
								to all improvements in country parishes: - what with their rectors,
								parsons, their graziers and yeomanry, who talk of ‘my pew,’ and
								‘mine,’ with as much tenacity, as if one wanted to deprive them of
								any thing worth retaining. Sir Marmaduke has had so many things of
								consequence to attend to since we came to the Pagoda, that he has
								not had leisure to settle a plan for a little sequestration (as I
								term it); for hs family’s accommodation at church; and for my own
								part, I do not much trouble about it. My own religion, is the
								religion of nature! I can put up my aspirations, while walking in
								the fields or driving on the road, just as devoutly as if I was
								kneeling on the moist and humid pavement of some time-worn,
								superstitious structure, and catching a sudden death at the very
								moment I was praying to be delivered from it, - for nothing short of
								a miracle could preserve me!"</p>
							<p>"The breaths of the greasy farmers is what I chiefly dread in these
								mixed meetings," said Miss Danby.</p>
							<p>"But you used not to dread the infinitely more contagious atmosphere
								of a crowded assembly and rout," said Augustus.</p>
							<p>Miss Danby coloured through her rouge at this well-timed rebuke, and
								in some haste began to unscrew her netting machine from the
								table.</p>
							<p>"And what may you call this?" asked Augustus playfully.</p>
							<p>"Now you know very well, Mr. Fairfield, that it is a vice."</p>
							<p>"Oh, I don’t approve the name at all, - never bring it here again of
								a Sunday, I entreat you, Miss Danby. These vicious pursuits must not
								be introduced into a quiet and pastoral country."</p>
							<p>"I do verily believe that you are become a methodist," said Miss
								Danby; "you are so sarcastic too in your manner that I shall begin
								to be afraid of you, - and shall begin to hate you almost as bad as
								my friend, poor Mrs. George, does!"</p>
							<p>"Oh, do not say so," said Fairfield; "let me not live to be the
								object of your hatred, fair Almenia!"</p>

							<p>I DO not know why I have dwelt on the Ingots, except that, as they
								are to me a new species of animal, I feel my own curiosity, as well
								as pity, excited in analyzing them, and imagine that you will feel
								similar emotions. But today we will turn to a nobler and a more
								delightful inspection. The rectory would be frequently haunted by
								Mrs. Milbanke were she with her Olivia; (oh, that were!) Mr. Lumley
								is just the clergyman which my heart depicted him. I fancy he has
								known great trials and struggles in bustling through life, and
								endeavouring to bring up a large family in respectability; - and a
								conscientious clergyman is, of all characters, the one which is
								least calculated to do this; for as much as may be, he wishes to
								disengage his mind from all secular pursuits ("we cannot serve God
								and mammon"), yet this is wholly impossible, where few friends, and
								a scanty income, are the only reward for a life spent in the most
								noble of all causes. Mr. Lumley’s long residence, and zealous
								administration of the duties of his office, as curate of this large
								and scattered parish, at length moved the heart of a man of some
								consequence in this neighbourhood, into whose patronage the living
								fell on the death of a rector, to whom Mr. Lumley had been, (during
								a long period of twenty years) curate; - and who had never entered
								his parish except to give his flock an annual shearing and
								sermon!</p>
							<p>The living was presented to Mr. Limley, who was truly worthy to be so
								preferred, which is deductible from the general satisfaction
								exhibited by his parishioners. Easy in his circumstances, with the
								means of forwarding his family in the world, the good man seems to
								be completely happy. You would admire his whole family, Mrs.
								Milbanke; the father, sensible, cheerful in conversation, eloquent
								in the cause nearest his heart, and making it the rule of his life;
								- the mother, unaffected and warm-hearted, ready to apply the balm
								of consolation, and the drop of sympathy, to every mourner within
								her reach; - the girls, frank, open-hearted, and innocent; - the
								boys, hanging and catching his sentiments to give the tone to their
								own!</p>
							<p>Caroline Lumley is a sweet girl of seventeen; her beauty does not
								consist so much in feature, as expression: there is a native
								simplicity in her manner, which I have never seen equalled - and
								much mistaken if the eyes of Waller have not told a tale, which hers
								have understood. I have asked her assistance in forwarding a little
								plan for establishing a School of Industry in the village; this
								brings her more frequently to me, than I should otherwise, - her
								fear of intrusion withholding her from coming unbidden. She has
								frequently been my companion in my morning’s ramble; and she is so
								sweetly grateful for my notice, that your Olivia could almost fancy
								herself a superior, instead of an inferior being, notwithstanding
								her colour! But, thank God, I am loved not feared by this child of
								nature, - my behaviour surprises and charms her, as being contrasted
								with the foolish hauteur of other strangers who have settled here,
								particularly the Ingots. Mrs. Lumley called on Lady Ingot, on her
								first coming to the Pagoda, - Sir Marmaduke returned it; and in an
								affectedly affable manner, which proved his mushroom pride and
								self-sufficiency, he invited Mr. Lumley to dine with him, excusing
								himself from including the females of the family, by saying, -</p>
							<p>"Lady Ingot had a great many claims upon her in society. She was a
								highly-bred woman; it was necessary to draw the line of separation
								somewhere. She was sorry to refuse the pleasure of receiving Mrs.
								Lumley at the Pagoda; but if she did, Mrs. Notary and Mrs. Bolus
								might expect the same honour to be extended to them likewise; - thus
								the very canaille would be included in her ladyship’s list of
								visitants, and her life would be subject to an eternal impost, from
								the levies of an inferior scale of beings!"</p>
							<p>Mrs. Lumley has nothing of sarcasm in her manner, but she laughingly
								repeated this speech, saying, - "Verbatim, as it came from the
								courtly Sit Marmaduke; believe me, Mrs. Fairfield, though we all
								suspect that it was the florid composition of her ladyship, for it
								came off in rather too studied a manner to be extempore. I
								courtesied, and was not much mortified at coming below the
								prescribed standard; and the good man there, in his own placid tone,
								thanked the Knight for the honour of his invitation, - but said, he
								was well aware that the hours and the society of the Pagoda would
								ill coalesce with his humdrum mode of life and obsolete ideas, and
								therefore desired to be excused likewise! - This refusal on his part
								seemed to be vastly well taken, and Sir Marmaduke is on the best of
								all possible terms with us. He always bows and smiles, inquires
								cordially after my health, asks after my little family, then how
								many children I have, and the age of the youngest, when he meets me;
								- passes the children one day, and makes an apology for forgetting
								them on the next; and when he, mounted on his dashy phaeton, meets
								me trudging along the lanes, he invariably stops to express his fear
								of my getting an illness by encountering so much dirt."</p>
						</div>
						<div type="entry">
							<head type="sub">IN CONTINUATION</head>
							<p>THE amiable simplicity and good-humoured frankness of the Lumleys,
								are well contrasted by the assuming pride and false consequence of
								the Ingots, in the little trait which I gave you yesterday. - Ah, my
								dear Mrs. Milbanke! if the little great would but behold themselves
								as they are viewed by those from whom they have departed under
								covert of Sir Marmaduke’s "separating line," they would surely learn
								to despise themselves; but those beings who court popularity are
								beset with a train of parasites, of Danbys and of Singletons, who
								flatter, who compliment, and who laugh at them in a breath!</p>
							<p>Even Augustus, - even your Olivia, who prides herself on her
								ingenuousness of character, even we are silent; and we would keep on
								a neighbourly footing at the Pagoda, we must not always express our
								real sentiments. And yet we purposely left the crowded haunts of the
								city, to escape from all the ceremonials of fashion and the tax
								which the arbitrary customs of the world has imposed so heavily upon
								reason and common sense. Yet they have followed us into retirement,
								and, unless we would really turn hermits, and entirely seclude
								ourselves from society, we must be content to pay the common levy; -
								for, to form a truly unvitiated and primeval neighbourhood of
								undisturbed truth, simplicity, and innocence, we must revert to the
								golden age, and to the rapt reveries of enthusiastic poets. Happy is
								it, when, with no overstrained fastidiousness, we can consent to
								take the world as we find it, when we endeavour to mend where it
								lies in our power, and firmly resolve not to make it worse by our
								own example. If I was to brace myself up, and with affected
								authority take upon me to correct the follies which I observe at the
								Pagoda, I should most assuredly draw down a great deal of odium on
								myself, and, to the other failings of her ladyship, add those of
								rancour and malice to her nearest neighbours.</p>
							<p>We have heard nothing of Honeywood, or to what spot he has bent his
								course, in pursuit of consolation. I fear he thinks himself
								forgotten by your Olivia. Yet surely, he could not have appreciated
								her character so unjustly; rather should I suspect that he fears to
								obtrude on my happiness, with his grief! Yet that Power who has
								bestowed on me a happiness, for which I cannot be sufficiently
								grateful has also taught me to "feel another’s woe."</p>
							<p>Adieu, my dearest friend! My heart always turns to you
									with a sentiment of reverential affection, which I feel but
									cannot express.</p>

							<p>IN the plenitude of happiness, we sometimes grow childishly
								fastidious, and are easily put out of humour. I feel ashamed to own,
								that this has just been my own case: but all my weaknesses shall be
								confessed to my beloved Mrs. Milbanke.</p>
							<p>I have received a letter from Mrs. Merton; she is coming to pay me a
								visit. You know, my dear friend, that I do not love her. I confess,
								that I felt a pain at my heart, wholly unaccountable even to myself,
								as I read the intelligence. It seemed as if she were coming to
								disturb my halcyon felicity; it seemed, - I know not what. But you
								may suppose that I do not exaggerate my feelings when I tell you,
								that Augustus observing me, said, in a voice of affectionate
								inquiry, -</p>
							<p>"No ill news, my love, I trust!"</p>
							<p>This brought me to come sense of my weakness to call it by no harsher
								name. I had nothing to allege in my excuse. Indeed, I had not words
								to answer him, so I put the letter into his hands. - In his turn,
								Augustus seemed to receive a damp from the promised visit.</p>
							<p>"Do as you like, my Olivia," said he, returning me the letter.</p>
							<p>"We shall see Mrs. Merton, of course," said I: "you know we have no
								engagements."</p>
							<p>"It is, of course," said he, "for you to forget that she invariably
								made you the object of her affront and insult. But your unparalleled
								sweetness and forbearance is what I must ever remember!"</p>
							<p>"Oh, I am so vulnerable to praise from you," said I, "that I must
								receive Mrs. Merton’s visit for even were I sure of experiencing
								similar treatment from her, I should now be doubly supported from
								the proud consciousness of your esteem!"</p>
							<p>"No, my generous girl," said he, "her rudeness must never be
								repeated! I have now a husband’s claim, and I will see that none
								injures my wife with impunity! - Yet hear me, whilst I conjure you,
								that from no false pride and punctilious delicacy towards me, you
								receive the visit of my brother’s wife! God knows, that I have no
								relative - no affection for her of any kind. She has been my - Do
								not put a tax on your own feelings, to avoid wounding mine, my
								Olivia," said he, recollecting himself after pausing abruptly, and
								heaving a bitter sigh; - "for I protest that was she not the wife of
								my brother, I would never behold her more!"</p>
							<p>"But as your brother’s wife," said I, smiling.</p>
							<p>"My Olivia will always have it her own way, and that way is always
								right," said he. "You must extend the invitation to my nephew, your
								little favourite."</p>
							<p>"Most assuredly I will!"</p>
							<p>And so ended this conversation; though I freely confess, that a gloom
								comes over my mind, which I cannot get rid of, when I think of
								entertaining Mrs. Merton as my guest. I do not fear her, Mrs.
								Milbanke; she cannot have power to harm me, blest as I am with my
								husband’s protecting love. I do not hate her; for I trust I have
								attained that rule of Christian forbearance, which teaches us to
								"pray for those who despitefully use us." But I shall feel awkward
								and constrained, while performing the rites of hospitality, and
								apparently extending the hand of friendship, where I cannot respect
								or esteem.</p>
							<p>Dido is as much out of sorts as her mistress; she does not like the
								idea of the tonish (or rather townish) Abigail, and the monkey
								footman, who treated her with so much sang froid, at Clifton and in
								London. "But here," she says, "thanks to my good lady, - Dido be
								Missee below stairs, and treated by all as if me was as good as
								another, for all me be poor negro wench!"</p>
							<p>Ah, my good Dido, perhaps both your "good lady," and yourself, may
								find the difference of entertaining, and being entertained! Yet Dido
								is determined that nothing shall be wanting on her part, towards
								receiving our guest stylishly; and she has been in a prodigious
								bustle ever since I made her acquainted with the contents of my
								letter.</p>
							<p>Augustus bids me make up my packet for Jamaica, as he can get it
								conveyed to Bristol by a gentleman now setting out. May every
								earthly blessing attend you, my ever dear friend! - so will always
								pray your affectionate</p>

						<p>SCARCELY do I send off one packet ere I begin another, so great is my
							satisfaction in addressing myself to my dear Mrs. Milbanke, and so well
							am I acquainted with the fond reception which she will always give to
							them. I believe I have never told you, that at the entrance of the park
							there is a neat little cottage, which is nearly concealed by the
							venerable elms which are planted in order to mark the direct approach to
							the house, and are continued in a fine avenue, quite in the old style
							(although the place be rather unjustly termed New Park). There is
							something formal in this straight lined road, to be sure, but venerable
							in their formality. I am inclined to behold them with as partial an eye
							as Mr. Seagrove (the gentleman of whom we rent the place), and I would
							not willingly lop a branch, or disturb a rook’s nest. I like to walk
							under the shade of those trees which were planted by the hands of those
							who have long lain in the dust. My mind is tinged by melancholy, but it
							is not of an unpleasing cast. I am carried back to a remote age - I
							unconsciously look up to those majestic trees, which form a canopy to
							screen me from the fervid sun, to inquire into the manners and history
							of "times, long ago." The wind, whistling through their branches, seems
							to waft me the answer in a long-drawn sigh. I echo it responsively, and
							my reflections end with supposing, that the human mind, always the same
							in its feelings and emotions, its pleasures, its pains, its virtues and
							its vices, life, in every æra of existence, had nearly the same
							proportion of weal or woe! - So you find that my solitary meditations,
							like those of other illuminators, end just where they began. - But I
							have widely strayed from the subject with which I began; namely, the
							little cottage. It has been shut up till last week: its present tenant
							is an entire stranger. We like to know something of a person before we
							form an acquaintance; and yet I think it would appear very fastidious
							and narrow-minded in me, if I was not to visit so near a neighbour - a
							female too!</p>

						<quote>Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,<lb/> And waste its
							sweetness on the desert-air.</quote>

						<p>The inhabitant of that modest tenement may have a million times more
							innate worth than the titled she of a certain colonnaded Pagoda.
							Fairfield chimes with me in thinking it would be iliberal not to notice
							this stranger; yet says,</p>
						<p>"Stay a little, my Olivia; let not the generous fervour of your feelings
							carry you too swiftly along; hear Mrs. Lumley’s account: she, as the
							clergyman’s wife, will most assuredly" -</p>
						<p>"Now," said I, interrupting him, and laughing, "you must forgive me, for
							reminding you of the table of the cat and the bell."</p>
						<p>"I acknowledge the propriety of the application," said he, bowing.</p>

						<p>I WAS this morning walking in the park with Caroline Lumley, when we
							perceived four persons approaching towards us - two of either sex - each
							lady supported by a beau. We soon discovered them, as they came nearer,
							for Miss Singleton, leaning on the arm of young Ingot; Miss Danby on
							that of Waller. The quick retreating colour of my companion announced
							the latter pair to me, previous to my own observation.</p>
						<p>"Oh, what a morning of Ossian!" said Miss Singleton, throwing out her
							hands with an air truly theatrical, and making a truly Arcadian
							appearance, in a gipsy hat, tied with a pink handkerchief, and
							ornamented by a wreath of half-blown roses, a mantle of the same
							coloured sarsnet, hung over her left shoulder, while her short and thin
							drapery discovered her laced stockings and delicate pink kid slipper.
							Miss Danby, in rather a rougher and more assured manner than the
							languishing shepherdess, declared the day was charmingly fine, but that
							there was a softness and stillness in the air, which would wholly have
							incapacitated her from walking with Miss Singleton without assistance.
							-</p>
						<p>"So I have absolutely pulled this book-worm from his desk," said she, "to
							make him my walking-stick! Hav’n’t I, Waller?"</p>
						<p>"Make me any thing you please," said he, with a bow, not ungallant.</p>
						<p>"’Pon my honour that’s not so bad," said Miss Danby; "I shall make
							something of you yet, I believe - He’ll do yet, Mrs. Fairfield, when I
							can cure him of ‘Ma’am,’ and blushing at every word," for the eyes of
							Waller had met those of Caroline, and the colour rose in his cheeks at
							the moment when it forsook hers.</p>
						<p>"A stick! - Waller, a stick! That’s a monstrous good one, Miss Daby - I
							am sure I shall make mamma laugh at that - I am sure her ladyship will
							enjoy the new use to which you have put my tutor, Miss Danby."</p>
						<p>"Talking of her ladyship," said I, for I had scarcely patience to listen
							to the impertinence of this young puppy, "I am reminded to express my
							surprise at seeing that she has given you leave to walk out, Mr. Ingot,
							this melting day."</p>
						<p>"He is, indeed, composed of the most melting materials!" said Miss
							Singleton, looking at him with eyes of admiration.</p>
						<p>"Perhaps you fear that he may dissolve," said Miss Danby. "Pray, Miss
							Singleton, don’t let your blooming Adonis slip through your
							fingers!"</p>
						<p>"Lady Ingot is not afraid of the heat, ’tis the cold she dreads for me,"
							said Ingot, lisping out every word; "and most of all, a thaw - her
							ladyship calls a thaw the check to every genial emotion, and to all
							animal circulation!"</p>
						<p>"Oh, ’tis a most terrible feel - pray don’t talk of it!" said Miss
							Singleton, affectedly shivering.</p>
						<p>"Pray, Mrs. Fairfield, have you yet seen your new neighbour, the fair
							incognita, at the cottage?" asked Miss Danby.</p>
						<p>"No, I have not," said I. "Is she, then, fair?"</p>
						<p>"That remains to be proved," answered Miss Singleton; "but the colonel,
							who has a truly quixotic spirit, where a female (and, moreover, a young,
							and, as it appears in this case, a concealed female) is engaged, swears
							by his gallantry, that he will get a peep at her, and then we shall have
							his opinion; for I assure you, the colonel is allowed to be some judge
							of beauty!"</p>
						<p>"A gallant, gay Lothario!" said INgot; "is he not, Miss Singleton?"</p>
						<p>"Why, to be sure he is gay;" said Miss Singleton. "But what can be said
							when a man is in the zenith of life, spirits, gaiety, and fortune, and
							every female heart falling before him? I talk to him a little seriously
							now and then, when I can find time, but he is so charmingly insinuating,
							and such an agreeable devil, that I’m sure if he had not been my
							brother, I must have been one of his victims!"</p>
						<p>"Not his victim," returned Miss Danby; "you must, you would have been the
							selected she; for I think I never saw two persons more alike than
							yourself and the colonel, both in manner, sentiment, person, and
							conversation."</p>
						<p>"Now, don’t flatter me," said Miss Singleton, "though I must own we have
							frequently been found out for brother and sister." By this time, you are
							tired of antiquated folly, dearest Mrs. Milbanke; believe me, I was
							heartily so before we got to the end of our walk, and I could see that
							Caroline Lumley felt awkwardly constrained before these high-flown
							belles, who noticed her not quite as much as they would have done a dog
							which they had met with me. When the quartetto was fairly gone, and we
							were seated quietly at our work, Caroline said, -</p>
						<p>"I think, ma’am, Miss Danby has something very bold in her look and
							manner - do you not agree with me? She may be a very well-bred lady, for
							I am not acquainted with many of those - but she is not at all like you
							in her manners."</p>
						<p>"She has seen a great deal more of the world than I have, Caroline," said
							I; "and is much admired in its circles, I make no doubt."</p>
						<p>"But do you admire her, ma’am?"</p>
						<p>"That is not the question," said I. "Does Mr. Waller admire her?"</p>
						<p>I said this with meaning - the crimson tide covered the neck of Caroline
							- her face was bent over her work; but she answered with a vehemence,
							which rendered her almost breathless, -</p>
						<p>"No; I am sure he does not!"</p>
						<p>"And I am sure of it too," said I. "Waller has a better taste - the
							meretricious allurements of folly cannot draw him aside from the
							contemplation of virtuous simplicity! - Waller loves you, Caroline."</p>
						<p>"Oh, madam!" said she covered her face with both her hands.</p>
						<p>"Be not ashamed my love, at having raised a virtuous passion in the bosom
							of virtue - I speak not from motives of idle or unfeeling curiosity, but
							from a real wish of assisting you - deal ingenuously, then, with me,
							sweet girl, and tell me if my conjectures are not right?"</p>
						<p>"They are, madam. Why should I conceal any thing from you? Why, indeed,
							when my parents are both acquainted with, and approve, the mutual
							passion which subsists between Waller and myself? Mr. Waller came down
							here a stranger, as tutor to Mr. ingot’ there was little chance of our
							getting acquainted with him, as the nabob’s family were placed at a
							height so far above us, that we neither wished an intercourse with it,
							nor would have been allowed it if we had; but Mr. Waller’s constant and
							zealous attendance at church - his respectful attention to Mr.
							Bellefield, the uncle of Sir Marmaduke (a worthy old gentleman, whose
							story reached my father’s ear) - these circumstances first conciliated
							in us an interest for Mr. Waller; - and then, when my father had a long
							and severe fit of sickness, he stepped forwards, volunteered his
							services, and officiated as minister of his parish nearly three months -
							no persuasions of my father could induce him to accept any pecuniary
							reward!"</p>
						<p>"But he had his rich reward in your love, Caroline?"</p>
						<p>"Ah, madam," said she, "I felt that I could not withhold it from him - My
							good parents soon perceived our mutual partiality - they sought not to
							restrain it - but they saw the imprudence of our thinking of any thing
							further, till better prospects should open to Waller."</p>
						<p>"Has he expectations, then?" asked I.</p>
						<p>"Alas! madam, I hardly know what to call them. A dependence on the word
							of Sir Marmaduke Ingot is, I sometimes fear, the slightest of all
							probabilities. He is, you must see, a man who ever pays court to the
							‘rising sun;’ who would help to lift those who are already exalted, if,
							in any way, they could conduce to his own exaltation, but who would be
							more likely to crush than to succour the fallen."</p>
						<p>"I fear that you have drawn too just a picture of a selfish man,
							Caroline."</p>
						<p>"Waller submits to the dreugery that is imposed on him at the Pagoda (and
							papa often compares him to Jacob serving for Rachel), because he does
							not like to leave this neighbourhood; but there is no chance of his
							pupil’s improvement, and this is of itself sufficient to depress the
							spirits and the exertions of a young man of talent and genius. He feels
							that the instructor can never derive any credit from the instructed; and
							though he does all in his power to give Mr. Ingot’s mind a right turn,
							and to form it to laudable pursuits, and to plant into it just notions,
							yet his labours are daily subverted by the false and ridiculous theories
							and systems of his refined mother, and the overweening and worldly
							maxims of Sir Marmaduke. Mr. Ingot is any thing but a classical scholar;
							and, as to study, I have frequently heard Waller say, that it is
							impossible to fix his attention to any one subject for half an hour
							together; and when he has complained, at his first coming to the Pagoda,
							of the inattention of his pupil, her ladyship said, -</p>
						<p>"That learning was never to be thrummed into the head of any one; that
							true genus caught it at intervals, when the glow of enthusiasm
							stimulated the breast; that she was a decided enemy to all innovations
							on the liberty of the human mind; that measuring out the classics by the
							hour and the rule, might do in a large school, where there was just ten
							minutes for the teacher to appropriate to each boy; but that, where the
							exclusive attention was to be directed to one, it was the duty of the
							tutor to watch for the auspicious moment - to follow the youthful mind
							in all its variations - to watch it with never-ceasing vigilance, and
							eagerly snatch the golden opportunity when it panted for information and
							instruction!"</p>
						<p>"The golden opportunity has never arrived, and Waller, in following his
							pupil in all his whimsical and childish vagaries, frequently compares
							himself to the butterfly-hunter."</p>
						<p>"But Sir Marmaduke, surely, he must be a very weak man, to suffer his son
							to go on in such a manner!"</p>
						<p>"Sir Marmaduke has not had the advantages of a liberal education
							himself," said Caroline, "but he does not find that he is received the
							worse on this account since he has made his fortune, and assured that
							his son will inherit these advantages, he is very easy on the subject of
							his mental improvement, although he would fain have it believed, that he
							is of a very studious turn himself, and is fond of talking of his
							"literary avocations," though his studies never extend further than the
							newspapers, the army list, the court calendar, the court calendar, and
							the acts of parliament concerning highways and turnpikes; - but I must
							put a check on my tongue," said she, "Waller would not be well pleased
							to hear me revealing the secrets of (his) prison house!"</p>
						<p>"I don’t think he could be displeased," said I, "with the artless picture
							which you have drawn of his disagreeable situation. But such, I fear,
							are frequently the trials which genius, talen, and virtue have to
							undergo, in a world where the trials are always proportioned to the
							strength!"</p>
						<p>I cannot say how much I admire this ingenuous girl, or how deeply I am
							interested in the loves of this youthful pair. For the present,
							adieu!</p>

						<p>AUGUSTUS heard my recital of Caroline’s artless tale with an interest as

						<p>AUGUSTUS brought Waller home to dinner yesterday, on a more familiar
							footing than he has hitherto been with us. We saw him to greater
							advantage; he has a courage in speaking his opinions, and an
							independence of sentiment, which pleased us both; for it proves, that,
							though placed by fortune in a subordinate situation, he will not crouch
							nor temporize with his own principles to please his superiors. He gave
							us an outline of poor old Bellfield’s life -</p>

						<p><quote>Blow, blow, thou winter’s wind!<lb/> Thou art not so unkind<lb/> As
							man’s ingratitude!<lb/></quote></p>

						<p>Mr. Bellefield was a merchant of some consequence, and bore an
							irreproachable character both in regard to his commercial and relative
							connexions. His only sister married, was left a destitute widow with a
							small family, and it was wholly to the generosity of her brother, that
							she was indebted for her own and their existence. He sent the eldest boy
							to India, with strong recommendations; he returned Sir Marmaduke Ingot,
							a nabob, with an overgrown fortune: he found his uncle reduced by
							unmerited misfortunes, and labouring under difficulties in the decline
							of life, from which he had been exempt in the meridian. The hand of
							protection was most ostentatiously thrown out, not the hand which should
							have lifted Mr. Bellfield to his former situation, and strained every
							nerve to keep him there with his original credit! No! the nephew offered
							an asylum at the Pagoda, and the uncle was driven to an acceptance of
							it.His pride, his sense of ingratitude he had met with, were silenced by
							his necessities; - an offer from which his spirit would have revolted,
							his imperious exigence obliged him to accept! - "my poverty, but not my
							will, consents!"</p>
						<p>Daily getting nearer to that grave, where "the rich and the poor meet
							together," in that contemplation Mr. Bellfield apparently looks beyond
							the unpleasantries which he daily encounters at the Pagoda. No tempers
							can be so dissimilar as Mr. Bellfield’s and Sir Marmaduke’s; "sanction,
							countenance, and favour," are the favourite words of the great man -
							while through his whole mercantile proceedings, Mr. Bellfield was
							invariably sanctioning, countenancing, and favouring in silence,
							experiencing true pleasure only, whilst benefiting his fellow-creatures.
							Though unhappily reduced to a dependent situation in the house of his
							nephew, yet he studiously maintains a freedom of opinion which does him
							honour, and which Sir Marmaduke finding to be impregnable, after a few
							useless discussions on his first coming, has ceased to attack, seldom
							entering into conversation with Mr. Bellfield; and thus he avoids
							showing him how widely different are their sentiments on most subjects.
							The old gentleman is suffered to pursue his own plan of amusement, and
							to walk over the grounds alone and unmolested, like an old horse, that
							"having borne the burden and heat of the day," is just suffered to exist
							by the master whom he formerly sustained on his back! - Lady Ingot feels
							an utter contempt for Mr. Bellfield, he has never been at college or in
							India, and hence he can be no companion for her. - She never checks
							Frederic in his facetious remarks on "old quiz," and "old square toes,"
							and the duty and respect which the age, the affinity, and the worth of
							Mr. Bellfield ought to command from him, are thus converted into
							ridicule and insult! Waller is particularly attached to Mr. Bellfield;
							and I rejoice that there is one feeling being at the Pagoda, who will
							try to ameliorate his hard lot. The story of this unfortunate gentleman
							is interesting, my dear Mrs. Milbanke; it shows us how differently
							things are in reality, from their estimation in the world. By the world,
							Sir Marmaduke and Lady Ingot are praised and applauded for their
							kindness and benevolence to an unfortunate relative - We, who know the
							preceding and existing circumstances, see where their "tender mercies"
							tend. God bless you - so will ever pray</p>

						<p>MRS. Merton is arrived; so obliging, so amiable; her "dear sister," her
							"charming Mrs. Fairfield;" I really fear I shall forget myself, I am so
							overwhelmed by civility; the park, too, is so beautiful, "she shall be
							strolling in it continually!" (by this you are to understand she has
							found her legs since I last saw her): then "we look so well, so
							handsome, we do so much credit to the air of Devonshire; Augustus is
							grown quite fat. She even longs for the day when she may prevail on Mr.
							George Merton to follow her example, and retire to such another
							elysium!" This rhodomontade, convinced as we must be of its insincerity,
							is rather teasing - Augustus can scarcely sit in: he never liked Mrs.
							Merton, and he is of too ingenuous a disposition to conceal his marked
							surprise, when he hears her thus boldly avowing sentiments in direct
							contradiction to her practice.</p>

						<p>YOU will not have much added to my packet, as I shall devote my whole

							professions when measured by her standard; I must therefore make up, by
							acts of attention, for these deficiencies in words: To-morrow we are to
							have the party from the Pagoda to dine with us, the Singletons, &amp;c.
							- Mrs. Merton may talk to the delights of the country, but I know she
							would soon weary of our domestic meals, if they were not enlivened by a
							few new faces, - while I grudge every day that is passed otherwise than
							in rational conversation, and a parity of sentiment. In my husband’s
							approving looks, in listening to the ingenuous remarks of Caroline
							Lumley, I find my highest pleasure; and I daily pray to Heaven, that, in
							the midst of this abundant happiness, I may not forget that I enjoy all
							through its benign mercy! I pray to have my heart more and more softened
							towards my fellow-creatures, that I may look with an eye of compassion
							on their failings, as well as their wants, that I may see my own
							deficiencies of conduct, and not suffer myself to be so puffed up by
							prosperity, as to forget my God! - Adieu, my beloved friend! Remember

						<p>THE bitterness of death is past - the climax of my fate is sealed - I am
							separated for ever from my - Oh, Mrs. Milbanke, I must not write the
							word! To weeks of agony of despair, is now succeeded the calm stupor of
							settled grief; - the short, the transient taste of perfect happiness
							which I lately enjoyed, has rendered the transition doubly acute. - Oh,
							my dear, my misjudging father! why did you not suffer your poor child to
							continue in Jamaica? - there, there was respected - for your sake, she
							was respected by all - while there, one dear, dear friend loved her for

							- The prejudices of society which you feared for her there, have here

							and the character of a poor girl of colour! - Ah! let me recall my

							Milbanke - he feels for your Olivia; he pours his consolations, the

						<p>IT is a long story, my dearest madam; yet you will be impatient to get
							it: and I must try to give you a minute relation.</p>
						<p>What tranquil, what unalloyed happiness preceded Mrs. Merton’s visit to
							New Park! It is only by recalling this bright picture to your memory,
							that you can form an estimate of the soul-harrowing reverse, - it was a
							picture of primeval happiness, of paradisiacal bliss! In Eden, our first
							parents were happy till the serpent - I dread to pursue the comparison -
							it was necessary to my happiness should be destroyed, I had too long
							enjoyed that situation which - Oh, Mrs. Milbanke! my soul shudders, my
							heart sickens, at the recollection of those happy days which are gone by
							for ever! - But of what avail are useless retrospections, perhaps they
							are even criminal, perhaps - Alas! If I will ever let you into the
							melancholy history, it is necessary that I should be more
							methodical!</p>
						<p>All civility and harmony, Mrs. Merton appeared to be the happiest of the
							happy, and the gayest of the gay, on becoming our guest. She was
							delighted at seeing Miss Danby, and seeing this, of course I pressed
							that lady to be with us as frequently as possible; this she acceded to:
							the Singletons also, drawn by the magnetic attractions of a London lady,
							were daily at the park. We formed constant walking parties, and Mrs.
							Merton’s languor and ennui seemed have been left in London: she was more
							pleasant than I had ever seen her; perhaps she smiled like Judas, to
							destroy more surely! The incognita at the cottage, her mysterious
							seclusion, had frequently been the topic of conversation; in vain had
							Colonel Singleton essayed every means for getting a peep at her; but her
							impervious solitude could not be broken in upon by any method he had
							devised. The ladies were all anxious to know something of her, and we
							frequently took our evening walks near the cottage, and directed our
							looks to its Gothic easements, vainly trying to glimpse the object which
							had excited our curiosity! Mrs. Milbanke, do you remember the night of
							the seventeenth of - ? With you it might have been calm; with us it was
							tremendous beyond expression! - No hurricane that I ever witnessed in
							the West Indies equalled it! The continued flashing of vivid lightning,
							the almost uninterrupted peals of thunder, the torrents of rain, - it
							seemed as if Heaven was pouring out its vengeance on our heads - every
							individual of the family arose: from my windows I saw the oaks rifted
							from their trunks; - I saw their branches hurled along the avenue; the
							whole park exhibited a scene of ruin and desolation! Mrs. Merton’s
							shrieks rent the air, for she had no command over herself, while a cold
							damp struck at my heart, which I never felt but once before. That once,
							- oh, Mrs. Milbanke! it was before the marriage altar! - Yet I was
							soothed by the voice of my husband; I hoped, I trusted in the Almighty,
							and I thought of and prayed for those who were exposed to the "pelting
							of the pitiless storm!" The morning at length broke, the sun rose with
							unclouded majesty, as if to smile at the devastating influence of its
							precursor, night. We all congratulated one another on our safety; Mrs.
							Merton was as much exhilarated, as she had been depressed on the
							preceding night; and my Augustus - mine did I say - oh, Mrs. Milbanke!
							Mr. Fairfield, ever anxious to be of service to his fellow-creatures,
							proposed my making a tour of the cottages, and inquiring what injuries
							their poor tenants had sustained, in order that he might relieve
							them.</p>
						<p>"The lady at the park gate must have been dreadfully alarmed, I should
							think," said Mrs. Merton.</p>
						<p>"Indeed she must," quickly returned Augstus. "Olivia, my love, you never
							stand on the formal punctilios of ceremony, when it is in your power to
							be useful; we will go by the way of the park gate, and you shall
							approach the house, and send in your message to its inhabitant."</p>
						<p>An unusual animation seemed to overspread the countenance of Mrs. Merton,
							as she announced her intention of accompanying us in our errand of
							mercy.</p>
						<p>"The park is very damp," said Augustus, who, I believe, did not much wish
							to have her witness of his acts of beneficence; as he usually fulfilled
							the law of Revelation, and suffered not his left hand to know what his
							right hand had done.</p>
						<p>"Oh, you have taught me to laugh at my foolish fears concerning damp and
							cold!" said Mrs. Merton.</p>
						<p>Miss Danby and Miss Singleton then walked in, and began to give a history
							of their affright during the storm. The cupola of the Pagoda had been
							carried away; Mr. Ingot ran into a dark closet, and her ladyship had
							been employed in trying repellent experiments to keep off the electric
							fluid, after stuffing her son’s ears with cotton, to prevent his hearing
							the thunder. On hearing whither we were bound, the ladies, with one
							voice, declared they would be of the party; we could not refuse, but we
							contented ourselves with a very cursory view of the little cottages in
							the village, Mr. Fairfield giving private instructions for those persons
							to call at the house, whom he judged in most need of assistance. We at
							lengthy reached the park gate by a circuitous route; for frequently had
							our progress been impeded by the interposing branches of the oaks,
							which, rent by the storm, lay entangled under our feet, while the rain
							had washed off the grassy turf, as though it had been inundated by a
							whelming flood, and the trees were entirely divested of their verdure;
							the poor sheep seemed to herd together, as if not yet recovered from
							their affright; and the birds flew about in circles, their nests
							entirely destroyed. I hinted to the ladies, my companions, that I
							thought it better to advance to the house alone; but, impelled by
							curiosity, they proceeded, and only halted a few paces, whilst I applied
							my hand to the knocker. At the moment I did so, a violent shriek from
							within saluted my ears. The door was burst open - a female rushed out.
							She sprang by me, crying, "Save, oh save me! - Augustus, save me!" - She
							sank on the turf at the feet of Mr. Fairfield. - Colonel Singleton
							followed from the cottage. He tried, in some confusion, to account for
							his appearance; but I heard him not - I saw Augustus only. -
							Astonishment and surprise were the expression which momentarily
							overspread his features, - but to these appeared to succeed, fear,
							apprehension, anxiety, love! - Yes, love, Mrs. Milbanke! - He held the
							inanimate form of the lady to his bosom; he conjured her to open her
							eyes, to awake - he called her his wife - his best-beloved, his lamented
							Angelina! - He saw, he heard me not, even while I frantically knelt at
							his feet, and conjured him to tell me the meaning of the words he
							uttered!</p>
						<p>The three ladies expressed their wonder and their surprise in terms
							suitable to their respective characters; but I remember that both Mrs.
							Merton and Miss Danby seemed to recognize the lady: they called her
							Angelina - Miss Forester! - Too well I remembered these names - I felt
							the stroke of anguish - it seemed to pierce my heart - to fire my brain!
							- I, too, fainted in my turn! How long I continued in this state, I know
							not; when I came to my recollection, I found myself in bed; Caroline
							Lumley and Dido sitting one on either side of me. I spoke, but I had no
							idea of the occurrence that had brought me there.</p>
						<p>"Blessed be our good God!" said Dido; "I hear my dear Missee speak yet
							once more again!"</p>
						<p>While Caroline kissed my hand in silence, a tear dropped on it. The
							traces of memory were now busily returning; they threatened to unsettle
							my brain! - I passed my hand before my face, and then said, -</p>
						<p>"Oh, Caroline! was it a soul-harrowing vision that I saw? or did Augustus
							clasp another to his heart?"</p>
						<p>"Do not agitate yourself, my dearest Mrs. Fairfield!" said Caroline; yet
							her own voice faltered, as she pronounced the last two words. "You must
							not think - every thing depends on your being tranquil!"</p>
						<p>"Must not think!" said I - "Alas! I see, I feel there is some dreadful
							calamity fallen on my defenceless head!"</p>
						<p>Caroline sighed - Dido fell on her knees - she collapsed her hands
							together, and turning up her eyes, so as to show only their whites, she
							muttered some words with a fervency of supplication, which convinced me
							that her honest heart was bursting for her mistress!"</p>
						<p>"Who was that lady, whom I saw in the park?" asked I.</p>
						<p>"Pardon me, - I must not, cannot answer you!" said the gentle
							Caroline.</p>
						<p>I referred my questions to Dido with my eyes.</p>
						<p>"Oh, accursed, accursed wretches!" said Dido; "they that contrived so
							black a plot! - Oh, my dear Missee, we will go back to our own good
							country! - we will pray to a good God Almighty, to teach you and me to
							forget that we was ever set foot on England land! My poor Missee was
							happy in our own dear Jamaica; there every body knew she was Mr.
							Fairfield’s daughter - good Massa’s child - and, not a blacky of them
							all would have touched one sacred hair of her head, but in the way of
							reverence and affection!</p>
						<p>But here - oh, could the poor good Massa speak out of his grave, he
							should cry shame and vengeance on ’em all ! - Ah, my dear lady; you be
							too good to stay here!"</p>
						<p>It was in vain that Caroline Lumley besought Dido to be pacified; her
							heart was relieved by pouring forth all the bitterness of her
							spirit!</p>
						<p>"Where is Mr. Fairfield?" asked I.</p>
						<p>Caroline spoke not; she averted her head.</p>
						<p>"Where is your master, Dido?" asked I.</p>
						<p>"Dido has no master - Dido’s poor old Massee be in heaven!" said she; her
							lip quivering, and turning pale from passionate emotion as she
							spoke.</p>
						<p>"The uncertainty under which I labour, will unsettle my returning
							reason," said I. "Caroline, if you expect mercy at the day of judgement,
							tell me who was the lady I saw at the park gate? Was she - is she - or
							is she not? - speak, I charge you, speak, if you will not have me die
							before you!"</p>
						<p>"She is - she is" - Caroline’s tears fell down her cheeks - "she is Mr.
							Fairfield’s - "</p>
						<p>"You shall not say it - you dare to say the word in Dido’s hearing,
							before her dear Missee!" putting her hand before Caroline’s mouth.</p>
						<p>"His wife - his wife!" cried I, "is it not so? Great God! then what am
							I?"</p>
						<p>"An angel, a sacrificed angel!" cried Dido, again falling on her knees.
							"Ah, Missee! dear, dearest Missee! exert your own self - struggle - live
							- to show them all, that you be Mr. Fairfield’s daughter!"</p>
						<p>"Oh my father, my beloved, my regretted father!" cried I, "if you had
							lived, this had not been! - Yet I would not recall thee from
							happiness."</p>
						<p>"Oh no, no - we must not, we cannot!" said Dido, sobbing
							convulsively.</p>
						<p>"And where is Augustus?" asked I, Caroline was again silent: even Dido
							was so likewise. "Where is Auguastus?" repeated I.</p>
						<p>"He is at my father's," said Caroline. "Alas, Mrs.-! alas, madam! he is
							greatly to be pitied!"</p>
						<p>"Oh, soften not, but steel my heart towards him, Caroline!" said I. "I
							must not think of him - of the destroyer of my peace - my fame - my
							happiness!"</p>
						<p>"But hear his justification, dearest madam."</p>
						<p>"Never, never!" said I; "never must I see him more! Better that I should
							believe him guilty, than to dwell on his virtues, to contemplate on his
							perfections, and to think of the felicity which once was mine! - Oh,
							Caroline, I am awakened from a dream of bliss, as short as it was
							delightful!"</p>
						<p>"And my good, my dear Missee, too, who was so kind to every body - shem
							who was every-body’s friend - she to be so cruelly used; they think the
							poor blacks have no hearts; but I believe they have more heart and soul
							too than some of the whites - God help them all!"</p>
						<p>Oh, Mrs. Milbanke, I have written till my eyes are nearly blinded. As I
							retrace my sufferings, it seems, that to have existed under them, I must
							have had a harder heart than the white ones, as Dido calls them.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="entry">
						<head type="sub">IN CONTINUATION</head>
						<p>WHAT a day was the one I have been describing! - Towards the evening, Mr.
							Lumley came to visit me; he feelingly entered into my distress, and
							while he lamented its cause, he pointed my thoughts towards heaven, for
							consolation; plainly showing me that all other hope was fled. I inquired
							for Augustus; my soul was upon the rack to hear of him; my heart (my
							variable, my fluctuating, but my still doating heart) was longing to
							hear his exculpation, even though he could be nothing more to me! I
							longed to know that he had not designedly planned my destruction; that
							he had not voluntarily caused my irremediable wretchedness!</p>
						<p>"He is greatly to be pitied," said Mr. Lumley; "his distress is but
							little inferior to your own. To know himself the cause, though the
							innocent cause, of your ruin, is no common affliction; and his
							sensibility is too acute, his regard for you was too fervent, to let him
							bear it with firmness!"</p>
						<p>"But how could he be in ignorance of the existence of his - "</p>
						<p>"Alas! there is the mystery," said Mr. Lumley; "a mystery, as yet
							undiscovered: but I trust, that Heaven, in its own good time, will bring
							to light the projectors and the executors of an almost unheard-of
							cruelty. Mr. Fairfield has nothing to accuse himself of, except his
							concealed and clandestine marriage; a mode of proceeding altogether
							wrong, for, though existing circumstances may sometimes appear to
							acquire it, yet, in my opinion, it ought never to be adopted: disguise
							and concealment invariably hide or lead to something wrong; and the
							consequences have frequently been fatal!"</p>
						<p>"Fatal indeed!" sighed I. "Oh, Mr. Lumley, had Augustus but confessed to
							me that he had once been married - had he only breathed a hint of the
							kind, and of his uncertainty with regard to the fate of his wife - "</p>
						<p>"He felt no uncertainty," said Mr. Lumley. "To Mr. Fairfield her death
							appeared certain; and, much as he loved her - tenderly as he mourned her
							loss, I heard him aver (and, with what sincerity, his whole countenance
							testified) that he had rather, much rather, have had her lain for ever
							in the tomb, than by her sudden re-appearance and restoration to him,
							have thus caused the desolation of your happiness! Even Angelina, though
							supposing herself abandoned by a faithless seducer, even she would have
							been contented to remain in her disgraceful privacy, rather than have
							caused such an excess of misery by her re-union with her husband! - She
							seems an amiable and pitiable young creature; the faults of her husband
							were hers likewise; she should not have suffered her passion to overcome
							her principles, by yielding to a clandestine union. - Three estimable
							persons are thus made wretched for the present, though time - "</p>
						<p>I hastily interrupted him.</p>
						<p>"Time cannot cure a broken heart, Mr. Lumley!"</p>
						<p>"Ah, my dear lady, I expect great things from you; this is an arduous
							struggle: but I firmly believe your strength of mind is equal to it. You
							must exert your courage - your fortitude - and that excellent
							understanding which you possess; moreover, you must lean on that Rock of
							support which will never daily you, - remembering, that these ‘light
							afflictions, which continue but for a day, will work for you a far more
							exceeding weight of glory!’"</p>
						<p>Ah! Mrs. Milbanke, if I had not felt consolation from such words, I had
							been unworthy the name of Christian!</p>
					</div>
					<div type="entry">
						<head type="sub">IN CONTINUATION</head>
						<p>AT length I begin to rouse myself from that state of inactive despair
							which had overwhelmed my faculties. For more than six weeks have I been
							confined to the house; during that period Augustus has continued the
							guest of Mr. Lumley, fearing to invade the delicacy of my situation by
							appearing here; and scrupulously avoiding from visiting at the cottage,
							lest he should hurt my feelings. To tell you the various plans which
							have agitated my mind, during this painful period, is impossible. I have
							applied to Mr. Lumley for his advice, and he has been the bearer of
							daily messages, of the most generous kind, from my - alas! I was going
							to call him - my Augustus. He has entreated me to continue at the Park -
							to consider it as my own; he has offered to remove to the utmost
							extremity of the kingdom, that, if possible, I may never be reminded
							that he continues in existence. - Alas! I can never forget him, Mrs.
							Milbanke; I can never forget his virtues - his kindness - his attention
							to your poor child! Wherever I go, the remembrance of these will break
							in on my tranquility, and by the strong force of contrast, blight every
							present prospect. I am not ambitious, my dear friend; you know, I never
							was. Retirement always suited my disposition, and the turn of my mind; -
							now, the obscurest nook, the most retired cot, would be my choice, where
							I might hide my head, and my sufferings together, and ponder over them
							unmolested. But yet, in privacy, I pant for independence! You, Mrs.
							Milbanke, are fully acquainted with the strange tenour of my father’s
							will. By a wonderful transition of fortune, I am now, once again, likely
							to be dependent on the generosity of Mr. George Merton.Yes! my dear
							friend, it is even so; - this has been the point to which his wife has
							aimed. Heaven forgive me, if I wrong her by my suspicions; but I fear
							she has played a black part in order to rob me of that fortune which I
							did not value! A scene of distress, like that which was exhibited here,
							was, I find, too overpowering for the weak nerves of Mrs. Merton; she
							left the park, at a period, when one victim of her machinations lay
							stretched, in a state of insensibility, on a sick bed; - when another
							was nearly wrought up to a state of phrensy by his opposing feelings; -
							and a third, who had long been an innocent sufferer, experienced only a
							variation of suffering from the recent discovery. Ah, Mrs. Milbanke! do
							you think that creature deserves the name of woman, who voluntarily
							deserted persons whom she professed to esteem, at such a period.</p>
						<p>Eager to exculpate himself, and to convince me, that he had not been
							actuated by any mercenary motives, in forming an union with me,
							Augustus, at his first return of recollection, sent for a lawyer, and
							though he left himself, his wife, and his child, (yes, a child, a
							beautiful boy of two years of age), entirely destitute, he made a formal
							renunciation of all claim to my property. Not so, his brother: - by the
							earliest post which could arrive after Mrs. George Merton’s return to
							London, her husband wrote to Augustus, and said,</p>
						<p>"That a recent discover having proved, that he had no claim or right to
							any part of the late Mr. Fairfield’s fortune, he demanded its
							restoration, under the second clause of the will - and that if it was
							not voluntarily yielded, he should have recourse to legal means."</p>
						<p>Stabbed to the heart at such an irrefragable proof of mercenary
							selfishness, feeling acutely for my situation, and disdaining that any
							interested motive should, for an instant, attach to his character,
							Augustus as hastily disclaimed all pretensions to my fortune, in a
							letter to his brother, as he had previously done in one to me. Mr.
							Lumley read me a copy of the letter - Ah! Mrs. Milbanke, what
							indignation at his brother’s turpitude - what disdain at his false
							accusations - what pity - what compassion - let me say, what affection
							towards me, did it not contain?</p>
						<p>"That God who sees my heart," said he, "knows that I married Miss
							Fairfield from the best, the purest intentions! It has pleased him to
							let our secret enemies triumph over the demolition of her happiness, for
							whom I would have yielded my life with cheerfulness. Oh, brother! let
							not avarice - let not any ambitious or inhuman instigations of those
							around you, prevail on you to rob an orphan of her dower, even though
							the law should make it yours. Remember, that here, law and justice must
							be at variance; any dispassionate person must see the meaning of the
							clause annexed to my uncle’s will in your favour. Your name will be held
							in contempt, and every tear of the forlorn and helpless Olivia, will be
							measured against your cruelty at the awful day of retribution! What has
							she now left which can reconcile her to life? Despoiled - fatally
							despoiled of her name and title in society, it is by benefiting her
							fellow-creatures, that a mind like hers can alone experience
							consolation: and would you deprive her of the means of exerting the
							benevolence of her disposition - the ever-active impulse of her pious
							soul? Oh, George - George! it is I, it is your brother, who has been the
							innocent means of ruining this angel’s happiness! It is I, that on my

						<opener><dateline><placeName>Cliff Cot, near ****, Monmouthshire.</placeName></dateline></opener>

						<p>MUCH has been done within the last fortnight, and your Olivia is now
							addressing you from a very humble cottage in a retired part of
							Monmouthshire! When I found that I was considered by Mr. George Merton,
							as living at his expense, during the time I continued at New Park, it
							required little resolution to form the determination of quitting it as
							soon as possible. I made my intention known to Mr. Lumley and desired
							him to bring Augustus acquainted with it. Mr. Lumley attempted to
							dissuade me - I was not to be moved.</p>
						<p>"Hear me, my good friend," said I, "and you will agree with me in the
							propriety of my resolve. To be indebted to the ostentatious generosity
							of the Mertons, for such a situation as this, is impossible! I believe
							the law might give them my fortune, and I have a spirit which disdains
							to enter into a litigation: - and without him, who, once cheered every
							scene to me, this house would be a gloomy prison! - Ah, Mr. Lumley! that
							cottage at the park-gate, that little cottage, would contain the love of
							Augustus; and that would be a palace of content. But I must drive such
							vain ideas from my mind! Am I not acting a very selfish part, Mr.
							Lumley, by remaining here? I am the barrier which separates Augustus
							from his - !" (I could not utter the word); "because misfortune and
							irremediable suffering have overtaken me, shall I continue to blight the
							prospects of all those around me? No! - I trust I have a better heart.
							If I cannot be happy myself, I will not retard the happiness of
							others!"</p>
						<p>I sighed deeply, and weak "womanish tears," almost blinded my eyes, at
							the moment when I made these (I trust) virtuous resolves. My tears were
							infectious; the good rector wiped his eyes.</p>
						<p>"Oh, come here, ye prejudiced, narrow-minded beings!" said he,
							apostrophizing from the feelings of the moment, and entirely losing the
							idea of my presence in them: - "Oh come hither, ye advocates for
							slavery! - ye who talk of the inferiority of reason, which attends a
							difference of colour, - oh, come here! and see a woman, - a young - a
							tender woman, who, in the contemplation of her own unparalleled
							misfortunes, and with a heart almost broken by affliction, yet rises
							with unexampled pre-eminence of virtue! - See here a conquest over self,
							which ye would vainly try to imitate!"</p>
						<p>"Ah! my good sir," said I, "I know what is right, and I trust the
							Almighty will support me in the due performance of it. I had a glorious
							example in my mother, Mr. Lumley. - My mother, though an African slave,
							when once she had felt the power of that holy religion which you preach,
							from that hour she relinquished him, who had been dearer to her than
							existence! And shall I then shrink from a conflict which she sustained?
							Shall I not go on, upheld by an approving conscience, and the bright
							hope of futurity?"</p>

						<head type="sub">IN CONTINUATION</head>

						<p>I HAD seen a cottage advertised to be let in Monmouthshire, which seemed
							to meet my wishes, with regard to the retiredness of the situation, and
							its size, which, from the printed description, was diminutive enough;
							thither I wished to bend my course, and, previous to the above
							conversation with Mr. Lumley, I had written to make inquiries concerning
							it. In the interim, I understood from him, that Augustus had received a
							very angry letter from his father, accusing him of the most criminal
							intentions in concealing his former marriage, and pointing to this as
							the cause of all the distressing events which had ensued. Mr. Merton
							ended, by disclaiming all interest or connexion with him; and he bade
							him seek that maintenance for his wife and child by his own exertions,
							of which he was justly deprived in every other way.</p>
						<p>I also received a letter from each of the Mr. Mertons. My uncle condoled
							with me in a very polite and complimentary style on my "recent
							distress:" - talked of my fortitude and strength of mind, and offered me
							all the service and advice in his power, and subscribed himself, as
							usual, my very affectionate uncle! The professions of Mr. George were a
							vast deal more diffuse (I shall enclose both the letters); it was plain
							that he considered himself as the master of my future fate, and after
							bidding me not to despond, but to be reconciled to my misfortune, he
							ended with almost commanding me to come to London, and to place myself
							under the protection of Mrs. George Merton!</p>
						<p>Disdaining to receive even pretended favours from such hands, I did not
							answer this letter; but replying to my uncle, I made him acquainted with
							my intentions in regard to my future mode of life, and voluntarily
							relinquished all further claim to my father’s fortune, if he would
							secure to me, from his son, fifty pounds every three months. This, I
							said, would secure a maintenance for myself and Dido, and I wished for
							nothing further.</p>
						<p>The earliest post brought me a fifty pound bank note, as an advanced
							quarter, from Mr. George Merton, with his promise of remitting the like
							sum every three months. The account of Cliff cottage was satisfactory; I
							settled to take it by letter; and ere we mentioned that we had fixed on
							a place of residence, Dido had privately began to pack up my wardrobe.
							The jewels which had been presented to me on my marriage by Mr. Merton,
							it was my firm resolve to give to Mrs. Augustus Merton; I had also a
							great curiosity to see her, and I resolved to be the bearer of them
							myself!</p>
						<p>In the course of my melancholy tale, I feel that I hurry over some
							occurrences, while on others I am unnecessarily diffuse; but you will
							impute these seeming inconsistencies of style to their real cause. But
							as I am not sat down in one unvaried routine of solitude, and as writing
							employs my time, if it does not amuse it, I will endeavour to be as
							particular in my narrative as I can.</p>
						<p>God bless you, my dear madam ! - till to-morrow I must throw aside my
							pen.</p>

						<p>WITH the approach of misfortune, my summer friends flew off. I imagine
							that Miss Danby had given out at the Pagoda, that my fortune was
							forfeited to Mr. George Merton, - and to trample on the fallen, is no
							new trait in the character of the Ingots. I received a pompous and
							pedantic note from her ladyship, where, after condoling with me on my
							reverse of fortune, she advised me to go out to the East Indies, where,
							with my accomplishments, she doubted not but my colour would be
							overlooked, - and, by a feigned name, I might soon form an advantageous
							matrimonial connexion.</p>
						<p>I should imagine that the crimson was the predominant colour in my cheek
							as I perused this vile scroll, which finished with an offer of
							protection, and letters of introduction at Bengal, from Sir Marmaduke,
							if I approved the plan. I threw the note into the fire, and sent word to
							the servant who brought it, that it required no answer. The next piece
							of penmanship I shall transcribe verbatim:</p>

						<p>Not even to Mr. Lumley could I prevail on myself to relate this insult. -
							Alas! I feared not for myself; but had Augustus heard of it, his
							indignant spirit would have fired, and the consequences might have been
							dreadful. Silence, a proud silence, I have observed on this disgraceful
							subject, except to you. I feared even to put my resentment into words,
							in addressing the colonel, lest by any means it should transpire; and I
							trust this sapient hero will construe the silence of the Woman of Colour
							into utter contempt. -</p>
						<p>But, oh! how slight do these insults appear from the proud and the
							unprincipled, when contrasted with my real source of distress! The whole
							world is to me as nothing; its applause or its censure would alike be
							disregarded by me: though I trust I shall ever retain strength and
							resolution to act, so as not to deserve the latter, though I may not
							inherit the former!</p>
					</div>
					<div type="entry">
						<head type="sub">IN CONTINUATION</head>

						<p>EVERY thing was prepared for my journey into Monmouthshire, I had not
							revealed my determination to a single person, save my faithful Dido. I
							dreaded the persuasive entreaties of Mr. Lumley; I dreaded the
							affectionate sorrow of Caroline and of Waller; I dreaded to hear of the
							distracting emotions of Augustus!</p>
						<p>The evening preceding the day of my departure at length arrived. I
							resolved to walk across the park, and to visit my innocent rival;
							perhaps there was something of romance in this resolution, but I had
							determined on it; I longed to behold this (to me) most interesting of
							females; I wished to show her that I retained no illiberal prejudices
							against her; therefore putting the casket in my pocket, which contained
							my intended present, and flinging my shawl round my shoulders, I sallied
							forth. My soul seemed tarmed with a gloomy sort of resolution; the
							evening was in unison with the feelings of my mind, it was cold and
							stormy; the quick receding clouds as they passed above me, now illuming,
							now shading my way, presaged a coming storm. The park was damp, the
							branches of the trees lay on the ground; it seemed as if even the
							inanimate objects had felt the recent shock which had shattered my
							nerves, and were mourning the wreck of happiness: the wild thought was
							soothing my soul, yet i felt that my recent convalescence prevented my
							walking with my usual step- now firm, now unsteady and feeble. I more
							than once tottered to a tree, and held by it to support me, while I
							recovered breath to proceed; when, turning to cast a look at the house,
							from a point of view where Augustus and I had always been used to admire
							it together, I heard a hasty and approaching stemp, from a copse of
							underwood which was near me; - the little gate fell, and Augustus stood
							before me! - pale, wan, his hair dishevelled, his whole form forcibly
							proclaiming the extent of his late sufferings! - I started on seeing
							him.</p>
						<p>"Oh, best - most injured of women!" said he, clasping his hands wildly
							together, and flitting by me as he spoke. -</p>
						<p>"Augustus!" said I, for my resolutions returned with the pressure of the
							moment; "Augustus! And do you then fly me?"</p>
						<p>"And can you for a moment bear my hateful presence?" asked he, quickly
							returning, but his countenance evincing the agony of his mental
							conflict.</p>
						<p>"Yes, I thank God that I can!" said I, "though I did not seek this
							interview; yet will I not shun it, but rather rejoice in the opportunity
							which is thus accidentally afforded me, of assuring you that I feel not
							the slightest spark of resentment towards you; that I will fervently
							beseech Heaven for your future happiness, and pray that you may forget
							that there exists such a being as myself!"</p>
						<p>"And can you do this? Incomparable creature! can you do this?" said
							Augustus, as he threw himself on his knees before me, and frantically
							seized my hand!</p>
						<p>"Yes," cried I; "I can do more than this, if you will not unnerve my
							resolution, by thus giving way to the excess of your feelings! - Pray, I
							entreat you, rise Mr. Fairfield."</p>
						<p>"Fairfield! - alas!" said he, "I no longer bear that honoured name; I am
							unworthy to bear the name which belongs to you!"</p>
						<p>"Whatever name you bear," said I, "I shall alway consider you as friend,
							- you shall always be regarded in my memory with esteem."</p>
						<p>"Kill me not by such kindness; reproach, accuse, revile me; call me base
							destroyer of your fame, your peace, and I will plead guilty to it all -
							but in mercy spare me from those words of softness, which are sharper,
							which cut deeper here," laying his hand on his heart, "than pointed
							arrows!"</p>
						<p>"Rise, pray rise!" said I; "this posture ill befits me to allow, or you
							to retain - Pray, Augustus, exert yourself, re-assume your
							self-possession; fancy you are talking to a friend from whom you are
							going to be separated for a long period; a friend who takes this
							opportunity of lamenting, that the transitions of fortune prevent her
							from demonstrating her regard in any stronger way than words." -</p>
						<p>"The transitions of fortune!" repeated he, stamping his foot with
							vehemence on the ground, "say, rather, the hellish machinations, the
							sordid avarice of perfidious fiends of malice! - Oh, Olivia, amiable,
							revered Olivia! how may you regret the day when you left your native
							island! - better to have been landed on a savage shore of barbarians,
							than to have found, as you have done, your bitterest enemies, in uncle,
							brother, husband! those names which, in the common lot of human life,
							are associated with all that is affectionate and tender!"</p>
						<p>"Oh!" said I, the tears rolling over my face, and wringing my hands in
							agony, "let me entreat you to leave me Augustus, if you will thus add to
							my distress. I thought I had acquired fortitude to sustain any trial,
							but, indeed, if you will thus give way to useless recrimination, you
							will make me as frantic as yourself!"</p>
						<p>"Oh, pardon - pardon!" said he; "I know not what I do, or what I
							say!"</p>
						<p>"Come with me," said I, once more reassuming some appearance of
							composure; "come with me."</p>
						<p>"Whither?" asked he.</p>
						<p>"I am going to visit your Angelina!"</p>
						<p>Augustus staggered as he held my hand - his cheek was blanched - he
							looked at me - never can I forget the expression of entranced admiration
							and surprise, which his features underwent.</p>
						<p>"Can you be serious, Olivia - Do I touch your hand? do I feel your
							throbbing pulse? or are you not a being of ethereal mold?"</p>
						<p>"Alas! a very mortal!" I exclaimed; "but, anxious to behold your
							Angelina, to love her for your sake, to look at your little boy - and to
							tell your wife, that I will pray for her and your felicity - I have
							determined on going to her, and let us go together, my friend!" - The
							big tear rolled down his cheek.</p>
						<p>"I have not seen - I have not been at the cottage since that day - that
							never-to-be-forgotten day."</p>
						<p>"I know it," said I; "Mr. Lumley has acquainted me with your self-command
							and forbearance, and it is your example which has excited my emulation -
							Come, you cannot refuse to go with me - but remember, that though you
							have seen me overcome by the sight of your self-upbraidings, together
							with the sudden surprise of this interview, I am not going to overwhelm
							Angelina with a picture of my sufferings, and enhance a sacrifice to
							her, which I am constrained to make. - No! I am going to speak comfort
							to her, by telling her that I hope soon to regain my own tranquillity,
							and that it is my earnest hope that her re-union with her husband may be
							lasting and uninterrupted."</p>
						<p>"Where could you acquire such heroism, such generosity of soul?" asked
							Augustus; "from whence do you service such unexampled magnanimity?"</p>
						<p>"When the mind is thoroughly impressed with the consciousness of a
							super-intending Providence," said I, "it is taught to submit patiently
							to all its chastisements. ‘Sweet, are the uses of adversity,’ if it
							teaches us to amend our lives!"</p>
						<p>"Amend!" said Augustus, "how is perfection to be amended?"</p>
						<p>"Ah!" said I, "flatter me no longer with praise which I must never more
							hear - perhaps, even in this instance, I have erred - perhaps, I was too
							much elated by your approbation - perhaps, in the redundancy of my
							happiness, I forgot that this was not my abiding place; and by timely
							chastisement I shall be brought back to a knowledge of myself!"</p>
						<p>"If you can thus find any reason for self-accusation," said Augustus,
							"what must I feel, who am conscious that it was owing to my clandestine
							concealment of my early marriage, that my enemies plotted my ruin, and
							cruelly produced this desolation?"</p>
						<p>"That your secrecy in this respect was wrong," said I, "must be allowed;
							but by the faults of the past take a warning with respect to the
							future!"</p>
						<p>"I can hardly ask it" said he; "but if at a future hour, I should have
							resolution to write down the events which led to this sad catastrophe,
							will you deign to read the history with candour and lenity, for I feel
							that to the character of Angelina Forrester I owe this explanation!"</p>
						<p>"I will read it with all the indulgence you can wish," said I, "for I
							have already acquitted you in my mind."</p>
						<p>"Generous - generous Olivia!" said he. -</p>
						<p>"The Lumleys will always know my residence," said I; "to them you may
							safely consign the packet -"</p>
						<p>"The Lumleys?" returned Augustus; "and must I then remain in ignorance of
							it? - will you seclude yourself from me? shall I never be informed of
							your health, of your welfare? - shall I constantly be accusing myself as
							the destroyer of your peace? - shall my tortured imagination be
							eternally haunting me with the remembrance of your misery?"</p>
						<p>"Pray talk more rationally," said I; "a correspondence with you must be
							declined for both - for all our sakes; the sooner you forget me the
							better; the sooner I -" I stopped, I checked the unbidden sigh, I wiped
							off the involuntary tear and proceeded - "Augustus, you have not yet
							learned to know me. It is part of my religious duty to endeavour to
							resign myself to the all-wise dispensations of the Most High. I scruple
							not to own to you, that, as my husband, I loved you with the warmest
							affection; that tie no longer exists, it is now become my duty to force
							you from my heart, - painful, difficult I acknowledge this to be, for
							your virtues had enthroned you there! But this world is not our abiding
							place. I look forwards with faith and hope to that eternally happy state
							where there is neither ‘marrying nor giving in marriage,’ where there
							shall be no more sorrow, and where ‘all tears shall be wiped away from
							all eyes!’"</p>
						<p>"Heavenly, heavenly Olivia!" said Augustus, "I could now reverence thee
							as a beautified spirit! - Oh, how weak must I appear in your eyes!"</p>
						<p>We had now reached the cottage door - Ah, Mrs. Milbanke! with what
							different sensations had I last approached it! I involuntarily shuddered
							as the hollow sound of the knocker reverberate,d as before, through the
							little dwelling - My feelings, as I entered the parlour, where sat
							Angelina at work, her sweet little boy playing at her side on the
							carpet, it would be impossible to describe; or to portray the
							conflicting emotions, and the animated transports, of the re-united wife
							and husband! While the gentle, the trembling Angelina hid her face, and
							poured her tears into her husband’s bosom, I caught the innocent
							resemblance of Augustus to mine, and poured my caresses on him, that I
							might not appear as though I grudged them their happiness. The
							gratitude, the bashful timidity of Angelina, her dove-like eyes, her
							transparent complexion, the delicacy of her fragile form, all rendered
							her a most interesting object. She seems peculiarly to require the
							assistance and support of the lordly creature man, and to be
							ill-calculated for braving the difficulties of life alone. The
							speechless astonishment with which she received my present of the
							jewels, I shall never forget. I could have said, "These radiant gems
							which banish happiness but mock misfortune, I can easily relinquish" -
							but I contented myself with plainly desiing her to convert them to any
							purpose which she should deem most beneficial, and lamented that i had
							nothing better worth her acceptance to offer; then turning to Augustus,
							I said, "That your father will relent, and again receive you into his
							favour, I do not doubt, else should I be sorry that I had stipulated
							only for a maintenance for myself out of my father’s fortune; but you
							know the delicacy of my situation, and will see that, with propriety, I
							could not assist you."</p>
						<p>"I know that you always act with consistency, with unexampled feeling,
							and consideration," said Augustus.</p>
						<p>I feared that he was again going to forget himself; I started up, I
							placed the little Augustus in his father’s arms, then taking his tiny
							hand, and joining it with both his parents, I said, "May heaven protect,
							and bless you all! May my fervent prayers be heard for your happiness!"
							and before any thing reached my ear, save the sigh of Augustus, I had
							quitted the house, and was once more in the park! I do not take any
							merit to myself, my dear Mrs. Milbanke, from having made this exertion -
							I was in some sort actuated by a romantic and curious spirit, and I felt
							relieved at having seen Angelina, and having beheld in her a woman who
							was likely to form the happiness of the husband who I must for ever
							relinquish!</p>
					</div>
					<div type="entry">
						<head type="sub">IN CONTINUATION</head>

						<p>A FORMAL parting with the Lumleys was not to be thought of; I wrote my
							adieus, my grateful thanks for their kindness. A note I wrote also to
							the good Mr. Bellfield, in which I lamented that my reverse of fortune
							prevented my exerting myself in the behalf of Waller and his Caroline;
							and said, "that it had been the sanguine wish of Augustus, as well as
							myself, to see them happy in each other." I thanked the good Bellfield
							for the friendly sympathy he had evinced for me, and told him, that from
							his example I would learn a lesson on heroism! These painful duties
							over, I knelt at the throne of mercy; I besought the Almighty to give me
							courage to bear the stroke of adversity, and to arm my mind with a
							portion of his divine grace!</p>
						<p>At an early hour in the morning, a hired chaise drew up, and, followed by
							the weeping Dido, I entered it. All the servants stood to catch a view
							of me as I walked across the hall; they reverenced my sorrows: but I
							heard their whispered prayers and blessings as I passed. I waved my hand
							in token of my thanks, and hurried into the carriage: there I gave way
							to the oppressive feelings of my heart, while Dido wrung her hands
							together, and sobbed at my side. The park, the lofty trees, the little
							cottage, its happy inmate, every animate, every inanimate object, added
							to my distress. I saw the little school which I had projected - the
							children which I had clothed - the peasants whom I had assisted. I
							recollected all the plans of long years of peace and comfort which I had
							laid, and, shuddering at my own temerity, I felt as if the Almighty had
							said to me those awful words, "Thou fool! this night why soul shall be
							required of thee!" For was it not early so? was not my husband my
							heart’s idol - my bosom’s sovereign? - Oh, Mrs. Milbanke! perhaps I
							loved him too much - perhaps "it is good for me to have been thus
							afflicted!"</p>
						<p>You will accuse me of having formed a harsh judgement, in having
							condemned Mrs. George Merton, without a proof, in the beginning of this
							narration; but, assured of her long and irreconcilable enmity to them,
							Augustus and Angelina, are convinced that she has been the prime agent
							of this plot against us all. Disappointed vanity, and craving ambition,
							two powerful incentives in the mind, where they are encouraged, urged
							her to work their ruin. But though this is completed in her idea, and
							though she may revel and smile on the money she has thus unjustly
							gained, yet their happiness is not dependent on outward circumstances;
							it is seated in their minds, and in their mutual affection, which she
							cannot deprive them of: and when she hears of their humble content, she
							may make the comparison between it and her own restless grandeur.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="entry">
						<head type="sub">IN CONTINUATION</head>

						<p>INDEED, I could be very happy in this little cottage did I not remember
							"such things were, and were most pleasant to me;" and did not Dido
							constantly bewail the change in a loud and clamorous grief, which,
							entirely viested of self, on my account will not be appeased. In vain I
							tell her, that if two courses were before me, I should prefer our boiled
							mutton; - she cries and shakes her head. I assure her that my little
							parlour is quite large enough. She asks if I recollect the "nice large
							rooms at Fairfield estate, and at Kingston?" She still pines for the
							"flesh-pots of Egypt" but not herself, but only for "Dear Missee."</p>
						<p>"For Dido would live upon salt herrings and rice all the long year round,
							if she could see Mr. Fairfield’s daughter served any way like
							herself."</p>
						<p>And the Monmouthshire girl whom we have hired as a drudge, is taught to
							consider me as a princess, at least, and must not dare to enter the
							parlour on any account, or to answer the bell, on pain of losing her
							place; so that, quite scared when she sees me, she drops fifty
							courtesies in a minute, and runs into some corner, with her back pinned
							against the wall, to let my high mightiness pass along. With the
							earliest dawn poor Dido leaves her pillow, in order to see my breakfast
							prepared for me as I have been used to have it. The various ways that
							she tries to allure me to eat; the various cakes and little dainties
							which she prepares, without my knowledge, to tempt my palate, would make
							you smile, who know my always-temperate appetite. But how can I be angry
							with this well-meant and affectionate attention? The body and mind of
							poor Dido are, however so unceasingly engaged, that I hear her strength
							will fail - and miserable in the extreme should I be, if I lost my
							faithful girl, and was conscious that she had been the victim of her
							attachment to her mistress.</p>

						<p>MINE is a very snug habitation; it is a thatched cottage on the side of a
							hill, which commands a noble view of the Wye, and the picturesque
							country which adorns its windings. I understand that this country is not
							so retired as I had imagined; many gentlemen’s seats are dispersed about
							the neighbourhood; their owners attracted by its wild and romantic
							scenery. An humble inhabitant of a lowly tenement like mine, is,
							how-ever, likely to pass unnoticed, and a woman of colour will not be a
							courted object. I wish to be unobserved - I do not want society - for
							although there is no real disgrace attached to my very peculiar
							situation, yet there is some appearance of it. I do not conceal my name;
							I contemn all mystery: and I never can voluntarily relinquish the
							beloved, the honoured name of Fairfield! - Believe me, my dear Mrs.
							Milbanke, I do not resign myself to a state of fruitless and blameable
							despondency. - No! I thank God, I keep myself employed; I endeavour to
							interest myself in my pursuits; I work in my little garden; I walk where
							I see a retired hut of poverty, and I try to do a little good to my
							fellow beings, even in my present narrow sphere. The blessings of
							constant employment I take to be a secret as well worth knowing as the
							philosopher’s stone; it is a remedy for most of the evils of life. Had I
							the instruction of youth, my first, my last words should be, "rational

						<p>I brought my books with me. I have scrupulously avoided opening one of a

						<p>I HAVE had a letter from Caroline Lumley; her style is as affectionate as
							her heart is sincere. She tenderly reproaches me for leaving New Park
							without seeing her; yet acknowledges that the pain of separation was
							spared to them all. She slightly glances at Augustus; and tells me, he
							has for the present taken up his residence at the cottage: that it is
							rumoured that Mr. George Merton means to retain the park as a summer
							residence.</p>
						<p>"I hope not," says the ingenuous girl; "for indeed, my dear madam, such a
							neighbour could give us no pleasant ideas."</p>
						<p>With the utmost simplicity she tells me, that her walks have never
							extended beyond the boundaries of her father’s glebe, since I have
							quitted the neighbourhood. I understand from this, that she has not yet
							lain her prejudices aside, and visited Angelina, as I desired she would.
							Augustus has sent regularly to the rectory, to hear if they have had any
							tidings of me; and they had sent him the intelligence of my safe arrival
							at my new residence.</p>
						<p>I have thus given you the heads of this affectionate girl’s letter. It is
							delightful to be esteemed by those who are worthy, and I feel much
							comfort in the friendship which follows me with so much kindness into
							this retirement!</p>
						<p>No incident occurs, worth relating, the monotonous life which I lead at
							present, yet I shall not cease to scribble my dear friend.</p>

						<p>CAROLINE LUMLEY writes me, that Augustus has been sent for, express, to
							London. That it is reported that his father is dying; that he has taken
							Angelina and his boy with him; and that the cottage is shut up. May the
							Almighty soften Mr. Merton’s heart - may his forgiveness reach the ear
							of his son, and pave the way to his own forgiveness reach the ear of his
							son, and pave the way to his own forgiveness from a heavenly Father -
							and may he provide for the innocent Angelina and her unoffending
							offspring! I shall be most anxious to hear the result of this visit. I
							wrote to Caroline by the return of the post, and charged her to give me
							the earliest intelligence which should reach her. Surely my uncle will
							be reconciled to Augustus - surely he will make a provision for his

						<p>DID I not tell you, some time ago, that my poor Dido looked wan and
							dispirited, and that I attributed it to the effects of dher zealous and
							arduous exertions for me? To-day she is all cheerful hilarity. She walks
							about with her head erect, as is usual with her when labouring with any
							pleasing intelligence, of which she chooses to make a temporary
							concealment. Were you to observe her mysterious, yet consequential
							looks, you must be diverted; for, in spite of the solemnity which she
							tries to assume, I perceive that she is constantly pursing up her thick
							lips, to prevent their widening into a smile of satisfaction. I see a
							pleasing surprise is in store for her dear Missee; perhaps a fine
							dessert, or some favourite flowers: whatever it be, I must try to evince
							my gratitude by a pleased reception of her favour.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="entry">
						<head type="sub">IN CONTINUATION</head>

						<p>OH, Dido, Dido! my faithful, yet mistaken girl, into what a situation
							hast thou put thy mistress! and yet I cannot chide thee. - I will
							recount to you, dearest madam, the surprise, and the conflicting
							emotions which I have just experienced. Devoid of curiosity, and wishing
							to live unknowing as well as unknown, I had not inquired the names of my
							nearest neighbours; all were alike strangers to me: and consequently a
							mere name could afford me neither knowledge nor information. Dido, I
							suspect, had been more inquisitive: she had more than once spoken of a
							"sweet, pretty house near the cliff," and had told me there was "one
							good gentleman in Monmouthshire." I usually answered her, that I hoped
							there were many here, as well as in other parts of the world, and I
							never indulged her loquacity, in point of local communications; feeling
							a satisfaction in maintaining my ignorance, which was an undefinable
							sensation even to myself. Dido has no small portion of superstition, and
							has laid up carefully all those signs and omens which she has gleaned
							from the English servants while in Devonshire. She has several times
							seen a stranger in the fire, and a friend in my tea-cup; I used to smile
							at her simple predictions, knowing that I was expected to notice them:
							but little imagining that, by these predictions, she was in reality
							preparing me for the reception of a visitor, and one, too, of her own
							inviting!</p>
						<p>Yesterday morning, Dido seemed usually officious at my toilette; she
							would attend it through, although I several times told her I did not
							need her assistance; and when I came into the parlour, I thought it
							looked unusually decorated with flowers. She several times remarked,
							that it was a very fine day, and sweet, pleasant weather; and I guessed
							that she wished to lure me to a walk: but not feeling inclined to go
							out, I seated myself at my work, and, I will freely confess, had engaged
							in a train of rumination which had wetted it with the tears which fell
							from my eyes, when I heard a treble, but soft, rap at the door of the
							cottage. Though an unusual sound, it did not alarm me, as the villagers
							do not understand the different gradations of a rap, like a London
							footman, till I heard the stifled whisper of Dido in the passage, and in
							the next minute saw her open the door of the room, and usher in Mr.
							Honeywood! Though much altered, paler, thinner, and in deep mourning, I
							could not forget him. - But, alas! I could not receive him as once I
							should have done; my emotions nearly over-powered me, and I sat down on
							the chair; my trembling limbs refused to support me; I covered, my face
							with my hands, and burst into tears! Honeywood’s agitation seemed very
							little inferior to mine.</p>
						<p>"My friend," said I, now resuming my courage, "it is not for us,
							narrow-sighted beings as we are, to inquire into the dispensations of an
							all-wise and all-just God! Afflictions fit us for another world - for a
							state of enjoyment; they make us eager to quit these scenes of transient
							sorrow, and to go to the regions of eternal bliss!"</p>
						<p>"And there," said Honeywood, with enthusiasm, "if superior reward be the
							allotment of superior virtue, there, in transcendent happiness -"</p>
						<p>He stopped abruptly - "No," said he, "my heart refuses to complete the
							picture - it would still chain thee to earth! Olivia, talk not of dying!
							What! the tender maid, who lately crossed with me the world of waters, -
							that time of ever-to-be-regretted felicity, - she whose spirits, whose
							health, whose youth, whose genius, whose fortune, whose situation, whose
							connexions, - all promised long years of happiness, - she to turn
							already to the grave, as to her only resting place? Oh, it cannot - it
							shall not be!"</p>
						<p>"No," said I, "I am content, even now, to wait my allotted time on earth
							without murmuring; but, my spirits depressed; my health weakened; youth
							prematurely flying away; my genius (if any I had) entirely damped; my
							fortune changed; my situation strangely singular, and isolated from my
							connexions; you must allow that life has not much to hold out to
							me."</p>
						<p>"Oh! I know - I know it all, - I feel it here!" said Honeywood, laying
							his hand with emphatic fervour on his heart; "and, since I lost my
							parent, ’tis the bitterest pang I ever felt!" - and he walked round the
							room in wild disorder.</p>
						<p>"Mr. Honeywood," said I, calming my emotions, "you have sought this
							interview; and the sympathy which you indulge for me, assures me of your
							friendly regard: then hear me assure you, that you see my sufferings in
							too strong a light. Overpowered by surprise, and the rushing
							remembrances which visited my heart at the moment of your entrance, I
							gave way to a transient weakness; but, believe me, I do not usually
							yield thus supinely to my feelings. I thank God, that the knowledge of
							my own innocence, and that of - of him, from whom I am separated for
							ever" - I sighed, - my sigh was echoed by deep-drawn one from Honeywood
							- "and the comforts of religion have supported me, and do continue to
							support me, in patient cheerfulness. I am not without my resources or my
							avocations; I can find employment, and I visit my poor, though I pass by
							on the other side of my rich neighbours. I have a sufficiency for all my
							wants."</p>
						<p>"A sufficiency!" interrupted Honeywood, "the nightly depredator is not so
							base a plunderer as is George Merton; he steals from strangers, from
							aliens whom he knows not - whom he cares not for. But Merton, the robber
							of the orphan - of his nearest relative - of a young - a tender female,
							- curses light on his head!"</p>
						<p>"Oh, I must not hear you talk thus," said I; "rather my repentance visit
							his heart! But you know me not, Mr. Honeywood, if you think that the
							mere loss of my property has given me a moment’s uneasiness. - Alas! in
							the bankrupt of the affections, in the entire desolation of the
							tenderest feelings of the heart, a pecuniary thought could never gain
							entrance into the mind, when he - when he too suffers poverty, I am well
							contented to be not rich."</p>
						<p>Honeywood looked at me, for a moment, with the utmost surprise; his whole
							frame seemed to experience a revulsion; his agitation was excessive; he
							advanced eagerly towards me; he seized my hand,</p>
						<p>"Olivia! dearest, beloved Olivia!" and he sank at my knees, "oh, forgive
							the question! pity my despair, - my agony, and answer it - I conjure you
							answer me with your known candour! you loved - you loved Augustus?"</p>
						<p>"More than my life!" answered I, with emphasis. "Yes, Mr. Honeywood, I
							glory in the acknowledgement; for he possessed every virtue and every
							quality to interest the heart!"</p>
						<p>Honeywood clasped both his hands together; then he seized mine - he
							bathed them in tears.</p>
						<p>"And do you try to conquer this imperious passion?" asked he, looking
							earnestly, and with a scrutinizing expression, in my face. </p>
						<p>"Assuredly I do," replied I, "as much as is possible. I drive from my
							remembrance the few months of happiness - the fleeting months I passed
							in Devonshire; but there are times when ‘busy meddling memory’ returns
							with barbarous power, to give a new edge to prevailing
							retrospections!"</p>
						<p>"But with no reciprocation of attachment, no congeniality of sentiment,
							could your delicate, your sensitive mind be satisfied with a widowed
							heart, with - "</p>
						<p>"That the warmest affections of Augustus were lain )as he believed) in
							the tomb of his lost wife, was true; but in the tender friendship of
							Augustus Merton, I had nothing to lament. I, - but why - why draw me
							into this needless recapitulation - into this strange confession? Sacred
							were my feelings; why - why disturb them, with unhallowed hand?"</p>
						<p>"Why, indeed!" said Mr. Honeywood. - "Oh, Olivia! vain would I have
							concealed from you at this interview the purpose with which my heart is
							fraught; but, forced as it is from me by the tumultuous sensations of
							the moment, hear me say, - that I love you beyond all earthly beings! -
							Hear me tell you, that on board the ****, while daily present with you -
							while listening to your melodious voice - to your noble sentiments - to
							the delicate purity of your conversation, I drank deep draughts of a
							passion which was violent as it was hopeless. Vainly did reason and
							reflection urge me to break my bonds; I loved my fetters, and, to
							contemplate on your dear idea, to turn with retrospective eye on those
							blissful hours of friendly intercourse was my utmost pleasure; even when
							I knew that you were to become the wife of another; even when I knew
							that duty and propriety bade me fly your presence! The loss of my
							ever-to-be-lamented mother, though it plunged me in sorrow, did not
							erase your image from my heart; I still remembered how you had, in the
							soft voice of friendship, tried to prepare me for this cruel stroke; and
							on retiring to this sequestered country, you were still the sylvan
							goddess of the shades I visited, - you were the benign genius of all my
							avocations! My fortune was greatly increased by a most unlooked-for
							circumstance; but of what use to me were this world’s goods, isolated
							from her, who only could give them a charm? I heard of your happiness -
							of your felicity; I breathed fervent prayers for its continuance. - I
							hope I did not envy your husband. Think, - oh judge, then, my
							astonishment, my wonder, let me add, my sorrow, when I met your faithful
							black, and heard her tale of woe! - Olivia, Heaven is my witness, that
							in sympathizing in your afflictions, not a thought of self introduced at
							that hour. But now, oh dearest, amiable Olivia! if a life devoted to
							your happiness; if a fortune devoted to your service; if a love, a
							reverence, an admiration, unbounded as they are sincere, can move you to
							pity, oh, hear my suit! - deign, oh deign to pity me! forgive the
							seeming impetuosity of this declaration! feelings such as mine are not
							to be controlled! You are free, you are unfettered; - I may now, with
							pride; with glory, avow, that I doat on you to distraction; that your
							recent trials in the hard school of adversity have heightened (oh, how
							highly heightened!) you in my esteem; and that the pity of Olivia
							Fairfield would be more precious to me, than the love of any other
							woman!"</p>
						<p>This rapid address, so unexpected, delivered with such enthusiasm, such
							fervour, bewildered and astonished me. I seemed to gasp for breath, and
							could only find strength to interpose at this moment.</p>
						<p>"My pity, believe me, you have: sensible as you appear of the indelicacy
							of your present avowal, I will forbear to make any comments upon it. You
							have frequently told me, that mine is a decided character -"</p>
						<p>"Oh stop, look not so determined, have mercy, gentlest, sweetest Olivia!"
							cried he, almost distractedly seizing my hand.</p>
						<p>"The skilful surgeon," said I, "probes deep, the more speedily to heal
							the wound. I now, and to the last moment of my existence, shall consider
							myself the windowed wife of Augustus Merton!"</p>
						<p>Honeywood let go my hand; he let his head rest on the table, hiding his
							face.</p>
						<p>"My good friend," said I, "exert your resolution, nor let a woman be your
							superior in this quality. I have suffered, Mr. Honeywood, but I have
							struggled to sustain my sufferings with fortitude, and with consistency
							of character. Consider my situation, impartially and coolly, and see if
							I should not suffer in your opinion, were I to act in any way but the
							one I have fixed on; that one which my judgement approves, and which my
							heart must ever ratify!"</p>
						<p>"Cruel, inexorable Olivia!"</p>
						<p>"Not cruel," said I; "more cruel would it be to give you hopes which I
							could never realize."</p>
						<p>"But surely, then," said Honeywood, after a silence of some minutes, "you
							will allow me your friendship - you will let me try to be instrumental
							to your happiness - you will let me renew our former delightful
							intercourse?Here, in this sequestered nook, let me try to cheer your
							solitary hours, to guide your steps in the evening ramble, to follow
							your benevolent impulse in your charitable visits to the neighbouring
							cottages!"</p>
						<p>"Surely, Mr. Honeywood, you forget what you were asking me; - your reward
							for me is, I am sure, of a disinterested nature!"</p>
						<p>"If I know my own heart!" said he, laying his hand upon it.</p>
						<p>"Then," said I, "you will rather deny yourself a trifling gratification
							than injure my character. Consider the appearance that it would have, if
							I were to admit your visits, secluded as I am from all other
							society."</p>
						<p>"The appearance! - and does Olivia regard appearances? She whose conduct
							could stand proclaimed before men and angels - shall she become the
							victim of a name - a nothing - shall she - ?"</p>
						<p>"Pray stop, Mr. Honeywood; in your eager warmth, you forget that you are
							arguing only from the disappointment of your own feelings; for, believe
							me, my ease and comfort would depend on my not being subjected (or
							rather in my not subjecting myself) to the malevolent sarcasms of the
							world!"</p>
						<p>"If you so lightly hold my friendship - if you can so coolly forbid my
							visits," said he - "Oh, Olivia! could I but make you sensible of what I
							suffer at this moment, when I hear you refuse every thing that I propose
							- when you will not let me be of service to you - when I have not the
							power of evincing the sincerity of my professions!"</p>
						<p>"I believe them all," said I; "and they make exactly that impression
							which they should on a woman, who has plighted vows of eternal fealty to
							another! - Honeywood, farewel! Take with you my thanks - my gratitude -
							my sincere esteem!"</p>
						<p>"You drive me from you?" said he. - "Oh, Olivia! who can resist your
							commands? - May heaven bless and preserve you! May peace revisit your
							bosom! May your heart never experience those pangs, which now are
							piercing mine!"</p>
						<p>Then, suddenly lifting my hand to this heart - to his lips - and to his
							forehead, he let it fall on my lap, and rushed out of the house.</p>

						<p>FOR a few moments I gave way to all the weakness of my soul. Compassion
							for Honeywood, gratitude for his warm regard, were, you may believe,
							blended with other conflicting emotions. I even regretted that the
							punctilious decorum of the world prevented me from enjoying his society,
							till I recollected, that, by such an intercourse, I should be tacitly
							giving encouragement to hopes which I could never realize. Tears still
							stood on my cheeks, when Dido bolted in; a wise grin on her face, her
							black orbs sparkling like diamonds -</p>
						<p>"What! my dear Missee crying? Ah! how glad me be to see dearest Mr.
							Honeywood once again! Dido did always like Massa Honeywood; and me be so
							glad he lives but just here, for now my dear Missee can see him every
							day - every day - and he be living in so nice grand house! - Oh dear,
							dear! what fine gardens there be, Missee, at Massa Honeywood’s! - But
							ah, Missee, Missee!" tapping my cheek with her hand, "it be your own
							house, if you do like it; - me do know it be - me do know it be!" and
							she clapped her hands together, and danced around the room with marks of
							the greatest delight, in her manner.</p>
						<p>"Dido," said I. It was of no use to speak; Dido heard me not.</p>
						<p>"Iss, iss, me think it be very pretty house, indeed, - it be like the
							dear Fairfield plantation! Iss, iss, and me shall be housekeeper again,
							and have my bunch of keys at my own side! For here, God help Dido, there
							be nothing to lock. Now, be then good Missee, my own Massa’s
							daughter!"</p>
						<p>"Dido!" said I again, in rather a louder key. Dido turned round. "Dido,
							do you love your mistress?"</p>
						<p>"You know Dido loves her Massa’s own daughter, better than she loves her
							own self."</p>
						<p>"And you can be happy where your mistress is?"</p>
						<p>"Oh iss, iss! - Where Missee be happy, Dido be so too,"</p>
						<p>"When we shall both be very comfortable here."</p>
						<p>"Not here!" said Dido, and her arms fell lumpishly down at her sides.</p>
						<p>"And why not here?"</p>
						<p>"Massa Honeywood’s be very fine house!"</p>
						<p>"Very likely I shall never go to see it."</p>
						<p>"Never! - Oh, my dearee Missee!"</p>
						<p>"Never, Dido!"</p>
						<p>"Oh, my good God almighty! me thought - Dido did think - but ’tis all of
							one - me know nothing in this England town, but disappointments - me
							will never believe any thing that me sees again, - no, that me won’t;
							for me cou’d have well sworn, that when Massa Honeywood comed here, this
							very morning, that he wou’d have asked my dear Missee to come and live
							to his house; for me was sure - me thought - that my Missee was his own
							very sweetheart!"</p>
						<p>"But, Dido, were you as certain that your mistress would go and live with
							Mr. Honeywood, if he had asked her? Did you think your mistress could so
							soon change the object of her affections? Do you think she has already
							forgotten her husband?"</p>
						<p>"Husband! he be no husband of my dear Missee’s."</p>
						<p>"Dido, I consider myself, I always shall consider myself, as his wife!
							Talk no longer to me on this subject - you pain - you grieve me to the
							heart!"</p>
						<p>"Me would not grieve dear Missee for all the world - me would not!"</p>
						<p>"I believe you, my good girl; I know you are my friend - I look upon you
							as such - I talk to you as one - I will confide to you, Dido, that Mr.
							Honeywood did come on the errand you imagined!"</p>
						<p>"He did, he did!" cried she; "me thought he did, me thought so all
							along!" and she kissed my hand in delight.</p>
						<p>"That I could not listen to him, I have told you," said I. "Ah! what
							sentiments could so ill accord with my feelings? Generous and candid, he
							was convinced by my reasoning - and I shall see him no more!"</p>
						<p>"No more!" said Dido, "see him no more! and this little bit of a
							nut-shell of a house for my own dear Massa’s daughter?" -</p>
						<p>"Dido, how often must I tell you, that happiness is independent of
							situation, and that in a palace I should be more unhappy than I am in
							this little cottage, because I should not have him to share it with
							me?"</p>
						<p>Ah, my dearest friend! why tire you with a longer recapitulation of this
							conversation? why recapitulate the conflicts which this visit from
							Honeywood has occasioned me? - I will resume my pen when I feel more fit
							to be your correspondent.</p>

						<p>"MR. MERTON is no more: Augustus is still in London."</p>
						<p>So says Caroline Lumley, in a letter just received: It is reported that

						<p>HONEYWOOD continues to absent himself from the cottage, but by a thousand
							delicate and different attentions I am reminded of his proximity. I know
							not how to act: by affecting not to discover, I am tacitly approving his
							attention, whilst, in refusing them I shall wound his already bruised
							heart. A fine bouquet of flowers on my mantle-piece; an aromatic heath
							on my window; a newspaper, or new pamphlet, on my breakfast-table; a
							pineapple, brought in by Dido, as a dessert! - oh, Mrs. Milbanke, what
							can I say to Honeywood for such well-meant kindnesses? Why should I put
							a construction on his behaviour which should hurt his feelings? And yet
							the consciousness of what these really are, the knowledge of his
							contiguity, operates as a check upon all my actions; and I am absolutely
							as if spell-bound, a prisoner in this little cot, and my smaller garden,
							when, because I would range free and uncontrolled, a tenant of the air,
							I chose this situation! Dido too, poor, affectionate, and simple-hearted
							girl, loving Mr. Honeywood for his attention to a mistress on whom she
							doats, though she puts a check upon her tongue, and never names the name
							of Honeywood, yet has it always in her thoughts; and her looks convey
							that sort of tender reproof which I cannot express, not unaccompanied by
							exultation, either when she sees me notice any thing which is just
							arrived from Elm Wood (for this I find is the name of Honeywood’s place)

						<p>CAROLINE LUMLEY gives me one piece of information, which you will rejoice
							to learn, as much as I did; for, thank God, in the desolation of my
							heart, it yet can glow with satisfaction to hear of another’s happiness.
							- A great nephew of Mr. Bellfield’s has lately discovered him: a very
							young man; liberal in principle, and of much goodness of heart. He has
							heard of his dependent and unworthy situation at the Pagoda; and,
							contemning the treatment of Sir Marmaduke, he has written to make a
							proffer of any part of his fortune to his uncle; and has done it in the
							most noble and handsome manner: at the same time that he refuses to
							introduce himself to Sir Marmaduke Ingot, his own uncle, by whom he
							would be certain of a welcome reception, as his recently acquired
							fortune would be a certain passport to the Pagoda.</p>
						<p>Caroline says, that tears coursed each other down the rugged cheeks of
							the good old man, as he made this generous offer known to Waller, but
							that he steadfastly refuses to accept any pecuniary gift from his
							relation; though he is going to pay him a visit immediately, with a
							determination of residing with him during the remainder of his days. His
							sorrow at leaving his young friend, Waller, he expresses in a manner
							very flattering to the worthy young clergyman, "Who would find his own
							situation insupportable, he says (Caroline prettily and modestly
							inserts), if it were not for his being in our vicinity."</p>

						<p>AT length, my dear Mrs. Milbanke, your Olivia has received the long
							anticipated acquittal of Augustus Merton. Conscience has pricked the
							heart of Mrs. George Merton. She was seized by a violence and alarming
							illness, a few days previous to the decease of her father-in-law, and,
							while contemplating the near approach of death, the world, its
							pleasures, and its riches, faded from her view, and the whole weight of
							her unacknowledged crimes lay at her heart, she sent for Augustus, who,
							luckily, was come to town, and, in the presence of her husband, made a
							full confession of all the malicious plans by which she had contrived to
							circumvent his happiness. She produced proofs of her guilt, in letters
							to and from the agents of her machinations, which made the truth of her
							relation but too apparent. These letters Augustus has transmitted to me
							for perusal. I cannot transcribe so black a scene of guilt! - Neither
							can I transcribe Augustus’s letter to myself: and, let me own the
							weakness of my heart, neither can I part with it. - Ah! Mrs. Milbanke,
							such a heart as is there laid open - such nobleness of sentiment - such
							respect - such consideration - let me add, such tenderness towards your
							Olivia, who but would be proud of keeping such a memorial of his
							esteem!</p>
						<p>I will try to form a little narrative of these letters, and the
							confession of Mrs. Merton; and give to you, my beloved friend, the
							necessary information under that form. There will you see the fatal
							effects of female vanity, and of disappointed pride. There will you see
							- but I must not forestal myself. - All that can now be done in the way
							of reparation has been effected. Mr. Merton made a will, and has divided
							his fortune equally between his sons, on Mr. George Merton’s foregoing
							all claim to, or interest in, my fortune; and this has been formally
							relinquished to me by him, in the same packet that brought me this very
							pleasing and unlooked-for intelligence. - Yes! my friend, Augustus
							received the embrace, the affectionate blessing of his dying parent! He
							is now enabled to provide for his Angelina and his child, and your
							Olivia, is now contented! - She is more - she is grateful to that God
							who has melted the heart of the poor sinner; and, from the bottom of her
							own, she can forgive Mrs. George Merton; and, in full confidence of the
							undiminished regard of Mrs. Milbanke, continues to sing herself,</p>

							of Mr. Manby, who, from a very obscure and plodding tradesman, through
							industry and good luck (as it is called), rose to be a wealthy merchant
							in the city of London. Without the advantages of a liberal education,
							and rising from the very dregs of the people, his notions were
							illiberal, his principles sordid and confined. The poor man, if he
							possessed every virtue, and a title, was an object of contempt and
							opprobrium; the rich, if the most worthless benign in creation, and a
							chimney-sweeper, would, from him, have received attention and
							consideration. His wife, whose ideas were nearly as confined as his own,
							was yet assailable to the great tempter of her sex, vanity; and while
							Mr. Manby talked of thousands and ten thousands, she would enumerate on
							the thousand and ten thousands of fine things which could be purchased
							by them. The mere hoarding of guinea upon guinea was the first pursuit
							of the one; the desire of making a show with their riches, was the first
							wish of the other: but nothing could persuade Mr. Manby to diverge from
							the beaten track. The front of his large premises in **** Lane was taken
							up in warehouses; and the small back parlour, to which he tired every
							evening, could not, with all Mrs. Manby’s attempts, be converted into
							any thing of a fashionable or dashy appearance. She was obliged,
							therefore, to content herself with showing her riches on her large and
							portly person; and when she sallied out on the Sunday’s walk, to the
							park, attired in all the colours of a rainbow, with her real lace weil,
							she was frequently gratified by hearing some of her quondam friends in
							**** Lane, whisper, as she sailed along, "streaming, in the wind,"</p>
						<p>"Look there! that is the rich Mr. Manby’s wife."</p>
						<p>An only child smiled on the union of this couple; she soon became the
							idol of both her parents: and, while the father carefully instilled into
							his offspring the value and the consequence of money, and taught her to
							distinguish a guinea from a shilling, before she could articulate; the
							mother, equally in character, dazzled her infantine eyes with finery,
							and laboured earnestly to decorate her little person in the costliest
							garb, and in the most becoming manner.</p>
						<p>At an early age Letitia Manby was placed at a boarding-school a few miles
							from the metropolis, where the conductress of the seminary knew how to
							fall in with the dispositions of her employers. She had penetration to
							discover the ruling passion of the parents who committed their children
							to her care; and that discernment, which, if it had been applied to the
							discovery of the different traits in the characters of her pupils (to
							the encouragement of their virtuous, and to the correction of their
							vicious propensities), would have qualified her for the discharge of the
							office she had undertaken, being wholly turned towards the failings of
							their parents, and to making them subservient to her own interest; it
							may be presumed that those young ladies, who were ushered into the
							world, formed under her auspices, were likely to come forth with all the
							follies inherent to their sex, and to their different dispositions.</p>
						<p>Miss Manby was by nature vain; she was also jealous of her own
							consequence, and frequently vaunted of the great wealth to which she was
							sole heiress! Her father could not be prevailed on, even when she
							returned from school - "mistress of every polite accomplishment," and
							"her education complete," - as the subtle governess notified to Mrs.
							Manby, - not even for the sake of this darling child could he be
							prevailed on to relinquish his old habits, and his accustomed mode of
							life. The back parlour in **** Lane could not be forsaken for a house
							with a veranda (or weranda, as Mrs. Manby termed it), in one of the
							squares at the west end of the town - but every thing else that his dear
							Letty liked, she should have: and when Miss Manby declared, that she
							could not live without a friend, that she must have a friend, for that
							she had always been used to an intimate friend at school, but that not
							one amongst all of her very particular friends would have visit her now
							she was come back to odious **** Lane, Mr. Manby told her she should
							have a friend - and the only sister of Mr. Manby, who had married a
							clergyman (whose whole subsistence had been derived from a curacy in
							Northumberland) being about this period carried off by malignant fever,
							which reigned in the neighbourhood, and to which her husband has
							previously fallen a victim, Mrs. Manby thought there would be something
							very benevolent in taking her orphan daughter for Letty’s friend.</p>
						<p>Mrs. Forrester had been a different woman to her sister; she had
							naturally good understanding, and a rightly turned heart; and marrying
							Mr. Forrester, a man of probity and worth, she had, in the retirement of
							Northumberland, cultivated those talents, which had hitherto lain
							dormant in her mind; and, with the assistance of her husband, had become
							an accomplished, as well as an amiable, character. They had one child,
							and to the little Angelina had been transmitted all the beauty and the
							softness of her mother; all the intelligence and magnanimity of her
							father. This amiable girl knew neither sorrow nor care, till, by the
							fatal event which has been previously mentioned, she lost both her
							parents, and was restored, from the very brink of the grave, to behold
							herself alone and friendless, thrown on the wide world, a destitute
							orphan at the early age of seventeen! When, therefore, her aunt wrote
							her a letter of condolence; and offered her an asylum in **** Lane, to
							become the "friend and company-keeper of her Letty," the gratitude of
							this child of nature was unbounded, and she eagerly accepted the
							invitation, and lost no time in going to her kind relatives!</p>
						<p>The transition from the pure air of Northumberland to **** Lane, from
							wide heaths expanded lawns; from mountains and vales, where nature in
							her "wildest works is seen," to the close atmosphere of the most
							combined part of the metropolis, was very striking to poor ANgelina. The
							manners, too, of her new friends, - Mr. Manby so short, so quaint, so
							odd in his expressions - Mrs. Manby so fond of dress and finery, her
							whole conversation turning on the riches of her husband, and on her
							daughter’s beauty - the vanity and self-consequence of Letty, the air of
							authority and imposing command which she assumed towards her friend, was
							so perfectly novel to Angelina, that she would have felt her situation
							beyond endurance, if her recent and irreparable afflictions had not
							paralysed her feelings, and rendered her almost impervious to any thing
							which might succeed to them. Religion had been firmly planted in the
							mind of Angelina Forrester, and to "bear and forbear," which is,
							perhaps, the hardest duty which the Christian fulfils (especially if
							endowed with great sensibility of disposition), in that palsy of the
							mind which she experienced at her first introduction to London, she
							practised without much difficulty; and when her feelings resumed their
							wonted station, her reason returned also, and she did not deviate from a
							conduct, which she found was the only one she could adopt, with a
							probability of comfort, in her present situation.</p>
						<p>Miss Manby considered Angelina, "Lin" (as she abbreviated the name) as an
							inferior being; Mrs. Manby thought she had done a noble action in
							receiving her niece in **** Lane, and in making her the "company keeper"
							of Letty; and Mr. Manby would not have increased his family circle for a
							useless member, and one who brought him no profit, except to please "his
							girl!" - The pleasure which Miss Manby derived from the society of
							Angelina would be rather difficult to define. She seemed to take a
							delight in showing her finery, in pointing out the difference of their
							situations - "But I am so different from you, Lina" - "that gown is well
							enough for you, I could not be seen in such a one." Angelina was made
							the companion of the young lady when she could get no other, but when a
							more dashy girl appeared, "I do not want you now, Lina," was said with
							all the air of an arbitrary and supercilious mistress. Of a dull day,
							when Miss Manby had the vapours, Lina was to read full six hours at a
							stretch in the most silly novel which could be procured from the next
							circulating library; for, unless there was a great deal of love, and a
							long account of the hero and the heroine’s person, Miss Manby usually
							pronounced it a "stupid, dull thing;" and Lina was dispatched eight or
							nine times in a morning till she could hit on a book, glowing with the
							description of beauty, and warm with the declaration of passion. Mrs.
							Manby usually sat by to hear the novel, and if the heroine was fair,
							with blue eyes, the description always was the exact resemblance of her
							dearest Letty.</p>
						<p>Mr. Merton and Mr. Manby had some dealings together with regard to
							commercial business; in which, added to the great riches of the father,
							Mr. Manby discovered such readiness in, and application to his one thing
							needful, in George Merton, that he came home delighted with the young
							merchant; and, after calculating Mr. Merton’s fortune over his bowl of
							punch in the evening, he suddenly seized the ladle, and filling a
							bumper, said, "Here’s George Merton to you, little Letty, and may God
							send you such a husband!" This roused the curiosity of Mrs. Manby; she
							knew that the Mertons were considered as the very first people in the
							mercantile world, and "Law! Mr. Manby, then you must make an
							entertainment, and introduce him to our Letty," quickly followed Mr.
							Manby’s toast.</p>
						<p>"I don’t want a husband - I couldn’t abide a husband of pa’s choosing - I
							know he can’t be handsome or genteel," said Mis Manby, affectedly
							turning up her lip!</p>
						<p>"Now I can tell you Letty, he is both one and the other," replied the
							father; "I never saw a likelier young fellow in my whole life: and as to
							calculations, why he is fit to meet the prime minister for the
							loan!"</p>
						<p>An invitation was given and accepted, and Mr. Merton, accompanied by his
							two sons, dined in **** Lane. George Merton, tutored by his father (who
							liked the idea of getting old Manby’s fortune into his family), was all
							politeness and attention to the young heiress, while Augustus, perfectly
							undesigning and unconscious, sat near the modest and innocent Angelina;
							and perceiving the disregard of the rest of the party, he was the more
							respectful and attentive, pitying her situation; as, at the first view,
							he perceived that she was a superior being to those with whom she was
							placed. George Merton might have been called a handsome young man, but
							the redundancy of youth, the animation, the brilliancy which at this
							time played on the countenance, and sparkled in the eyes of Augustus,
							made him an object of greater attraction than his brother to Miss Manby.
							She could scarcely conceal her vexation when she saw him bestowing that
							attention on Lina, which she would fain have engrossed to herself. More
							than once, with a commanding air and an authoritative voice, she ordered
							Lina to fetch her handkerchief and her smelling-bottle, in order to send
							her out of the way; but the malicious expression which sat on her
							features, effectually disgusted Augustus; he saw through her
							contemptible jealousy, and, on the fair orphan’s return to the company,
							he beheld her with that commiseration which her situation inspired.
							Augustus Merton was the very personified hero of Miss Manby’s fruitful
							and impassioned imagination; she immediately fell violently in love with
							him, and told pa and ma, that she liked Mr. George Merton well enough,
							but he was not to compare with Augustus - Augustus too, sounded so well
							- so novel-like - ‘Augustus and Letitia, a novel, founded on facts,’
							would be delightful! Mr. Manby had none of his daughter’s reasons for
							preferring Augustus Merton to his brother; he had never read a novel in
							his life; and with regard to beauty, "handsome he, that handsome does,"
							was his maxim. Augustus had thrown out one or two severe innuendos, in
							contempt of that spirit of hoarding which Mr. Manby had displayed, and
							he plainly saw that George was his father’s favourite - but swayed by
							his wife, who assured him, that, "Letty would pine herself into a
							consumption if crossed in her first love," he at lengthy consented to
							break the matter to Mr. Merton.</p>
						<p>Mr. Merton had long seen that Augustgus did not follow up his schemes of
							business with true mercantile avidity; there was an open-heartedness, a
							manly generosity in his character, which could only have been derived
							from the Fairfield family, and which had rendered him the idol of his
							mother, while it had had the contrary affect on his other parent. The
							prospect of settling Augustus so advantageously was very satisfactory to
							Mr. Merton; and, sending for his youngest son, he told him, that, seeing
							he had no wish of pursuing the commercial speculations, in which his
							family were embarked, with any portion of spirit, he could now put him
							into a way of making his fortune at a single stroke. The whole soul of
							Augustus recoiled when he heard the proposition of his father - What!
							marry Miss Manby? marry the haughty, the cruel, the unfeeling Letitia
							Manby? she, who tyrannized over a helpless orphan, to whom she
							apparently extended her protection! - that gentle being, whose patient
							forbearance, whose modest sweetness, had gained her an interest in his
							heart, which was scarcely known to himself! - No, never could he unite
							himself to Miss Manby!</p>
						<p>In the firmest and the most decided manner Augustus expressed his dislike
							of Miss Manby, and his repugnance to the connexion. Mr. Merton was
							enraged with his son, and told him, as he valued his favour, if he
							expected from henceforth to be beheld as a son, he expected an implicit
							compliance with his wishes in this instance. Augustus temporized with
							his father - for the first time in his life, the treacherous emotions of
							his heart inclined him to play a double part - he promised to visit in
							**** Lane; he did so, but while the young heiress absolutely doated on
							him, while she exposed her preference to every common observer, Augustus
							could scarcely conceal the disgust with which he suffered her
							civilities, nor how deeply he quaffed the delicious draughts of love as
							they fell from the honied lips, the chastened smiles, of the unconscious
							Angelina! Wholly inexperienced and new to the world as Angelina was,
							there was something in the respectful regard, in the tender manner which
							Augustus Merton displayed in his behaviour towards her, which seemed to
							give life a new charm in her eyes. Yet these floating and delightful
							ideas had never been discussed in her mind; for she beheld Mr. Augustus
							Merton as the elected husband of her cousin, and frequently whispered to
							herself that Letitia was a most fortunate creature.</p>
						<p>Miss Manby kept Angelina, as much as was possible, at a distance, while
							Miss Danby (a ci-devant friend, who had at length got over her scruples
							concerning **** Lane, in the prospect of Miss Manby’s approaching union
							with the son of Mr. Merton, a man of great fortune and consequence) was
							her intimate companion and confidante! - Poor Angelina, confined in a
							close apartment up three pair of stairs, brooding over her past sorrows,
							and her present difficulties, would have become the victim of melancholy
							despondence, if the thought of Augustus Merton had not sometimes lulled
							her griefs, with airy and gay dreams of happiness.</p>
						<p>The insulting and contumelious treatment which she met with from the
							friends in the parlour, and which were invariably backed by Mrs. Manby,
							could not have been sustained, if the benevolent friendliness of Mr.
							Merton had not frequently been exerted in her behalf; and on one of
							those instances of illiberal and vaunting superiority, when poor
							Angelina had given way to the bitterest emotions of her soul, Augustus
							Merton had accidentally found her; - prudence, duty, reflection, fled at
							the sight of her distress! and he abruptly made an impassioned avowal of
							love, as sincere as it was fervent. Surprise of the most delightful kind
							rendered Angelina dumb; whilst Augustus hastily assured her,that nothing
							but his affection for her, and his compassion for her situation, could
							have induced him to bear the society at **** Lane for one half hour! He
							lamented that the prejudices of his father forbade him to offer her his
							hand in a public manner, but with vows of constancy he besought her to
							hear him. He conjured her to consent to his proposal of a private
							marriage, that she might be his beyond the reach of fate or fortune! -
							The fond, the confiding, the grateful Angelina, was ill-calculated to
							carry on a contest against her own heart; - she met Augustus Merton one
							morning in **** church, where they were formally and legally united in
							marriage bonds; after which, the bride retired to private lodgings,
							which her husband had taken for her reception. To save appearances, and
							to avoid a discovery, Augustus consented to continue to a visit, for a
							time, in **** Lane. But the suspicions of Letitia Manby were awake,
							though she contrived to conceal them from the object of them. In
							conjunction with her mother, she set every inquiry on foot to discover
							the retreat of Angelina, and when this had been accomplished, a train of
							revenge was laid as black as it proved unsuccessful. With all the
							apprehensive fears of a friend zealous for the honour of his family,
							Mrs. Manby sought the elder Mr. Merton, and under a strict charge of
							inviolable secrecy, confided to him her fears, that Mr. Augustus Merton
							had an intention of disgracing himself by marrying a low creature whom
							she had protected merely from benevolent and charitable motives.</p>
						<p>Mr. Merton was greatly shocked at the intelligence of Mrs. Manby; but,
							eager to snatch his son from (what he termed) ruin, he ordered him to
							embark immediately for Ireland to transact some commercial business of
							an urgent nature which would necessarily detain him some time; and,
							during his absence, Mrs. Manby took upon herself the charge of putting
							the young lady out of his reach. Poor Augustus, in this instance, dared
							not disobey his father - no time had been given him for reflection; he
							just snatched a hasty farewel of his darling Angelina, in an agony of
							mind little short of distraction. He left her all the money he had, and
							promising to write to her frequently, he tore himself away, and got on
							board the vessel, which was already under weigh. </p>
						<p>And now it was, that in all the affected distress of insulted honour and
							maternal affection, Mrs. Manby sought out her niece. Breaking violently,
							and unushered, into her apartment, she assured her, that she had been
							trepanned and ruined by a villain, under the stale pretext of a false
							marriage. At first, the indignant Angelina thought it doubting Heaven,
							to doubt the faith and honour of Augustus Merton; but proofs, behind
							proofs, were produced by Mrs. Manby, of a false clergyman being hired by
							Augustus, for the performance of the marriage ceremony, for which there
							had been prepared a fictitious licence, and that the whole business had
							been formal and illegal - that she could no longer hope! -</p>
						<p>The agony of the innocent orphan is not to be described; more especially
							when she found that she was likely to become the mother of a witness of
							her own shame and the guilt of her seducer. To her aunt she now turned
							herself, as to her only friend; and on her knees conjured her to bestow
							pity and forgiveness! Mrs. Manby evinced more feeling than Angelina had
							ever experienced from her before. She said, she could not take her back
							to **** Lane; - she must never tell her Litty what she had done for her,
							but she would not let the only child of her own sister perish; and she
							would send her into some retired part of Wales; and she would pay for
							her maintenance there, if Angelina would consent to go by a feigned
							name, and never attempt to see or hear from her vile seducer! Alas!
							Angelina could easily promise this, convinced of his falsehood, whose
							heart she had hitherto believed the seat of truth. - She only wished to
							hide her shame and sorrow in obscurity! She was quickly transported into
							Wales, and the smallpox soon after carrying off the woman with whom she
							had lodged in London, and also a young woman, who had immediately
							tenanted Angelina’s vacated apartments on her quitting them, Mrs. Manby
							managed this (to her) lucky circumstance very adroitly; and the death of
							poor Angelina was credited even by Mr. Merton. Miss Manby was the
							malicious suggester of all the schemes which her parent had so promptly
							executed; and being convinced, that Augustus Merton would never accede
							to her tender wishes, even if he were to outlive his affection for
							Angelina Forrester, she determined, hat during his absence, she would
							marry his brother; the more effectually to revenge herself on Augustus,
							by thus securing the favour of Mr. Merton towards his eldest son.</p>
						<p>Mr. George Merton wasily fell in with the views of this crafty young
							lady. Mr. Merton was delighted to find that the Manby wealth would still
							be centred in his family, and within a very few weeks after the marriage
							of Miss Manby and Mr. George Merton - Mr. Manby was deprived of life, by
							a sudden stroke of apoplexy; and thus, nearly fifty thousand pounds fell
							into the eager grasp of the lucky George Merton! Mrs. Manby outlived her
							husband but a few months. The place of Angelina’s concealment was
							perfectly well known to Mrs. George Merton; and, through her mother’s
							former agent in the business, she contrived that her stipend should be
							continued regularly.</p>
						<p>We will pass over the agonizing feelings of Augustus Merton, on being
							informed of the untimely fate of his believed Angelina. The idea of her
							falling a victim to a direful malady; - alone, and unprotected - her
							only friend - her husband, at a distance, was dreadful! He pondered over
							her virtues; he delighted in retracing her mild and gentle attractions;
							the modest excellencies of her mind; and he gave way to all the
							oppressive grief which pierced his soul; while the very sight of Mrs.
							George Merton - of his brother’s wife, was torture! The look of
							exultation and triumph which sat on her countenance gave him a sensation
							of abhorrence and disgust; and he fled from her presence as he would
							have hastened from a venomous reptile!</p>
						<p>The elapsed; yet still the wounds of Augustus’s heart were unclosed. He
							still sighed over lost happiness; and the death of Mr. Fairfield, in
							Jamaica, with the tenour of his last will, were at length made known to
							his relatives in England! Strange as the tenour of this will appeared;
							miserable as must be the future fate of Olivia Fairfield, if dependent
							on his brother; yet Augustus declared to his father, that the affections
							of his heart were for ever lain in the tomb of Angelina Forrester (he
							had not thought it necessary to avow his private marriage since the
							fatal event of her death had taken place) and that he could never marry
							his cousin! But, consenting to meet Olivia at Clifton, - the natural
							benevolence and philanthropy of his heart got the better of this
							resolution,and he made the virtuous sacrifice of his own feelings to
							Olivia Fairfield’s happiness!</p>
						<p>It would be incredible that there could have existed such a character as
							Mrs. George Merton, if the melancholy fact were not made too apparent -
							and that by her own confession. The happiness which ensued to the union
							of Augustus and Olivia, the fortune which Augustus enjoyed, once more
							excited all the malice of her heart; and, burning with revenge at
							beholding the tranquil serenity of their countenances, she thought to
							put the death-stroke to all future comfort by restoring Angelina to the
							sight of her husband - returning them both to poverty, and overwhelming
							the hapless Olivia with complicated misery!</p>
						<p>Angelina, in her sequestered nook, had (soon after her retreat to it)
							become the mother of a fine little boy; and in rearing her offspring
							with maternal tenderness, she had received all the comfort of which her
							existence seemed capable. She had a half-yearly remittance from town,
							sufficient for her decent maintenance; it was continued to be paid by
							Mrs. Manby’s agent, after that lady’s death, and Angelina was given to
							understand, that this was done in consequence of the secret and dying
							injunctions of that lady; and that Angelina was desired implicitly, to
							follow his directions in every step of her future life. The marriage of
							Augustus Merton to Miss Fairfield had been carefully communicated to
							Angelina through this channel; and if a doubt had still hung on her mind
							with regard to this falsehood, and the turpitude of his conduct towards
							her, the knowledge of this event entirely decided it. She became inured
							and resigned to her lot: she deeply lamented her inexperienced weakness,
							and that credulity which had induced her to consent to a private
							marriage; but her conscience was eased of the eight of intentional
							guilt, and her faith in the promises of God, firmly planted in her mind,
							she looked forwards to a happy futurity with chastened hope!</p>
						<p>From this torpid tranquility, Angelina was once more roused by a letter
							from the agent, informing her, that the house in which she resided was
							advertised for sale, and that he had in consequence taken a cottage for
							her in Devonshire, to which she was required to move without loss of
							time; that the situation was more eligible, and that she would remain as
							secluded, and as much unknown, as in Wales.</p>
						<p>These orders Angelina dared not disobey; but the thought of removing to
							such a distance was very unpleasant. She had associated ideas of comfort
							and quiet with the cottage which had been her asylum in trouble, which
							had sheltered her defenceless hdead from the cruel taunts of a malicious
							world, and which had been the birthplace of her child; and she set out
							on her journey with a heavy and foreboding heart. To her great surprise
							and mortification, she found that her new habitation was attached to a
							gentleman’s park, and near a bathing place of general resort; she feared
							to stir abroad, lest she should attract the prying eye of curiosity. She
							had from time to time observed a gentleman walking near her cottage,
							and, fearing a discover and recognition of her person with double
							vigilance, till surprised, whilst sitting in her parlour, by the abrupt
							entrance of Colonel Singleton, who addressing her in a strain of
							gallantry, as fulsome as it was ill-timed, she lost her presence of mind
							in the indignant sense of the insult, and rushing from the house was
							caught in the arms of her still-doating husband!</p>

						<head type="sub">OLIVIA FAIRFIELD - IN CONTINUATION</head>

						<p>THUS, my dear Ms. Milbanke, have I given you the simple statement of
							facts. In the full acquittal of Augustus Merton, believe me, I do not
							feel my own hard fate. Mine was a disinterested attachment, my dearest
							friend; and I glory in saying, that I prefer his happiness to my own. I
							have just received a note of congratulation from Honeywood. I suspect
							that Dido has been the means of so speedily conveying this intelligence
							to Elm Wood. Poor girl, she was nearly frantic with joy when she heard
							of it. How grateful am I for her faithful attachment! Mrs. George Merton
							is recovered from her illness. Her mind disburdened of its load, became
							tranquil, and her health mended in consequence. Ah! if the inward
							feelings of the guilty were made apparent, I believe we should find,
							that, even in this world, they experienced no light punishment.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="entry">
						<head type="sub">IN CONTINUATION</head>
						<p>MORE wonders! - More events to communicate to my dear friend. I have just
							parted with another visitor - with the uncle of Mr. Honeywood! He
							introduced himself to me uncalled for - unexpected: but I received him
							with a cordial welcome, for I beheld the good Mr. Bellfield! -Yes,
							Honeywood is the generous, the noble-minded nephew, who has sought out
							his worthy and unfortunate relative, and who has caused the tears of
							delighted gratitude to rush to the eyes of this respectable old man!</p>
						<p>"Ah!" said the venerable Bellfield, as he pressed my hand in his, "I
							glory in this nephew, my dear madam; there is only one man, whom I know,
							that is his equal -" He stopped. The long-absent crimson visited his
							time-worn cheek; his confusion convinced me that he alluded to Augustus.
							He proceeded - "There is only one woman worthy of him - and she - ah!
							madam - much esteemed and respected young lady - suffer an old man to
							speak - suffer him to ask you, whether it be charity, whether it be
							humanity, to let this excellent youth pine away the flower of his days?
							to be exiled from that society which he prizes beyond every other? to be
							ever within the hearing of her manifold virtues, of her extraordinary
							endowments, and still to experience the punishment of Tantalus, in not
							daring to enter her presence? Let not my plain speaking offend you,
							dearest lady," seeing that I rose from my seat - "I ask these questions
							from the sincerity of my heart. You have it in your power to raise my
							nephew to the highest state of happiness which he is capable of enjoying
							in this state of being. - You acknowledge his worth - you are not blind
							to his virtues - then why -"</p>
						<p>"Mr. Bellfield," said I, interrupting him, "little did I think that I
							could ever regret receiving a visit from you - and are you, too, joined
							in a party against the unfortunate Olivia? Is it the venerable, the good
							Mr. Bellfield that seeks to persuade this beating heart to become an
							apostate to its first love?"</p>
						<p>"Is it Miss Fairfield," asked Mr. Bellfield, looking at me with some
							severity of expression in his countenance, - "is it Miss Fairfield who
							talks of a passion which she ought never to name? - which she ought to
							exert all her fortitude, all her resolution, to extirpate for ever from
							her heart?"</p>
						<p>"Heaven is my witness!" cried I, "that I consider Augustus Merton as the
							husband of Angelina, that for the ‘wealth of worlds’ I would not
							interrupt their happiness. To define my feelings, exactly, I cannot; yet
							I feel a consolation - a romantic satisfaction, in imagining myself as
							the window of my love! Had death taken from me the object of my
							affections, this bosom never could have known another lord. Think then,
							my dear sir, how much more acute was my misfortune, when, by a single
							stroke, an instance almost unparalleled - duty - religion - even honour,
							bade me instantly resign my living husband!"</p>
						<p>"You are an extraordinary creature!" said Mr. Bellfield, wiping his eyes;
							"and to say the truth, I do not wonder at Honeywood, when you have the
							power to make all old fellow, like myself, play the child and blubber
							before you! - But, ah! my poor Honeywood, my good boy!" - and snatching
							up his hat and, sick he walked out of the house.</p>
						<p>I will not say any thing of this new exercise of my feelings, for I must,
							ever sympathize with those whom I love; and that her Olivia, loves both
							Honeywood and his good old relative, Mrs. Milbanke will readily
							believe.</p>

						<p>MR. BELLFIELD visits me daily. Never since our first interview has he
							dropped a syllable concerning his nephew’s attachment, though his
							virtues are the never-varying topic of his discourse; and they form so
							striking a contrast to the pride, the arrogance, and the supercilious
							importance of Sir Marmaduke Ingot, that I cannot wonder at his
							garrulity. He has given me a brief sketch of Mrs. Honeywood’s life. I
							will weave it into a little narrative for your perusal.</p>

								<head type="sub">THE HISTORY OF MRS. HONEYWOOD</head>

								<p>It has been said, that Mr. Bellfield took the orphan and
									destitute children of an only sister into his house, resolving
									to become their protector - and this he was in the fullest sense
									of the word. From that hour he discarded all thoughts of
									matrimony, although his temper and his inclination would have
									led him to seek for connubial happiness; and his heart had long
									felt a secret preference in favour of a lady, whose character
									and connexions were very suitable to his own, but from the
									moment when he voluntarily resolved to be the father of the
									fatherless, he steadily applied himself to the conquest of every
									tender sentiment for this lady, and his endeavors were so far
									crowned with success, that through a long term of years, during
									which he maintained an undiminished intercourse with her, she
									had never imagined that his regard for her had ever risen beyond
									the bounds of friendship!</p>
								<p>Mrs. Moreton had left three children; the eldest was Marmaduke,
									whom his uncle soon perceived to have very ambitious notions
									joined to an imperious and irascible disposition. His views of
									gain were too arden and sanguine to bear the plodding means of
									patient industry and perseverance, by which an independence must
									be acquired in England; and his young heart burned to go to a
									climate where a fortune would be speedily acquired, and every
									luxury of life be within his reach, ere time should have
									impaired his powers of enjoyment: - a country, where the
									following maxim has too frequently been adopted by the youth who
									have set out on the career of gain - "Get money, - honestly, if
									you can; - but, whatever you do, get money."</p>
								<p>Mr. Bellfield was an easy man, - he was indulgent to all with
									whom he was concerned; and perceiving that the whole thoughts of
									Marmaduke were turned towards the East, exerted all his interest
									(which was, at that period, very great, as his mercantile
									connexions were very extensive), and fitted out his nephew for
									Bengal. The second son continued with his uncle, and died of a
									decline, when he was just starting in manhood. - This was a sore
									affliction to Sophia Moreton; she had loved her brother Charles
									with fond affection: he had always been her favourite brother,
									and constant associate and companion, during the last three
									years that she had returned from school to keep her uncle’s
									house. Mr. Bellfield dried the tears of his lovely niece - the
									good man doated on this amiable girl, whose manners and whose
									person were particularly calculated to conciliate regard; while
									the virtues of her heart gave a rich promise of future worth.
									Bereft of her brother, Sophia redoubled her attentions towards
									her kind uncle; and it might be said that she lived only to
									evince her duty and her gratitude towards him: and Mr. Bellfield
									has frequently been heard to say, that this was by far the
									happiest period of his life.</p>
								<p>Sophia Moreton was a blooming girl of eighteen, when a young West
									Indian was consigned to the care of Mr. Bellfield, in order to
									acquire a local knowledge of England by a few months residence
									in it, as a finish to commercial education. The house of
									Honeywood had for some years maintained a correspondence with
									that of Bellfield, in the mutual transaction of business; and
									always ready to do a good natured action, the good Bellfield
									welcomed the youth most cordially, and he became an inmate of
									his house. Delighted with the charms of the gay metropolis, full
									of health, with spirits and unsubdued gaiety in all the flush of
									effervescent youth, Honeywood enlivened every party, and gilded
									every hour by his unceasing vivacity. He was soon attracted by
									the beautiful simplicity of Sophia Moreton, and, hasty and
									impassioned, with all that fervour of disposition which so
									peculiarly characterizes his countrymen - he declared that
									health, that happiness, that life itself depended on his taking
									back the lovely Sophia to the West Indies as his wife. Sophia
									thought Mr. Honeywood handsome and agreeable, but she had seen
									very little of him; she could not be said to know this
									character. She felt her heart shrink within her, at the idea of
									leaving her uncle, and venturing herself with him on "untried
									seas and unknown shores;" but Honeywood, the ardent Honeywood,
									was not to be dissuaded from his purpose: he swore that he would
									never return again to his father, unless she would accede to his
									wishes; and on his knees he frantically besought Mr. Bellfield
									not to withhold his consent, not to condemn him to everlasting
									ruin! Mr. Bellfield made some allowance for the sanguine
									temperament of this young and hot-headed West Indian; he felt
									that it would be a bitter trial to him to part with his beloved
									Sophia; but self-denial had long been the good man’s practice:
									and the known wealth and established respectability of
									Honeywood’s father, the pleasing qualities of the young man, and
									his (apparently) warm regard for his niece, made him think that
									he should probably be opposing the advancement of Sophia, and
									her future happiness in life, by not furthering the union. He
									sounded his niece on the subject - poor Sophia was not deeply in
									love, but she hesitated not to acknowledge, that she certainly
									felt a preference, a sort of interest for Mr. Honeywood; and in
									reality this was the true state of her heart. But this open
									avowal from one of her modest disposition, Mr. Bellfield
									construed into something of a warmer kind, and became in
									consequence more eager to forward the union of the young couple,
									while Sophia imagining she was pleasing her uncle by a
									compliance with his wishes - an uncle to whom she owed every
									thing - no longer hesitate to become the wife of Honeywood; and
									Mr. Bellfield remitted with her ten thousand pounds as her
									wedding portion.</p>
								<p>On their first arrival in the island, all was delighted fondness
									on the part of Honeywood; proud of the beauty of his bride, and
									of the fortune which she had brought him, he introduced her to
									all his acquaintance, and they existed in one continued swirl of
									hilarity and amusement. The elder Mr. Honeywood received his
									daughter-in-law with much satisfaction, and Sophia had nothing
									to complain of: and yet there was a vacuity in her mind, a want
									of relish for all the gratifications which waited her, which she
									ingenuously attributed to the absence of her respected uncle;
									that good man, in whose society and conversation she had always
									found her highest enjoyment; whose approbation of her conduct
									had always been the stimulus of her exertions.</p>
								<p>Sophia too soon perceived that there was no stability in the
									character of her husband; his principles were not fixed, but
									veered with every impulsive movement of his feelings, and the
									rapid and changeable turns of these, in his impetuous
									constitution, were constantly engaging him in some plan, which
									interested him only, as long as any difficulty appeared in the
									pursuit. Nothing could dissuade him from any design which he
									took in hand; and his various and chimerical speculations (after
									the death of his father, which happened in a few years after his
									return to Jamaica) becoming more extensive in their aim, were
									consequently more serious in their failure, which occurred but
									too frequently. It was in vain that Sophia, by gentle
									persuasions, would have induced him to pursue one undeviating
									and steady rack; immediately on the defeat of one wild scheme,
									his whole soul was rapt on the projection of another, and his
									large fortune, in consequence, became much impoverished, and his
									affairs in great confusion. The consignments of Mr. Bellfield
									were not attended to, and poor Sophia, amidst the pressure of
									domestic disappointment and maternal solicitude, for the future
									fate of her little boy, felt a greater weight at her heart, from
									the fear that her good uncle would suffer from her husband’s
									imprudences. A prey to unceasing disquiet and anxiety, daily
									witnessing acts of the most unlicensed extravagance, with no
									power or influence in checking its career, her health was on the
									decline, and she eagerly accepted her husband’s offer of
									revisiting England for its restoration; but in fact to see her
									beloved uncle, towards whom her heart yearned with fond
									affection: and to ask his advice relative to the education of
									her son, who was now of an age to be put to school, and for
									whose morals she dreaded the tainted atmosphere of Jamaica.</p>
								<p>Sophia found her uncle depressed in spirits and circumstances.
									Time had imprinted its passing hand on his head, but his heart
									was still the same, and he folded his beloved niece to it with
									unsubdued tenderness. Sophia at this moment lifted up the
									anguished sigh, and sincerely wished she had never quitted those
									paternal arms which now sheltered her in their fond embrace!</p>
								<p>Charles Honeywood was placed at an eligible school, Sophia
									resumed her duties in her uncle’s family, and the old man smiled
									once again. Sophia’s health might have mended from the genial
									air of her native clime, from the kind indulgence of her
									protector, if the fear, the anxiety, which she suffered on the
									account of Honeywood, if the evident embarrassment of her
									uncle’s affairs - embarrassed by the negligence of her husband -
									had not imbittered every moment!</p>
								<p>Months and years passed on, and Sophia’s presence was not
									re-demanded in Jamaica. The inconstancy, the neglect of her
									husband, the entire loss of his affections, had been but too
									apparent previous to her quitting him, though her conduct had
									been irreproachable; and by patient suffering, and undiminished
									attempts to please on her part, she had mildly essayed to win
									him back to the path of duty.</p>
								<p>The involvement of Mr. Bellfield’s affairs became truly alarming,
									when the failure of Mr. Honeywood’s house in Jamaica, by
									reducing her kind, her generous uncle to the verge of ruin,
									almost broke the heart of the affectionate Sophia. It was soon
									after that the news of Honeywood’s death determined her to
									revisit a place which had lain the foundation of all her
									sorrows, in order to gather up a maintenance for her son (that
									son, whose education completed, was now all that a fond mother’s
									most sanguine wishes had depicted), if from the wreck of a
									once-noble patrimony she could but snatch a little pittance,
									something to assist her uncle - to support her Charles - she
									should be content!</p>
								<p>The struggles which Mrs. Honeywood underwent during three years
									of anxious inspection into the intricate and perplexed affairs
									of her late husband, effectually undermined her health; and she
									returned to England with a competency snatched from the ruin of
									his fortune, to resign her life in the arms of her disconsolate
									son, and to be in utter ignorance respecting the fate of her
									honoured uncle; - (for, of the title of her brother Marmaduke, -
									of his return to England, and his large fortune, she was wholly
									unacquainted).</p>
								<p>On losing his mother, Honeywood had nearly resigned himself to
									despair, when he was roused from his agonizing emotions to
									attend the death-bed of an old gentleman who was distantly
									related to his grandfather, Mr. Moreton, and who resided at Elm
									Wood in Monmouthshire. This gentleman having no near relative,
									made a will bequeathing Honeywood the bulk of his fortune, in
									estates and money, to the value of three thousand per annum. The
									heart of Honeywood experienced no exhilaration at this
									acquisition of prosperity, while yet a stranger to the fate of
									his uncle Bellfield, while yet mourning the loss of his beloved
									mother. He continued at Elm Wood, after the demise of the old
									gentleman, and in one of his accidental conversations with Dido,
									she gave him, in her simple manner, the history of the
									neighbourhood of New Park; and happened to mention the name of
									"good old Mr. Bellfield, as one of her dear Missee’s best
									friends." Honeywood did not notice the discovery to her, but
									instantly wrote to the venerable gentleman as has been
									mentioned.</p>

						<p>DEAREST Mrs. Milbanke! I am foiled in my best designs. Augustus has

					</div>
					<div type="entry">
						<head type="sub">IN CONTINUATION</head>
						<p>YES! My beloved friend, I am coming to you. I waited but for you to
							suggest a scheme which my heart has long anticipated. Your letter is
							arrived, and Dido is already packing up with avidity. We will revisit
							Jamaica. I shall come back to the scenes of my infantine happiness - of
							my youthful tranquillity. I shall again zealously engage myself in
							ameliorating the situation, in instructing the minds - in mending the
							morals of our poor blacks. I shall again enjoy the society of my dear
							Mrs. Milbanke - I shall forget the lapse of time which has occurred
							since I parted from her, and shall again be happy! Eager to be with you
							once more, I almost count the tardy minutes as they move along.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="entry">
						<head type="sub">IN CONTINUATION</head>
						<p>MY passage is taken in the ****; and to-morrow I set out for Bristol.
							England, favoured Isle! - Happy country, where the laws are duly
							administered - where the arts - the sciences flourish, and where
							religion is to be found in all its beautiful purity. Farewel! - a long
							farewel! - Fain would I have taken up my abode in this charming clime, -
							but Heaven forbade it. Yet, England, I shall carry with me over the
							world of waters a veneration for thy name, a veneration for that soil
							which produced a Lumley - a Bellfield - and an Augustus Merton!</p>

						<head type="sub">DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE EDITOR AND A FRIEND.</head>

						<p>Friend. - What do you propose from the publication of the foregoing tale?
							If your Woman of Colour be an imaginary character, I do not see the
							drift of your labours, as undoubtedly there is no moral to the work!</p>
						<p>Editor. - How so?</p>
						<p>Friend. - You have not rewarded Olivia even with the usual meed of virtue
							- a husband!</p>
						<p>Editor. - Virtue, like Olivia Fairfield’s, may truly be said to be its
							own reward - the moral I would deduce from her story is, that there is
							no situation in which the mind (which is strongly imbued with the truths
							of our most holy faith, and the consciousness of a divine Disposer of
							Events) may not resist itself against misfortune, and become resigned to
							its fate. And if these pages should teach one child of calamity to see
							Him in the hour of distress who is always to be found, if they teach one
							skeptical European to look with a compassionate eye towards the despised
							native of Africa - then, whether Olivia Fairfield’s be a real or an
							imaginary character, I shall not regret that I have edited the Letters
							of Woman of Colour!</p>
