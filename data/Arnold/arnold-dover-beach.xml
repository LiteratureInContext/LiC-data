                     <note>This digital edition has been transcribed from the first edition of <hi rend="italic">New Poems</hi>, published in 1867. Page images courtesy of <ref target="https://search.lib.virginia.edu/sources/uva_library/items/u415095">The University of Virginia Special Collections</ref>. "Dover Beach" is Arnold's most celebrated poem, and he began writing it over a decade before its publication and just after his marriage to Frances Lucy Wightman. It encapsulates much of Arnold's thought about the techtonic cultural shifts afoot during the Victorian period, especially around industrialization and its effects. In <hi rend="italic">Culture and Anarchy</hi>, which was published at the same time as <hi rend="italic">New Poems</hi>, Arnold gives prosaic voice to his view that culture--"the best which has been thought and said in the world"--is a balm or corrective to the mechanizations of the modern world (the quote comes from the preface to <hi rend="italic">Culture and Anarchy</hi>). The poem addresses an unknown auditor, perhaps a representation of his spouse, and given the time of its authorship as well as its themes, critics often term "Dover Beach" a honeymoon poem in which love has perhaps a salvific effect.</note>
