                   <p>THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE
                       TO THE SECOND EDITION</p>
                   <p>   A PREFACE to the first edition of Jane Eyre being unnecessary, I
                       gave none: this second edition demands a few words both of
                       acknowledgment and miscellaneous remark.</p>
                   <p>   My thanks are due in three quarters.</p>
                   <p>   To the Public, for the indulgent ear it has inclined to a plain
                       tale with few pretensions.</p>
                   <p>   To the Press, for the fair field its honest suffrage has opened
                       to an obscure aspirant.</p>
                   <p>   To my Publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy, their
                       practical sense and frank liberality have afforded an unknown and
                       unrecommended Author.</p>
                   <p>   The Press and the Public are but vague personifications for me, and
                       I must thank them in vague terms; but my Publishers are definite: so
                       are certain generous critics who have encouraged me as only
                       large-hearted and high-minded men know how to encourage a struggling
                       stranger; to them, i.e., to my Publishers and the select Reviewers,
                       I say cordially, Gentlemen, I thank you from my heart.</p>
                   <p>   Having thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided and
                       approved me, I turn to another class; a small one, so far as I know,
                       but not, therefore, to be overlooked. I mean the timorous or carping
                       few who doubt the tendency of such books as Jane Eyre: in whose eyes
                       whatever is unusual is wrong; whose ears detect in each protest
                       against bigotry- that parent of crime- an insult to piety, that regent
                       of God on earth. I would suggest to such doubters certain obvious
                       distinctions; I would remind them of certain simple truths.</p>
                   <p>   Conventionality is not morality. Self-righteousness is not
                       religion. To attack the first is not to assail the last. To pluck
                       the mask from the face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand
                       to the Crown of Thorns.</p>
                   <p>   These things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as
                       distinct as is vice from virtue. Men too often confound them: they
                       should not be confounded: appearance should not be mistaken for truth;
                       narrow human doctrines, that only tend to elate and magnify a few,
                       should not be substituted for the world-redeeming creed of Christ.
                       There is- I repeat it- a difference; and it is a good, and not a bad
                       action to mark broadly and clearly the line of separation between
                       them.</p>
                   <p>   The world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for it has
                       been accustomed to blend them; finding it convenient to make
                       external show pass for sterling worth- to let white-washed walls vouch
                       for clean shrines. It may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose-
                       to rase the gilding, and show base metal under it- to penetrate the
                       sepulchre, and reveal charnel relics: but hate as it will, it is
                       indebted to him.</p>
                   <p>   Ahab did not like Micaiah, because he never prophesied good
                       concerning him, but evil; probably he liked the sycophant son of
                       Chenaanah better; yet might Ahab have escaped a bloody death, had he
                       but stopped his ears to flattery, and opened them to faithful counsel.</p>
                   <p>   There is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to tickle
                       delicate ears: who, to my thinking, comes before the great ones of
                       society, much as the son of Imlah came before the throned Kings of
                       Judah and Israel; and who speaks truth as deep, with a power as
                       prophet-like and as vital- a mien as dauntless and as daring. Is the
                       satirist of Vanity Fair admired in high places? I cannot tell; but I
                       think if some of those amongst whom he hurls the Greek fire of his
                       sarcasm, and over whom he flashes the levin-brand of his denunciation,
                       were to take his warnings in time- they or their seed might yet escape
                       a fatal Ramoth-Gilead.</p>
                   <p>   Why have I alluded to this man? I have alluded to him, Reader,
                       because I think I see in him an intellect profounder and more unique
                       than his contemporaries have yet recognised; because I regard him as
                       the first social regenerator of the day- as the very master of that
                       working corps who would restore to rectitude the warped system of
                       things; because I think no commentator on his writings has yet found
                       the comparison that suits him, the terms which rightly characterise
                       his talent. They say he is like Fielding: they talk of his wit,
                       humour, comic powers. He resembles Fielding as an eagle does a
                       vulture: Fielding could stoop on carrion, but Thackeray never does.
                       His wit is bright, his humour attractive, but both bear the same
                       relation to his serious genius that the mere lambent sheet-lightning
                       playing under the edge of the summer-cloud does to the electric
                       death-spark hid in its womb. Finally, I have alluded to Mr. Thackeray,
                       because to him- if he will accept the tribute of a total stranger- I
                       have dedicated this second edition of Jane Eyre.</p>

                   <p>   December 21st, 1847.</p>
                   <p>                       THE AUTHOR'S NOTE
                       TO THE THIRD EDITION</p>
                   <p>   I AVAIL myself of the opportunity which a third edition of Jane
                       Eyre affords me, of again addressing a word to the Public, to
                       explain that my claim to the title of novelist rests on this one
                       work alone. If, therefore, the authorship of other works of fiction
                       has been attributed to me, an honour is awarded where it is not
                       merited; and consequently, denied where it is justly due.</p>
                   <p>   This explanation will serve to rectify mistakes which may already
                       have been made, and to prevent future errors.</p>
                   <p>                                                         CURRER BELL.</p>
                   <p>   April 13th, 1848.</p>
