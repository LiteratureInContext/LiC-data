                <l> AS it's an Establish'd Custom in these latter Ages, for all Writers,
                    particularly the Poetical, to shelter their Productions under the Protection of
                    the most Distinguish'd, whose Approbation pro duces a kind of Inspiration, much
                    superior to that which the <hi rend="italic">Heathenish</hi> Poets pretended to
                    derive from their Fictitious <hi rend="italic">Apollo:</hi> So it was my
                    Ambition to Address one of my weak Performances to Your Lordship, who, by
                    Universal Consent, are justly allow'd to be the best Judge of all kinds of
                    Writing. </l>
                <l> I was indeed at first deterr'd from my Design, by a Thought that it might be
                    accounted unpardonable Rudeness to obtarude a Trifle of this Nature to a Person,
                    whose sublime Wisdome moderates that Council, which at this Critical Juncture,
                    over-rules the Fate of all <hi rend="italic">Europe.</hi> But then I was
                    encourag'd by Reflecting, that <hi rend="italic">Lelius</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Scipio,</hi> the two greatest Men in their <pb/> Time, among
                    the <hi rend="italic">Romans,</hi>both for Political and Military Virtues, in
                    the height of their important Affairs, thought the Perusal and Improving of <hi
                        rend="italic">Terence</hi> 's Comedies the noblest way of unbinding their
                    Minds. I own I were guilty of the highest Vanity, should I presume to put my
                    Composures in Parallel with those of that Celebrated <hi rend="italic"
                        >Dramatist;</hi> But then again, I hope that Your Lordship's native Goodness
                    and Generosity, in Condescention to the Taste of the Best and Fairest part of
                    the Town, who have been pleas'd to be diverted by the following SCENES, will
                    excuse and overlook such Faults as your nicer Judgment might discern. </l>
                <l>And here, my Lord, the Occasion seems fair for me to engage in a Panegyrick upon
                    those Natural and Acquired Abilities, which so brightly Adorn your Person: But I
                    shall resist that Temptation, being conscious of the Inequality of a Female Pen

                    <l>THO' modern Prophets were expos'd of late,</l>
                    <l>The Author cou'd not Prophesy his Fate:</l>
                    <l>If with such Scenes an Audience had been fir'd,</l>
                    <l>The Poet must have really been Inspir'd.</l>
                    <l>But these, alas! are Melancholy Days</l>
                    <l>For Modern Prophets and for Modern Plays.</l>
                    <l>Yet since Prophetick Lyes please Fools o' Fashion,</l>
                    <l>And Women are so fond of Agitation;</l>
                    <l>To Men of Sense I'll Prophesy anew,</l>
                    <l>And tell you wond'rous things that will prove true;</l>
                    <l><hi rend="italic">Undaunted Colonels will to Camps repair,</hi></l>
                    <l><hi rend="italic">Assur'd, there'll be no Skirmishes this Year;</hi></l>
                    <l>On our own Terms will flow the wish'd-for Peace,</l>
                    <l>All Wars, except 'twixt Man and Wife, will cease.</l>
                    <l>The Grand Monarch may wish his Son a Throne,</l>
                    <l>But hardly will advance to lose his own.</l>
                    <l>This Season most things bear a smiling Face;</l>
                    <l>But Play'rs in Summer have a dismal Case,</l>
                    <l>Since your Appearance only is our Act of Grace.</l>

                            Expences too great, and I his Allowance too little; he never sees me,
                            but he quarrels; and to avoid that, I shun his House as much as
                            possible. The Report is, he intends to marry her himself. </l>
