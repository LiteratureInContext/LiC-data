<p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl, TEI @ Oxford. </p>
</projectDesc>
<editorialDecl>
<p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
<p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
<p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
<p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
<p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
<p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as <gap>s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
<p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
<p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

        IT has ever been the Custom of Poets to shelter Productions of this Nature under the Patronage of the brightest Men of their Time;
        and 'tis observ'd, that the Muses always met the kindest Reception from Persons of the greatest Merit. The World will do me Justice as to the Choice of my Patron, but will, I fear, blame

        blame my rash Attempt, in daring to Address Your Grace, and offer at a Work too difficult for our ablest Pens,
        <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> an Encomium on Your Grace: I have no Plea against such just Reflections, but the Disadvantage of Education, and the Privilege of my Sex.
        </p>
        <p>
        If Your Grace discovers a Genius so surprising in this Dawn of Life, what must your riper Years produce? Your Grace has already been distinguish'd in a most peculiar Manner, being the first Young Nobleman that ever was admitted
        into a House of Peers before he reached the Age of One and Twenty: But Your Grace's Judgment and Eloquence
        soon convinced that August Assembly, that the excelling Gifts of Nature ought not to be confin'd to Time. We hope the Example which
        <hi rend="italic">Ireland</hi> has set, will shortly be followed by an
        <hi rend="italic">English</hi>
        House of Lords, and Your Grace made a Member of that Body, to which You will be so Conspicuous an Ornament.
        </p>
        <p>
        Your good Sense, and real Love for your Country, taught Your Grace to persevere in the Principles of your Glorious
        </p>
        <pb facs="tcp:0391401600:5" n="A4"/>
        <head><hi rend="italic">DEDICATION.</hi><lb/></head>
        <p>
        rious Ancestors, by adhering to the Defender of our Religion and Laws: and the penetrating Wisdom of Your Royal Master,
        saw you merited your Honours ere he conferr'd them. It is one of the greatest Glories of a Monarch,
        to distinguish where to bestow his Favours; and the World must do ours Justice, by owning Your Grace's Titles most deservedly worn.
        </p>
        <p>
        It is with the greatest Pleasure imaginable
        the Friends of Liberty see You pursuing the Steps of Your Noble Father:
        Your Courteous, Affable Temper, free from Pride and Ostentation,
        makes Your Name ador'd in the Country, and enables Your Grace to carry what Point You please. The late Lord
        <hi rend="italic">Wharton</hi>
        will be still remember'd by every Lover of his Country, which never
        felt a greater Shock than what his Death occasion'd: Their Grief had been inconsolable, if Heaven, out of its wonted
        Beneficence to this Favourite Isle, had not transmitted all his shining Qualities to you, and Phenix like, raised up one Patriot out of the Ashes of
        another.
        </p>
        <p>
        That
        </p>

        <head><hi rend="italic">DEDICATION.</hi><lb/></head>
        <p>
        That Your Grace has a high Esteem for Learning, particularly appears by the large Progress you have made therein: and your Love for the Muses shews a Sweetness of Temper, and
        Generous Humanity, peculiar to the Greatness
        of Your Soul; for such Virtues reign not in the Breast of every Man of Quality.
        </p>
        <p>
        Defer no longer then, my Lord, to charm the World with the Beauty of your Numbers, and shew the Poet, as you have done the Orator; convince our unthinking
        <hi rend="italic">Britous,</hi>
        by what vile Arts
        <hi rend="italic">France</hi>
        lost her Liberty; and teach 'em to avoid their own Misfortunes, as well as to weep over
        <hi rend="italic">Henry</hi>
        IV. who (if it were possible for him to know) would forgive the bold Assassin's Hand, for the Honour of having his Fall celebrated by Your Grace's Pen.
        </p>
        <p>
        To be distinguish'd by Persons of Your Grace's Character, is not only the highest Ambition, but the greatest
        Reputation to an Author; and it is not the least of my Vanities, to have it known to the Publick I had Your Grace's Leave to prefix Your Name to this Comedy. I

        <head><hi rend="italic">DEDICATION.</hi><lb/></head>
        <p>
        I wish I were capable to cloath the following Scenes in such a Dress, as might be worthy to appear before Your Grace, and draw Your Attention as much as Your Grace's admirable
        Qualifications do that of all Mankind; but the Muses, like most Females, are least liberal to their own Sex.
        </p>
        <p>
        All I dare say in Favour of this Piece is, that the Plot is entirely New, and the Incidents wholly owing to my own
        Invention; not borrow'd from our own, or translated from the Works of any Foreign Poet; so that they have at least the Charm of Novelty to recommend 'em: If they are so lucky in some leisure
        Hour to give Your Grace the Least Diversion, they will answer the utmost Ambition of, my Lord,

        </l>
        </sp>
        <sp>
        <speaker>Col.</speaker>
        <l>
        She visited a Lady who boarded in the same House with me: I lik'd her Person, and found an Opportunity to tell her so:
        She reply'd, she had no Objection to mine; but if I could not reconcile Contradictions, I must not think of her,
        for that she was condemned to the Caprice of four Persons, who never yet agreed in any one thing, and she was oblig'd to please them all.
        </l>

        <l>
        'Tis most true, Sir; I'll give you a short Description of the Men, and leave you to judge of the poor Lady's Condition. One is a kind of a
        <hi rend="italic">Virtuoso,</hi>
        a silly, half-witted Fellow, but positive and surly; fond of nothing but what is Antique and Foreign, and wears his Cloaths of the Fashion of the last Century; doats upon Travellers, and believes Sir
        <hi rend="italic">John Mandiville</hi>
        more than the Bible.
        </l>
        </sp>
        <sp>
        <speaker>Col.</speaker>
        <l>That must be a rare old Fellow!</l>
        </sp>
        <sp>
        <speaker>Sack.</speaker>
        <l>Another is a Change-Broker; a Fellow that will out-lie the Devil for the Advantage of Stock, and cheat his Father that got him in a Bargain: He is a great Stickler for Trade and hates every thing that wears a Sword.</l>
        </sp>
        <sp>
        <speaker>Free.</speaker>
        <l>
        He is a great Admirer of the
        <hi rend="italic">Dutch</hi>
        Management, and swears they understand Trade better than any Nation under the Sun.
        </l>
        </sp>
        <sp>
        <speaker>Sack.</speaker>
        <l>
        The Third is an old Beau, that has
        <hi rend="italic">May</hi>

        <l>There is nothing impossible to a Lover. What would not a Man attempt for a fine Woman and Thirty Thousand Pounds? Besides, my Honour is at Stake; I promis'd to deliver her‚Äîand she bad me win her, and take her.</l>

        If it depended upon Knight-Errantry, I should not doubt your setting free the Damsel; but to have Avarice,
        Impertinence, Hypocrifie, and Pride, at once to deal with, requires more Cunning than generally attends a Man of Honour.

        That's not the Way, I am sure. No, no, Girl, there are certain Ingredients to be mingled with Matrimony, without which,
        I may as well change for the worse as for the better. When the Woman has Fortune enough to make the Man happy,
        if he has either Honour or Good Manners,
        he'll make her easie. Love makes but a slovenly Figure in that House, where Poverty keeps the Door.
