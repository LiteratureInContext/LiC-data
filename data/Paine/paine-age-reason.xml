<p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl, TEI @ Oxford. </p>
</projectDesc>
<editorialDecl>
<p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
<p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
<p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
<p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
<p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
<p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as <gap>s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
<p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
<p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                IT is not intended by this Note to the Reader to apologize, nor is it necessary, for the publication
                of the First Part of a work called "THE AGE OF REASON," written by so celebrated an author as THOMAS PAINE.
                The Publisher knows, that as well as there are persons biassed by <hi rend="italic">prejudices</hi>
                there are others blinded by <hi rend="italic">partiality</hi>. The best men are influenced by long
                and ancient habits and practices. He wishes not to offend the good, he would not arm the hand or aid
                the tongue of the bad. All rational men allow TRUTH to be discovered by free discussion, to follow
                unrestrained research. The subject which THE AGE OF REASON holds to our view, is consessedly of the first
                importance; if the Writer, equally zealous for freeing his fellow creatures from their religious as from their
                political shackles, should be found to have erred in his means, or failed in his intentions, it will
                be for more matured philosophy to set him right. It is, and ought always to be the business of the lovers
                and abettors of Truth (among whom the Publisher of these sheets is desirous to be classed) to hold up both
                sides of the question, that REASON may determine which is right.

                <head>THE AGE OF REASON.<lb/>
                PART THE FIRST</head>
                <p>IT has been my intention, for several years past, to publish my thoughts upon religion.
                I am well aware of the difficulties that attend the subject; and, from that consideration,
                had reserved it to a more advanced period of life. I intended it to be the last offering I should make to my fellow citizens of all nations:
                and that at a time when the purity of the motive that induced me to it, could not admit of a question, even by those who might disapprove the work.</p>
                <p>
                The circumstance that has now taken place in <placeName key="1000070" type="tgn">France,</placeName> of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood,
                and of every thing appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith,
                has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary;
                lest, in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology,
                we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.
                </p>
                <p>
                As several of my colleagues, and others of my fellow citizens of France,
                have given me the example of making their voluntary and individual
                profession of faith, I also will make mine: and I do this with all that sincerity
                and frankness with which the mind of man communicates with itself.
                </p>
                <p>I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.</p>
                <p>
                I believe the equality of man, and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice,
                loving mercy, and endeavouring to make our fellow creatures happy.
                </p>
                <p>But lest it should be supposed that I believe many other things in addition to these, I shall,
                in the progress of this work, declare the things I do not believe, and my reasons for not believing them.</p>
                <p>
                I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church,
                by the Turkish church,
                </p>
                <p>
                A2    church,
                </p>
                <pb n="4"/>
                <p>
                church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.
                </p>
                <p>
                All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian, or Turkish, appear to me
                no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.

                I do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise. They have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.
                But it is necessary to the happiness of man, that he be mentally faithful to himself.
                Infidelity does not consist in believing, or in disbelieving:
                it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe.

                It is impossible to calculate the moral mischief, if I may so express it,
                that mental lying has produced in society. When
                a man has so far corrupted and prostituted the chastity of his mind, as to subscribe his professional
                belief to things he does not believe, he has prepared himself for the commission of every other crime.
                He takes up the trade of a priest for the sake of gain, and in order to
                <hi rend="italic">qualify</hi>
                himself for that trade, he begins with perjury.
                Can we conceive anything more destructive to morality than this?

                Soon after I had published the pamphlet, COMMON SENSE, in America, I saw the exceeding probability
                that a revolution in the System of Government would be followed by a revolution in the System of Religion.
                The adulterous connection of church and state, wherever it had taken place, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish,
                had so effectually prohibited, by pains and penalties, every discussion upon established creeds, and upon first principles of religion,
                that until the system of government should be changed, those subjects could not be brought fairly and openly before the world:
                but that whenever this should be done, a revolution in the system of religion would follow.
                Human inventions and Priest-craft would be detected: and man would return to the pure,
                unmixed, and unadulterated belief of one God, and no more.
                </p>
                <p>
                Every national church or religion has established itself by pretending some special mission from God,
                communicated to certain individuals. The Jews have their Moses; The Christians their Jesus Christ, their apostles and saints;
                and the Turks their Mahomet; as if the way to God was not open to every man alike.
                </p>
                <p>
                Each of those churches show certain books, which they call
                <hi rend="italic">revelation,</hi>
                or the word of God. The Jews say, that their word of God was given by God to Moses, face to face;
                the Christians
                </p>
                <p>
                Christians
                </p>
                <pb n="5"/>
                <p>
                Christians say, that their word of God came by divine inspiration; and the Turks say,
                that their word of God (the Koran) was brought by an angel from heaven.
                Each of those churches accuses the other of unbelief; and, for my own part, I disbelieve them all.
                </p>
                <p>
                As it is necessary to affix right ideas to words, I will, before I proceed further into the subject,
                offer some observations on the word
                <hi rend="italic">revelation.</hi>
                Revelation, when applied to religion, means something communicated
                <hi rend="italic">
                immediately
                </hi>
                from God to man.
                </p>
                <p>
                No one will
                deny or dispute the power of the Almighty to make such a communication, if he pleases.
                But admitting, for the sake of a case, that something has been revealed to a certain person,
                and not revealed to any other person, it is revelation to that person only.
                When he tells to a second person, a second to a third, a third to a fourth, and so on,
                it ceases to be a revelation to all those persons. It is revelation to the first person
                only, and
                <hi rend="italic">hearsay</hi>
                to every other; and consequently, they are not obliged to believe it.
                </p>
                <p>
                It is a contradiction in terms and ideas to call any thing a revelation that comes to us at second hand,
                either verbally or in writing. Revelation is necessarily limitted to the first communication.
                After this it is only an account of something which that person says was a revelation made to him;
                and though he may find himself obliged to believe it, it cannot be incumbent upon me to believe it in the same manner;
                for it was not a revelation made to
                <hi rend="italic">me,</hi>
                and I have only his word for it that it was made to him.
                </p>
                <p>
                When Moses told the children of Israel that he received the two tables of the commandments
                from the hand of God, they were not obliged to believe him, because they had no other authority
                for it than his telling them so; and I have no other authority for it than some historian telling me so.
                The commandments carry no internal evidence of divinity with them. They contain some good moral precepts,
                such as any man qualified to be a lawgiver, or a legislator, could produce himself,
                without having recourse to supernatural intervention.*

                *It is, however, necessary to except the declaration, which says, that God

                It is contrary to every principle of moral justice.

                Joseph, said, that an angel told him so; I have a right to believe them or not:
                such a circumstance required a much stronger evidence than their
                bare word for it: but we have not even this: for neither Joseph nor Mary wrote any such matter themselves.
                It is only reported by others that
                <hi rend="italic">they said so.</hi>
                It is hearsay upon
                hearsay, and I do not chuse to rest my belief upon such evidence.
                </p>
                <p>
                It is, however, not difficult to account for the credit that was given to the story of Jesus Christ being the Son of God.
                He was born at a time when the Heathen mythology had still some fashionand repute in the world,
                and that mythology had prepared the people for the belief of such a story. Almost all the extraordinary men
                that lived under the Heathen mythology were reputed to be the sons of some of their gods.
                It was not a new thing, at that time, to believe a man to have been celestially begotten:
                the intercourse of gods with women, was then a matter of familiar opinion. Their Jupiter,
                according to their accounts, had cohabited with hundreds: the story, therefore, had nothing in it
                either new, wonderful or obscene: it was conformable to the opinions that then prevailed among the people
                called Gentiles, or mythologists, and it was
                those people only that believed it. The Jews, who had kept strictly to the belief of one God,
                and no more, and who had always rejected the Heathen mythology, never credited the story.
                </p>
                <p>
                It is curious to observe how the theory of what is called the Christian church, sprung out of the tail of the heathen mythology.
                A direct incorporation took place in the first instance, by making the reputed founder to be celestially begotten.
                The trinity of gods that then followed was no other than a reduction of the former plurality,
                which was about twenty or thirty thousand. The statue of Mary succeeded the statue of Diana of Ephesus.
                The deification of heroes, changed into the cannonization of saints. The mythologists had gods for every thing;
                the Christian mythologists had saints for every thing. The church became as crowded with the one,
                as the pantheon had been with the other; and Rome was the place of both. The Christian theory is little else than the
                idolatry of the ancient mythologists, accommodated to the purposes of power and revenue;
                and it yet remains to reason and philosophy to abolish the amphibious fraud.

                Nothing that is here said can apply, even with the most distant disrespect, to the
                <hi rend="italic">real</hi> character of Jesus Christ.
                He was virtuous and an amiable man. The morality that he preached
                </p>
                <pb n="7"/>
                <p>
                and practised was of the most benevolent kind;
                and though similar systems of morality had been preached by Confucius, and by some of the Greek philosophers,
                many years before; by the Quakers since; and by many good men in all ages; it has not been exceeded by any.
                </p>
                <p>
                Jesus Christ wrote no account of himself, of his
                birth, parentage, or any thing else. Not a line of what is called the New Testament is of his own writing.
                The history of him is altogether the work of other people; and as to the account given of his resurrection
                and ascension, it was the necessary counterpart to the story of his birth. His historians, having brought
                him into the world in a supernatural manner, were obliged to take him out again in the same manner,
                or the first part of the story must have fallen to the ground.
                </p>
                <p>
                The wretched contrivance with which this latter part is told, exceeds every thing that went before it.
                The first part, that of the miraculous conception, was not a thing that admitted of publicity;
                and therefore the tellers of this part of the story had this advantage,
                that though they might not be credited, they could not be detected.
                They could not be expected to prove it, because it was not one of those things that admitted of proof,
                and it was impossible that the person of whom it was told could prove it himself.
                </p>
                <p>
                But the resurrection of a dead person from the grave, and his aseension through the air,
                is a thing very different as to the evidence it admits of, to the invisible conception of a child in the womb.
                The resurrection and ascension, supposing them to have taken place, admitted of public and occular demonstration,
                like that of the ascension of a balloon, or the sun at noon day, to all Jerusalem at least.
                A thing which every body is required to believe, requires that the proof and evidence of it should be equal to all,
                and universal; and as the public visibility of this last related act was the only evidence that
                could give sanction to the former part, the whole of it falls to the ground
                because the evidence never was given. Instead of this, a small number of persons, not
                more than eight or nine, are introduced as proxies for the whole world, to say, they
                <hi rend="italic">saw it,</hi>
                and all the rest of the world are called upon to believe it. But it appears that Thomas did not believe the resurrection;
                and, as they say, would not believe, without having occular and manual demonstration himself.
                <hi rend="italic">So neither will I,</hi>
                and the reason is equally as good for me, and for every other person, as for Thomas.
                </p>
                <p>
                It is in vain to attempt to palliate or disguise this matter. The story, so far as relates to the supernatural part,
                has every
                </p>
                <p>
                mark
                </p>
                <pb n="8"/>
                <p>mark of fraud and imposition stamped upon the face of it. Who were the authors of it
                is impossible for us now to know, as it is for us to be assured, that the books in which the account is related,
                were written by the persons whose names they bear. The best surviving evidence we have respecting this
                affair is the Jews. They are regularly descended from the people who lived in the times this resurrection
                and ascension is said to have happened, and they say
                <hi rend="italic">it is not true.</hi>
                It has long appeared to me a strange inconsistency to cite the Jews as a proof of the truth of the story.
                It is just the same as if a man were to say, I will prove the truth of what I have told you,
                by producing the people who say it is false.

                That such a person as Jesus Christ existed, and that he was crucified, which was the mode of execution at that day,
                are historical relations strictly within the limits of probability. He preached most excellent morality,
                and the equality of man; but he preached also against the corruptions and avarice of the Jewish priests,
                and this brought upon him the hatred and vengeance of the whole order of priesthood.
                The accusation which those priests brought against him, was that of sedition and conspiracy against the Roman government,
                to which the Jews were then subject and tributary; and it is not improbable that the Roman government might have
                some secret apprehension of the effects of his doctrine as well as the Jewish priests;
                neither is it improbable that Jesus Christ had in contemplation the delivery of the Jewish nation from the bondage of
                the Romans. Between the two, however, this virtuous reformer and revolutionist lost his life.
                </p>
                <p>
                It is upon this plain narrative of facts, together with another case I am going to mention,
                that the Christian mythologists, calling themselves the Christian Church, have erected their fable,
                which, for absurdity and extravagance is not exceeded by any thing that is to be found in the mythology of the ancients.
                </p>
                <p>
                The ancient mythologists tell that the race of Giants made war against Jupiter, and that one of them threw an hundred rocks against him at one throw;
                that Jupiter defeated him with thunder, and confined him afterwards under Mount Etna:
                and that every time the Giant turns himself, Mount Etna belches fire.
                It is here easy to see that the circumstance of the mountain, that of its being a vulcano,
                suggested the idea of the fable; and that the fable is made to fit and wind itself up with that circumstance.
                </p>
                <p>
                The Christian mythologists tell us, that their Satan made war against the Almighty, who defeated him,
                and confind him
                </p>
                <p>
                afterwards,
                </p>
                <pb n="9"/>
                <p>afterwards, not under a mountain, but in a pit.
                It is here easy to see that the first fable suggested the idea of the second;
                for the fable of Jupiter and the Giants was told many a hundred years before that of Satan.
                </p>
                <p>
                Thus far the ancient and the Christian mythologists differ very little from each other. But the
                latter have contrived to carry the matter much farther. They have contrived to connect the fabulous part of
                the story of Jesus Christ, with the fable originating from Mount Etna: and, in order to make all the parts of
                the story tie together, they have
                taken to their aid the tradition of the Jews; for the Christian mythology is made up partly from the ancient mythology,
                and partly from the Jewish traditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                The Christian mythologists, after having confined Satan in a pit, were obliged to let him out again,
                to bring on the sequel of the fable. He is then introduced into the garden of Eden in the shape of a snake
                or a serpent, and in that shape he enters into familiar conversation with Eve, who is no ways surprised to hear a
                snake talk; and the issue of this tête-à-tète is, that he persuades her to eat an apple,
                and the eating of that apple damns all mankind.
                </p>
                <p>
                After giving Satan this triumph over the whole creation, one would have supposed that the church mythologists
                would have been kind enough to send him back again to the
                pit; or, if they had not done this, that they would have put a mountain upon him
                (for they say that their faith can remove a mountain), or have put him
                <hi rend="italic">under</hi>
                a mountain, as the former mythologists had done, to prevent his getting again among the women,
                and doing more mischief. But instead of this, they leave him at large, without even obliging him to give his parole.
                The secret of which is, that they could not do without him: and after being at the trouble of making him,
                they bribed him to stay. They promised him ALL the Jews, ALL the Turks by anticipation, nine-tenths of the world beside,
                and Mahomet into the bargain. After this, who can doubt the bountifulness of the Christian mythology.
                </p>
                <p>
                Having thus made an insurrection and a battle in heaven, in which none of the combatants could be either
                killed or wounded—put Satan into the pit—let him out again—given him a triumph over the whole
                creation—damned all manking for the eating of an apple, the Christian mythologists bring
                the two ends of their fable together.
                They represent this virtuous and amiable man, Jesus Christ, to be at once both God and man,
                and also the Son of God, celestially begotten, on purpose to

                be sacrificed, because they say

                Putting aside every thing that might excite laughter by its absurdity, or detestation by its prophaneness,
                and confining ourselves merely to an examination of the parts,
                it is impossible to conceive a story more derogatory to the Almighty,
                more inconsistent with his wisdom, more contradictory
                to his power, than this story is.

                <p>
                In order to make for it a foundation to rise upon, the inventors were under the necessity of giving to the being, whom they call Satan,
                a power equally as great, if not greater than they attribute to the Almighty.
                They have not only given him the power of liberating himself from the pit,
                after what they call his fall, but they have made that power increase afterwards to infinity.
                Before his fall they represent him only as an angel of limited existence,
                as they represent the rest. After his fall, he becomes, by their account omnipresent.
                He exists everywhere, and at the same time. He occupies the whole immensity of space.
                </p>
                <p>
                Not content with this deification of Satan, they represent him as defeating, by stratagem,
                in the shape of an animal of the creation, all the power and wisdom of the Almighty.
                They represent him as having compelled the Almighty to the
                <hi rend="italic">direct necessity</hi>
                either of surrendering the whole of the creation to the government and sovereignty of this Satan,
                or of capitulating for its redemption by coming down upon earth and exhibiting himself upon a cross
                in the shape of a man.
                </p>
                <p>
                Had the inventors of this story told it the contrary way, that is, had they represented the Almighty as compelling Satan to exhibit
                <hi rend="italic">himself</hi>
                on a cross, in the shape of a snake, as a punishment for his new transgression,
                the story would have been less absurd, less contradictory. But instead of this
                they make the transgressor triumph, and the Almighty fall.
                </p>
                <p>
                That many good men have believed this strange fable, and lived very good lives under that belief (for credulity is not a crime)
                is what I have no doubt of. In the first place, they were educated to believe it,
                and they would have believed any thing else in the same manner.
                There are also many who have been so enthusiastically enraptured by what they have conceived to be the
                infinite love of God to man, in making a sacrifice of himself, that the vehemence of the
                idea has forbidden and deterred them from examining into the absurdity and prophaneness of the story.
                The more unnatural any thing is, the more is it capable of becoming the object of dismal admiration.
                </p>
                <p>
                But

                <p>
                But if objects of gratitude and admiration are our desire, do they not present themselves every hour to our
                eyes? Do we not see a fair creation prepared to receive us the instant we are born,
                a world furnished to our hands that cost us nothing? Is it we that light up the sun;
                that pour down the rain; and fill the earth with abundance? Whether we sleep or wake,
                the vast machinery of the universe still goes on. Are these things, and the blessings they indicate
                in future, nothing to us? Can our gross feelings be excited by no other subjects than tragedy and suicide!
                Or is the gloomy pride of man become so intolerable, that nothing can flatter it but a sacrifice of the Creator?
                </p>
                <p>
                I know that this bold investigation will alarm many, but it would be paying too great a compliment to their credulity
                to forbear it upon that account. The times and the subject demand it to be done. The suspicion that the theory of what is called the
                Christian Church is fabulous, is becoming very extensive in all countries; and it will be a consolation to men staggering under that suspicion,
                and doubting what to believe and what to disbelieve, to see the subject freely investigated.
                I therefore pass on to an examination of the books called the Old and the New Testament.
                </p>
                <p>These books, beginning with Genesis and ending with Revelations (which by the bye is a book of riddles that requires a Revelation to explain it)
                are, we are told, the word of God. It is therefore proper for us to know who told us so,
                that we may know what credit to give the report. The answer to this question is, that nobody can tell,
                except that we tell one another so. The case, however, historically appears to be as follows:</p>
                <p>
                When the church mythologists established their system, they collected all the writings they could find,
                and managed them as they pleased. It is a matter altogether of uncertainty to us,
                whether such of the writings as now appear, under the name of the Old and the New Testament,
                are in the same state in which those collectors say they found them; or whether they added, altered,
                abridged, or dressed them up.
                </p>
                <p>
                Be this as it may, they decided by <hi rend="italic">vote</hi> which of the books out of the collection they had made,
                should be the WORD OF GOD, and which should not. They rejected several;
                they voted others to be doubtful, such as the books called the Apocrypha;
                and those books which had a majority of votes, were voted to be the word of God.
                Had they voted otherwise, all the people, since calling themselves Christians,
                had believed otherwise; for the belief of the one comes from the vote of the
                </p>
                <p>
                other.
                </p>
                <pb n="12"/>
                <p>
                other. Who the people were that did all this, we know nothing of; they call themselves by the general name of the church;
                and this is all we know of the matter.
                </p>
                <p>
                As we have no other external evidence or authority for believing those books to be the word of God, than what
                I have mentioned, which is no evidence or authority at all; I come, in the next place,
                to examine the internal evidence contained in the books themselves.
                </p>
                <p>In the former part of this essay, I have spoken of Revelation. I now proceed further with that subject,
                for the purpose of applying it to the books in question.</p>
                <p>Revelation is a communication of something, which the person to whom that thing is revealed, did not know before.
                For if I have done a thing or seen it done, it needs no revelation to tell me I have done it,
                or seen it, nor to enable me to tell it, or to write it.</p>
                <p>
                Revelation, therefore, cannot be applied to any thing done upon earth of which man is himself the actor or the witness;
                and consequently all the historical and anecdotal part of the Bible, which is almost the whole of it,
                is not within the meaning and compass of the word revelation, and therefore is not the word of God.
                </p>
                <p>
                When Samson ran off with the gate-posts of Gaza, if he ever did so (and whether he did or not
                is nothing to us),
                or when he visited his Delilah, or caught his foxes, or did
                any thing else, what has revelation to do with these things? If they were facts,
                he could tell them himself; or his secretary, if he kept one,
                could write them, if they were worth either telling or writing; and if they were fictions,
                revelation could not make them true; and whether true or not, we are neither the better nor the wiser
                for knowing them.—When we contemplate the immensity of that Being, who directs and governs the incomprehensible WHOLE,
                of which the utmost ken of human sight can discover but a part,
                we ought to feel shame at calling such paltry stories the word of God.

                <p>
                As to the account of the creation, with which the book of Genesis opens,
                it has all the appearance of being a tradition which the Israelites had among them before they came into Egypt:
                and after their departure from that country, they put it at the head of their history,
                without telling, as it is most probable they did not know how they came by it.
                The manner in which the account opens, shews it to be traditionary. It begins abruptly.
                It is nobody that speaks. It is nobody that hears. It is addressed to nobody. It has neither first,
                second, nor third person. It has every criterion of being
                </p>
                <p>
                a tradition.
                </p>
                <pb n="13"/>
                <p>
                a tradition. It has no voucher. Moses does not take it upon himself by introducing it with the formality that he uses on other
                occasions, such as that of saying, "
                <hi rend="italic">
                The Lord spake unto
                Moses, saying.
                </hi>
                "
                </p>
                <p>
                Why it has been called the Mosaic account of the creation,
                I am at a loss to conceive. Moses, I believe, was too good a judge of such subject to put his
                name to that account. He had been educated among the Egyptians, who were people
                as well skilled in science, and particularly in astronomy, as
                any people of their day; and the silence and caution that
                Moses observes, in not authenticating the account, is
                a good negative evidence that he neither told it, nor believed it.—The case is,
                that every nation of people has been world-makers, and the Israelites
                had as much right to set up the trade of world-making as any of the rest;
                and as Moses was not an Israelite, he did not choose to contradict the tradition. The
                account, however, is
                harmless; and this is more than can be said of many other parts of the Bible.

                Whenever we read the obscene
                stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and torturous executions,
                the unrelenting vindictiveness, with which more than half the Bible is filled,
                it would be more consistent that we called it the word of a demon,
                than the word of God. It is a history of wickedness,
                that has served to corrupt and brutalize mankind; and, for my own part,
                I sincerely detest it, as I detest every thing that is cruel.

                <p>
                We scarcely meet with any thing, a few phrases excepted, but what deserves either our abhorrence
                or our contempt, till we come to the miscellaneous parts of the Bible.
                In the anonymous publications, the Psalms and the Book of Job, more particularly in
                the latter, we find a great deal of elevated sentiment reverentially expressed of the power
                and benignity of the Almighty; but they stand on no higher rank than many other compositions
                on similar subjects, as well before that time as since.
                </p>
                <p>The Proverbs, which are said to be Solomon's, though most probably a collection
                (because they discover a knowledge of life, which his situation excluded him from knowing),
                are an instructive table of ethics. They are inferior in keenness to the proverbs of the Spaniards,
                and not more wise and œconomical than those of the American Franklin.</p>
                <p>
                All the remaining parts of the Bible, generally known by the name of the Prophets,
                are the works of the Jewish poets and itinerant preachers, who mixed poetry,
                anecdote and devotion
                </p>
                <p>
                together;

                <p>
                together; and those works still retain the air and stile of poetry,
                though in translation*.

                There is not, throughout the whole book, called the Bible, any word that describes to us what we call a poet,
                nor any word that describes what we call poetry. The case is, that the word
                <hi rend="italic">prophet</hi>
                to which latter times have affixed a new idea, was the Bible word for poet, and the word
                <hi rend="italic">prophesying</hi>
                meant the art of making poetry. It also meant the art of playing poetry to a tune
                upon any instrument of music.
                </p>
                <p>We read prophesying with pipes, tabrets, and horns.
                Of prophesying with harps, with psalteries, with cymbals,
                and with every other instrument of music then in fashion. Were we now to speak of prophesying with a fiddle,
                or with a pipe and tabor, the expression would have no meaning, or would appear ridiculous,
                and to some people contemptuous, because we have changed the meaning of the word.</p>
                <p>
                We are told of Saul being among the
                <hi rend="italic">prophets,</hi>
                and also that he prophesied; but we are not told what
                <hi rend="italic">the prophesied</hi>
                nor what
                <hi rend="italic">he prophesied.</hi>
                The case is, there was nothing to tell:
                </p>
                <p>
                *As there are many readers who do not see that a composition is poetry, unless it be in rhyme,
                it is for their information that I add this note.
                </p>
                <p>
                Poetry consists principally in two things; Imagery and Composition.
                The composition of poetry differs from that of prose in the manner of mixing long and short syllables
                together. Take a long syllable out of a line of poetry, and put a short one in the room of it,
                or put a long syllable where a short one should be, and that line will loose its poetical harmony.
                It will have an effect upon the line like that of misplacing a note in a song.
                </p>
                <p>
                The imagery in those books, called the Prophets, appertains altogether to poetry. It is fictious,
                and often extravagant, and not admissible in any other kind of writing than poetry.
                </p>
                <p>
                To shew that these writings are composed in poetical numbers,
                I will take ten syllables, as they stand in the book, and make a line of the same number of syllables,
                heroic measure, that shall rhyme with the last word. It will then be seen,
                that the composition of those books is poetical measure. The instance I shall first produce is from Isaiah.

                for these prophets were a company of musicians and poets;

                of prophets; a whole company of them! coming down with a psaltery, a tabret,
                a pipe and a harp, and that they prophesied, and that he prophesied with them.
                But it appears afterwards, that Saul prophesied badly; that is, he performed his part badly;
                for it is said, that "<hi rend="italic">evil spirit from God*</hi>"
                came upon Saul, and he prophesied. <!-- TODO: Fix -->

                we have lost the original meaning of the word prophecy, and substituted another meaning in its place,
                this alone would be sufficient; for it is impossible to use and apply the word prophesy in the place it
                is here used and applied, if we give to it the sense which latter times have affixed to it.
                The manner in which it is here used strips it of all religious meaning, and shews that a man might
                then be a prophet, or might prophesy, as he may now be a poet or a musician,
                without any regard to the morality or the immorality of his character. The word was originally a term of science,
                promiscuously applied to poetry and to music, and not restricted to any subject upon which poetry and music might be exercised.

                Deborah and Barak are called prophets, not because they predicted any thing, but because they composed the poem or song that bears their name in celebration
                of an act already done. David is ranked among the prophets, for he was a musician; and was also reputed to be
                (though perhaps very erroneously) the author of the Psalms. But Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, are not called prophets.
                It does not appear from any accounts we have that they could either sing, play music, or make poetry.

                We are told of the greater and lesser prophets. They might as well tell us of the greater and lesser God;
                for there cannot be degrees in prophesying consistently with its modern sense. But there are degrees in poetry,
                and therefore the phrase is reconcileable to the case, when we understand by it the greater and the lesser poets.
                </p>
                <p>It is altogether unnecessary, after this, to offer any observations upon what those men,
                stiled prophets, have written. The axe goes at once to the root,
                by shewing that the original meaning of the word has been mistaken,
                and consequently all the inferences that have been drawn from those books,
                the devotional respect that has been paid to them, and the laboured commentaries that have been written
                upon them under that mistaken meaning, are not worth disputing about.
                In many things, however, the writings of the Jewish poets deserve a better fate than
                that of being bound up, as they now are, with the trash that accompanies them,
                under the abused name of the word of God.</p>
                <p>If we permit ourselves to conceive right ideas of things, we must necessarily affix the right idea,
                not only of unchangeableness, but of the utter impossibility of any change taking place,
                by any means or accident whatever, in that which we would honour with the name of the word of God;
                and therefore the word of God cannot exist in any written or human language.</p>
                <p>
                The continually progressive change to which the meaning of words is subject,
                the want of an universal language which renders translations necessary,
                the errors to which translations are again subject, the mistakes of copyists and printers,
                together with the possibility of wilful alteration, are of themselves evidences,
                that human language, whether in speech or in print, cannot be the vehicle of the word of God.
                The word of God exists in something else.

                Did the book called the Bible, excel, in purity of ideas and expression,
                all the books that are now extant in the world, I would not take it for my rule of faith,
                as being the word of God; because the possibility would

                scarcely any thing but a history of the grossest vices, and a collection of the most paltry
                and contemptible tales, I cannot dishonour my Creator by calling it by his name.

                Had it been the object or the intention of Jesus Christ to establish a new religion,

                All the books called the New Testament were written after his death.
                He was a Jew by birth and by profession; and he was the Son of God in like manner that every other person is;
                for the Creator is the Father of all.

                The first four books, called Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, do not give a history of the life of Jesus Christ,
                but only detached anecdotes of him. It appears from these books, that the whole time of his being a preacher
                was not more than eighteen months; and it was only during this short time,
                that those men became acquainted with him. They make mention of him, at the age of twelve years,
                sitting, they say, among the Jewish doctors, asking and answering them questions.
                As this was several years before their acquaintance with him began,
                it is most probable they had this anecdote from his parents. From this time there is no account
                of him for about sixteen years. Where he lived or how he employed himself during this
                interval, is not known. Most probably he was working at his father's trade, which was that of a carpenter.
                It does not appear that he had any school

                as appears from their not being able to pay for a bed when he was born.

                It is somewhat curious that the three persons, whose names are the most universally recorded,
                were of very obscure parentage. Moses was a foundling, Jesus Christ was born in a stable,
                and Mahomet was a mule-driver. The first and the last of these men, were founders of different systems
                of religion; but Jesus Christ founded no new system. He called men to the practice of moral virtues,
                and the belief of one God. The great trait in his character is philanthropy.

                The manner in which he was apprehended, shews that he was not much known at that time:
                and it shews also, that the meetings he then held with his followers were in secret;
                and that he had given over, or suspended, preaching publicly. Judas could no otherwise betray
                him than by giving information where he was, and pointing him out to the officers that went
                to arrest him; and the reason for employing and paying Judas to do this,
                could arise only from the causes already mentioned, that of his not being much known,
                and living concealed.

                The idea of his concealment, not only agrees very ill
                with his reputed divinity, but associates with it something of pusillanimity;
                and his being betrayed, or in other words, his being apprehended,
                on the information of one of his followers, shews that he did not intend to be apprehended,
                and consequently that he did not intend to be crucified.

                The Christian mythologists tell us, that Christ died for the sins of the world, and that he came on

                it could make no part of the sentence that Christ was to suffer in the room of Adam.
                A fever would have done as well as a cross, if there was any occasion for either.
                </p>
                <p>
                This sentence of death, which they tell us, was thus passed upon Adam,
                must either have meant dying naturally, that is, ceasing
                to live, or, have meant what these mythologists call damnation; and, consequently,
                the act of dying on the part of Jesus Christ, must, according to their system,
                apply as a prevention to one or other of these two

                happening to Adam and to us.

                That it does not prevent our dying is evident, because we all
                die; and if their accounts
                of longevity be true, men die faster since the crucifixion than before;
                and with respect to the second explanation, (included with it the
                <hi rend="italic">natural death</hi>
                of Jesus Christ as a substitute for the

                That manufacturer of quibbles, St. Paul, if he wrote the books that bear his name,
                has helped this quibble on, by making another quibble upon the word

                He makes there to be two Adams; the one who sins in fact, and suffers

                interlarded with quibble, subterfuge, and pun,
                has a tendency to instruct its professors in the practice of these arts.

                How much, or what parts of the books called the New Testament, were written by the persons whose names
                they bear, is what we can know nothing of, neither are we certain in what language they were
                originally written. The matters they now contain may be classed under two heads; anecdote,
                and epistolary correspondence.
                </p>
                <p>
                The four books already mentioned, Matthew, Mark. Luke, and John, are altogether anecdotal.
                They relate events after they have taken place. They tell what Jesus Christ did and said,
                and what others did and said to him; and in several instances they relate the same event differently.
                Revelation is necessairly out of the question with respect to those books;
                not only because of the disagreement of the writers, but because revelation cannot be applied to
                the relating of facts by the persons who saw them done, nor to the relating or recording of
                any discourse or conversation by those who heard it. The book called the Acts of the Apostles,
                an anonymous work, belongs also to the anecdotal part.
                </p>
                <p>
                All the other parts of the New Testament, except the book of Enigmas,
                called the Revelations, are a collection of letters under the name of epistles;
                and the forgery of letters has been such a common practice in the world,
                that the probability is, at least, equal whether they are genuine or forged.
                One thing, however, is much less equivocal, which is,
                that out of the matters contained in those books, together with the assistance of some old stories,
                the church has set up a system of religion very contradictory to the character of the
                person whose name it bears. It has set up a religion of pomp and of revenue,
                in the pretended imitation of a person, whose life was humility and poverty.
                </p>
                <p>
                The invention of a purgatory, and of the releasing of souls therefrom, by prayers,
                bought of the church with money; the selling of pardons, dispensations,
                and indulgencies, are revenue laws, without
                bearing that name or
                <pb n="24" facs="unknown:027458_0023_0FD3D97F0ACFA788"/>
                carrying that appearance. But the case nevertheless is, that those things derive their
                origin from the proxysm of the crucifixion, and the theory deduced therefrom, which was,
                that one person could stand in the place of another, and could perform meritorious services for him.
                The probability, therefore, is, that the whole theory or doctrine of what is called the redemption
                (which is said to have been accomplished by the act of one person in the room of another)
                was originally fabricated on purpose to bring forward and build all those secondary and pecuniary redemptions upon;
                and that the passages in the books upon which the idea or theory of redemption is built,
                have been manufactured and fabricated for that purpose. Why are we to give this church credit,
                when she tells us that those books are genuine in every part,
                any more than we give her credit for every thing else she has told us;
                or for the miracles she says she has performed. That she
                <hi rend="italic">could</hi>
                fabricate writings is certain, because she could write; and the composition of the writings in question,
                is of that kind that any body might do it; and that she
                <hi rend="italic">did</hi>
                fabricate them is not more inconsistent with probability, than that she should tell us,
                as she has done, that she could and did work miracles.
                </p>
                <p>Since then no external evidence can, at this long distance of time,
                be produced to prove whether the church fabricated the doctrine called redemption or not,
                (for such evidence, whether for or against, would be subject to the same suspicion of being fabricated)
                the case can only be referred to the internal evidence which the thing carries of itself;
                and this affords a very strong presumption of its being a fabrication.
                For the internal evidence is, that the theory or doctrine of redemption has for its basis,
                an idea of pecuniary justice, and not that of moral justice.</p>
                <p>
                If I owe a person money and cannot pay him, and he threatens to put me in prison another person can take
                the debt upon himself, and pay it for me. But if I have committed a crime,
                every circumstance of the case is
                changed. Moral justice cannot take the innocent for
                the guilty; even if the innocent would offer itself. To suppose
                justice to do this, is to destroy the principle of its existence,
                which is the thing itself. It is then no longer justice.
                It is indiscriminate revenge.

                <p> <!-- TODO: Start -->
                This single reflection will shew that the doctrine of redemption is founded on a mere pecuniary idea,
                corresponding to that of a debt which another person might pay; and as this pecuniary idea corresponds
                again with the system of second redemptions, obtained through the means of money given to the church
                for pardons, the probability is, that the same persons fabricated both the one and the other of those theories;
                and that, in truth, there is no such thing as redemption; that it is fabulous; and that man stands in the same
                relative condition with his Maker he ever did stand since man existed; and that it is his greatest consolation
                to think so.

                It is by his being taught to contemplate himself as an out-law, as an out-cast, as a beggar,
                as a mumper, as one thrown, as it were, on a dunghill, at an immense distance from his Creator,
                and who must make his approaches by creeping and cringing to intermediate beings,
                that he conceives either a contemptuous disregard for every thing under the name religion,
                or becomes, indifferent, or turns, what he calls devout. In the latter case,
                he consumes his life in grief, or the affectation of it. His prayers are reproaches.
                His humility is ingratitude. He calls himself a worm, and the fertile earth a dunghill;
                and all the blessings of life by the thankless name of vanities. He despises the choicest gift of God to man,
                the GIFT OF REASON; and having endeavoured to force upon himself the belief of a system
                against which reason revolts, he ungratefully calls it
                <hi rend="italic">human reason,</hi>
                as if man could give reason to himself.
                </p>
                <p>
                Yet with all this strange appearance of humility, and this contempt for human reason,
                he ventures into the boldest presumptions. He finds fault with every thing. His selfishness is never satisfied;
                his ingratitude is never at an end. He takes on himself to direct the Almighty what to do, even in the government
                of the universe. He prays dictatorially. When it is sun-shine, he prays for rain,
                <pb n="26" facs="unknown:027458_0025_0FD3D982326C62E0"/>
                and when it is rain, he prays for sun-shine. He follows the same idea in every thing that he prays for;
                for what is the amount of all his prayers, but an attempt to make the Almighty change his mind,
                and act otherwise than he does. It is as if he were to say—thou knowest not so well as I.
                </p>
                <p>But some perhaps will say, are we to have no word of God—No revelation? I answer, yes. There is a word of God:
                there is a revelation.</p>
                <p>
                THE WORD OF GOD IS THE CREATION WE BEHOLD: And it is in
                <hi rend="italic">this word,</hi>
                which no human invention can counterfeit or alter, that God speaketh universally to man.
                </p>
                <p>
                Human language is local and changeable, and is therefore incapable of being used as the means of
                unchangeable and universal information. The idea that God sent Jesus Christ to publish, as they say,
                the glad tidings to all nations, from one end of the earth unto the other, is consistent only with the
                ignorance of those who knew nothing of the extent of the world, and who believed,
                as those world-faviours believed, and continued to believe for several centuries,
                (and that in contradiction to the discoveries of philosophers, and the experience of navigators)
                that the earth was flat like a trencher; and that a man might walk to the end of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                But how was Jesus Christ to make any thing known to all nations? He could speak but one language,
                which was Hebrew: and there are in the world several hundred languages.
                Scarcely any two nations speak the same language, or understand each other;
                and as to translations, every man who knows any thing of languages, knows that it is impossible to
                translate from one language into another, not only without losing a great part of the original,
                but frequently of mistaking the sense: and besides all this, the art of printing was wholly unknown
                at the time Christ lived.
                </p>
                <p>
                It is always necessary that the means that are to accomplish any end, be equal to the accomplishment of that end,
                or the end cannot be accomplished. It is in
                <pb n="27" facs="unknown:027458_0026_0FD3D983B6C2A570"/>
                this that the difference between finite and infinite power and wisdom discovers itself.
                Man frequently fails in accomplishing his end, from a natural inability of power to the purpose;
                and frequently from the want of wisdom to apply power properly. But it is impossible for infinite power
                and wisdom to fail as man faileth. The means it useth are always equal to the end:
                but human language, more especially as there is not an universal language, is incapable of being
                used as an universal means of unchangeable and uniform information; and therefore it is not the
                means that God useth in manifesting himself universally to man.
                </p>
                <p>
                It is only in the CREATION that all our ideas and conceptions of a
                <hi rend="italic">world of God</hi>
                can unite. The creation speaketh an universal language, independently of human speech or human language,
                multiplied and various as they be. It is an ever-existing original, which every man can read.
                It cannot be forged; it cannot be counterfeited; it cannot be lost; it cannot be altered;
                it cannot be suppressed. It does not depend upon the will of man whether it shall be published or not;
                it publishes itself from one end of the earth to the other. It preaches to all nations and to all worlds;
                and this
                <hi rend="italic">word of God</hi>
                reveals to man all that is necessary for man to know of God.
                </p>
                <p>
                Do we want to contemplate his power? We see it in the immensity of the creation. Do we want to contemplate his wisdom?
                We see it in the unchangeable order by which the incomprehensible Whole is governed.
                Do we want to contemplate his munificence? We see it in the abundance with which he fills the earth.
                Do we want to contemplate his mercy? We see it in his not withholding that abundance even from the unthankful.
                In sine, do we want to know what God is? Search not the book called the scripture,
                which any human hand might make, but the scripture called the creation.
                </p>
                <p>
                The only idea that man can affix to the name of God, is that of a
                <hi rend="italic">first cause,</hi>
                the cause of all things. And incomprehensibly difficult as it is for man to conceive what a first cause is,
                he arrives at the belief of it, from the ten-fold greater difficulty of disbelieving it.
                It is difficult beyond description to conceive that space can have no
                <pb n="28" facs="unknown:027458_0027_0FD3D9850C738000"/>
                end; but it is more difficult to conceive an end. It is difficult, beyond the power of man to conceive an
                eternal duration of what we call time; but it is more impossible to conceive a time when there shall be no time.
                In like manner of reasoning, every thing we behold carries in itself the internal evidence that
                it did not make itself. Every man is an evidence to himself, that he did not make himself;
                neither could his father make himself, nor his grandfather, nor any of his race; neither could any tree,
                plant, or animal, make itself: and it is the conviction arising
                from this evidence, that carries us on, as it were, by necessity, to the belief of a first cause
                eternally existing, of a nature totally different to any material existence we know of,
                and by the power of which all things exist; and this first cause man calls God.
                </p>
                <p>
                It is only by the exercise of reason, that man can discover God. Take away that reason,
                and he would be incapable of understanding any thing; and, in this case, it would be just as consistent to read
                even the book called the Bible, to a horse as to a man. How then is it that those people pretend to reject reason?
                </p>
                <p>
                Almost the only parts in the book, called the Bible, that convey to us any idea of God,
                are some chapters in Job, and the 19th psalm. I recollect no other. Those parts are true
                <hi rend="italic">deistical</hi>
                compositions; for they treat of the
                <hi rend="italic">Deity</hi>
                through his works. They take the book of Creation is the word of God; they refer to no other book; and
                all the inferences they make are drawn from that volume.
                </p>
                <p>
                I insert in this place, the 19th Psalm, as paraphrased
                into English verse, by Addison. I recollect not the prose, and where I write this
                I have not the opportunity of seeing it.

                What more does man want to know than that the hand, or power that made these things,
                is divine, is omnipotent. Let him believe this, with the force it is impossible
                to repel if he permits his reason to act, and his rule of moral life will follow of course.

                <p>
                The allusions in Job have all of them the same tendency with this psalm;
                that of deducing or proving a truth, that would be otherwise unknown, from truths already known.
                </p>
                <p>
                I recollect not enough of the passages in Job to insert them correctly: but there is one that occurs to
                me that is applicable to the subject I am speaking upon. "Canst thou by
                <hi rend="italic">searching</hi>
                "find out God? Canst thou find out the Almighty to "perfection!"
                </p>
                <p>I know not how the printers have pointed this passage, for I keep no Bible;
                but it contains two distinct questions that admit of distinct answers.</p>
                <p>
                First, Canst thou by searching find out God? Yes. Because, in the first place, I know I did not make myself,
                and yet I have existence; and by
                <hi rend="italic">searching</hi>
                into the nature of other things, I find that no other thing could make itself;
                and yet millions of other things exist; therefore it is, that I know by positive conclusion resulting from this search,
                that there is a power superior to all those things, and that power is God.
                </p>
                <p>
                Secondly, Canst thou find out the Almighty to
                <hi rend="italic">
                perfection?
                </hi>
                No. Not only because the power and wisdom he has manifested in the structure of the creation that I
                <pb n="30" facs="unknown:027458_0029_0FD3D9880646D3A8"/>
                behold, is to me incomprehensible; but because even this manifestation, great as it is,
                is probably but a small display of that immensity of power and wisdom, by which millions of other worlds,
                to me invisible by their distance, were created, and continue to exist.
                </p>
                <p> <!-- TODO: Start here -->
                It is evident that both these questions were put to the reason of the person to whom they are supposed to have been addressed;
                and it is only by admitting the first question to be answered affirmatively, that the second could follow.
                It would have been unnecessary and, even absurd, to have put a second question, more difficult than the first,
                if the first question had been answered negatively. The two questions have different objects,
                the first refers to the existence of God, the second to his attributes.
                Reason can discover the one, but it falls infinitely short in discovering the whole of the other.
                </p>
                <p>
                I recollect not a single passage in all the writings ascribed to the men called apostles,
                that conveys any idea of what God is. Those writings are chiefly controversial; and the gloominess of the subject
                they dwell upon, that of a man dying in agony on a cross, is better suited to the gloomy genius of a monk
                in a cell, by whom it is not impossible they were written, than to any man breathing the open air
                of the creation. The only passage that occurs to me, that has any reference to the works of God,
                by which only his power and wisdom can be known, is related to have been spoken by Jesus Christ,
                as a remedy against distrustful care. "Behold the lilies of the field,
                they toil not, neither do they spin." This, however, is far inferior to the allusions
                in Job, and in the nineteenth psalm; but it is similar in idea, and the modesty of the imagery is
                correspondent to the modesty of the man.
                </p>
                <p>
                As to the christian system of faith, it appears to me as a species of atheism; a fort of religions denial of God.
                It professes to believe in a man rather than in God. It is a compound made up chiefly of manism with but little
                deism, and is as near to atheism as twilight is to darkness. It introduces between man and his Maker an opaque body,
                which it calls a redeemer; as the moon introduces her opaque self between the earth and the sun,
                and it produces by this means a religious or irreligious eclipse of light. It has put the whole orbit of
                reason into shade.

                The effect of this obscurity has been that of turning every thing upside down,
                and representing it in reverse; and among the revolutions it has thus magically produced,
                it has made a revolution in Theology.
                </p>
                <p>
                That which is now called natural philosophy, embracing the whole circle of science, of which
                astronomy occupies the chief place, is the study of the works of God, and of the power and wisdom of God
                in his works, and is the true theology.
                </p>
                <p>
                As the theology that is now studied in its place, it is the study of human opinions and of human fancies
                <hi rend="italic">
                concerning
                </hi>
                God. It is not the study of God himself in the works that he has made,
                but in the works or writings that man has made; and it is not among the least of the mischiefs that the christian
                system has done to the world, that it has abandoned the original and beautiful system of theology,
                like a beautiful innocent, to distress and reproach, to make room for the hag of superstition.
                </p>
                <p>
                The book of Job, and the 19th psalm, which even the church admits to be more ancient than the chronological
                order in which they stand in the book called the Bible, are theological orations conformable to the
                original system of theology. The internal evidence of those orations proves to a demonstration,
                that the study and contemplation of the words of creation, and of the power and wisdom of God,
                revealed and manifested in those works, made a great part of the religious devotion of the times
                in which they were written; and it was this devotional study and contemplation that led to the discovery
                of the principles upon which, what are now called Sciences, are established;
                and it is to the discovery of these principles that almost all the Arts that contribute to the
                convenience of human life, owe their existence. Every principal art has some science for its parent,
                though the person who mechanically performs the work does not always,
                and but very seldom, perceive the connection.
                </p>
                <p>
                It is a fraud of the christian system to call the sciences
                <hi rend="italic">human inventions;</hi>
                it is only the application of
                <pb n="32" facs="unknown:027458_0031_0FD3D98B0DB7A090"/>
                them that is human. Every science has for its basis a system of principles as fixed and unalterable
                as those by which the universe is regulated and governed. Man cannot make principles;
                he can only discover them:
                </p>
                <p>
                For example—Every person who looks at an almanack sees an account when an eclipse will take place:
                and he sees also that it never fails to take place according to the account there given.
                This shews that man is acquainted with the laws by which the heavenly bodies move.
                But it would be something worse than ignorance, were any church on earth to say,
                that those laws are an human invention.
                </p>
                <p>It would also be ignorance, or something worse, to say, that the scientific principles,
                by the aid of which man is enabled to calculate and foreknow when an eclipse will take place,
                are an human invention. Man cannot invent any thing that is eternal and immutable;
                and the scientific principles he employs for this purpose must be, and are, of necessity,
                as eternal and immutable as the laws by which the heavenly bodies move, or they could not be used as they are,
                to ascertain the time when, and the manner how, an eclipse will take place.</p>

                The scientific principles that man employs to obtain the fore-knowledge of an eclipse,
                or of any thing else relating to the motion of the heavenly bodies, are contained chiefly in that
                part of science called trigonometry, or the properties of a triangle; which, when applied to the study
                of the heavenly bodies, is called astronomy; when applied to direct the course of a ship on the ocean,
                it is called navigation; when applied to the construction of figures drawn by a rule and compass,
                it is called geometry; when applied to the construction of plans of edifices, it is called architecture;
                when applied to the measurement of any portion of the surface of the earth,
                it is called land surveying. In fine, it is the soul of science; it is an eternal truth: it contains the
                <hi rend="italic">mathematical demonstration</hi>
                of which man speaks, and the extent of its uses are unknown.
                </p>
                <p>It may be said, that man can make or draw a triangle, and therefore a triangle is an human invention.</p>
                <p>
                But the triangle, when drawn, is no other than the image of the principle: it is a delineation to the eye,
                <pb n="33" facs="unknown:027458_0032_0FD3D98C8C3EE340"/>
                and from thence to the mind,
                of a principle that would otherwise be imperceptible. The triangle does not make the principle,
                any more than a candle taken into a room that was dark, makes the chairs and tables that before were invisible.
                All the properties of a triangle exist independently of the figure, and existed before any triangle
                was drawn or thought of by man. Man had no more to do in the formation of those properties,
                or principles, than he had to do in making the laws by which the heavenly bodies move:
                and therefore the one must have the same divine origin as the other.
                </p>
                <p>
                In the same manner as it may be said that man can make a triangle, so also it may be said,
                he can make the mechanical instrument called the lever. But the principle, by which the lever acts,
                is a thing distinct from the instrument, and would exist if the instrument did not:
                it attaches itself to the instrument after it is made; the instrument therefore can act no
                otherwise than it does act; neither can all the effort of human invention make it act otherwise.
                That which, in all such cases, man calls the
                <hi rend="italic">effect,</hi>
                is no other than the principle itself rendered perceptible to the senses.
                </p>
                <p>
                Since then man cannot make principles, from whence did he gain a knowledge of them,
                so as to be able to apply them not only to things on earth, but to ascertain the motion of bodies
                so immensely distant from him as all the heavenly bodies are? From whence, I ask,
                <hi rend="italic">could</hi>
                he gain that knowledge, but from the study of the true theology?

                It is the structure of the universe that has taught this knowledge to man. That structure is an ever-existing exhibition
                of every principle upon which every part of methematical science is founded. The offspring of this science is mechanics;
                for mechanics is no other than the principles of science applied practically.
                The man, who proportions the several parts of a mill, uses the same scientific
                principles, as if he had the power of constructing an universe: but as he cannot give to matter that invisible agency, \
                by which all the component parts of the immense machine of the universe have influence upon each other,
                and act in motional unison together, without any
                <pb n="34" facs="unknown:027458_0033_0FD3DAF2097B0080"/>
                apparent contact, and to which man has given the name of attraction, gravitation, and repulsion;
                he supplies the place of that agency by the humble imitation of teeth and
                cogs. All the parts of man's microcosm must visibly touch. But could
                he gain a knowledge of that agency, so as to be able to apply it in practice, we might then say, that another
                <hi rend="italic">canonical book</hi>
                of the word of God had been discovered.
                </p>
                <p>
                If man could after the properties of the lever, so also could he alter the properties of the triangle:
                for a lever, (taking that sort of lever, which is called a steel-yard, for the sake of explanation)
                forms, when in motion, a triangle. The line it descends from, (one point of that line being in the fulcrum)
                the line it descends to, and the chord of the arc, which the end of the lever describes in the air,
                are the three sides of a triangle. The other arm of the lever describes also a triangle;
                and the corresponding sides of those two triangles, calculated scientifically,
                or measured geometrically; and also the fines, tangents, and secants generated from the angles,
                and geometrically measured, have the same proportions to each other, as the different weights have that will balance
                each other on the lever, leaving the weight of the lever out of the case.
                </p>
                <p>
                It may also be said, that man can make a wheel and axis, that he can put wheels of different
                magnitudes together, and produce a mill. Still the case comes back to the same point, which is,
                that he did not make the principle that gives the wheels those powers.
                That principle is as unalterable as in the former cases, or rather it is the same principle under
                a different appearance to the eye.
                </p>
                <p>The power that two wheels, of different magnitudes, have upon each other,
                is in the same proportion as if the semi-diameter of the two wheels were joined together,
                and made into that kind of lever I have described, suspended at the part where the semidiameters join;
                for the two wheels, scientifically considered, are no other than the two circles generated by
                the motion of the compound lever.</p>

                It is from the study of the true theology that all

                our knowledge of science is derived, and it is from that knowledge that all the arts have originated.

                The Almighty lecturer, by displaying the principles of science in the structure of the universe,
                has invited man to study and to imitation. It is as if he had said to the inhabitants of this globe,
                that we call ours, "I have made an earth for man to dwell upon, and I have rendered the starry
                heavens visible, to teach him science and the arts. He can now provide for his own comfort,
                AND LEARN FROM MY MUNIFICENCE TO ALL, TO BE KIND TO EACH OTHER."

                Of what use is it, unless it be to teach man something, that his eye is endowed with the power
                of beholding, to an incomprehensible distance, an immensity of worlds revolving in the ocean of space?
                Or of what use is it that this immensity of worlds is visible to man? What has man to do with the
                Pleiades, with Orion, with Sirius, with the star he calls the north star,
                with the moving orbs he has named Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury,
                if no uses are to follow from their being visible? A less power of vision would have been sufficient
                for man, if the immensity he now possesses were given only to waste itself, as it were,
                on an immense desert of space glittering with shows.

                It is only by contemplating what he calls the starry heavens, as the book and school of science,
                that he discovers any use in their being visible to him, or any advantage refulting from his immensity of vision.
                But when he contemplates the subject in this light, he sees an additional motive for saying, that
                <hi rend="italic">nothing was made in vain;</hi>
                for in vain would be this power of vision if it taught man nothing.

                As the christian system of faith has made a revolution in theology, so also has it made a revolution
                in the state of learning. That which is now called learning was not learning originally.
                Learning does not consist, as the schools now make it to consist, in the knowledge of languages,
                but in the knowledge of things to which language gives names.
                </p>
                <p>
                The Greeks were a learned people; but learning with them did not consist in speaking Greek, any more
                <pb n="36" facs="unknown:027458_0035_0FD3DAF592B6C198"/>
                than in a Roman's speaking Latin, or a Frenchman's speaking French, or an Englishman's speaking English.
                From what we know of the Greeks, it does not appear that they knew or studied any language
                but their own; and this was one cause of their being so learned; it afforded them more time to
                apply themselves to better studies. The schools of the Greeks were schools of science and philosophy,
                and not of languages; and it is in the knowledge of the things that science and philosophy teach,
                that learning consists.

                Almost all the scientific learning that now exists, came to us from the Greeks, or the people who spoke
                the Greek language. It therefore became necessary for the people of other nations, who spoke a different
                language, that some among them should learn the Greek language, in order that the learning the Greeks had,
                might be made known in those nations, by translating the Greek books of science and philosophy into the
                mother tongue of each nation.
                </p>
                <p>
                The study therefore of the Greek language, (and in the same manner for the Latin,) was no other than the
                drudgery business of a linguist; and the language thus obtained, was no other than the means, as it were the tools,
                employed to obtain the learning the Greeks had. It made no part of the learning itself;
                and was so distinct from it, as to make it exceeding probable, that the persons who had studied Greek sufficiently
                to translate those works, such, for instance, as Euclid's Elements, did not understand any of the learning the
                works contained.

                <p>
                As there is now nothing new to be learned from the dead languages, all the useful books being already
                translated, the languages are become useless, and the time expended in teaching and in learning them
                is wasted. So far as the study of languages may contribute to the progress and communication
                of knowledge, (for it has nothing to do with the <hi rend="italic">creation</hi> of knowledge,)
                it is only in the living languages that new knowledge is to be found: and certain it is, that, in general,
                a youth will learn more of a living language in one year, than of a dead language in seven; and it
                is but seldom that the teacher know much of it himself. The difficulty of learning the dead language
                does not arise from any superior abstruseness in the languages themselves, but in their
                <hi rend="italic">being dead,</hi> and the pronounciation entirely lost. It would be the same thing with
                any other language when it becomes dead. The best Greek linguist, that now exists,
                does not understand Greek so well as a Grecian plowman did,
                or a Grecian milkmaid; and the same for the Latin, compared with a plowman or milkmaid of the Romans;
                and with respect to pronounciation, and idiom, not so well as the cows that she milked. It would therefore
                be advantageous to the state of learning to abolish the study of the dead languages, and to make learning conflict,
                as it originally did, in scientific knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                But the apology that is now made for continuing to teach the dead languages, could not
                be the cause at first of cutting down learning to the narrow and humble sphere of
                linguistry; the cause, therefore, must be saught for elsewhere. In all researches of this kind,
                the best evidence that can be produced, is the internal evidence the thing carries with itself, and
                the evidence of circumstances that unites with it; both of which, in this case, are not difficult to
                be discovered.

                Putting then aside, as matter of distinct consideration, the outrage offered to the moral justice of God,
                by supposing him to make the innocent suffer for the guilty, and also the loose morality and low contrivance
                of supposing him to change himself into the shape of a man, in order to make an excuse to himself for
                not executing his supposed sentence upon Adam; putting, I say, those things aside,
                as matter of distinct consideration, it is certain that what is called the christian system of faith,
                including in it the whimsical account of the creation; the strange story of Eve,
                the snake, and the apple; the amphibious idea of a man-god; the corporeal idea of the death of a god;
                the mythological idea of a family of gods; and the christian system of arithmetic,
                that three are one, and one is three, are all irreconcileable, not only to the divine gift of reason
                that God has given to man, but to the knowledge that man gains of the power and wisdom of God,
                by the aid of the sciences, and by studying the structure of the universe that God has made.
                </p>
                <p>
                The setter-up, therefore, and the advocates of the christian system of faith,
                could not but foresee that the continually progressive knowledge that man would gain by the aid
                of science, of the power and wisdom of God, manifested in the structure of the universe,
                and in all the works of creation, would militate against, and call into question,
                the truth of their system of faith; and therefore it bacame necessary to their purpose to cut
                learning down to a size less dangerous to their project, and this they effected by restricting
                the idea of learning to the dead study of dead languages.

                They not only rejected the study of science out of the christian schools, but they persecuted it;
                and it is only within about the last two centuries that the study has been revived.
                So late as 1610, Galileo, a Florentine, discovered and introduced the use of telescopes,
                and by applying them to observe the motions and appearances of the heavenly bodies,
                afforded additional means for ascertaining the true structure of the universe.
                Instead of being esteemed for these discoveries, he was sentenced to renounce them, or the opinions
                resulting from them, as a damnable heresy. And prior to that time Vigiilius
                was condemned to be burned for asserting the antipodes; or, in other words, that the earth was a globe,
                and habitable in every part where there was land: yet the truth of this is now too well
                know even to be told.

                If the belief of errors not morally bad did no mischief, it would make no part of the moral duty of man
                to oppose and remove them. There was no moral ill in believing the earth flat like a trencher,
                any more than there was moral virtue in believing it was round like a globe; neither was there any
                moral ill in believing that the Creator made no other world than this, any more than there was moral
                virtue in believing that he made millions, and that the infinity of space is filled with worlds.
                But when a system of religion is made to grow out of a supposed system of creation that is not true,
                and to unite itself there with in a manner almost inseparable therefrom, the case assumes an entirely
                different ground. It is then that errors, not morally bad, become fraught with the same mischiefs
                as if they were. It is then that the truth, though otherwise indifferent in itself,
                becomes an essential, by becoming the criterion, that either confirms by corresponding evidence
                or denies by contradictory evidence, the reality of the religion itself. In this view of the case,
                it is the moral duty of man to obtain every possible evidence that the structure of the heavens,
                or any other part of creation affords, with respect to systems of religion. But this,
                the supporters or partizans of the christian system, as if dreading the result,

                Had Newton or Descartes lived three or four hundred years ago, and pursued their studies
                as they did, it is most probable they would not have lived to finish them; and had Franklin
                drawn lightning from the clouds at the same time, it would have been at the hazard of expiring

                Later times have laid all the blame upon the Goths and Vandals; but, however unwilling the partizans of the christian
                system may be to believe or to acknowledge it, it is nevertheless true that the age of ignorance
                commenced with the christian system. There was more knowledge in the world before that period
                than for many centuries afterwards; and as to religions knowledge, the christian system,
                as already said, was only another species of mythology; and the mythology, to which it succeeded,
                was a corruption of an ancient system of theism.*

                with the stock that before existed that chasm would have been filled up with characters rising

                * It is impossible for us now to know at what time the heathen mythology began;
                but it is certain, from the internal evidence that it carries,
                that it did not begin in the same state or condition in which it ended. All the gods
                of that mythology, except Saturn, were of modern invention. The supposed reign of Saturn
                was prior to that which is called the heathen mythology, and was so far a
                species of theism, that it admitted to the belief of only one God. Saturn is supposed to have
                abdicated the government in favour of his three sons and one daughter, Jupiter, Pluto, Neptune, and Juno:
                after this, thousands of other gods and demi-gods were imaginarily created, and
                the calendar of gods increased as fast as the calendar of saints, and the calendar
                of courts have increased since.

                All the corruptions that have taken place in theology, and in religion,
                have been produced by admitting of what men calls
                <hi rend="italic">revealed religion.</hi>
                The mythologists pretended to more revealed religion than the christians do. They
                had their oracles and their priests, who were supposed to receive and deliver
                the word of God verbally on almost all occassions.

                Since then all corruptions drawn from Moloch to modern predestinarianism, and
                the human sacrifices of the heathens to the christian sacrifice of the Creator,
                have been produced by admitting of what is called
                <hi rend="italic">revealed religion,</hi>  the most effectual means to prevent all
                such evils and impositions, is not to admit of any other revelation than
                that which is manifested in the book of creation, and to contemplate the creation, as the
                only true and real word of God that ever did or ever will exist; and
                that every thing else, called the word of God, is fable and imposition.

                But the christian system laid all waste; and if we take our stand about the beginning of
                the sixteenth century, we look back through that long chasm,
                to the times of the ancients, as over a vast sandy desert, is which not a shrub
                appears to intercept the vision to the fertile hills beyond.

                It is an inconsistency, scarcely possible to be credited, that any thing should exist,
                under the name of a

                religion,

                to study and contemplate the structure of the universe that God had made.
                But the fact is too well established to be denied. The event that served more than any other to
                break the first link in this long chain of despotic ignorance, is that known by the name of the
                reformation by Luther. From
                <pb n="39" facs="unknown:027458_0038_0FD3DAFB918951A0"/>
                that time, though it does not appear to have made any part of the intention of Luther,
                or of those who are called reformers, the sciences began to revive, and liberality,
                their natural associate, began to appear. This was the only public good the reformation did;
                for with respect to religious good, it might as well not have taken place.
                The mythology still continued the same; and a multiplicity of national popes grew out of the
                downfal of the pope of christendom.

                Having thus shewn, from the internal evidence of things, the cause that produced a change
                in the state of learning, and the motive for substituting the study of the dead languages
                in the place of the sciences, I proceed, in addition to the several observations already made
                in the former part of this work, to compare, or rather to confront, the evidence that
                the structure of the universe affords, with the christian system of religion.
                But as I cannot begin this part better than by referring to the ideas that recurred to me at an
                early part of life, and which I doubt not have occurred in some degree to almost every other
                person at one time or other. I shall state what those ideas were, and add there to such other
                matters as shall arise out of the subject, giving to the whole, by way of preface,
                a short introduction.

                My father, being of the quaker profession, it was my good fortune to have an exceedingly good moral
                education, and a tolearble stock of useful learning. Though I went to the grammer school,
                I did not learn Latin, not only because I had no inclination to learn languages,
                but because of the objection the Quakers have against the books in which the language is taught.
                But this did not prevent me from being acquainted with the subjects of all
                the Latin books used in the school.
                </p>
                <p>
                *The same school, Thetford in Norfolk, that the present counsellor Mingay went to,
                and under the same master.
                </p>
                <p>
                The natural bent of my mind was to science. I had some turn, and I believe some talent, for poetry;
                but this
                <pb n="40" facs="unknown:027458_0039_0FD3DAFB96AB3900"/>
                I rather repressed than encouraged, as leading too much into the field of imagination.
                As soon as I was able I purchased a pair of globes, and attended the philosophical lectures of
                Martin and Ferguson, and became afterwards acquainted with Dr. Bevis, of the society,
                called the Royal Society, then living in the Temple, and as excellent astronomer.

                I had no disposition for what was called politics. It presented to my mind no other idea
                than is contained in the word Jockeyship. When, therefore, I turned my thoughts toward,
                matters of government, I had to form a system for myself that accorded with the moral and philosophic
                principles in which I had been educated. I sew, or at least I thought I saw,
                a vast scene opening itself to the world in the affairs of America; and it appeared to me,
                that unless the Americans changed the plan they were then pursuing, with respect to the government
                of England, and declared themselves independent, they would not only involve themselves in a
                multiplicity of new difficulties, but shut out the prospect that was then offering itself
                to mankind, through their means. It was from these motives that I published the work known by the
                name of <hi rend="italic">Common Sense,</hi> which is the first work I ever did publish:
                and so far as I can judge of myself, I believe I never should have been known in the world as an
                author, on any subject whatever, had it not been for the affairs of America. I wrote
                <hi rend="italic">Common Sense</hi>
                the latter end of the year 1775, and published it the first of January, 1776.
                Independence was declared the fourth of July following.

                Any person who was made observations on the state and progress of the human mind,
                by observing his own, cannot but have observed, that there are two distinct clasles of what
                we call Thoughts: those that we produce in ourselves by reflection and the act of thinking,
                and those that bolt into the mind of their own accord. I have always made it a rule to treat
                those voluntary visitors with civility, taking care to examine, as well as I was able,
                if they were worth entertaining; and it is from them I have acquired almost all the knowledge
                that I have. As to the learning that any person gains from school education, it
                <pb n="41" facs="unknown:027458_0040_0FD3DAFCD37F5540"/>
                serves only, like a small capital, to put him in the way of beginning learning for himself
                afterwards. Every person of learning is finally his own teacher; the reason of which is that
                principles, being of a distinct quality to circumstances, cannot be impressed upon the memory.
                Their place of mental residence is the understanding, and they are never so lasting as when they
                begin by conception. Thus much for the introductory part.
                </p>
                <p>
                From the time I was capable of conceiving an idea, and acting upon it by reflection,
                I either doubted the truth of the christian system, or thought it to be a strange affair;
                I scarcely know which it was; but I we I remember, when about seven or eight years of age,
                hearing a sermon read by a relation of mine, who was a great devotee
                of the church, upon the subject of what is called
                <hi rend="italic">
                redemption by the death of the Son of God.
                </hi>
                After the sermon was ended I went into the garden, and as I was going down the garden step
                (for I perfectly recollect the spot) I revolted at the recollection of what I had heard,
                and thought to myself that it was making God Almighty act like a passionate man that
                killed his son, when he could not revenge himself any other way; and as I was sure a man would be
                hanged that did such a thing, I could not see for what purpose they preach such
                sermons. This was not one of those kind of thoughts that had any thing in it of childish levity;
                it was to me a serious reflection, arising from the idea I had, that God was too good to do such
                an action, and also too Almighty to be under any necessity of doing it.
                I believe in the same manner to this moment; and I moreover believe, that any system of religion,
                that has any thing in it that shocks the mind of a child, cannot be a true system.
                </p>
                <p>
                It seems as if parents of the christian profession were ashamed to tell their children any
                thing about the principles of their religion. They sometimes instruct them in morals,
                and talk to them of the goodness of what they call Providence: for the christian mythology
                has five dieties: there is God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost, the God Providence,
                and the Goddess Nature.
                <pb n="42" facs="unknown:027458_0041_0FD3DAFF74063108"/>
                But the christian story of God the Father putting his son to death, or employing people to do it
                (for that is the plain language of the story), cannot be told by a parent to a child:
                and to tell him that it was done to make mankind happier and better, is making the story still worse,
                as if mankind could be improved by the example of murder: and to tell him that all this is a mystery,
                is only making an excuse for the incredibility of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                How different is this to the pure and simple profession of Deism! The true deist has but one Deity:
                and his religion consists in contemplating the power, wisdom, and benignity of the Deity
                in his works, and in endeavouring to imitate him in every thing moral, scientifical, and mechanical.
                </p>
                <p>
                The religion that approaches the nearest of all others to true deism, in the moral and
                benign part thereof, is that professed by the Quakers; but they have contracted themselves too much,
                by leaving the works of God out of their system. Though I reverence their philanthropy,
                I cannot help smiling at the conceit, that if the taste of a Quaker could have been consulted
                at the creation, what a silent and drab-coloured creation it would have been
                Not a flower would have blossomed its gaieties, nor a bird been permitted to sing.
                </p>
                <p>
                Quitting these reflections, I proceed to other matters. After I had made myself master of the
                use of the globes, and of the Orrery*, and conceived an idea of the infinity of space,
                and of the eternal divisibility of matter, and obtained, at least, a general knowledge of what
                is called natural philosophy, I began to compare, or, as I have before said, to confront the
                eternal evidence those things afford, with the christian system of faith.
                </p>
                <p>
                Though it is not a direct article of the christian system, that this world that we inhabit
                is the whole of the habitable creation, yet it is so worked up therewith, from what is
                called the Mosaic account of the creation, the story of Eve and the apple,
                and the counterpart of that story,
                <pb n="43" facs="unknown:027458_0042_0FD3DB00B5CDF0E8"/>
                the death of the Son of God, that to believe otherwise; that is, to believe that God
                created a plurality of worlds, at least as numerous as what we call stars,
                renders the christian system of faith at once little and ridiculous; and scatters it in the mind
                like feathers in the air. The two beliefs cannot be held together in the same mind;
                and he who thinks that he believes both, has thought but little of either.
                </p>
                <p>
                Though the belief of a plurality of worlds was familiar to the ancients,
                it is only wihtin the last three centuries that the extent and dimensions of this globe,
                that we inhabit have been ascertained. Several vessels, following the tract of the ocean,
                have failed entirely round the world, as a man may march in a circle, and come round by the

                it is for their information I add this note, as the name gives no idea of the uses of
                the thing. The Orrery has its name from the person who invented it. It is a machinery
                of clock-work representing the universe in miniature; and in which the revolution
                of the earth round itself and round the sun, the revolution of the moon round the earth, the
                revolution of the planets round the sun, and their relative distances from the sun,
                as the center of the whole system, their relative distances from each other, and their
                different magnitudes, are represented as they really eist in what we call the heavens.

                spot he set out from; The circular dimensions of our world in
                the widest part, as a man would measure the widest round of an apple or a ball,
                is only twenty-five thousand and twenty English miles, reckoning sixty-nine miles and an half toan
                equatorial degree, and may be failed round in the space of about three years*.

                <p>
                A world of this extent may, at first thought, appear to us to be great; but if we compare it
                with the immensity of space in which it is suspended, like a bubble or a balloon in the air,
                it is infinitely less in proportion than the smallest grain of sand is to the size of the world,
                or the finest particle of dew to the whole ocean, and is therefore but small;
                and as will be hereafter shewn, is only of a system of worlds,
                of which the universal creation is composed.
                </p>
                <p>
                It is not difficult to gain some faint idea of the immensity of space in which this
                and all the other worlds are suspended, if we follow a progression of ideas.
                When we think of the size or dimensions of a room, our ideas limit themselves to the walls,
                and there they stop. But when our eye, or our imagination, darts into space; that is,
                when it looks upward into what we call the open air, we cannot conceive any walls or boundaries
                it can have; and if for the sake of resting our ideas, we suppose a boundary, the question
                immediately renews itself, and asks, what
                <pb n="44" facs="unknown:027458_0043_0FD3DB03A54AD448"/>
                is beyond that boundary? and in the same manner, what is beyond the next boundary?
                and so on, till the fatiguing imagination returns and says,
                <hi rend="italic">There is no end.</hi>
                Certainly, then, the Creator was not pent for room when he made this world no larger than it is;
                and we have to seek the reason in something else.
                </p>
                <p>
                If we take a survey of our own world, or rather of this of which the Creator has given us
                the use, as our portion in the immense system of creation, we find every part of it, the earth,
                the waters, and the air that surround it, filled, and, as it were, crowded with life,
                down from the largest animals that we know of, to the smallest insects the naked eye can behold;
                and from thence to others still smaller, and totally invisible without the assistance
                of the microscope. Every tree, every plant, every leaf, serves not only as an habitation,
                but as a world to some numerous race, till animal existence become so exceedingly refined,
                that the effluvia of a blade of grass would be food for thousands.

                <p>
                Since then no part of our earth is left unoccupied, why is to be supposed, that the immensity of space is a naked
                void, lying in eternal waste? There is room for millions of worlds as large or larger than ours,
                and each of them millions of miles apart from each other.

                <p>Having now arrived at this point, if we carry our ideas only one thought further, we shall see, perhaps,
                the true reason at least a very good reason for our happiness, why the Creator,
                instead of making one immense world, extending over an immense quantity of space,
                has preferred dividing that quantity of matter into several distinct and sparate worlds,
                which we call planets, of which our earth is one. But before I explain my ideas upon this subject,
                it is necessary (not for the sake of those that already know, but for those who do not)
                to shew what the system of the universe is.</p>

                That part of the universe, that is called the solar system (meaning the system of worlds to which our earth belongs,
                and of which Sol, or in English language the Sun, is the center) consists, besides the Sun, of fix distinct orbs,
                or planets, or worlds, besides the secondary bodies, called satellites, or moons, of which our earth has one
                that attends her in her annual revolution round the Sun, in like manner as the other satellites,
                or moons attend the planets, or worlds, to which they severally belong,
                as may be seen by the assistance of the telescope.
                </p>
                <p>
                The Sun is the center, round which those six worlds or planets, revolve at different distances therefrom,
                and in circles concentric to each other. Each world keeps constantly in nearly the same tract round the Sun,
                and continues at the same time, turning round itself, in nearly an upright position, as a top turns round itself
                when it is spinning on the ground, and leans a little side ways.
                </p>
                <p>It is this leaning of the earth (23½ degrees) that occasions summer and winter, and the different length of
                days and nights. If the earth turned round itself in a position perpendicular to the plane or level of the circle
                it moves in round the Sun, as a top turns round, when it stands erect on the ground, the days and nights would
                be always of the same length, twelve hours day, and twelve hours night, and the season would be uniformly the same
                throughout the year.</p>
                <p>Every time that a planet (our earth for example) turns round itself, it makes what we call day and night;
                and every time it goes entirely round the Sun, it makes what we call a year;
                </p>

                consequently our world turns three hundred and sixty-five times round itself, in going once round the Sun*.</p>
                <p>
                The names that the ancients gave to those six worlds, and which are still called by the same names,
                are Mercury, Venus, this world that we call ours, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. They appear larger to the eye than
                the stars, being many million miles nearer to our earth than any of the stars are. The planet Venus is that which
                is called the evening star, and sometimes the morning star, as she happens to set after, or rise before,
                the sun, which, in either case, is never more than three hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                The Sun, as before said, being the center, the planet, or world, nearest the Sun, is Mercury;
                his distance from the sun is thirty-four million miles, and he moves
                round in a circle always at that distance from the Sun, as a top may be supposed to spin round in the tract
                in which a horse goes in a mill. The second world is Venus; she is fifty-seven million miles distant from the Sun,
                and consequently moves round in a circle much greater than that of Mercury. The third world is this that we
                inhabit, and which is eighty-eight million miles distant from the Sun, and consequently moves round in a circle
                greater than that of Venus. The fourth world is Mars; he is distant from the Sun one hundred and thirty-four
                million miles, and consequently moves round in a circle greater than that of our earth. The fifth is Jupiter;
                he is distant from the Sun five hundred and fifty-seven million miles, and consequently moves round to a circle
                greater than that of Mars. The sixth world is Saturn; he is distant from the Sun seven hundred and
                sixty-three million miles, and consequently moves round in a circle that surrounds the circles or orbits of
                all the other worlds or planets.

                The space, therefore, in the air, or in the immensity of space, that our solar system takes up for the several
                worlds to perform their revolutions in round the Sun, is of the extent, in a strait line of the whole diameter
                of the orbit or circle, in which Saturn moves round the sun, which being double his distance from the Sun,
                is fifteen hundred and twenty-six million miles; and its circular extent is nearly five thousand million;
                and its globical content is almost three thousand five hundred millions times three thousand five hundred million square miles+.

                <p>* Those who supposed that the Sun went round the earth every twentyfour hours, made the same mistake in idea,
                that a cook would do in fact, that should make the fire go round the meat, instead of the meat turning round itself
                towards the fire.</p>
                <p>
                + If it should be asked, how can man know these things? I havve one plain answer to give, which is,
                that man knows how to calculate an eclipse, and

                <p>
                But this, immense as it is, is only one system of worlds. Beyond this, at a vast distance into space,
                far beyond all power of calculation, are the stars called the fixed stars. They are called fixed,
                because they have no revolutionary motion, as the six worlds or planets have that I have been describing.
                Those fixed stars continue always at the same distance from each other, and always in the same place,
                as the sun does in the center of our system. The probability, therefore, is, that each of those fixed stars
                is also a Sun, round which another system of worlds or planets, though too remote for us to discover,
                performs its revolutions, as our system of worlds does round our central Sun.
                </p>
                <p>
                By this easy progression of ideas, the immensity of space will appear to us to be filled with systems of worlds;
                and that no part of space lies waste, any more than any part of our globe of earth and water is left unoccupied.
                </p>
                <p>
                Having thus endeavoured to convey, in a familiar and easy manner, some idea of the structure of the universe,
                I return to explain what I before alluded to, namely, the great benefits arising to man in consequence
                of the Creator having made a <hi rend="italic">plurality</hi>
                of worlds, such as our system is, consisting of a central Sun and six worlds, besides satellites,
                in preference to that of creating one world only of a vast extent.
                </p>
                <p>
                It is an idea I have never lost sight of, that all our knowledge of science is derived from the revolutions
                (exhibited to our eye, and from thence to our understanding) which those several planets, or worlds,
                of which our system is composed, make in their circuit round the Sun.
                </p>
                <p>
                Had then the quantity of matter which these six worlds contain been blended into one solitary globe,
                the consequence to us would have been, that either no revolutionary motion would have existed,
                or not a sufficiency of it, to give us the ideas and the knowledge of science we now have;
                and it is from the sciences that all the mechanical arts that contribute so much to our earthly felicity
                and comfort are derived.
                </p>

                <p>
                also how to calculate, to a minute of time, when the planet Venus, in making her revolutions round the Sun,
                will come in a strait line between our earth and the Sun, and will appear to us about the size of a large pea, passing
                across the face of the Sun. This happens but twice in about an hundred years, at the distance of about eight years from
                each other, and has happened twice in our time, both of which were foreknown by calculation. It can also be known when
                they will happen again for a thousand years to come, or to any other portion of time. As, therefore, man could not be able to 
                do those things, if he did not understand the solar system, and the manner in which the revolutions of the several planets
                or worlds are preformed, the fact of calculating an eclipse or transit of Venus, is a proof in point that the knowledge exists;
                and as to a few thousand, or even a few million miles more or less, it makes scarcely any sensible difference in such
                immense distances.

                As, therefore, the Creator made nothing in vain, so also must it be believed that he organized the structure
                of the universe in the most advantageous manner for the benefit of man; and as we see, and from experience
                feel, the benefits we derive from the structure of the universe, formed as it is,
                which benefits we should not have had the opportunity of enjoying, if the structure,
                so far as relates to our system, had been a solitary globe, we can discover, at least, one reason why a
                <hi rend="italic">plurality</hi>
                of worlds has been
                made, and that reason calls forth the devotional gratitude of man, as well as his admiration.
                </p>
                <p>
                But it is not to us, the inhabitants of this globe, only, that the benefits arising from a plurality of
                worlds are limited. The inhabitants of each of the worlds, of which our system is composed,
                enjoy the same opportunities of knowledge as we do. They behold the revolutionary motions of our earth,
                as we behold theirs. All the planets revolve in sight of each other; and, therefore,
                the same universal school of science presents itself to all.
                </p>
                <p>Neither does the knowledge stop here. The system of worlds next to us, exhibits,
                in its revolution, the same principles and school of science to the inhabitants of their system,
                as our system does to us; and in like manner throughout the immensity of space.</p>
                <p>
                Our ideas, not only of the Almightiness of the Creator, but of his wisdom and of his beneficence,
                become enlarged in proportion as we contemplate the extent and the structure of the universe.
                The solitary idea of a solitary world rolling, or at rest, in the immense ocean of space,
                gives place to the cheerful idea of a society of worlds, so happily contrived, as to administer,
                even by their motion, instruction to man. We see our own earth filled with abundance; but we forget to consider
                how much of that abundance is owing to the scientific knowledge the vast machinery of the universe has unfolded.
                </p>
                <p>
                But, in the midst of those reflections, what are we to think of the christian system of faith,
                that forms itself upon the idea of only one world, and that of no greater extent, as is before shewn,
                than twenty-five thousand miles? An extent, which a man walking at the rate of three miles an hour,
                for twelve hours in a day, could he keep on in a circular direction, would walk entirely round in less than
                two years. Alas! what is this to the mighty ocean of space, and the Almighty power of the Creator!
                </p>
                <p>
                From whence then could arise the solitary and strange conceit that the Almighty,
                who had millions of worlds equally dependent on his protection, should quit the care of all the rest, and
                <pb n="43"/>
                come to die in our world,
                because, they say, one man and one woman had eaten an apple? And, on the other hand,
                are we to suppose that every world, in the boundless creation, had an Eve, and apple, a serpent, and a redeemer?
                In this case, the person, who is irrevently called the Son of God, and sometimes God himself,
                would have nothing else to do than to travel from world to world, in an endless succession of death,
                with scarcely a momentary interval of life.
                </p>
                <p>
                It has been by rejecting the evidence, that the word, or works of God in the creation,
                affords to our senses, and the action of our reason upon that evidence, that so many wild and whimsical systems
                of faith, and of religion, have been fabricated and set up. There may be many systems of religion,
                that so far from being morally bad, are in many respects morally good: but there can be but ONE that is true;
                and that one necessarily must, as it ever will, be in all things consistent with the ever-existing word of God
                that we behold in his works. But such is the strange construction of the christian system of faith,
                that every evidence the heavens afford to man, either directly contradicts it, or renders it absurd.
                </p>
                <p>
                It is possible to believe, and I always feel pleasure in encouraging myself to believe it,
                that there have been men in the world who persuaded themselves that, what is called
                <hi rend="italic">a pious fraud,</hi>
                might, at least under particular circumstances, be productive of some good.
                But the fraud being once established, could not afterwards be explained; for it is with a pious fraud,
                as with a bad action, it begess a calamitous necessity of going on.
                </p>
                <p>
                The persons who first preached the christian system of faith, and in some measure combined with it the morality
                preached by Jesus Christ, might persuade themselves that it was better than the heathen mythology that then
                prevailed. From the first preachers, the fraud went on to the second, and to the third, till the idea of
                its being a pious fraud became lost in the belief of its being true; and that belief became again encouraged
                by the interest of those who made a livelihood by preaching it.
                </p>
                <p>
                But though such a belief might, by such means, be rendered almost general among the laity, it is next to
                impossible to account for the continual persecution carried on by the church, for several hundred years,
                against the sciences and against the professors of science, if the church had not some record or some traditions,
                that it was originally no other than a pious fraud, or did not foresee, that it could not be maintained
                against the evidence that the structure of the universe afforded.
                </p>
                <p>
                Having thus shewn the irreconcileable inconsistencies between

                <p>
                the real word of God existing in the universe, and that which is called
                <hi rend="italic">the word of God,</hi>
                as shewn to us in a printed book, that any man might make, I proceed to speak of the three principal
                means that have been employed in all ages, and perhaps in all countries, to impose upon mankind.
                </p>
                <p>
                Those three means are, Mystery, Miracle, and Prophecy. The two first are incompatible with true religion,
                and the third ought always to be suspected.
                </p>
                <p>
                With respect to mystery, every thing we behold is, in one sense a mystery to us.
                Our own existence is a mystery: the whole vegetable world is a mystery. We cannot account how it is
                that an acorn, when put into the ground, is made to develope itself, and become an oak.
                We know now how it is that the seed we sow unfolds and multiplies itself,
                and returns to us such an abundant interest for so small a capital.
                </p>
                <p>
                The fact, however, as distinct from the operating cause, is not a mystery, because we see it;
                and we know also the means we are to use, which is no other than putting the seed into the ground.
                We know therefore as much as is necessary for us to know; and that part of the operation that we
                do not know, and which if we did we could not perform, the Creator takes upon himself and performs
                it for us. We are therefore better off than if we had been let into the secret,
                and left to do it for ourselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                But though every created thing is in this sense a mystery, the word mystery cannot be applied to
                <hi rend="italic">moral truth,</hi>
                any more than obscurity can be applied to light. The God in whom we believe is a God of moral truth,
                and not a God of mystery or obscurity. Mystery is the antagonist of truth. It is a fog of human
                invention, that obscures truth, and represents it in distortion. Truth never envelopes
                <hi rend="italic">itself</hi>
                in mystery; and the mystery in which it is at any time enveloped, is the work of its antagonist,
                and never of itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                Religion, therefore, being the belief of a God, and the practice of moral truth,
                cannot have connection with mystery. The belief of a God, so far from having any thing of mystery in it,
                is of all beliefs the most easy, because it arises to us, as is before observed, out of necessity.
                And the practice of moral truth, or in other words, a practical imitation of the moral goodness of God,
                is no other than our acting towards each other, as he acts benignly towards all. We cannot
                <hi rend="italic">serve</hi>
                God in the manner we serve those who cannot do without such service; and, therefore
                the only idea we can have of serving God, is that of contributing to the happiness of the living
                creation that God has made. This cannot be done by retiring ourselves
                </p>
                <pb n="45"/>
                <p>
                from the society of the world, and spending a recluse life in selfish devotion.
                </p>
                <p>
                The very nature and design of religion, if I may so express it, prove even to demonstration,
                that it must be free from every thing of mystery, and unincumbered with every thing
                that is mysterious. Religion, considered as a duty, is incumbent upon every living soul alike,
                and therefore must be on a level to the understanding and comprehension of all.
                Man does not learn religion as he learns the secrets and mysteries of a trade.
                He learns the theory of religion by reflection. It arises out of the action of his own mind
                upon the things which he sees, or upon what he may happen to hear or to read, and the practice
                joins itself therto.
                </p>
                <p>
                When men, whether from policy or pious fraud, set up systems of religion incompatible with the word or works of God 
                in the creation, and not only above but repugnant to human comprehension, they
                were under the necessity of inventing or adopting a word that should serve as a bar to all questions,
                inquiries, and speculations. The word
                <hi rend="italic">mystery</hi>
                answered this purpose; and thus it has happened, that religion, which in itself is without mystery,
                has been corrupted into a fog of mysteries.
                </p>
                <p>
                As
                <hi rend="italic">mystery</hi>
                answered all general purposes,
                <hi rend="italic">miracle</hi>
                followed as an occasional auxiliary. The former served to bewilder the mind, the latter to puzzle the sense.
                The one was the lingo, the other the legerdemain.
                </p>
                <p>But before going further into this subject, it will be proper to inquire what is to be understood
                by a miracle.</p>
                <p>
                In the same sense that every thing may be said to be a mystery, so also may it be said,
                that every thing is a miracle, and that no one thing is a greater miracle than another.
                The elephant, though larger, is not a greater miracle than a mite; nor a mountain a greater miracle than an
                atom. To an Almighty power, it is no more difficult to make the one than the other;
                and no more difficult to make a million of worlds than to make one. Every thing therefore is a miracle
                in one sense; whilst, in the other sense, there is no such thing as a miracle.
                It is a miracle when compared to our power, and to our comprehension. It is not a miracle,
                compared to the power that performs it. But as nothing in this description conveys the idea that is
                affixed to the word miracle, it is necessary to carry the inquiry further.
                </p>
                <p>
                Mankind have conceived to themselves certain laws, by which, what they call nature, is supposed to act;
                and that a miracle is something contrary to the operation and effect of those
                </p>
                <pb/>
                <p>
                laws. But unless we know the whole extent of those laws, and of what are commonly called the powers
                of nature, we are not able to judge whether any thing that may appear to us wonderful, or miraculous,
                be within, or be beyond, or be contrary to, her natural power of acting.
                </p>
                <p>
                The ascension of a man several miles high into the air, would have every thing in it that constitutes
                the idea of a miracle, if it were not known that a species of air can be generated several times
                lighter than the common
                atmospheric air, and yet possess elasticity enough to prevent the balloon,
                in which that light air is inclosed, from being compressed into as many times less bulk,
                by the common air that surrounds it. In like manner, extracting flashes
                or sparks of fire from the human body, as visibly as from a steel struck with a flint, and causing
                iron or steel to move without any visible agent, would also give the idea of a miracle,
                if we were not acquainted with electricity and magnetism: so also would many other experiments
                in natural philosophy, to those who are not acquainted, with the subject.
                The restoring persons to life, who are to appearance dead, as is practised upon drowned persons,
                would also be a miracle, if it were not known that animation is capable of being suspended, without
                being extinct.
                </p>
                <p>
                Besides these, there are performances by slight of hand, and by persons acting in concert,
                that have a miraculous appearance, which, when known, are thought nothing of. And besides these,
                there are mechanical and optical deceptions. There is now an exhibition in Paris of ghosts or spectres,
                which, thought it is not imposed upon the spectators as a fact, has an astonishing appearance.
                As therefore we know not the extent to which nature or art can go, there is no positive
                criterion to determine what a miracle is; and mankind, in giving credit to appearances,
                under the idea of their being miracles, are subject to be continually imposed upon.
                </p>
                <p>
                Since then appearances are so capable of deceiving, and things not real have a strong resemblance to
                things that are, nothing can be more inconsistent, than to suppose, that the Almighty would make
                use of means, such as are called miracles, that would subject the person who performed them to the
                suspicion of being an impostor, and the persons who related them to be suspected of lying,
                and the doctrine intended to be supported thereby, to be suspected as a fabulous invention.
                </p>
                <p>
                Of all the modes of evidence that ever were invented to obtain belief to any system or opinion,
                to which the name of religion has been given, that of
                <hi rend="italic">miracle,</hi>
                however
                successful the imposition may have been, is the most inconsistent. For, in the
                </p>
                <pb n="47"/>
                <p>
                first place,
                whenever recourse is had to show, for the purpose of procuring that belief (for a miracle,
                under any idea of the word, is a show), it implies a lameness or weakness in the doctrine that is
                preached. And, in the second place, it is degrading the Almighty into the character of a show-man,
                playing tricks to amuse and make the people stare and wonder. It is also the most equivocal sort of
                evidence that can be set up; for the belief is not to depend upon the thing called a miracle,
                but upon the credit of the reporter, who says that he saw it; and therefore the thing, were it true,
                would have no better chance of being believed than if it were a lie.
                </p>
                <p>Suppose I were to say, that when I sat down to write this book, a hand presented itself in the air,
                took up the pen, and wrote every word that is herein written; would any body believe me? Certainly
                they would not. Would they believe me a whit the more if the thing had been a fact? Certainly they
                would not. Since then a real miracle, were it to happen, would be subject to the same fate as a
                falsehood, the inconsistency becomes the greater, of supposing the Almighty would make use of means
                that would not answer the purpose for which they were intended, even if it were real.
                </p>
                <p>If we were to suppose a miracle to be something so entirely out of the course of what is called
                nature, that she must go out of that course to accomplish it, and we see an account given of such
                miracle by the person who said he saw it, it raises a question in the mind very easily decided,
                which is, Is it more probable that nature should go out of her course, or that a man should tell a
                lie? We have never seen, in our time, nature go out of her course; but we have good reason to believe,
                that millions of lies have been told in the same time: it is therefore at least millions to one,
                that the reporter of a miracle tells a lie.</p>
                <p>
                The story of the whale swallowing Jonah, though a whale is large enough to do it,
                borders greatly on the marvellous; but it would have approached nearer to the idea
                of a miracle, if Jonah had swallowed the whale. In this, which may serve for all cases of miracles,
                the matter would decide itself as before stated,
                namely, Is it more probable that a man should have swallowed a whale, or told a lie?
                </p>
                <p>
                But supposing that Jonah had really swallowed the whale, and gone with it in his belly to Nineveh,
                and to convince the people that it was true, have cast it up in their sight, of the full length and
                size  of a whale, would they not have believed him to have been the devil instead
                of a prophet? or, if the whale had carried Jonah to Nineveh, and cast him up in the same
                public
                </p>
                <pb n="48"/>
                <p>
                manner, would they not have believed the whale to have been the devil, and Jonah
                one of his imps?
                </p>
                <p>
                The most extraordinary of all the things called miracles, related in the New Testament,
                is that of the devil flying away with Jesus Christ, and carrying him to the top of a high mountain,
                and to the top of the highest pinnacle of the temple, and showing him, and promising to him
                <hi rend="italic">all the kingdoms of the world.</hi>
                How happened it that he did not discover America? or is it only with
                <hi rend="italic">
                kingdoms
                </hi>
                that his sooty
                highness has any interest?
                </p>
                <p>
                I have too much respect for the moral character of Christ, to believe that he told this
                whale of a miracle himself; neither is it easy to account for what purpose it could have been
                fabricated unless it were to impose upon the connoisseurs of miracles, as is sometimes
                practised upon the connoisseurs of Queen Anne's farthings and collectors of relics and
                antiquities; or to render the belief of miracles rediculous, by outdoing miracle,
                as Don Quixote outdid chivalry; or to embarrass the belief of miracles by making it doubtful
                by what power, whether of God or of the devil, any thing called a miracle was performed.
                It requires, however, a great deal of faith in the devil to belief this miracle.
                </p>
                <p>
                In every point of view, in which those things called miracles can be placed and considered,
                the reality of them is improbable, and their existence unnecessary. They would not,
                as before observed, answer any useful purpose, even if they were true: for it is more difficult
                to obtain belief
                to a miracle, than to a principle evidently moral, without
                any miracle. Moral principle speaks universally for itself. Miracle
                could be but a thing of the moment, and seen but by a few; after this it requires a transfer of faith
                from God to man, to believe a miracle upon man's report. Instead therefore of admitting the
                recitals of miracles as evidence of any system of religion being true, they ought to be
                considered as symptoms of its being fabulous. It is necessary to the full and upright character
                of truth, that it rejects the crutch; and it is consistent with the character of fable,
                to seek the aid that truth rejects. Thus much for mystery and miracle.
                </p>
                <p>
                As mystery and miracle took charge of the past and the present, prophecy took charge of the future,
                and rounded the tenses of faith. It was not sufficient to know what had been done, but what
                would be done. The supposed prophet was the supposed historian of times to come:
                and if he happened, in shooting with a long bow of a thousand years, to strike within a thousand
                miles of a mark, the ingenuity of posterity could make
                </p>
                <pb n="49"/>
                <p>
                it point blank: and if he happened to
                be directly wrong, it was only to suppose, as in the case of Jonah and Ninevah, that God had
                repented himself, and changed his mind. What a fool do fabulous systems of religion make of man!
                </p>
                <p>
                It has been shewn in a former part of this work, that the original meaning of the words
                <hi rend="italic">prophet</hi>
                and
                <hi rend="italic">
                prophesying,
                </hi>
                has been changed, and that a prophet, in the sense the word is now used, is a creature of modern
                invention; and it is owing to this change in the meaning of the words, that the flights and
                metaphors of the Jewish poets, and phrases and expressions now rendered obscure by our not being
                acquainted with the local circumstances to which they applied at the time they were used,
                have been erected into prophesies, and made to bend to explanations at the will and whimsical
                conceits of sectaries, expounders, and commentators. Every thing unintelligible
                was prophetical, and every thing insignificant was typical. A blunder would have served for prophecy,
                and a dish-clout for a type.
                </p>
                <p>
                If by a prophet we are to suppose a man, to whom the Almighty communicated some event that would
                take place in future, either there were such men, or there were not. If there were,
                it is consistent to believe that the event, so communicated, would be told in terms that
                could be understood; and not related in such a loose and obscure manner as to be out of the
                comprehension of those that heard it, and so equivocal as to fit almost any circumstance that
                might happen afterwards. It is conceiving very irreverently of the Almighty to suppose he would
                deal in this jesting manner with mankind:
                yet all the things called prophecies, in the book called the Bible, come under this description.
                </p>
                <p>
                But it is with prophecy, as it is with miracle. It could not answer the purpose even if it were real.
                Those to whom a prophecy should be told, could not tell whether the man prophesied or lyed, or
                whether it had been revealed to him, or whether he conceited it; and if the thing that the prophesied,
                or pretended to prophecy, should happen, or something like it, among the multiude of things that
                are daily happening, nobody could again know whether he foreknew it, or guessed at it, or whether
                it was accidental. A prophet, therefore, is a character useless and unnecessary;
                and the safe side of the case is, to guard against being imposed upon by not giving
                credit to such relations.
                </p>
                <p>
                Upon the whole, mystery, miracle, and prophecy, are appendages that belong to fabulous and not to
                true religion. They are the means by which so many
                <hi rend="italic">Lo heres!</hi>
                and
                <hi rend="italic">Lo theres!</hi>
                have

                <p>
                been spread about the world, and religion been made into a trade. The success of one imposter
                gave encouragement to another; and the quieting salvo of doing
                <hi rend="italic">some good</hi>
                by keeping up a
                <hi rend="italic">pious fraud,</hi>
                protected them from remorse.
                </p>
                <p>
                Having now extended the subject to a greater length than I first intended, I shall bring it to a
                close by abstracting a summary from the whole.
                </p>
                <p>
                First, That the idea or belief of a word of God existing in print, or in writing, or in speech,
                is inconsistent in itself for the reasons already assigned. These reasons, among many others,
                are the want of a universal language; the mutability of language; the errors to which
                translations are subject; the possibility of totally suppressing such a word;
                the probability of altering it; or of fabricating the whole, and imposing it upon the world.
                </p>
                <p>Secondly, That the creation we behold is the real and ever-existing word of God,
                in which we cannot be deceived. It proclaims his power; it demonstrates his wisdom;
                it manifests his goodness and beneficence.</p>
                <p>
                Thirdly, That the moral duty of man consists in imitating the moral goodness and beneficence of
                God manifested in the creation towards all his creatures. That, seeing as we daily do
                the goodness of God to all men, it is an example calling upon all men to practise the same
                towards each other; and consequently that every thing of persecution and revenge between man
                and man, and every thing of cruelty to animals, is a violation of moral duty.
                </p>
                <p>
                I trouble not myself about the manner of future existence. I content myself with believing,
                even to positive conviction, that the power that gave me existence is able to continue it,
                in any form and manner he pleases, either with or without this body; and it appears more
                probable to me, that I shall continue to exist hereafter, than that I should have had existence,
                as I now have, before that existence began.
                </p>
                <p>
                It is certain that, in one point, all nations of the earth and all religions agree.—All
                believe in a God. The things in which they disagree, are the redundancies annexed to that
                belief; and therefore, if ever an universal religion should prevail, it will not be believing any
                thing new, but in getting rid of redundancies, and believing as man believed at first. Adam,
                if ever there was such a man, was created a Deist:—but in the mean time let every man
                follow, as he has a right to do, the religion and the worship he prefers.
