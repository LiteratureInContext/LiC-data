    <head type="title">THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE.</head>

    <p>BY EDGAR A. POE.</p>

    <p>It is not improbable that a few farther steps in phrenological science will lead to a belief
     in the existence, of not to the actual discovery and location of an organ of <hi rend="italic"
      >analysis</hi>. If this power (which may be described, although not defined, as the capacity
     for resolving thought into its elements) be not, in fact, an essential portion of what later
     philosophers term ideality, then there are indeed many good reasons for supposing it a
     primitive faculty. That it may be a constituent of ideality is here suggested in opposition to
     the vulgar dictum (founded, however, upon the assumptions of grave authority,) that the
     calculating and discriminating powers (causality and comparison) are at variance with the
     imaginative—that the three, in short, can hardly coexist. But, although thus opposed to
     received opinion, the idea will not appear ill-founded when we observe that the processes of
     invention or creation are strictly akin with the process of resolution—the former being nearly,
     if not absolutely, the latter conversed.</p>

    <p>It cannot be doubted that the mental features discoursed of as the analytical, are, in
     themselves, but little susceptible of analysis. We appreciate them only in their effects. We
     know of them, among other things, that they are always to their possessor, when inordinately
     possessed, a source of the liveliest enjoyment. As the strong man exults in his physical
     ability, delighting in such exercises as call his muscles into action, so glories the analyst
     in that moral activity which <hi rend="italic">disentangles</hi>. He derives pleasure from even
     the most trivial occupations bringing his talent into play. He is fond of enigmas, of
     conundrums, of hieroglyphics—exhibiting in his solutions of each and all a degree of acumen
     which appears to the ordinary apprehension præternatural. His results, brought about by the
     very soul and essence of method, have, in truth, the whole air of intuition.</p>
    <p>The faculty in question is possibly much invigorated by mathematical study, and especially by
     that highest branch of it which, unjustly, and merely on account of its retrograde operations,
     has been called, as if <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi>, analysis. Yet to calculate is not
     in itself to analyse. A chess-player, for example, does the one without effort at the other. It
     follows that the game of chess, in its effects upon mental character, is greatly misunderstood.
     I am not now writing a treatise, but simply prefacing a somewhat peculiar narrative by
     observations very much at random—I will, therefore, take occasion to assert that the higher
     powers of the reflective intellect are more decidedly and more usefully taxed by the
     unostentatious game of draughts than by a the elaborate frivolity of chess. In this latter,
     where the pieces have different and bizarre motions, with various and variable values, that
     which is complex is mistaken (a not unusual error) for what is profound. The <hi rend="italic"
      >attention</hi> is here called powerfully into play. If it flag for an instant, an oversight
     is committed, resulting in injury or defeat. The possible moves being not only manifold but
     involute, the chances of such oversights are multiplied; and in nine cases out of ten it is the
     more concentrative rather than the more acute player who conquers. In draughts, on the
     contrary, where the moves are unique and have but little variation, the probabilities of
     inadvertence are diminished, and the mere attention being left comparatively unemployed, what
     advantages are obtained by either party are obtained by superior acumen. To be less
     abstract—Let us suppose a game of draughts, where the pieces are reduced to four kings, and
     where, of course, no oversight is to be expected. It is obvious that here the victory can be
     decided (the players being at all equal) only by some recherché movement, the result of some
     strong exertion of the intellect. Deprived of ordinary resources, the analyst throws himself
     into the spirit of his opponent, identifies himself therewith, and not unfrequently sees thus,
     at a glance, the sole methods (sometime indeed absurdly simple ones) by which he may seduce
     into miscalculation or hurry into error.</p>
    <p><ref target="whist_" corresp="whist">Whist</ref> has long been noted for its influence upon
     what are termed the calculating powers; and men of the highest order of intellect have been
     known to take an apparently unaccountable delight in it, while eschewing chess as frivolous.
     Beyond doubt there is nothing of a similar nature so greatly tasking the faculty of analysis.
     The best chess-player in Christendom <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be little more than the best
     player of chess—but proficiency in whist implies capacity for success in all those more
     important undertakings where mind struggles with mind. When I say proficiency, I mean that
     perfection in the game which includes a comprehension of all the sources (whatever be their
     character) from which legitimate advantage may be derived. These are not only manifold but
     multiform, and lie frequently among recesses of thought altogether inaccessible to the ordinary
     understanding. To observe <pb n="167" facs="pageImages/Murders_167.jpg"/>attentively is to
     remember distinctly; and so far the concentrative chess-player will do very well at whist;
     while the rules of <ref target="hoyle_" corresp="hoyle">Hoyle</ref> (themselves based upon the
     mere mechanism of the game) are sufficiently and generally comprehensible. Thus to have a
     retentive memory, and to proceed by "the book," are points commonly regarded as the sum total
     of good playing. But it is in matters beyond the limits of mere rule where the skill of the
     analyst is evinced. He makes, in silence, a host of observations and inferences. So perhaps do
     his companions; and the difference in the extent of the information obtained lies not so much
     in the falsity of the inference as in the quality of the observation. The necessary knowledge
     is that of <hi rend="italic">what</hi> to observe. Our player confines himself not at all; nor,
     because the game is the object, does he reject deductions from things external to the game. He
     examines the countenance of his partner, comparing it carefully with that of each of his
     opponents. He considers the mode of assorting the cards in each hand; often counting trump by
     trump, and honor by honor, through the glances bestowed by their holders upon each. He notes
     every variation of face as the play progresses, gathering a fund of thought from the
     differences in the expression of certainty, of surprise, of triumph or of chagrin. From the
     manner of gathering up a trick he judges whether the person taking it can make another in the
     suit. He recognises what is played through feint by the air with which it is thrown upon the
     table. A casual or inadvertent word; the accidental dropping or turning of a card, with the
     accompanying anxiety or carelessness in regard to its concealment; the counting of the tricks,
     with the order of their arrangement; embarrassment, hesitation, eagerness or trepidation—all
     afford to his apparently intuitive perception indications of the true state of affairs. The
     first two or three rounds having been played, he is in full possession of the contents of each
     hand, and thenceforward puts down his cards with as absolute a precision of purpose as if the
     rest of the party had turned outward the faces of their own.</p>
    <p>The analytical power should not be confounded with simple ingenuity; for while the analyst is
     necessarily ingenious, the ingenious man is often utterly incapable of analysis. I have spoken
     of this latter faculty as that of resolving thought into its elements, and it is only
     necessarily to glance upon this idea to perceive the necessity of the distinction just
     mentioned. The constructive or combining power, by which ingenuity is usually manifested, and
     to which the phrenologists (I believe erroneously) have assigned a separate organ, supposing it
     a primitive faculty, has been so frequently seen in those whose intellect bordered otherwise
     upon idiocy as to have attracted general observation among writers on morals. Between ingenuity
     and the analytic ability there exists a difference far greater indeed than that between the
     fancy and the imagination, but of a character very strictly analogous. It will be found, in
     fact, that the ingenious are always fanciful, and the <hi rend="italic">truly</hi> imaginative
     never otherwise than profoundly analytic.</p>
    <p>The narrative which follows will appear to the reader somewhat in the light of a commentary
     upon the propositions just advanced.</p>
    <p>Residing in Paris during the spring and part of the summer of 18—, I there contracted an
     intimacy with a Monsieur C. Auguste Dupin. This young gentleman was of an excellent, indeed of
     an illustrious family, but, by a variety of untoward events, had been reduced to such poverty
     that the quondam energy of his character succumbed beneath it, and he ceased to bestir himself
     in the world, or to care for the retrieval of his fortunes. By courtesy of his creditors there
     still remained in his possession a small remnant of his patrimony; and, upon the income arising
     from this he managed, by means of a vigorous economy, to procure the necessaries of life,
     without troubling himself about its superfluities. Books, indeed, were his sole luxuries, and
     in Paris these are easily obtained.</p>
    <p>Our first meeting was at an obscure library in the <ref target="rue_" corresp="rue"
     >Rue</ref>Montmartre, where the accident of our both being in search of the same very rare and
     very remarkable volume brought us into closer communion. We saw each other again and again. I
     was deeply interested in the little family history which he detailed to me with all that candor
     which a Frenchman indulges only when self is his theme. I was astonished, too, at the vast
     extent of his reading—and above all I felt my soul enkindled within me by the wild fervor, and
     what I could only term the vivid freshness, of his imagination. Seeking in Paris the objects I
     then sought, I felt that the society of such a man would be to me a treasure beyond price; and
     this feeling I frankly confided to him. It was at length arranged that we should live together
     during my stay in the city; and, as my worldly circumstances were somewhat less embarrassed
     than his own, I was permitted to be at the expense of renting, and furnishing in a style which
     suited the rather fantastic gloom of our common temper, a time-eaten and grotesque mansion,
     long deserted through superstitions into which we did not inquire, and tottering to its fall in
     a retired and desolate portion of the <ref target="germain_" corresp="germain">Faubourg St.
      Germain</ref>.</p>
    <p>Had the routine of our life at this place been known to the world, we should have been
     regarded as madmen—although, perhaps, as madmen of a harmless nature. Our seclusion was
     perfect. We admitted no visitors whomsoever. Indeed the locality of our retirement had been
     carefully kept a secret from my own former associates; and it had been many years since Dupin
     had ceased to know or be known in Paris. We existed within ourselves alone.</p>
    <p>It was a freak of fancy in my friend (for what else shall I call it?) to be enamored of the
     Night for her own sake; and into this <hi rend="italic">bizarrerie</hi>, as into all his
     others, I quietly fell; giving myself up to his wild whims with an utter <hi rend="italic"
      >abandon</hi>. The sable divinity would not herself dwell with us always, but we could
     counterfeit her presence. At the first dawn of the morning we closed all the <ref
      target="massy_" corresp="massy">massy</ref> shutters of our old building, lighting a couple of
     tapers which, strongly perfumed, threw out only the ghastliest and feeblest of rays. By the aid
     of these <pb n="168" facs="pageImages/Murders_168.jpg"/>we then busied our souls in
     dreams—reading, writing, or conversing, until warned by the clock of the advent of the true
     Darkness. Then we sallied forth into the streets arm in arm, continuing the topics of the day,
     or roaming far and wide until a late hour, seeking, amid the wild lights and shadows of the
     populous city, that infinity of mental excitement which quiet observation can afford.</p>
    <p>At such times I could not help remarking and admiring (although from his rich ideality I had
     been prepared to expect) a peculiar analytic ability in Dupin. He seemed, too, to take an eager
     delight in its exercise, if not exactly in its display; and did not hesitate to confess the
     pleasure thus derived. He boasted to me, with a low chuckling laugh, that most men, in respect
     to himself, wore windows in their bosoms, and was wont to follow up such assertions by direct
     and very startling proofs of his intimate knowledge of my own. His manner at these moments was
     frigid and abstract; his eyes were vacant in expression; while his voice, usually a rich tenor,
     rose into a treble which would have sounded petulantly but for the deliberateness and entire
     distinctness of the enunciation. Observing him in these moods I often dwelt meditatively upon
     the old philosophy of the Bi-Part Soul, and amused myself with the fancy of a double Dupin—the
     creative and the resolvent.</p>
    <p>Let it not be supposed, from what I have just said, that I am detailing any mystery, or
     penning any romance. What I have described in the Frenchman was but the result of an excited,
     or perhaps of a diseased intelligence. But of the character of his remarks at the periods in
     question an example will best convey the idea.</p>
    <p>We were strolling one night down a long dirty street, in the vicinity of the <ref
      target="palais_" corresp="palais">Palais Royal</ref>. Being both, apparently, occupied with
     thought, neither of us had spoken a syllable for fifteen minutes at least. All at once Dupin
     broke forth with these words—</p>
    <p>"He is a very little fellow, that's true, and would do better for the <ref target="theatre_"
      corresp="theatre"><hi rend="italic">Théâtre des Variétés.</hi></ref>"</p>
    <p>"There can be no doubt of that," I replied unwittingly, and not at first observing (so much
     had I been absorbed in reflection) the extraordinary manner in which the speaker had chimed in
     with my meditations. In an instant afterward I recollected myself, and my astonishment was
     profound.</p>
    <p>"Dupin," said I, gravely, "this is beyond my comprehension. I do not hesitate to say that I
     am amazed, and can scarcely credit my senses. How was it possible you should know I was
     thinking of ———?" Here I paused, to ascertain beyond a doubt whether he really knew of whom I
     thought.</p>
    <p>———"of Chantilly," said he, "why do you pause? You were remarking to yourself that his
     diminutive figure unfitted him for tragedy."</p>
    <p>This was precisely what had formed the subject of my reflections. Chantilly was a <ref
      target="quondam_" corresp="quondam">quondam</ref> cobler of the Rue St. Denis, who, becoming
     stage-mad, had attempted the rôle of <ref target="xerxes_" corresp="xerxes">Xerxes, in
      Crébillon's</ref> tragedy so called, and been notoriously <ref target="pasquinade_"
      corresp="pasquinade">pasquinaded</ref> for his pains.</p>
    <p>"Tell me, for God’s sake," I exclaimed, "the method—if method there be—by which you have been
     enabled to fathom my soul in this matter." In fact I was even more startled than I would have
     been willing to express.</p>
    <p>"It was the fruiterer," replied my friend, "who brought you to the conclusion that the mender
     of soles was not of sufficient height for Xerxes <hi rend="italic"><ref target="genus_"
       corresp="genus">et id genus omne</ref>
     </hi>."</p>
    <p>"The fruiterer!—you astonish me—I know no fruiterer whomsoever."</p>
    <p>"The man who ran up against you as we entered the street—it may have been fifteen minutes
     ago."</p>
    <p>I now remembered that in fact a fruiterer, carrying upon his head a large basket of apples,
     had nearly thrown me down, by accident, as we passed from the Rue C——— into the thoroughfare
     where we stood; but what this had to do with Chantilly I could not possibly understand.</p>
    <p>There was not a particle of <ref target="charlatan_" corresp="charlatan"><hi rend="italic"
       >charlâtanerie</hi></ref> about Dupin. "I will explain," he said, "and that you may
     comprehend all clearly, we will first retrace the course of your meditations, from the moment
     in which I spoke to you until that of the rencontre with the fruiterer in question. The larger
     links of the chain run thus—Chantilly, Orion, Dr. Nichols, Epicurus, Stereotomy, the street
     stones, the fruiterer."</p>
    <p>There are few persons who have not, at some period of their lives, amused themselves in
     retracing the steps by which particular conclusions of their own minds have been attained. The
     occupation is often full of interest; and he who attempts it for the first time is astonished
     by the apparently illimitable distance and incoherence between the starting-point and the goal.
     What, then, must have been my amazement when I heard the Frenchman speak what he had just
     spoken, and when I could not help acknowledging that he had spoken the truth. He continued—</p>
    <p>"We had been talking of horses, if I remember aright, just before leaving the Rue C———. This
     was the last subject we discussed. As we crossed into this street, a fruiterer, with a large
     basket upon his head, brushing quickly past us, thrust you upon a pile of paving stones
     collected at a spot where the causeway is undergoing repair. You stepped upon one of the loose
     fragments, slipped, slightly strained your ankle, appeared vexed or sulky, muttered a few
     words, turned to look at the pile, and then proceeded in silence. I was not particularly
     attentive to what you did—but observation has become with me of late a species of
     necessity.</p>
    <p>You kept your eyes upon the ground—glancing, with a petulant expression at the holes and ruts
     in the pavement, (so that I saw you were still thinking of the stones,) until we reached the
     little alley called Lamartine, which has been paved, by way of experiment, with the overlapping
     and riveted blocks. Here your countenance brightened up, and, perceiving your lips move, I
     could not doubt that you murmured the word 'stereotomic.' You continued the same inaudible
     murmur, with a knit brow, as is the custom of a man tasking his memory, until I considered that
     you sought the Greek derivation of the word ‘stereotomy.’ I knew <pb n="169"
      facs="pageImages/Murders_169.jpg"/>that you could not find this' without being brought to
     think of atomies, and thus of the theories of Epicurus; and as, when we discussed this subject
     not very long ago, I mentioned to you how singularly, yet with how little notice, the vague
     guesses of that noble Greek had met with confirmation in the late nebular cosmogony, I felt
     that you could not avoid casting your eyes upward to the great nebula in Orion, and I certainly
     expected that you would do so. You did look up; and I was now assured that I had correctly
     followed your steps. But in that bitter <hi rend="italic">tirade</hi> upon Chantilly, which
     appeared in yesterday's '<hi rend="italic">Musée</hi>,' the satirist, making some disgraceful
     allusions to the cobler's change of name upon assuming the buskin, quoted a Latin line about
     which we have often conversed. I mean the line</p>
    <p><ref target="perditit_" corresp="perditit"><hi rend="italic">Perdidit antiquum litera prima
       sonum.</hi></ref> I had told you that this was in reference to Orion, formerly written Urion;
     and from certain pungencies connected with this explanation I was aware that you could not have
     forgotten it. It was clear, therefore, that you would not fail to combine the two ideas of
     Orion and Chantilly. That you did combine them I saw by the character of the smile which passed
     over your lips. You thought of the poor cobler's immolation. So far, you had been stooping in
     your gait—but now I saw you draw yourself up to your full height. I was then sure that you
     reflected upon the diminutive figure of Chantilly. At this point I interrupted your meditations
     to remark that as in fact be was a very little fellow—that Chantilly—he would do better at the
      <hi rend="italic">Théâtre des Variétés.</hi>"</p>
    <p>Not long after this we were looking over an evening edition of "Le Tribunal," when the
     following, paragraphs arrested our attention.</p>
    <p>"EXTRAORDINARY MURDERS.—This morning, about three o'clock, the inhabitants of the <ref
      target="roch_" corresp="roch">Quartier St. Roch</ref> were aroused from sleep by a succession
     of terrific shrieks, issuing, apparently, from the fourth story of a house in the Rue Morgue,
     known to be in the sole occupancy of one Madame L'Espanaye, and her daughter, Mademoiselle
     Camille L'Espanaye. After some delay, occasioned by a fruitless attempt to procure admission in
     the usual manner, the gateway was broken in with a crowbar, and eight or ten of the neighbors
     entered, accompanied by two <ref target="gendarmes_" corresp="gendarmes"><hi rend="italic"
       >gendarmes</hi></ref>. By this time the cries had ceased; but as the party rushed up the
     first flight of stairs, two or more rough voices in angry contention were distinguished, and
     seemed to proceed from the upper part of the house. As the second landing was reached, these
     sounds, also, had ceased, and every thing remained perfectly quiet. The party spread
     themselves, and hurried from room to room. Upon arriving at a large back chamber in the fourth
     story, (the door of which, being found locked, with the key inside, was forced open) a
     spectacle presented itself which struck every one present not less with horror than with
     astonishment.</p>
    <p>The apartment was in the wildest disorder—the furniture broken and thrown about in all
     directions. There was only one bedstead; and from this the bed had been removed, and thrown
     into the middle of the floor. On a chair lay a razor, besmeared with blood. On the hearth were
     two or three long and thick tresses of grey human hair, also dabbled in blood, and seeming to
     have been pulled out by the roots. Upon the floor were found four Napoleons, an ear-ring of
     topaz, three large silver spoons, three smaller of <hi rend="italic">métal d'Alger</hi>, and
     two bags, containing nearly four thousand francs in gold. The drawers of a <hi rend="italic"
      >bureau</hi>, which stood in one corner, were open, and had been, apparently, rifled, although
     many articles still remained in them. A small iron safe was discovered under the <hi
      rend="italic">bed</hi> (not under the bedstead). It was open, with the key still in the door.
     It had no contents beyond a few old letters, and other papers of little consequence.</p>
    <p>Of Madame L'Espanaye no traces were here seen; but an unusual quantity of soot being observed
     in the fire-place, a search was made in the chimney, and (horrible to relate!) the corpse of
     the daughter, head downward, was dragged therefrom; it having been thus forced up the narrow
     aperture for a considerable distance. The body was quite warm. Upon examining it many
     excoriations were perceived, no doubt occasioned by the violence with which it had been thrust
     up and disengaged. Upon the face were many severe scratches, and upon the throat dark bruises,
     and deep indentations of finger nails, as if the deceased had been throttled to death.</p>
    <p>After a thorough investigation of every portion of the house, without farther discovery, the
     party made its way into a small paved yard in the rear of the building, where lay the corpse of
     the old lady, with her throat so entirely cut that, upon an attempt to raise her, the head fell
     off, and rolled some distance. The body, as well as the head, was fearfully mutilated—the
     former so much so as scarcely to retain any semblance of humanity.</p>
    <p>"To this horrible mystery there is not as yet, we believe, the slightest clew."</p>
    <p>The next day's paper had these additional particulars.</p>
    <p>"<hi rend="italic">The Tragedy in the Rue Morgue</hi>. Many individuals have been examined in
     relation to this most extraordinary and frightful affair." [The word '<hi rend="italic"
      >affaire</hi>' has not yet, in France, that levity of import which it conveys with us,] "but
     nothing whatever has transpired to throw light upon it. We give below all the material
     testimony elicited.</p>
    <p><hi rend="italic">Pauline Dubourg</hi>, laundress, deposes that she has known both the
     deceased for three years, having washed for them during that period. The old lady and her
     daughter seemed on good terms—very affectionate towards each other. They were excellent pay.
     Could not speak in regard to their mode or means of living. Believed that Madame L. told
     fortunes for a living. Was reputed to have money put by. Never met any persons in the house
     when she called for the clothes or took them home. Was sure that they had no servant in employ.
     There appeared to be no furniture in any part of the building except in the fourth story.</p>
    <p><hi rend="italic">Pierre Moreau</hi>, tobacconist, deposes that he has been in the habit of
     selling small quantities of <pb n="170" facs="pageImages/Murders_170.jpg"/>tobacco and snuff to
     Madame L'Espanaye for nearly four years. Was born in the neighborhood, and has always resided
     there. The deceased and her daughter had occupied the house in which the corpses were found for
     more than six years. It was formerly occupied by a jeweller, who under-let the upper rooms to
     various persons. The house was the property of Madame L. She became dissatisfied with the abuse
     of the premises by her tenant, and moved into them herself, refusing to let any portion. The
     old lady was childish. Witness had seen the daughter some five or six times during the six
     years. The two lived an exceedingly retired life—were reputed to have money. Had heard it said
     among the neighbors that Madame L. told fortunes—did not believe it. Had never seen any person
     enter the door except the old lady and her daughter, a porter once or twice, and a physician
     some eight or ten times.</p>
    <p>Many other persons, neighbors, gave evidence to the same effect. No one was spoken of as
     frequenting the house. It was not known whether there were any living connexions of Madame L.
     and her daughter. The shutters of the front windows were seldom opened. Those in the rear were
     always closed, with the exception of the large back room, fourth story. The house was a good
     house—not very old.</p>
    <p><hi rend="italic">Isidore Muset</hi>, gendarme, deposes that he was called to the house about
     three o'clock in the morning, and found some twenty or thirty persons at the gateway,
     endeavoring to gain admittance. Forced it open, at length with a bayonet—not with a crowbar.
     Had but little difficulty in getting it open, on account of its being a double or folding gate,
     and bolted neither at bottom nor top. The shrieks were continued until the gate was forced—and
     then suddenly ceased. They seemed to be screams of some person (or persons) in great agony—were
     loud and drawn out, not short and quick. Witness led the way up stairs. Upon reaching the first
     landing heard two voices in loud and angry contention—the one a gruff voice, the other much
     shriller—a very strange voice. Could distinguish some words of the former, which was that of a
     Frenchman. Was positive that it was not a woman's voice. Could distinguish the words <ref
      target="sacre_" corresp="sacre">'<hi rend="italic">sacré</hi>'</ref> and <ref target="diable_"
      corresp="diable">'<hi rend="italic">diable</hi>.'</ref> The shrill voice was that of a
     foreigner. Could not be sure whether it was the voice of a man or of a woman. Could not make
     out what was said, but believed the language to be Spanish. The state of the room and of the
     bodies was described by this witness as we described them yesterday.</p>
    <p><hi rend="italic">Henri Duval</hi>, a neighbor, and by trade a silver-smith, deposes that he
     was one of the party who first entered the house. Corroborates the testimony of Musèt in
     general. As soon as they forced an entrance, they reclosed the door to keep out the crowd,
     which collected very fast, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour. The shrill voice, this
     witness thinks, was that of an Italian. Was certain it was not French. Could not be sure that
     it was a man's voice. It might have been a woman's. Was not acquainted with the Italian
     language. Could not distinguish the words, but was convinced by the intonation that the speaker
     was an Italian. Knew Madame L. and her daughter. Had conversed with both frequently. Was sure
     that the shrill voice was not that of either of the deceased.</p>
    <p>———<hi rend="italic">Odenheimer</hi>, restaurateur. This witness volunteered his testimony.
     Not speaking French was examined through an interpreter. Is a native of Amsterdam. Was passing
     the house at the time of the shrieks. They lasted for several minutes—probably ten. They were
     long and loud—very awful and distressing. Was one of those who entered the building.
     Corroborated the previous evidence in every respect but one. Was sure that the shrill voice was
     that of a man—of a Frenchman. Could not distinguish the words uttered. They were loud and
     quick—unequal—sometimes quick, sometimes deliberate—spoken apparently in fear as well as in
     anger. The voice was harsh—not so much shrill as harsh. Could not call it a shrill voice. The
     gruff voice said repeatedly '<hi rend="italic">sacré</hi>,' '<hi rend="italic">diable</hi>,'
     and once '<ref target="mondieu_" corresp="mondieu"><hi rend="italic">mon dieu</hi></ref>.'</p>
    <p><hi rend="italic">Jules Mignaud</hi>, Banker, of the firm of Mignaud et Fils, Rue Deloraine.
     Is the elder Mignaud. Madame L'Espanaye had some property. Had opened an account with his
     banking house in the spring of the year—(eight years previously.) Made frequent deposits in
     small sums. Had checked for nothing until the third day before her death, when she took out in
     person the sum of 4000 francs. This sum was paid in gold, and a clerk sent home with the
     money.</p>
    <p><hi rend="italic">Adolphe Le Bon</hi>, clerk to Mignaud et Fils, deposes that on the day in
     question, about noon, he accompanied Madame L'Espanaye to her residence with the 4000 francs,
     put up in two bags. Upon the door being opened Mademoiselle L. appeared and took from his hands
     one of the bags, while the old lady relieved him of the other. He then bowed and departed. Did
     not see any person in the street at the time. It is a bye street—very lonely.</p>
    <p><hi rend="italic">William Bird</hi>, tailor deposes that he was one of the party who entered
     the house. Is an Englishman. Has lived in Paris two years. Was one of the first to ascend the
     stairs. Heard the voices in contention. The gruff voice was that of a Frenchman. Could make out
     several words, but cannot now remember all. Heard distinctly '<hi rend="italic">sacré</hi>' and
      '<hi rend="italic">mon dieu</hi>.' There was a sound at the moment as if of several persons
     struggling—a scraping and scuffling sound. The shrill voice was very loud—louder than the gruff
     one. Is sure that it was not the voice of an Englishman. Appeared to be that of a German. Might
     have been a woman's voice. Does not understand German.</p>
    <p>Four of the above-named witnesses, being recalled, deposed that the door of the chamber in
     which was found the body of Mademoiselle L. was locked on the inside when the party reached it.
     Every thing was perfectly silent—no groans or noises of any kind. Upon forcing the door no
     person was seen. The windows both of the back and front room were down and firmly fastened from
     within. A door between the two rooms was closed, but not locked. The door leading from the
     front room into the passage was locked with the key on the inside. A small room in the front of
     the house, on <pb n="171" facs="pageImages/Murders_171.jpg"/>the fourth story, at the head of
     the passage, was open, the door being ajar. This room was crowded with old beds, boxes, and so
     forth. These were carefully removed and searched. There was not an inch of any portion of the
     house which was not carefully searched. Sweeps were sent up and down the chimneys. The house
     was a four story one, with garrets, <ref target="mansard_" corresp="mansard">(<hi rend="italic"
       >mansardes</hi>.)</ref> A trap-door on the roof was nailed down very securely—did not appear
     to have been opened for years. The time elapsing between the hearing of the voices in
     contention and the breaking open of the room door was variously stated by the witnesses. Some
     made it as short as three minutes—some as long as five. The door was opened with
     difficulty.</p>
    <p><hi rend="italic">Alfonzo Garcio</hi>, undertaker, deposes that he resides in the Rue Morgue.
     Is a native of Spain. Was one of the party who entered the house. Did not proceed up stairs. Is
     nervous, and was apprehensive of the consequences of agitation. Heard the voices in contention.
     The gruff voice was that of a Frenchman. Could not distinguish what was said. The shrill voice
     was that of an Englishman—is sure of this. Does not understand the English language, but judges
     by the intonation.</p>
    <p><hi rend="italic">Alberto Montani</hi>, confectioner, deposes that he was among the first to
     ascend the stairs. Heard the voices in question. The gruff voice was that of a Frenchman.
     Distinguished several words. The speaker appeared to be expostulating. Could not make out the
     words of the shrill voice. Spoke quick and unevenly. Thinks it the voice of a Russian.
     Corroborates the general testimony. Is an Italian. Never conversed with a native of Russia.</p>
    <p>Several witnesses recalled, here testified that the chimneys of all the rooms on the fourth
     story were too narrow to admit the passage of a human being. By 'sweeps' were meant cylindrical
     sweeping brushes, such as are employed by those who clean chimneys. These brushes were passed
     up and down every flue in the house. There is no back passage by which any one could have
     descended while the party proceeded up stairs. The body of Mademoiselle L'Espanaye was so
     firmly wedged in the chimney that it could not be got down until four or five of the party
     united their strength.</p>
    <p><hi rend="italic">Paul Dumas</hi>, physician, deposes that he was called to view the bodies
     about day-break. They were both then lying on the sacking of the bedstead in the chamber where
     Mademoiselle L. was found. The corpse of the young lady was much bruised and excoriated. The
     fact that it had been thrust up the chimney would sufficiently account for these appearances.
     The throat was greatly chafed. There were several deep scratches just below the chin, together
     with a series of livid spots which were evidently the impression of fingers. The face was
     fearfully discolored, and the eye-balls protruded. The tongue had been partially bitten
     through. A large bruise was discovered upon the pit of the stomach, produced apparently by the
     pressure of a knee. In the opinion of M. Dumas, Mademoiselle L'Espanaye had been throttled to
     death by some person or persons unknown. The corpse of the mother was horribly mutilated. All
     the bones of the right leg and arm were more or less shattered. The left tibia much splintered,
     as well as all the ribs of the left side. Whole body dreadfully bruised and discolored. It was
     not possible to say how the injuries had been inflicted. A heavy club of wood, or a broad bar
     of iron, a chair, any large heavy and obtuse weapon, would have produced such results, if
     wielded by the hands of a very powerful man. No woman could have inflicted the blows with any
     weapon. The head of the deceased, when seen by witness, was entirely separated from the body,
     and was also greatly shattered. The throat had evidently been cut with some very sharp
     instrument—probably with a razor.</p>
    <p><hi rend="italic">Alexandre Etienne</hi>, surgeon, was called with M. Dumas to view the
     bodies. Corroborated the testimony, and the opinions, of M. Dumas.</p>
    <p>Nothing farther of importance was elicited, although several other persons were examined. A
     murder so mysterious, and so perplexing in all its particulars, was never before committed in
     Paris—if indeed a murder has been committed at all. The police are entirely at fault—an unusual
     occurrence in affairs of this nature. There is not, however, the shadow of a clew
     apparent."</p>
    <p>The evening edition of the paper stated that the greatest excitement still continued in the
     Quartier St. Roch—that the premises in question had been carefully re-searched, and fresh
     examinations of witnesses instituted, but all to no purpose. A postscript, however, mentioned
     that Adolphe Le Bon had been arrested and imprisoned—although nothing appeared to criminate
     him, beyond the facts already detailed.</p>
    <p>Dupin seemed singularly interested in the progress of this affair—at least so I judged from
     his manner, for he made no comments whatever. It was only after the announcement that Le Bon
     had been imprisoned, that he asked me my opinion respecting it.</p>
    <p>I could merely agree with all Paris in considering it an insoluble mystery. I saw no means by
     which it would be possible to trace the murderer.</p>
    <p>"We must not judge of the means," said Dupin, "by this shell of an examination. The Parisian
     police, so much extolled for acumen, are cunning, but no more. There is no method in their
     proceedings, beyond the method of the moment. They make a vast parade of measures; but not
     unfrequently these are so illy adapted to the objects proposed, as to put us in mind of
     Monsieur Jourdain's calling for his <ref target="robe_" corresp="robe"><hi rend="italic"
       >robe-de-chambre-pour mieux entendre la musique</hi>.</ref> The results attained by them are
     not unfrequently surprising, but, for the most part, are brought about by simple diligence and
     activity. When these qualities are unavailing their schemes fail. <ref target="vidocq_"
      corresp="vidocq">Vidocq</ref>, for example, was a good guesser, and a persevering man. But,
     without educated thought, he erred continually by the very intensity of his investigations. He
     impaired his vision by holding the object too close. He might see, perhaps, one or two points
     with unusual clearness, but in so doing he necessarily lost sight of the matter, as a whole.
     Thus there is such a thing as being too profound. Truth is not always in a well. In fact as
     regards the more important knowledge I do believe that she is invariably superficial. The <pb
      n="172" facs="pageImages/Murders_172.jpg"/>depth lies in the valleys where we seek her and not
     upon the mountain tops where she is found. The modes and sources of this kind of error are well
     typified in the contemplation of the heavenly bodies. To look at a star by glances—to view it
     in a side-long way by turning toward it the exterior portions of the retina (more susceptible
     of feeble impressions of light than the interior) is to behold the star distinctly—is to have
     the best appreciation of its lustre—a lustre which grows dim just in proportion as we turn our
     vision <hi rend="italic">fully</hi> upon it. A greater number of rays actually fall upon the
     eye in the latter case, but in the former there is the more refined capacity for comprehension.
     By undue profundity we perplex and enfeeble thought—and it is possible to make even Venus
     herself vanish from the firmanent by a scrutiny too sustained, too concentrated, and too
     direct.</p>
    <p>"As for these murders, let us enter into some examinations for ourselves, before we make up
     an opinion respecting them. An inquiry will afford us amusement," [I thought this an odd term,
     so applied, but said nothing] "and, besides, Le Bon once rendered me a service for which I am
     not ungrateful. We will go and see the premises with our own eyes. I know G—, the <hi
      rend="italic">Prefect de Police</hi>, and shall have no difficulty in obtaining the necessary
     permission."</p>
    <p>The permission was obtained, and we proceeded at once to the Rue Morgue. This is one of those
     miserable thoroughfares which intervene between the Rue Richelieu and the Rue St. Roch. It was
     late in the afternoon when we reached it, for this quarter is at a great distance from that in
     which we resided. The house was readily found; for there were still many persons gazing up at
     the closed shutters, with an objectless curiosity, from the opposite side of the way. It was an
     ordinary Parisian house, with a gateway, on one side of which was a glazed watch-box, with a
     sliding panel in the window, indicating a <ref target="loge_" corresp="loge"><hi rend="italic"
       >loge de concierge</hi>.</ref> Before going in we walked up the street, turned down an alley,
     and then, again turning, passed in the rear of the building—Dupin, meanwhile, examining the
     whole neighborhood, as well as the house, with a minuteness of attention for which I could see
     no possible object.</p>
    <p>Retracing our steps, we came again to the front of the dwelling, rang, and, having shown our
     credentials, were admitted by the agents in charge. We went up stairs—into the chamber where
     the body of Mademoiselle L'Espanaye had been found, and where both the deceased still lay. The
     disorders of the room had as usual been suffered to exist. I saw nothing beyond what had been
     stated in the "Tribunal." Dupin scrutinized every thing, not excepting the bodies of the
     victims. We then went into the other rooms, and into the yard; a gendarme accompanying us
     throughout. Our examination occupied us until dark, when we took our departure. On our way home
     my companion stepped in for a moment at the office of one of the daily papers.</p>
    <p>I have said that the whims of my friend were manifold, and that—<hi rend="italic">Je les
      menagais</hi>—for this phrase there is no English equivalent. It was his humor now to decline
     all conversation on the subject of the murder, until after we had talem a bottle of wine
     together about noon the next day. He then asked me, suddenly, if I had observed any thing <hi
      rend="italic">peculiar</hi> at the scene of the atrocity.</p>
    <p>There was something in his manner of emphasizing the word "peculiar," which caused me to
     shudder, without knowing why.</p>
    <p>"No, nothing <hi rend="italic"> peculiar,</hi>" I said, "nothing more, at least, than we both
     saw stated in the paper."</p>
    <p> "'Le Tribunal," he replied, "has not entered, I fear, into the unusual horror of the thing.
     But we will not revert to the idle opinions of this print. It appears to me that this mystery
     is considered insoluble, for the very reason which should cause it to be regarded as easy of
     solution—I mean for the <ref target="outre_" corresp="outre"><hi rend="italic">outré
      </hi></ref> character of its features. The police are confounded by the seeming absence of
     motive—not for the murder itself—but for the atrocity of the murder. They are puzzled, too, by
     the seeming impossibility of reconciling the voices heard in contention, with the facts that no
     one was discovered up stairs but the assassinated Mademoiselle L'Espanaye, and that there were
     no means of egress without the notice of the party ascending. The wild disorder of the room;
     the corpse thrust with the head downward up the chimney; the frightful mutilation of the body
     of the old lady; these considerations, with those just mentioned, and others which I need not
     mention, have sufficed to paralyze the powers, by putting completely at fault the boasted <hi
      rend="italic">acumen,</hi> of the government agents. They have fallen into the gross but
     common error of confounding the unusual with the abstruse. But it is by these deviations from
     the plane of the ordinary, that reason feels its way, if at all, in its search for the true. In
     investigations such as we are now pursuing, it should not be so much asked 'what has occurred,'
     as 'what has occurred that has never occurred before.' In fact, the facility with which I shall
     arrive, or have arrived, at the solution of this mystery, is in the direct ratio of its
     apparent insolubility in the eyes of the police."</p>
    <p>I stared at the speaker in mute astonishment. He continued .</p>
    <p>"I am now awaiting," continued he, looking toward the door of our apartment—"I am now
     awaiting a person who, although perhaps not the perpetrator of these butcheries, must have been
     in some measure implicated in their perpetration. Of the worst portion of the crimes committed,
     it is probable that he is innocent. I hope that I am right in this supposition; for upon it I
     build my expectation of reading the entire riddle. I look for the man here—in this room—every
     moment. It is true that he may not arrive; but the probability is that he will. Should he come,
     it will be necessary to detain him. Here are pistols; and we both know how to use them when
     occasion demands their use."</p>
    <p>I took the pistols, scarcely knowing what I did, or believing what I heard, while Dupin went
     on, very much as if in a soliloquy. I have already spoken of his abstract manner at such times.
     His discourse was addressed to myself; but his voice, although by no means loud, had that
     intonation which is commonly employed in speaking to some <pb n="173"
      facs="pageImages/Murders_173.jpg"/>one at a great distance. His eyes, vacant in expression,
     regarded only the wall.</p>
    <p>"That the voices heard in contention," he said, "by the party upon the stairs, were not the
     voices of the women themselves, was fully proved by the evidence. This relieves us of all doubt
     upon the question whether the old lady could have first destroyed the daughter and afterward
     have committed suicide. I speak of this point chiefly for the sake of method; for the strength
     of Madame L'Espanaye would have been utterly unequal to the task of thrusting her daughter's
     corpse up the chimney as it was found; and the nature of the wounds upon her own person
     entirely preclude the idea of self-destruction. Murder, then, has been committed by some third
     party; and the voices of this third party were those heard in contention. Let me now advert—not
     to the whole testimony respecting these voices—but to what was peculiar in that testimony. Did
     you observe anything peculiar about it?"</p>
    <p>I remarked that, while all the witnesses agreed in supposing the gruff voice to be that of a
     Frenchman, there was much disagreement in regard to the shrill, or, as one individual termed
     it, the harsh voice.</p>
    <p>"That was the evidence itself," said Dupin, "but it was not the peculiarity of the evidence.
     You have observed nothing distinctive. Yet there<hi rend="italic"> was </hi> something to be
     observed. The witnesses, as you remark, agreed about the gruff voice; they were here unanimous.
     But in regard to the shrill voice, the peculiarity is—not that they disagreed—but that, while
     an Italian, an Englishman, a Spaniard, a Hollander, and a Frenchman attempted to describe it,
     each one spoke of it as that <hi rend="italic">of a foreigner.</hi> Each is sure that it was
     not the voice of one of his own countrymen. Each likens it—not to the voice of an individual of
     any nation with whose language he is conversant—but the converse. The Frenchman supposes it the
     voice of a Spaniard, and 'might have distinguished some words <hi rend="italic">had he been
      acquainted with the Spanish.' </hi> The Dutchman maintains it to have been that of a
     Frenchman; but we find it stated that <hi rend="italic">'not understanding French this witness
      was examined through an interpreter.'</hi> The Englishman thinks it the voice of a German,
      and<hi rend="italic"> 'does not understand German.'</hi> The Spaniard 'is sure' that it was
     that of an Englishman, but 'judges by the intonation' altogether, <hi rend="italic">'as he has
      no knowledge of the English.'</hi> The Italian believes it the voice of a Russian, but <hi
      rend="italic">'has never conversed with a native of Russia.'</hi> A second Frenchman differs,
     moreover, with the first, and is positive that the voice was that of an Italian; but, <hi
      rend="italic">not being cognizant of that tongue,</hi> is, like the Spaniard, 'convinced by
     the intonation.' Now, how strangely unusual must that voice have really been, about which such
     testimony as this <hi rend="italic">could </hi> have been elicited!—in whose <hi rend="italic"
      >tones,</hi> even, denizens of the five great divisions of Europe could recognise nothing
     familiar! You will say that it might have been the voice of an Asiatic—of an African. Neither
     Asiatics nor Africans abound in Paris; but, without denying the inference, I will now merely
     call your attention to three points. The voice is termed by one witness 'harsh rather than
     shrill.' It is represented by two others to have been 'quick and <hi rend="italic"
      >unequal.'</hi> No words—no sounds resembling words—were by any witness mentioned as
     distinguishable.</p>
    <p>"I know not," continued Dupin, "what impression I may have made, so far, upon your own
     understanding; but I do not hesitate to say that legitimate deductions even from this portion
     of the testimony—the portion respecting the gruff and shrill voices —are in themselves
     sufficient to engender a suspicion which should give direction to all farther progress in the
     investigation of the mystery. I said 'legitimate deductions;' but my meaning is not thus fully
     expressed. I designed to imply that the deductions are the <hi rend="italic">sole</hi> proper
     ones, and that the suspicion arises <hi rend="italic">inevitably</hi> from them as the single
     result. What the suspicion is, however, I will not say just yet. I merely wish you to bear in
     mind that, with myself, it was sufficiently forcible to give a definite form—a certain
     tendency—to my inquiries in the chamber.</p>
    <p>"Let us now transport ourselves, in fancy, to this chamber. What shall we first seek here?
     The means of egress employed by the murderers. It is not too much to say that neither of us
     believe in præternatural events. Madame and Mademoiselle L'Espanaye were not destroyed by
     spirits. The doers of the deed were material, and escaped materially. Then how? Fortunately,
     there is but one mode of reasoning upon the point, and that mode <hi rend="italic">must</hi>
     lead us to a definite decision.—Let us examine, each by each, the possible means of egress. It
     is clear that the assassins were in the room where Mademoiselle L'Espanaye was found, or at
     least in the room adjoining, when the party ascended the stairs. It is then only from these two
     apartments that we have to seek issues. The police have laid bare the floors, the ceilings, and
     the masonry of the walls, in every direction. No <hi rend="italic">secret</hi> issues could
     have escaped their vigilance. But, not trusting to<hi rend="italic">their</hi> eyes, I examined
     with my own. There were, then, no secret issues. Both doors leading from the rooms into the
     passage were securely locked, with the keys inside. Let us turn to the chimneys. These,
     although of ordinary width for some eight or ten feet above the hearths, will not admit,
     throughout their extent, the body of a large cat. The impossibility of egress, by means already
     stated, being thus absolute, we are reduced to the windows. Through those of the front room no
     one could have escaped without notice from the crowd in the street. The murderers <hi
      rend="italic">must</hi> have passed, then, through those of the back room. Now, brought to
     this conclusion in so unequivocal a manner as we are, it is not our part, as reasoners, to
     reject it on account of apparent impossibilities. It is only left for us to prove that these
     apparent 'impossibilities' are, in reality, not such.</p>
    <p> "There are two windows in the chamber. One of them is unobstructed by furniture, and is
     wholly visible. The lower portion of the other is hidden from view by the head of the unwieldy
     bedstead which is thrust close up against it. The former<pb n="174"
      facs="pageImages/Murders_174.jpg"/>was found securely fastened from within. It resisted the
     utmost force of those who endeavored to raise it. A large gimlet-hole had been pierced in its
     frame to the left, and a very stout nail was found fitted therein, nearly to the head. Upon
     examining the other window, a similar nail was seen similarly fitted in it; and a vigorous
     attempt to raise this sash, failed also. The police were now entirely satisfied that egress had
     not been in these directions. And, <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi>, it was thought a matter of
     supererogation to withdraw the nails and open the windows.</p>
    <p>"My own examination was somewhat more particular, and was so for the reason I have just
     given—because here it was, I knew, that all apparent impossibilities <hi rend="italic"
      >must</hi> be proved to be not such in reality.</p>
    <p>"I proceeded to think thus—<ref target="posteriori_" corresp="posteriori"><hi rend="italic">a
       posteriori</hi></ref>. The murderers <hi rend="italic">did </hi> escape from one of these
     windows. This being so, they could not have refastened the sashes from the inside, as they were
     found fastened,—(the consideration which put a stop, through its obviousness, to the scrutiny
     of the police in this quarter). Yet the sashes <hi rend="italic"> were </hi> fastened. They <hi
      rend="italic">must,</hi> then, have the power of fastening themselves. There was no escape
     from this conclusion. I stepped to the unobstructed casement, withdrew the nail with some
     difficulty and attempted to raise the sash. It resisted all my efforts, as I had anticipated. A
     concealed spring must, I now know, exist; and this corroboration of my idea convinced me that
     my premises at least, were correct, however mysterious still appeared the circumstances
     attending the nails. A careful search soon brought to light the hidden spring. I pressed it,
     and, satisfied with the discovery, forbore to upraise the sash.</p>
    <p>"I now replaced the nail and regarded it attentively. A person passing out through this
     window might have reclosed it, and the spring would have caught—but the nail could not have
     been replaced. The conclusion was plain, and again narrowed in the field of my investigations.
     The assassins <hi rend="italic">must</hi> have escaped through the other window. Supposing,
     then, the springs upon each sash to be the same, as was probable, there <hi rend="italic"
      >must</hi> be found a difference between the nails, or at least between the modes of their
     fixture. Getting upon the sacking of the bedstead, I looked over the head-board minutely at the
     second casement. Passing my hand down behind the board, I readily discovered and pressed the
     spring, which was, as I had supposed, identical in character with its neighbor. I now looked at
     the nail. It was as stout as the other, and apparently fitted in the same manner—driven in
     nearly up to the head.</p>
    <p> "You will say that I was puzzled; but if you think so you must have misunderstood the nature
     of the inductions. To use a sporting phrase, I had not been once 'at fault.' The scent had
     never for an instant been lost. There was no flaw in any link of the chain. I had traced the
     secret to its ultimate result,—and that result was <hi rend="italic">the nail</hi>. It had, I
     say, in every respect, the appearance of its fellow in the other window; but this fact was an
     absolute nullity (conclusive us it might seem to be) when compared with the consideration that
     here, at this point, terminated the clew. 'There <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be something
     wrong,' I said, 'about the nail.' I touched it; and the head, with about a quarter of an inch
     of the shank, came off in my fingers. The rest of the shank was in the gimlet-hole where it had
     been broken off. The fracture was an old one (for its edges were incrusted with rust), and had
     apparently been accomplished by the blow of a hammer, which had partially imbedded, in the top
     of the bottom sash, the head portion of the nail. I now carefully replaced this head portion in
     the indentation whence I had taken it, and the resemblance to a perfect nail was complete—the
     fissure was invisible. Pressing the spring, I gently raised the sash for a few inches; the head
     went up with it, remaining firm in its bed. I closed the window, and the semblance of the whole
     nail was again perfect.</p>
    <p>"The riddle, so far, was now unriddled. The assassin had escaped through the window which
     looked upon the bed. Dropping of its own accord upon his exit (or perhaps purposely closed by
     them) it had become fastened by the spring; and it was the retention of this spring which had
     been mistaken by the police for that of the nail,—farther inquiry being thus considered
     unnecessary.</p>
    <p>"The next question is that of the mode of descent. Upon this point I had been satisfied in my
     walk with you around the building. About five feet and a half from the casement in question
     there runs a lightning-rod. From this rod it would have been impossible for any one to reach
     the window itself, to say nothing of entering it. I observed, however, that the shutters of the
     fourth story were of the peculiar kind called by Parisian carpenters <hi rend="italic"
      >ferrades</hi>—a kind rarely employed at the present day, but frequently seen upon very old
     mansions at Lyons and Bourdeaux. They are in the form of an ordinary door, (a single, not a
     folding door) except that the lower half is latticed or worked in open trellis—thus affording
     an excellent hold for the hands. In the present instance these shutters are fully three feet
     and a half broad. When we saw them from the rear of the house, they were both about half
     open—that is to say, they stood off at right angles from the wall. It is probable that the
     police, as well as myself, examined the back of the tenement; but, if so, in looking at these
      <hi rend="italic">ferrades</hi> in the line of their breadth (as they must have done), they
     did not perceive this great breadth itself, or, at all events, failed to take it into due
     consideration. In fact, having once satisfied themselves that no egress could have been made in
     this quarter, they would naturally bestow here a very cursory examination. It was clear to me,
     however, that the shutter belonging to the window at the head of the bed, would, if swung fully
     back to the wall, reach to within two feet of the lightning-rod. It was also evident that, by
     exertion of a very unusual degree of activity and courage, an entrance into the window, from
     the rod, might have been thus effected.—By reaching to the distance of two feet and a half (we
     now suppose the shutter open to its whole extent) a robber might have taken a firm grasp upon
     the trellis-work. Letting go, then, his hold upon the rod, placing his feet securely against
     the wall, and springing boldly from it, he might have swung the shutter so as to close it, and,
     if we imagine the window open at the time, might even have swung himself into the room.</p>
    <pb n="175" facs="pageImages/Murders_175.jpg"/>
    <p>"I wish you to bear especially in mind that I have spoken of a <hi rend="italic">very</hi>
     unusual degree of activity as requisite to success in so hazardous and so difficult a feat. It
     is my design to show you, first, that the thing might possibly have been accomplished:—but,
     secondly and <hi rend="italic">chiefly</hi>,I wish to impress upon your understanding the <hi
      rend="italic">very extraordinary</hi>—the almost præternatural character of that agility which
     could have accomplished it.</p>
    <p>"You will say, no doubt, using the language of the law, that 'to make out my case,' I should
     rather undervalue, than insist upon a full estimation of the activity required in this matter.
     This may be the practice in law, but it is not the usage of reason. My ultimate object is only
     the truth. My immediate purpose is to lead you to place in juxta-position, that <hi
      rend="italic">very unusual</hi> activity of which I have just spoken with that <hi
      rend="italic">very peculiar</hi> shrill (or harsh) and <hi rend="italic"> unequal</hi> voice,
     about whose nationality no two persons could be found to agree, and in whose utterance no
     syllabification could be detected."</p>
    <p>At these words a vague and half-formed conception of the meaning of Dupin flitted over my
     mind. I seemed to be upon the verge of comprehension without power to comprehend—men, at times,
     find themselves upon the brink of remembrance without being able, in the end, to remember. My
     friend went on with his discourse.</p>
    <p>"You will see," he said, "that I have shifted the question from the mode of egress to that of
     ingress. It was my design to convey the idea that both were effected in the same manner, at the
     same point. Let us now revert to the interior of the room. Let us survey the appearances here.
     The drawers of the bureau, it is said, had been rifled, although many articles of apparel still
     remained within them. The conclusion here is absurd. It is a mere guess—a very silly one—and no
     more. How are we to know that the articles found in the drawers were not all these drawers had
     originally contained? Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter lived an exceedingly retired life—saw
     no company—seldom went out—had little use for numerous changes of habiliment. Those found were
     at least of as good quality as any likely to be possessed by these ladies. If a thief had taken
     any, why did he not take the best—why did he not take all? In a word, why did he abandon four
     thousand francs in gold to encumber himself with a bundle of linen? The gold <hi rend="italic"
      >was</hi> abandoned. Nearly the whole sum mentioned by Monsieur Mignaud, the banker, was
     discovered, in bags, upon the floor. I wish you, therefore, to discard from your thoughts the
     blundering idea of <hi rend="italic">motive</hi>, engendered in the brains of the police by
     that portion of the evidence which speaks of money delivered at the door of the house.
     Coincidences ten times as remarkable as this (the delivery of the money, and murder committed
     within three days upon the party receiving it), happen to all of us every hour of our lives,
     without attracting even momentary notice. Coincidences, in general, are great stumbling-blocks
     in the way of that class of thinkers who have been educated to know nothing of the theory of
     probabilities—that theory to which the most glorious objects of human research are indebted for
     the most glorious of illustration. In the present instance, had the gold been gone, the fact of
     its delivery three days before would have formed something more than a coincidence. It would
     have been corroborative of this idea of motive. But, under the real circumstances of the case,
     if we are to suppose gold the motive of this outrage, we must also imagine the perpetrator so
     vacillating an idiot as to have abandoned his gold and his motive together.</p>
    <p>"Keeping now steadily in mind the points to which I have drawn your attention—that peculiar
     voice, that unusual agility, and that startling absence of motive in a murder so singularly
     atrocious as this—let us glance at the butchery itself. Here is a woman strangled to death by
     manual strength, and thrust up a chimney, head downward. Ordinary assassins employ no such
     modes of murder as this. Least of all, do they thus dispose of the murdered. In the manner of
     thrusting the corpse up the chimney, you will admit that there was something <hi rend="italic"
      >excessively outré</hi>—something altogether irreconcilable with our common notions of human
     action, even when we suppose the actors the most depraved of men. Think, too, how great must
     have been that strength which could have thrust the body <hi rend="italic">up</hi> such an
     aperture so forcibly that the united vigor of several persons was found barely sufficient to
     drag it <hi rend="italic">down!</hi> "Turn, now, to other indications of the employment of a
     vigor most marvellous. On the hearth were thick tresses—very thick tresses—of grey human hair.
     These had been <hi rend="italic">torn out by the roots.</hi> You are aware of the great force
     necessary in tearing thus from the head even twenty or thirty hairs together. You saw the locks
     in question as well as myself. Their roots (a hideous sight!) were clotted with fragments of
     the flesh of the scalp—sure token of the prodigious power which had been exerted in uprooting
     perhaps half a million of hairs at a time. The throat of the old lady was not merely cut, but
     the head absolutely severed from the body: the instrument was a mere razor. I wish you also to
     look at the <hi rend="italic">brutal</hi> ferocity of these deeds. Of the bruises upon the body
     of Madame L'Espanaye I do not speak. Monsieur Dumas, and his worthy coadjutor Monsieur Etienne,
     have pronounced that they were inflicted by some obtuse instrument; and so far these gentlemen
     are very correct. The obtuse instrument was clearly the stone pavement in the yard, upon which
     the victim had fallen from the window which looked in upon the bed. This idea, however simple
     it may now seem, escaped the police for the same reason that the breadth of the shutters
     escaped them—because, by the affair of the nails, their perceptions had been hermetically
     sealed against the possibility of the windows having ever been opened at all.</p>
    <p>"If now, in addition to all these things, you have properly reflected upon the odd disorder
     of the chamber, we have gone so far as to combine the ideas of an agility astounding, a
     strength superhuman, a ferocity brutal, a butchery without motive, a <hi rend="italic"
      >grotesquerie</hi> in horror absolutely alien from humanity, and a voice foreign in tone to
     the ears of men <pb n="176" facs="pageImages/Murders_176.jpg"/>of many nations, and devoid of
     all distinct or intelligible syllabification. What result, then, has ensued? What impression
     have I made upon your fancy?"</p>
    <p>I shuddered as Dupin asked me the question. "A madman," I said, "has done this deed—some
     raving maniac, escaped from a neighboring <ref target="sante_" corresp="sante"><hi
       rend="italic">Maison de Santé</hi>."</ref>
    </p>
    <p>"In some respects," he replied, "your idea is not irrelevant. But the voices of madmen, even
     in their wildest paroxysms, are never found to tally with that peculiar voice heard upon the
     stairs. Madmen are of some nation, and their language, however incoherent in its words, has
     always the coherence of syllabification. Besides, the hair of a madman is not such as I now
     hold in my hand. I disentangled this little tuft from the rigidly clutched fingers of Madame
     L'Espanaye. Tell me what you can make of it."</p>
    <p>"Good God," I said, completely unnerved; "this hair is most unusual—this is no <hi
      rend="italic"> human</hi> hair."</p>
    <p>"I have not asserted that it is," said he, "but, before we decide this point, I wish you to
     glance at the little sketch I have here traced upon this paper. It is a fac-simile drawing of
     what has been described in one portion of the testimony as 'dark bruises, and deep indentations
     of finger nails,' upon the throat of Mademoiselle L'Espanaye, and in another, (by Messrs. Dumas
     and Etienne,) as a 'series of livid spots, evidently the impression of fingers.'</p>
    <p>"You will perceive," continued my friend, spreading out the paper upon the table before us,
     "you will perceive that this drawing gives the idea of a firm and fixed hold. There is no <hi
      rend="italic"> slipping</hi> apparent. Each finger has retained—possibly until the death of
     the victim—the fearful grasp by which it originally imbedded itself. Attempt now to place all
     your fingers, at the same time, in the respective impressions as you see them."</p>
    <p>I made the attempt in vain.</p>
    <p>"We are possibly not giving this matter a fair trial," he said. "The paper is spread out upon
     a plane surface; but the human throat is cylindrical. Here is a billet of wood, the
     circumference of which is about that of the throat. Wrap the drawing around it, and try the
     experiment again."</p>
    <p>I did so; but the difficulty was even more obvious than before. "This," I said, "is the mark
     of no human hand."</p>
    <p>"Assuredly it is not," replied Dupin; "read now this passage from <ref target="cuvier_"
      corresp="cuvier">Cuvier."</ref></p>
    <p>It was a minute anatomical and generally descriptive account of the large fulvous
     Ourang-Outang of the East Indian Islands. The gigantic stature, the prodigious strength and
     activity, the wild ferocity, and the imitative propensities of these mammalia are sufficiently
     well known to all. I understood the full horrors of the murder at once.</p>
    <p>"The description of the digits," said I, as I made an end of reading, "is in exact accordance
     with this drawing. I see that no animal but an Ourang Outang, of the species here mentioned,
     could have impressed the indentations as you have traced them. This tuft of tawny hair, too, is
     identical in character with that of the beast of Cuvier. But I cannot possibly comprehend the
     particulars of this frightful mystery. Besides, there were two voices heard in contention, and
     one of them was unquestionably the voice of a Frenchman."</p>
    <p>"True; and you will remember an expression attributed almost unanimously, by the evidence, to
     this voice,—the expression,<hi rend="italic"> 'mon Dieu!'</hi> This, under the circumstances,
     has been justly characterized by one of the witnesses (Montani, the confectioner,) as an
     expression of remonstrance or expostulation. Upon these two words, therefore, I have mainly
     built my hopes of a full solution of the riddle. A Frenchman was cognizant of the murder. It is
     possible—indeed it is far more than probable—that he was innocent of all participation in the
     bloody transactions which took place. The Ourang-Outang may have escaped from him. He may have
     traced it to the chamber; but, under the agitating circumstances which ensued, he could never
     have re-captured it. It is still at large. I will not pursue these guesses—for I have no right
     to call them more—since the shades of reflection upon which they are based are scarcely of
     sufficient depth to be appreciable by my own intellect, and since I could not pretend to make
     them intelligible to the understanding of another. We will call them guesses then, and speak of
     them as such. If the Frenchman in question is indeed, as I suppose, innocent of this atrocity,
     this advertisement which I left last night, upon our return home, at the office of 'Le Monde,'
     (a paper devoted to the shipping interest, and much sought by sailors,) will bring him to our
     residence."</p>
    <p>He handed me a paper, and I read thus:</p>
    <p>CAUGHT—<hi rend="italic">In the Bois de Boulogne, early in the morning of the—inst., (the
      morning of the murder,) a very large, tawny Ourang-Outang of the Bornese species. The owner,
      (who is ascertained to be a sailor, belonging to a Maltese vessel,) may have the animal again,
      upon identifying it satisfactorily, and paying a few charges arising from its capture and
      keeping. Call at No. — , Rue —, Faubourg St. Germain—au troisiême.</hi></p>
    <p>"How was it possible," I asked, "that you should know the man to be a sailor, and belonging
     to a Maltese vessel?"</p>
    <p>"I do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> know it," said Dupin. "I am not <hi rend="italic">sure</hi>
     of it. Here, however, is a small piece of ribbon, which from its form, and from its greasy
     appearance, has evidently been used in tying the hair in one of those long <hi rend="italic"
      >queues</hi> of which sailors are so fond. Moreover, this knot is one which few besides
     sailors can tie, and is peculiar to the Maltese. I picked the ribbon up at the foot of the
     lightning-rod. It could not have belonged to either of the deceased. Now if, after all, I am
     wrong in my induction from this ribbon, that the Frenchman was a sailor belonging to a Maltese
     vessel, still I can have done no harm in saying what I did in the advertisement. If I am in
     error, he will merely suppose that I have been misled by some circumstance into which he will
     not take the trouble to inquire. But if I am right, a great point is gained. Cognizant although
     innocent of the murder, the Frenchman will <pb n="177" facs="pageImages/Murders_177.jpg"
     />naturally hesitate about replying to the advertisement—about demanding the Ourang-Outang. He
     will reason thus:—'I am innocent; I am poor; my Ourang-Outang is of great value—to one in my
     circumstances a fortune of itself—why should I lose it through idle apprehensions of danger?
     Here it is, within my grasp. It was found in the <ref target="bois_" corresp="bois">Bois de
      Boulogne</ref>—at a vast distance from the scene of that butchery. How can it ever be
     suspected that a brute beast should have done the deed? The police are at fault—they have
     failed to procure the slightest clew. Should they even trace the animal, it would be impossible
     to prove me cognizant of the murder, or to implicate me in guilt on account of that cognizance.
     Above all, <hi rend="italic">I am known</hi>. The advertiser designates me as the possessor of
     the beast. I am not sure to what limit his knowledge may extend. Should I avoid claiming a
     property of so great value, which it is known that I possess, I will render the animal at
     least, liable to suspicion. It is not my policy to attract attention either to myself or to the
     beast. I will answer the advertisement, get the Ourang-Outang, and keep it close until this
     matter has blown over.'"</p>
    <p>At this moment we heard a step upon the stairs.</p>
    <p>"Be ready," said Dupin, "with your pistols, but neither use them nor show them until at a
     signal from myself."</p>
    <p>The front door of the house had been left open, and the visiter had entered, without ringing,
     and advanced several steps upon the staircase. Now, however, he seemed to hesitate. Presently
     we heard him descending. Dupin was moving quickly to the door, when we again heard him coming
     up. He did not turn back a second time, but stepped up with decision, and rapped at the door of
     our chamber.</p>
    <p>"Come in," said Dupin, in a cheerful and hearty tone.</p>
    <p>The visiter entered. He was a sailor, evidently,—a tall, stout, and muscular-looking person,
     with a certain dare-devil expression of countenance, not altogether unprepossessing. His face,
     greatly sunburnt, was more than half hidden by whisker and <hi rend="italic"> mustachio</hi>.
     He had with him a huge <ref target="cudgel_" corresp="cudgel">oaken cudgel</ref>, but appeared
     to be otherwise unarmed. He bowed awkwardly, and bade us "good evening," in French accents,
     which, although somewhat Neufchatelish, were still sufficiently indicative of a Parisian
     origin.</p>
    <p>"Sit down, my friend," said Dupin. "I suppose you have called about the Ourang-Outang. Upon
     my word, I almost envy you the possession of him; a remarkably fine, and no doubt a very
     valuable animal. How old do you suppose him to be?"</p>
    <p>The sailor drew a long breath, with the air of a man relieved of some intolerable burden, and
     then replied, in an assured tone,—</p>
    <p>"I have no way of telling—but he can't be more than four or five years old. Have you got him
     here?"</p>
    <p>"Oh no, we had no conveniences for keeping him here. He is at a livery stable in the Rue
     Dubourg, just by. You can get him in the morning. Of course you are prepared to identify the
     property?"</p>
    <p>"To be sure I am, sir."</p>
    <p>"I shall be sorry to part with him," said Dupin.</p>
    <p>"I don't mean that you should be at all this trouble for nothing, sir," said the man.
     "Couldn't expect it. Am very willing to pay a reward for the finding of the animal—that is to
     say, any thing in reason."</p>
    <p>"Well," replied my friend, "that is all very fair, to be sure. Let me think!—what should I
     have? Oh! I will tell you. My reward shall be this. You shall give me all the information in
     your power about these murders in the Rue Morgue."</p>
    <p>Dupin said the last words in a very low tone, and very quietly. Just as quietly, too, he
     walked toward the door, locked it and put the key in his pocket. He then drew a pistol from his
     bosom and placed it, without the least flurry, upon the table.</p>
    <p>The sailor's face flushed up as if he were struggling with suffocation. He started to his
     feet and grasped his cudgel, but the next moment he fell back into his seat, trembling
     violently, and with the countenance of death itself. He spoke not a word. I pitied him from the
     bottom of my heart.</p>
    <p>"My friend," said Dupin, in a kind tone, "you are alarming yourself unnecessarily—you are
     indeed. We mean you no harm whatever. I pledge you the honor of a gentleman, and of a
     Frenchman, that we intend you no injury. I perfectly well know that you are innocent of the
     atrocities in the Rue Morgue. It will not do, however, to deny that you are in some measure
     implicated in them. From what I have already said, you must know that I have had means of
     information about this matter—means of which you could never have dreamed. Now the thing stands
     thus. You have done nothing which you could have avoided—nothing, certainly, which renders you
     culpable. You were not even guilty of robbery, when you might have robbed with impunity. You
     have nothing to conceal. You have no reason for concealment. On the other hand, you are bound
     by every principle of honor to confess all you know. An innocent man is now imprisoned, charged
     with that crime of which you can point out the perpetrator."</p>
    <p>The sailor had recovered his presence of mind, in a great measure, while Dupin uttered these
     words; but his original boldness of bearing was all gone.</p>
    <p>"So help me God," said he, after a brief pause, "I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> tell you all I
     know about this affair;—but I do not expect you to believe one half I say—I would be a fool
     indeed if I did. Still, I am innocent, and I will make a clean breast if I die for it."</p>
    <p>What he stated was, in substance, this. He had lately made a voyage to the Indian
     Archipelago. A party, of which he formed one, landed at Borneo, and passed into the interior on
     an excursion of pleasure. Himself and a companion had captured the Ourang-Outang. This
     companion dying, the animal fell into his own exclusive possession. After great trouble,
     occasioned by the intractable ferocity of his captive during the home voyage, he at length
     succeeded in lodging it safely at his own residence in <pb n="178"
      facs="pageImages/Murders_178.jpg"/>Paris, where, not to attract toward himself the unpleasant
     curiosity of his neighbors, he kept it carefully secluded, until such time as it should recover
     from a wound in the foot, received from a splinter on board ship. His ultimate design was to
     sell it.</p>
    <p>Returning home from some sailors' frolic the night, or rather in the morning of the murder,
     he found the beast occupying his own bed-room, into which it had broken from a closet
     adjoining, where it had been, as was thought, securely confined. Razor in hand, and fully
     lathered, it was sitting before a looking-glass, attempting the operation of shaving, in which
     it had no doubt previously watched its master through the key-hole of the closet. Terrified at
     the sight of so dangerous a weapon in the possession of an animal so ferocious, and so well
     able to use it, the man, for some moments, was at a loss what to do. He had been accustomed,
     however, to quiet the creature, even in its fiercest moods, by the use of a whip, and to this
     he now resorted. Upon sight of it, the Ourang-Outang sprang at once through the door of the
     chamber, down the stairs, and thence, through a window, unfortunately open, into the
     street.</p>
    <p>The Frenchman followed in despair; the ape, razor still in hand, occasionally stopping to
     look back and gesticulate at its pursuer, until the latter had nearly come up with it. It then
     again made off. In this manner the chase continued for a long time. The streets were profoundly
     quiet, as it was nearly three o'clock in the morning. In passing down an alley in the rear of
     the Rue Morgue, the fugitive's attention was arrested by a light gleaming from the open window
     of Madame L'Espanaye's chamber, in the fourth story of her house. Rushing to the building, it
     perceived the lightning rod, clambered up with inconceivable agility, grasped the shutter,
     which was thrown fully back against the wall, and, by its means, swung itself directly upon the
     headboard of the bed. The whole feat did not occupy a minute. The shutter was kicked open again
     by the Ourang-Outang as it entered the room.</p>
    <p>The sailor, in the meantime, was both rejoiced and perplexed. He had strong hopes of now
     recapturing the brute, as it could scarcely escape from the trap into which it had ventured,
     except by the rod, where it might be intercepted as it came down. On the other hand, there was
     much cause for anxiety as to what it might do in the house. This latter reflection urged the
     man still to follow the fugitive. A lightning rod is ascended without difficulty, especially by
     a sailor; but, when he had arrived as high as the window, which lay far to his left, his career
     was stopped; the most that he could accomplish was to reach over so as to obtain a glimpse of
     the interior of the room. At this glimpse he nearly fell from his hold through excess of
     horror. Now it was that those hideous shrieks arose upon the night, which had startled from
     slumber the inmates of the Rue Morgue. Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter, habited in their
     night clothes, had apparently been occupied in arranging some papers in the iron chest already
     mentioned, which had been wheeled into the middle of the room. It was open, and its contents
     lay beside it on the floor. The victims must have been sitting with their backs toward the
     window; and, from the time elapsing between the ingress of the beast and the screams, it seems
     probable that it was not immediately perceived. The flapping-to of the shutter would naturally
     have been attributed to the wind.</p>
    <p>As the sailor looked in, the gigantic animal had seized Madame L'Espanaye by the hair, (which
     was loose, as she had been combing it,) and was flourishing the razor about her face, in
     imitation of the motions of a barber. The daughter lay prostrate and motionless; she had
     swooned. The screams and struggles of the old lady (during which the hair was torn from her
     head) had the effect of changing the probably pacific purposes of the Ourang-Outang into those
     of wrath. With one determined sweep of its muscular arm it nearly severed her head from her
     body. The sight of blood inflamed its anger into phrenzy. Gnashing its teeth, and flashing fire
     from its eyes, it flew upon the body of the girl, and imbedded its fearful talons in her
     throat, retaining its grasp until she expired. Its wandering and wild glances fell at this
     moment upon the head of the bed, over which the face of its master, rigid with horror, was just
     discernible. The fury of the beast, who no doubt bore still in mind the dreaded whip, was
     instantly converted into fear. Conscious of having deserved punishment, it seemed desirous of
     concealing its bloody deeds, and skipped about the chamber in an agony of nervous agitation;
     throwing down and breaking the furniture as it moved, and dragging the bed from the bedstead.
     In conclusion, it seized first the corpse of the daughter, and thrust it up the chimney, as it
     was found; then that of the old lady, with which he rushed to the window, precipitating it
     immediately therefrom.</p>
    <p>As the ape approached the casement with its mutilated burden, the sailor shrank aghast to the
     rod, and, rather gliding than clambering down it, hurried at once home—dreading the
     consequences of the butchery, and gladly abandoning, in his terror, all solicitude about the
     fate of the Ourang-Outang. The words heard by the party upon the staircase were the Frenchman's
     exclamations of horror and affright, commingled with the fiendish jabberings of the brute.</p>
    <p>I have scarcely anything to add. The Ourang-Outang must have escaped from the chamber, by the
     rod, just before the break of the door. It must have closed the window as it passed through it.
     It was subsequently caught by the owner himself, who obtained for it a very large sum at the
      <ref target="jardin_" corresp="jardin"><hi rend="italic">Jardin des Plantes</hi></ref>. Le Don
     was instantly released, upon our narration of the circumstances (with some comments from Dupin)

     conceal his chagrin at the turn which affairs had taken, and was fain to indulge in a sarcasm
     or two, about the propriety of every person minding his own business.</p>
    <p>"Let him talk," said Dupin, who had not thought it necessary to reply. "Let him discourse; it
     will ease his conscience, I am satisfied with having <pb n="179"
