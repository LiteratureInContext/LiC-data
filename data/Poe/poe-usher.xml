      <div>
        <p>During the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the year, when the
          clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback,
          through a singularly dreary tract of country; and at length found myself, as the shades of
          the evening drew on, within view of the melancholy House of Usher. I know not how it
          was—but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my
          spirit. I say insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that
          half-pleasurable, because poetic, sentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the
          sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible. I looked upon the scene before
          me—upon the mere house, and the simple landscape features of the domain—upon the bleak
          walls—upon the vacant eye-like windows—upon a few rank sedges—and upon a few white trunks
          of decayed trees—with an utter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly
          sensation more properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opium—the bitter
          lapse into common life—the hideous dropping off of the veil. There was an iciness, a
          sinking, a sickening of the heart—an unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of
          the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime. What was it— I paused to
          think—what was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the House of Usher? It was a
          mystery all insoluble; nor could I grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me
          as I pondered. I was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion, that while,
          beyond doubt, there <hi rend="italic">are</hi> combinations of very simple natural objects
          which have the power of thus affecting us, still the reason, and the analysis, of this
          power, lie among considerations beyond our depth. It was possible, I reflected, that a
          mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the details of the picture,
          would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful
          impression; and, acting upon this idea, I reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a
          black and lurid <ref target="tarn_" corresp="tarn">tarn</ref> that lay in unruffled lustre
          by the dwelling, and gazed down—but with a shudder even more thrilling than before—upon
          the re-modelled and inverted images of the gray sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems, and the
          vacant and eye-like windows.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to myself a sojourn of some weeks.
          Its proprietor, Roderick Usher, had been one of my boon companions in boyhood; but many
          years had elapsed since our last meeting. A letter, however, had lately reached me in a
          distant part of the country—a letter from him—which, in its wildly importunate nature, had
          admitted of no other than a personal reply. The <ref target="ms_" corresp="ms">MS.</ref>
          gave evidence of nervous agitation. The writer spoke of acute bodily illness—of a pitiable
          mental idiosyncrasy which oppressed him—and of an earnest desire to see me, as his best,
          and indeed, his only personal friend, with a view of attempting, by the cheerfulness of my
          society, some alleviation of his malady. It was the manner in which all this, and much
          more, was said—it was the apparent <hi rend="italic">heart</hi> that went with his
          request—which allowed me no room for hesitation—and I accordingly obeyed, what I still
          considered a very singular summons, forthwith.</p>
        <p>Although, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet I really knew little of my
          friend. His reserve had been always excessive and habitual. I was aware, however, that his
          very ancient family had been noted, time out of mind, for a peculiar sensibility of
          temperament, displaying itself, through long ages, in many works of exalted art, and
          manifested, of late, in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity, as well as
          in a passionate devotion to the intricacies, perhaps even more than to the orthodox and
          easily recognisable beauties, of musical science. I had learned, too, the very remarkable
          fact, that the stem of the Usher race, all time-honored as it was, had put forth, at no
          period, any enduring branch; in other words, that the entire family lay in the direct line
          of descent, and had always, with very trifling and very temporary variation, so lain. It
          was this deficiency, I considered, while running over in thought the perfect keeping of
          the character of the premises with the accredited character of the people, and while
          speculating upon the possible influence which the one, in the long lapse of centuries,
          might have exercised upon the other—it was this deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue,
          and the consequent undeviating transmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony with the
          name, which had, at length, so identified the two as to merge the original title of the
          estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the "House of Usher"—an appellation <pb
            n="146" facs="pageImages/mdp.39015011390625-seq_162.jpg"/> which seemed to include, in
          the minds of the peasantry who used it, both the family and the family mansion.</p>
        <p>I have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment, of looking down
          within the tarn, had been to deepen the first singular impression. There can be no doubt
          that the consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstition—for why should I not so
          term it?—served mainly to accelerate the increase itself. Such, I have long known, is the
          paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a basis. And it might have been for
          this reason only, that, when I again uplifted my eyes to the house itself, from its image
          in the pool, there grew in my mind a strange fancy—a fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that I
          but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me. I had so
          worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and domain
          there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity—an atmosphere
          which had no affinity with the air of heaven, but which had reeked up from the decayed
          trees, and the gray wall, and the silent tarn, in the form of an inelastic vapor or gas—
          dull, sluggish, faintly discernible, and leaden-hued. Shaking off from my spirit what <hi
            rend="italic">must</hi> have been a dream, I scanned more narrowly the real aspect of
          the building. Its principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity. The
          discoloration of ages had been great. Minute fungi overspread the whole exterior, hanging
          in a fine tangled web-work from the eaves. Yet all this was apart from any extraordinary
          dilapidation. No portion of the masonry had fallen; and there appeared to be a wild
          inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts, and the utterly porous, and
          evidently decayed condition of the individual stones. In this there was much that reminded
          me of the specious totality of old wood-work which has rotted for long years in some
          neglected vault, with no disturbance from the breath of the external air. Beyond this
          indication of extensive decay, however, the fabric gave little token of instability.
          Perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have discovered a barely perceptible
          fissure, which, extending from the roof of the building in front made its way down the
          wall in a zigzag direction, until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn.</p>
        <p>Noticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the house. A servant in waiting
          took my horse, and I entered the Gothic archway of the hall. A valet, of stealthy step,
          thence conducted me, in silence, through many dark and intricate passages in my progress
          to the studio of his master. Much that I encountered on the way contributed, I know not
          how, to heighten the vague sentiments of which I have already spoken. While the objects
          around me—while the carvings of the ceilings, the sombre tapestries of the walls, the
          ebony blackness of the floors and the <ref target="phantasm_" corresp="phantasm"
            >phantasmagoric</ref> armorial trophies which rattled as I strode, were but matters to
          which, or to such as which, I had been accustomed from my infancy—while I hesitated not to
          acknowledge how familiar was all this—I still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the
          fancies which ordinary images were stirring up. On one of the staircases, I met the
          physician of the family. His countenance, I thought, wore a mingled expression of low
          cunning and perplexity. He accosted me with trepidation and passed on. The valet now threw
          open a door and ushered me into the presence of his master.</p>
        <p>The room in which I found myself was very large and excessively lofty. The windows were
          long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a distance from the black oaken floor as to be
          altogether inaccessible from within. Feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way
          through trellised panes, and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent
          objects around; the eye, however, struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the
          chamber, or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling. Dark draperies hung upon the
          walls. The general furniture was profuse, comfortless, antique, and tattered. Many books
          and musical instruments lay scattered about, but failed to give any vitality to the scene.
          I felt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow. An air of stern, deep, and irredeemable
          gloom hung over and pervaded all.</p>
        <p>Upon my entrance, Usher arose from a sofa on which he had been lying at full length, and
          greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in it, I at first thought, of an
          overdone cordiality—of the constrained effort of the <ref target="ennuye_"
            corresp="ennuye">ennuyé</ref> man of the world. A glance, however, at his countenance,
          convinced me of his perfect sincerity. We sat down; and for some moments, while he spoke
          not, I gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity, half of awe. Surely, man had never
          before so terribly altered, in so brief a period, as had Roderick Usher! It was with
          difficulty that I could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before me with
          the companion of my early boyhood. Yet the character of his face had been at all times
          remarkable. A <ref target="cadaver_" corresp="cadaver">cadaverousness</ref> of complexion;
          an eye large, liquid, and luminous beyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and very pallid,
          but of a surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate Hebrew model, but with a
          breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations; a finely moulded chin, speaking, in its
          want of prominence, of a want of moral energy; hair of a more than web-like softness and
          tenuity; these features, with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple,
          made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten. And now in the mere
          exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features, and of the expression they
          were wont to convey, lay so much of change that I doubted to whom I spoke. The now ghastly
          pallor of the skin, and the now miraculous lustre of the eye, above all things startled
          and even awed me. The silken hair, too, had been suffered to grow all unheeded, and as, in
          its wild gossamer texture, it floated rather than fell about the face, I could not, even
          with effort, connect its arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity.</p>
        <pb n="147" facs="pageImages/mdp.39015011390625-seq_163.jpg"/>
        <p> In the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an incoherence—an inconsistency;
          and I soon found this to arise from a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an
          habitual trepidancy, an excessive nervous agitation. For something of this nature I had
          indeed been prepared, no less by his letter, than by reminiscences of certain boyish
          traits, and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation and
          temperament. His action was alternately vivacious and sullen. His voice varied rapidly
          from a tremulous indecision (when the animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance) to that
          species of energetic concision—that abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and hollow-sounding
          enunciation—that leaden, self-balanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterance, which
          may be observed in the moments of the intensest excitement of the lost drunkard, or the
          irreclaimable eater of opium.</p>
        <p>It was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his earnest desire to see me, and
          of the solace he expected me to afford him. He entered, at some length, into what he
          conceived to be the nature of his malady. It was, he said, a constitutional and a family
          evil, and one for which he despaired to find a remedy—a mere nervous affection, he
          immediately added, which would undoubtedly soon pass off. It displayed itself in a host of
          unnatural sensations. Some of these, as he detailed them, interested and bewildered me—
          although, perhaps, the terms, and the general manner of the narration had their weight. He
          suffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses; the most insipid food was alone
          endurable; he could wear only garments of certain texture; the odors of all flowers were
          oppressive; his eyes were tortured by even a faint light; and there were but peculiar
          sounds, and these from stringed instruments, which did not inspire him with horror.</p>
        <p>To an anomalous species of terror I found him a bounden slave. "I shall perish," said he,
          "I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> perish in this deplorable folly. Thus, thus, and not
          otherwise, shall I be lost. I dread the events of the future, not in themselves, but in
          their results. I shudder at the thought of any, even the most trivial, incident, which may
          operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul. I have, indeed, no abhorrence of danger,
          except in its absolute effect —in terror. In this unnerved—in this pitiable condition—I
          feel that I must inevitably abandon life and reason together in my struggles with some
          [fatal] demon of fear."</p>
        <p>I learned, moreover, at intervals, and through broken and equivocal hints, another
          singular feature of his mental condition. He was enchained by certain superstitious
          impressions in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted, and from which, for many years,
          he had never ventured forth—in regard to an influence whose supposititious force was
          conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be restated—an influence which some peculiarities in
          the mere form and substance of his family mansion, had, by dint of long sufferance, he
          said, obtained over his spirit—an effect which the <hi rend="italic">physique</hi> of the
          gray walls and turrets, and of the dim tarn into which they all looked down, had, at
          length, brought about upon the <hi rend="italic">morale</hi> of his existence.</p>
        <p>He admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of the peculiar gloom which
          thus afflicted him could be traced to a more natural and far more palpable origin—to the
          severe and long-continued illness—indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution —of a
          tenderly beloved sister; his sole companion for long years—his last and only relative on
          earth. "Her decease," he said, with a bitterness which I can never forget, "would leave
          him (him the hopeless and the frail) the last of the ancient race of the Ushers." As he
          spoke, the lady Madeline (for so was she called) passed slowly through a remote portion of
          the apartment, and, without having noticed my presence, disappeared. I regarded her with
          an utter astonishment not unmingled with dread. Her figure, her air, her features—all,
          in their very minutest development were those—were identically (I can use no other
          sufficient term) were identically those of the Roderick Usher who sat beside me. A feeling
          of stupor oppressed me, as my eyes followed her retreating steps. When a door, at length,
          closed upon her exit, my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the
          brother—but he had buried his face in his hands, and I could only perceive that a far more
          than ordinary wariness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many
          passionate tears.</p>
        <p>The disease of the lady Madeline had long baffled the skill of her physicians. A settled
          apathy, a gradual wasting away of the person, and frequent although transient affections
          of a partially cataleptical character, were the unusual diagnosis. Hitherto she had
          steadily borne up against the pressure of her malady, and had not betaken herself finally
          to bed; but, on the closing in of the evening of my arrival at the house, she succumbed,
          as her brother told me at night with inexpressible agitation, to the prostrating power of
          the destroyer—and I learned that the glimpse I had obtained of her person would thus
          probably be the last I should obtain—that the lady, at least while living, would be seen
          by me no more.</p>
        <p>For several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either Usher or myself; and during
          this period I was busied in earnest endeavors to alleviate the melancholy of my friend. We
          painted and read together—or I listened, as if in a dream, to the wild improvisations of
          his speaking guitar. And thus, as a closer and still closer intimacy admitted me more
          unreservedly in the recesses of his spirit, the more bitterly did I perceive the futility
          of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness, as if an inherent positive quality,
          poured forth upon all object of the moral and physical universe, in one unceasing
          radiation of gloom.</p>
        <p>I shall ever bear about me, as <ref target="muslim_" corresp="muslim">Moslemin</ref>
          their shrouds at <placeName type="tgn" key="7003870">Mecca</placeName>, a memory of the
          many solemn <pb n="148" facs="pageImages/mdp.39015011390625-seq_165.jpg"/> hours I thus
          spent alone with the master of the House of Usher. Yet I should fail in any attempt to
          convey an idea of the exact character of the studies, or of the occupations, in which he
          involved me, or led me the way. An excited and highly distempered ideality threw a
          sulphureous lustre over all. His long improvised dirges will ring for ever in my ears.
          Among other things, I bear painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and
          amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of Von Weber. From the paintings over
          which his elaborate fancy brooded, and which grew, touch by touch, into vaguenesses at
          which I shuddered the more thrillingly, because I shuddered knowing not why, from these
          paintings (vivid as their images now are before me) I would in vain endeavor to educe more
          than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely written words. By the
          utter simplicity, by the nakedness, of his designs, he arrested and over-awed attention.
          If ever mortal painted an idea, that mortal was Roderick Usher. For me at least—in the
          circumstances then surrounding me—there arose out of the pure abstractions which the
          hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvass, an intensity of intolerable awe, no
          shadow of which felt I ever yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too
          concrete reveries of <ref target="fuseli_" corresp="fuseli"><persName type="lcnaf"
              key="n79021856">Fuseli</persName></ref>.</p>
        <p>One of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend, partaking not so rigidly of the
          spirit of abstraction, may be shadowed forth, although feebly, in words. A small picture
          presented the interior of an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel, with low
          walls smooth, white, and without interruption or device. Certain accessory points of the
          design served well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below
          the surface of the earth. No outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent, and no
          torch, or other artificial source of light was discernible—yet a flood of intense rays
          rolled throughout, and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendor.</p>
        <p>I have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which rendered all
          music intolerable to the sufferer, with the exception of certain effects of stringed
          instruments. It was, perhaps, the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon the
          guitar, which gave birth, in great measure, to the fantastic character of his
          performances. But the fervid <hi rend="italic">facility</hi> of his <ref
            target="impromptu_" corresp="impromptu">impromptus</ref> could not be so accounted for.
          They must have been, and were, in the notes, as well as in the words of his wild
          fantasias, (for he not unfrequently accompanied himself with rhymed verbal
          improvisations,) the result of that intense mental collectedness and concentration to
          which I have previously alluded as observable only in particular moments of the highest
          artificial excitement. The words of one of these rhapsodies I have easily borne away in
          memory. I was, perhaps, the more forcibly impressed with it, as he gave it, because, in
          the under or mystic current of in its meaning, I fancied that I perceived, and for the
          first time, a full consciousness on the part of Usher, of the tottering of his lofty
          reason upon her throne. The verses, which were entitled "The Haunted Palace," ran very
          nearly, if not accurately, thus:</p>

        <p> I well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad led us into a train of thought
          wherein there became manifest an opinion of Usher's which I mention not so much on account
          of its novelty, (for other men have thought thus,) as on account of the pertinacity with
          which he maintained it. This opinion, in its general form, was that of the sentience of
          all vegetable things. But, in his disordered fancy, the idea had assumed a more daring
          character, and trespassed, under certain conditions, upon the kingdom of inorganization. I
          lack words to express the full extent, or the earnest <hi rend="italic">abandon</hi>of his
          persuasion. The belief, however, was connected (as I have previously hinted) with the gray
          stones of the home of his forefathers. The condition of the sentience had been here, he
          imagined, fulfilled in the method of collocation of these stones—in the order of their
          arrangement, as well as in that of the many fungi which overspread them, and of the
          decayed trees which stood around—above all, in the long undisturbed endurance of this
          arrangement, and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn. Its evidence—the
          evidence of the sentience—was to be seen, he said, (and I here started as he spoke,) in
            <hi rend="italic">the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere of their own
            about the watersand the walls.</hi> The result was discoverable, he added, in that
          silent, yet importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the
          destinies of his family, and which made <hi rend="italic">him</hi> what I now saw him—what
          he was. Such opinions need no comment, and I will make none.</p>
        <p>Our books—the books which, for years, had formed no small portion of the mental existence
          of the invalid—were, as might be supposed, in strict keeping with this character of
          phantasm. We pored together over such works as the Ververt et Chartreuse of Gresset; the
          Belphegor of Machiavelli; the Heaven and Hell of Swedenborg; the Subterranean Voyage of
          Nicholas Klimm by Holberg; the Chiromancy of Robert Flud, of Jean D'Indaginé, and of De la
          Chambre; the Journey into the Blue Distance of Tieck; and the City of the Sun of
          Campanella. One favorite volume was a small octavo edition of the <ref target="eymeric_"
            corresp="eymeric">Directorium Inquisitorium</ref>, by the Dominican <persName
            type="lcnaf" key="n87884445">Eymeric de Gironne</persName>; and there were passages in
            <ref target="mela_" corresp="mela"><persName type="lcnaf" key="n80139084">Pomponius
              Mela</persName></ref>, about the old African Satyrs and Œgipans, over which Usher
          would sit dreaming for hours. His chief delight, however, was found in the earnest and
          repeated perusal of an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto Gothic—the manual of a
          forgotten church—the <ref target="vigilae_" corresp="vigilae"><hi rend="italic">Vigiliae
              Mortuorum secundum Chorum Ecclesiae Maguntinae.</hi></ref></p>
        <p> I could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work, and of its probable influence
          upon the hypochondriac, when, one evening, having informed me abruptly that the lady
          Madeline was no more, he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight,
          previously to its final interment, in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls of
          the building. The worldly reason, however, assigned for this singular proceeding, was one
          which I did not feel at liberty to dispute. The brother had been led to his resolution (so
          he told me) by consideration of the unusual character <pb n="150"
            facs="pageImages/mdp.39015011390625-seq_167.jpg"/>character of the malady of the
          deceased, of certain obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men, and of
          the remote and exposed situation of the burial ground of the family. I will not deny that
          when I called to mind the sinister countenance of the person whom I met upon the
          staircase, on the day of my arrival at the house, I had no desire to oppose what I
          regarded as at best but a harmless, and by no means an unnatural precaution.</p>
        <p> At the request of Usher, I personally aided him in the arrangements for the temporary
          entombment. The body having been encoffined, we two alone bore it to its rest. The vault
          in which we placed it (and which had been so long unopened that our torches, half
          smothered in its oppressive atmosphere, gave us little opportunity for investigation) was
          small, damp, and utterly without means of admission for light; lying, at great depth,
          immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my own sleeping apartment.
          It had been used, apparently, in remote feudal times, for the worst purposes of a <ref
            target="keep_" corresp="keep">donjon-keep</ref>, and, in later days, as a place of
          deposit for powder, or other highly combustible substance, as a portion of its floor, and
          the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it, were carefully sheathed
          with copper. The door, of massive iron, had been, also, similarly protected. Its immense
          weight caused an unusually sharp grating sound, as it moved upon its hinges.</p>
        <p> Having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of horror, we
          partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin, and looked upon the face of
          the tenant. The exact similitude between the brother and sister even here again startled
          and confounded me. Usher, divining, perhaps, my thoughts, murmured out some few words from
          which I learned that the deceased and himself had been twins, and that sympathies of a
          scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them. Our glances, however, rested
          not long upon the dead—for we could not regard her unawed. The disease which had thus
          entombed the lady in the maturity of youth, had left, as usual in all maladies of a
          strictly cataleptical character, the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face,
          and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death. We
          replaced and screwed down the lid, and, having secured the door of iron, made our way,
          with toil, into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house.</p>
        <p> And now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable change came over the
          features of the mental disorder of my friend. His ordinary manner had vanished. His
          ordinary occupations were neglected or forgotten. He roamed from chamber to chamber with
          hurried, unequal, and objectless step. The pallor of his countenance had assumed, if
          possible, a more ghastly hue—but the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out. The
          once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more; and a tremulous quaver, as if of
          extreme terror, habitually characterized his utterance. There were times, indeed, when I
          thought his unceasingly agitated mind was laboring with some oppressive secret, to divulge
          which he struggled for the necessary courage. At times, again, I was obliged to resolve
          all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness, as I beheld him gazing upon vacancy
          for long hours, in an attitude of the profoundest attention, as if listening to some
          imaginary sound. It was no wonder that his condition terrified—that it infected me. I felt
          creeping upon me, by slow yet certain degrees, the wild influences of his own fantastic
          yet impressive superstitions.</p>
        <p> It was, most especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night of the seventh or eighth
          day after the entombment of the lady Madeline, that I experienced the full power of such
          feelings. Sleep came not near my couch—while the hours waned and waned away. I struggled
          to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me. I endeavored to believe that
          much, if not all of what I felt, was due to the phantasmagoric influence of the gloomy
          furniture of the room—of the dark and tattered draperies, which, tortured into motion by
          the breath of rising tempest, swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and rustled
          uneasily about the decorations of the bed. But my efforts were fruitless. An irrepressible
          tremor gradually pervaded my frame; and, at length, there sat upon my very heart an
          incubus of utterly causeless alarm. Shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle, I
          uplifted myself upon the pillows, and, peering earnestly within the intense darkness of
          the chamber, harkened—I know not why, except that an instinctive spirit prompted me—to
          certain low and indefinite sounds which came, through the pauses of the storm, at long
          intervals, I knew not whence. Overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror, unaccountable
          yet unendurable, I threw on my clothes with haste for I felt that I should sleep no more
          during the night, and endeavored to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which I
          had fallen, by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment.</p>
        <p> I had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step on an adjoining staircase
          arrested my attention. I presently recognise it as that of Usher. In an instant afterward
          he rapped, with a gentle touch, at my door, and entered, bearing a lamp. His countenance
          was, as usual, cadaverously wan—but there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyes—an
          evidently restrained hysteria in his whole demeanor. His air appalled me—but any thing was
          preferable to the solitude which I had so long endured, and I even welcomed his presence
          as a relief.</p>
        <p>"And you have not seen it?" he said abruptly, after having stared about him for some
          moments in silence—"you have not then seen it? —but, stay! you shall." Thus speaking, and
          having carefully shaded his lamp, he hurried to one of the casements, and threw it freely
          open to the storm.</p>
        <pb n="151" facs="pageImages/mdp.39015011390625-seq_168.jpg"/>
        <p>The impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet. It was, indeed, a
          tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night, and one wildly singular in its terror and its
          beauty. A whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our vicinity; for there were
          frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind; and the exceeding density
          of the clouds (which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house) did not
          prevent our perceiving the life-like velocity with which they flew careering from all
          points against each other, without passing away into the distance. I say that even their
          exceeding density did not prevent our perceiving this—yet we had no glimpse of the moon or
          stars—nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning. But the under surfaces of the
          huge masses of agitated vapor, as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us,
          were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous
          exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the mansion.</p>
        <p>"You must not—you shall not behold this!" said I, shudderingly, to Usher, as I led him,
          with a gentle violence, from the window to a seat. "These appearances, which bewilder you,
          are merely electrical phenomena not uncommon—or it may be that they have their ghastly
          origin in the rank miasma of the tarn. Let us close this casement—the air is chilling and
          dangerous to your frame. Here is one of your favorite romances. I will read, and you shall
          listen— and so we will pass away this terrible night together."</p>
        <p>The antique volume which I had taken up was the <ref target="trist_" corresp="trist">"Mad
            Trist" of Sir Launcelot Canning</ref>—but I had called it a favorite of Usher's more in
          sad jest than in earnest; for, in truth, there is little in its uncouth and unimaginative
          prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend.
          It was, however, the only book immediately at hand; and I indulged a vague hope that the
          excitement which now agitated the hypochondriac might find relief (for the history of
          mental disorder is full of similar anomalies) even in the extremeness of the folly which I
          should read. Could I have judged, indeed, by the wild, overstrained air of vivacity with
          which he harkened, or apparently harkened, to the words of the tale, I might well have
          congratulated myself upon the success of my design.</p>
        <p>I had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where Ethelred, the hero of the
          Trist, having sought in vain for peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit,
          proceeds to make good an entrance by force. Here, it will be remembered, the words of the
          narrative run thus—</p>
        <p> "And Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who was now mighty withal, on
          account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had drunken, waited no longer to hold
          parley with the hermit, who, in sooth, was of an obstinate and maliceful turn, but,
          feeling the rain upon his shoulders, and fearing the rising of the tempest, uplifted his
          mace outright, and, with blows, made quickly room in the plankings of the door for his
          gauntleted hand; and now pulling therewith sturdily, he so cracked, and ripped, and tore
          all asunder, that the noise of the dry and hollow-sounding wood alarummed and reverberated
          throughout the forest."</p>
        <p>At the termination of this sentence I started, and, for a moment, paused; for it appeared
          to me (although I at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived me)—it appeared to
          me that, from some very remote portion of the mansion or of its vicinity, there came,
          indistinctly, to my ears, what might have been, in its exact similarity of character, the
          echo (but a stifled and dull one certainly) of the very cracking and ripping sound which
          Sir Launcelot had so particularly described. It was, beyond doubt, the coincidence alone
          which had arrested my attention; for, amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements,
          and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm, the sound, in itself,
          had nothing, surely, which should have interested or disturbed me. I continued the
          story.</p>
        <p>"But the good champion Ethelred, now entering within the door, was sore enraged and
          amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit; but, in the stead thereof, a dragon
          of a scaly and prodigious demeanor, and of a fiery tongue, which sate in guard before a
          palace of gold, with a floor of silver; and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining
          brass with this legend enwritten—</p>
        <lg>
          <l>Who entereth herein, a conqueror hath bin;</l>
          <l>Who slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win;</l>
        </lg>
        <p>And Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the dragon, which fell before
          him, and gave up his pesty breath, with a shriek so horrid and harsh, and withal so
          piercing, that Ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful
          noise of it, the like whereof was never before heard."</p>
        <p>Here again I paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wild amazement—for there could be
          no doubt whatever that, in this instance, I did actually hear (although from what
          direction it proceeded I found it impossible to say) a low and apparently distant, but
          harsh, protracted, and most unusual screaming or grating sound—the exact counterpart of
          what my fancy had already conjured up as the sound of the dragon's unnatural shriek as
          described by the <ref target="romance_" corresp="romance_">romancer</ref>.</p>
        <p>Oppressed, as I certainly was, upon the occurrence of this second and most extraordinary
          coincidence, by a thousand conflicting sensations, in which wonder and extreme terror were
          predominant, I still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting, by any
          observation, the sensitive nervousness <pb n="152"
            facs="pageImages/mdp.39015011390625-seq_169.jpg"/> of my companion. I was by no means
          certain that he had noticed the sounds in question; although, assuredly, a strange
          alteration had, during the last few minutes, taken place in his demeanor. From a position
          fronting my own, he had gradually brought round his chair, so as to sit with his face to
          the door of the chamber, and thus I could but partially perceive his features, although I
          saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly. His head had dropped upon
          his breast—yet I knew that he was not asleep, from the wide and rigid opening of the eye,
          as I caught a glance of it in profile. The motion of his body, too, was at variance with
          this idea—for he rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway.
          Having rapidly taken notice of all this, I resumed the narrative of Sir Launcelot which
          thus proceeded:—</p>
        <p>"And now, the champion, having escaped from the terrible fury of the dragon, bethinking
          himself of the brazen shield, and of the breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it,
          removed the carcass from out of the way before him, and approached valorously over the
          silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall; which in sooth
          tarried not for his full coming, but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor with a
          mighty great and terrible ringing sound."</p>
        <p>No sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than—as if a shield of brass had indeed, at
          the moment, fallen heavily upon a floor of silver—I became aware of a distinct, hollow,
          metallic, and clangorous, yet apparently muffled reverberation. Completely unnerved, I
          leaped to my feet; but the measured rocking movement of Usher was undisturbed. I rushed to
          the chair in which he sat. His eyes were bent fixedly before him, and throughout his whole
          countenance there reigned a stony rigidity. But, as I placed my hand upon his shoulder,
          there came a strong shudder over his whole person; a sickly smile quivered about his lips;
          and I saw that he spoke in a low, hurried, and gibbering murmur, as if unconscious of my
          presence. Bending closely over him, I at length drank in the hideous import of his
          words.</p>
        <p>"Not hear it?—yes, I hear it, and <hi rend="italic">have</hi> heard it. Long—long—
          long—many minutes, many hours, many days, have I heard it—yet I dared not—oh, pity me,
          miserable wretch that I am!—I dared not—I <hi rend="italic">dared</hi> not speak!<hi
            rend="italic">We have put her living in the tomb!</hi> Said I not that my senses were
          acute? I now tell you that I heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin. I
          heard them— many, many days ago—yet I dared not—<hi rend="italic">I dared not speak!</hi>
          And now—to-night—Ethelred—ha! ha!—the breaking of the hermit's door, and the death-cry of
          the dragon, and the clangor of the shield!—say, rather, the rending of her coffin, and the
          grating of the iron hinges, and her struggles within the coppered archway of the vault! Oh
          whither shall I fly? Will she not be here anon? Is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my
          haste? Have I not heard her footsteps on the stair? Do I not distinguish that heavy and
          horrible beating of her heart? Madman!" —here he sprung violently to his feet, and
          shrieked out his syllables, as if in the effort he were giving up his soul—"Madman! <hi
            rend="italic">I tell you that she now stands without the door!"</hi></p>
        <p>As if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found the potency of a
          spell—their huge antique pannels to which the speaker pointed, threw slowly back, upon the
          instant, their ponderous and ebony jaws. It was the work of the rushing gust— but then
          without those doors there did stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady Madeline
          of Usher. There was blood upon her white robes, and the evidence of some bitter struggle
          upon every portion of her emaciated frame. For a moment she remained trembling and reeling
          to and fro upon the threshold—then, with a low moaning cry, fell heavily inward upon the
          person of her brother, and in her horrible and now final death-agonies, bore him to the
          floor a corpse, and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated.</p>
        <p>From that chamber, and from that mansion, I fled aghast. The storm was still abroad in
          all its wrath as I found myself crossing the old causeway. Suddenly there shot along the
          path a wild light, and I turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued; for
          the vast house and its shadows were alone behind me. The radiance was that of the full,
          setting, and blood-red moon, which now shone vividly through that once barely-discernible
          fissure, of which I have before spoken, as extending from the roof of the building, in a
          zig-zag direction, to the base. While I gazed, this fissure rapidly widened—there came a
          fierce breath of the whirlwind—the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my
          sight—my brain reeled as I saw the mighty walls rushing asunder—there was a long
          tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand waters—and the deep and dank tarn
          at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the <hi rend="italic">"House
            of Usher."</hi></p>

          <p>This has long been one of Poe's most popular stories, but it is a story that has long
            resisted particularly persuasive interpretation. It's obvious that the entire tale turns
            on the pun on the word "house," here meaning both the literal house of the Usher family
            and the "house" in the sense of the family line itself. There has long been a tradition
            that Poe was inspired by the true story of James Campbell Usher and Agnes Pye Usher,
            twins who were the children of Luke and Harriet Usher, actor friends of Poe's mother.
            Like Poe himself, the Usher twins were orphaned as children. The situation is
            suggestive, but beyond the coincidence of orphaned twins named Usher, it is impossible
            to know how much Poe knew about the real-life Ushers, and how much he might have been
            inspired by them.</p>
