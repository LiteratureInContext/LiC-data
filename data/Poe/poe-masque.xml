                  xml:id="n0001" target="a0001" type="editorial" resp="editors.xml#JOB"><p>This
                     story was first published in <hi rend="italic">Graham's Magazine</hi>, a
                     journal published in Philadelphia, in May 1842, under the title "The Mask of
                     the Red Death: A Fantasy." Poe was editor of the magazine from February 1841 to
                     April 1842; the story was probably at the printers' at the time he departed.
                     (No one knows for certain why he left the mgazine, but most accounts suggest
                     that he did so impulsively.) The story was republished in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Broadway Magazine</hi> in July 1845 when Poe was editing <hi rend="italic"
                        >that</hi> magazine as "The Masque of the Red Death"; Poe had a habit of
                     recycling stories, and in an era without copyright protection, there was
                     nothing to stop him. "The Masque of the Red Death" is the title under which the
                     story has become known, but the original title is still relevant, and Poe
                     probably intends a play on words, with the word invoking both "masque" in the
                     sense of an aristocratic spectacle or entertainment, and "mask" in the sense of
                     the mask that the partygoers, including the character of the Red Death, are
                     wearing.</p>
                  <p>Poe's modern editor T. O. Mabbott suggests that the story of an aristocrat
                     having a party in the midst of a plague probably comes from stories about such
                     incidents that occurred during a cholera epidemic in Paris in 1832. Nathaniel
                     Willis published an account of "a masque ball" in <hi rend="italic">New York
                        Mirror</hi> that he attended that year in the midst of the outbreak that
                     seems to resemble the scenario of Poe's story closely: "There were some two
                     thousand people, I should think, in fancy dresses, most of them grotesque and
                     satirical, and the ball was kept up till seven in te morning, with all the
                     extravagant gayety, noise, and fun, with which the French people manage such
                     matters. There was a <hi rend="italic">cholera-waltz</hi>m and a <hi
                        rend="italic">cholera-galopade</hi>, and one man, immensely tall, dresed as
                     a personification of the <hi rend="italic">Cholera</hi> itself, with skeleton
                     armor, bloodshot eyes, and other horrible appurtances of a walking pestilence."
                     [Nathaniel P. Willis, <hi rend="italic">Pencillings by the Way</hi>, in <hi
                        rend="italic">The Prose Works of N. P. Willis</hi>, Philadelphia, 1854, p.
                     24.] Willis, perhaps the most famous journalist of the period, was so well
                     known to American readers, and so close a friend of Poe's at this time, that it
                     seems very likely that Poe read his account of rich people partying in the
                     midst of an epidemic. "The Masque of the Red Death" has remained one of Poe's
                     most popular short stories.</p>

            <p>THE “Red Death” had long devastated the country. No pestilence had ever been so
               fatal, or so hideous. Blood was its Avator and its seal — the redness and the horror
               of blood. There were sharp pains, and sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at
               the pores, with dissolution. The scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the
               face of the victim, were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the
               sympathy of his fellow-men. And the whole seizure, progress and termination of the
               disease, were the incidents of half an hour.</p>

            <p>But the <ref target="a0002" corresp="n0002">Prince Prospero</ref><note xml:id="n0002"
                  target="a0002" type="editorial" resp="editors.xml#JOB">Prospero is, of course, the
                  name of the central character in William Shakespeare's 1611 play <hi rend="italic"

               dominions were half depopulated, he summoned to his presence a thousand hale and
               light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames of his court, and with these
               retired to the deep seclusion of one of his castellated abbeys. This was an extensive
               and magnificent structure, the creation of the prince’s own eccentric yet august
               taste. A strong and lofty wall girdled it in. This wall had gates of iron. The
               courtiers, having entered, brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts.
               They resolved to leave means neither of ingress nor egress to the sudden impulses of
               despair or of frenzy from within. The abbey was amply provisioned. With such
               precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to contagion. The external world could
               take care of itself. In the meantime it was folly to grieve, or to think. The prince
               had provided all the appliances of pleasure. There were buffoons, there were <ref

                  target="a0003" type="editorial" resp="editors.xml#JOB">A group of Italian poets
                  who were known for their ability to improvise songs on the spot. They may go back
                  as far as the fourteenth century; by the middle of the nineteenth century, when
                  Poe was writing, they were disappearing.</note>, there were ballet-dancers, there
               were musicians, there was Beauty, there was wine. All these and security were within.
               Without was the “Red Death”.</p>

            <p>It was towards the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion, and while the
               pestilence raged most furiously abroad, that the Prince Prospero entertained his
               thousand friends at a masked ball of the most unusual magnificence.</p>

            <p>It was a voluptuous scene, that masquerade. But first let me tell of the rooms in
               which it was held. These were seven—an imperial suite. In many palaces, however, such
               suites form a long and straight vista, while the folding doors slide back nearly to
               the walls on either hand, so that the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded.
               Here the case was very different, as might have been expected from the duke’s love of
               the bizarre. The apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but
               little more than one at a time. There was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty
               yards, and at each turn a novel effect. To the right and left, in the middle of each
               wall, a tall and narrow <ref target="a0004" corresp="n0004">Gothic window</ref><note
                  xml:id="n0004" target="a0004" type="editorial" resp="editors.xml#JOB">An stone
                  arched window, such as one in what we now call a "Gothic" cathedral.</note> looked
               out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings of the suite. These windows
               were of stained glass whose colour varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of
               the decorations of the chamber into which it opened. That at the eastern extremity
               was hung, for example, in blue—and vividly blue were its windows. The second chamber
               was purple in its ornaments and tapestries, and here the panes were purple. The third
               was green throughout, and so were the casements. The fourth was furnished and lighted
               with orange—the fifth with white—the sixth with violet. The seventh apartment was
               closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down
               the walls, falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue. But in
               this chamber only, the colour of the windows failed to correspond with the
               decorations. The panes here were scarlet—a deep blood colour. Now in no one of the
               seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum, amid the profusion of golden
               ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the roof. There was no light
               of any kind emanating from lamp or candle within the suite of chambers. But in the
               corridors that followed the suite, there stood, opposite to each window, a heavy
               tripod, bearing a brazier of fire, that projected its rays through the tinted glass
               and so glaringly illumined the room. And thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and
               fantastic appearances. But in the western or black chamber the effect of the
               fire-light that streamed upon the dark hangings through the blood-tinted panes, was
               ghastly in the extreme, and produced so wild a look upon the countenances of those
               who entered, that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its
               precincts at all.</p>

            <p>It was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the western wall, a gigantic
               clock of ebony. Its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull, heavy, monotonous clang;
               and when the minute-hand made the circuit of the face, and the hour was to be
               stricken, there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and
               loud and deep and exceedingly musical, but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that,
               at each lapse of an hour, the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause,
               momentarily, in their performance, to harken to the sound; and thus the waltzers
               perforce ceased their evolutions; and there was a brief disconcert of the whole gay
               company; and, while the chimes of the clock yet rang, it was observed that the
               giddiest grew pale, and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows
               as if in confused revery or meditation. But when the echoes had fully ceased, a light
               laughter at once pervaded the assembly; the musicians looked at each other and smiled
               as if at their own nervousness and folly, and made whispering vows, each to the
               other, that the next chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion;
               and then, after the lapse of sixty minutes, (which embrace three thousand and six
               hundred seconds of the Time that flies,) there came yet another chiming of the clock,
               and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as before.</p>

            <p>But, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent revel. The tastes of the
               duke were peculiar. He had a fine eye for colours and effects. He disregarded the
               decora of mere fashion. His plans were bold and fiery, and his conceptions glowed
               with barbaric lustre. There are some who would have thought him mad. His followers
               felt that he was not. It was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that
               he was not.</p>

            <p>He had directed, in great part, the movable embellishments of the seven chambers,
               upon occasion of this great fete; and it was his own guiding taste which had given
               character to the masqueraders. Be sure they were grotesque. There were much glare and
               glitter and piquancy and phantasm—much of what has been since seen in <ref
                  target="a0005" corresp="n0005">“Hernani”. There were arabesque figures with
                  unsuited limbs and appointments.</ref><note xml:id="n0005" target="a0005"

                  plot."Arabesque" in this context means only vaguely Islamic or Arab in
                  style.</note> There were delirious fancies such as the madman fashions. There were
               much of the beautiful, much of the wanton, much of the bizarre, something of the
               terrible, and not a little of that which might have excited disgust. To and fro in
               the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a multitude of dreams. And these—the
               dreams—writhed in and about taking hue from the rooms, and causing the wild music of
               the orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps. And, anon, there strikes the ebony
               clock which stands in the hall of the velvet. And then, for a moment, all is still,
               and all is silent save the voice of the clock. The dreams are stiff-frozen as they
               stand. But the echoes of the chime die away—they have endured but an instant—and a
               light, half-subdued laughter floats after them as they depart. And now again the
               music swells, and the dreams live, and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever,
               taking hue from the many tinted windows through which stream the rays from the
               tripods. But to the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven, there are now
               none of the maskers who venture; for the night is waning away; and there flows a
               ruddier light through the blood-coloured panes; and the blackness of the sable
               drapery appals; and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet, there comes from
               the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches
               their ears who indulged in the more remote gaieties of the other apartments.</p>

            <p>But these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them beat feverishly the
               heart of life. And the revel went whirlingly on, until at length there commenced the
               sounding of midnight upon the clock. And then the music ceased, as I have told; and
               the evolutions of the waltzers were quieted; and there was an uneasy cessation of all
               things as before. But now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of the
               clock; and thus it happened, perhaps, that more of thought crept, with more of time,
               into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled. And thus too, it
               happened, perhaps, that before the last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk
               into silence, there were many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to
               become aware of the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of
               no single individual before. And the rumour of this new presence having spread itself
               whisperingly around, there arose at length from the whole company a buzz, or murmur,
               expressive of disapprobation and surprise—then, finally, of terror, of horror, and of
               disgust.</p>

            <p>In an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted, it may well be supposed that no
               ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation. In truth the masquerade
               licence of the night was nearly unlimited; but the figure in question had <ref

                  would someday rival him. The phrase "out-Herod Herod" comes from Shakespeare's <hi

               prince’s indefinite decorum. There are chords in the hearts of the most reckless
               which cannot be touched without emotion. Even with the utterly lost, to whom life and
               death are equally jests, there are matters of which no jest can be made. The whole
               company, indeed, seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the
               stranger neither wit nor propriety existed. The figure was tall and gaunt, and
               shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the grave. The mask which concealed
               the visage was made so nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that
               the closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat. And yet all
               this might have been endured, if not approved, by the mad revellers around. But the

               His vesture was dabbled in blood—and his broad brow, with all the features of the
               face, was besprinkled with the scarlet horror.</p>

            <p>When the eyes of the Prince Prospero fell upon this spectral image (which, with a
               slow and solemn movement, as if more fully to sustain its role, stalked to and fro
               among the waltzers) he was seen to be convulsed, in the first moment with a strong
               shudder either of terror or distaste; but, in the next, his brow reddened with
               rage.</p>

            <p>“Who dares,”—he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near him—“who dares
               insult us with this blasphemous mockery? Seize him and unmask him—that we may know
               whom we have to hang, at sunrise, from the battlements!”</p>

            <p>It was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the Prince Prospero as he
               uttered these words. They rang throughout the seven rooms loudly and clearly, for the
               prince was a bold and robust man, and the music had become hushed at the waving of
               his hand.</p>

            <p>It was in the blue room where stood the prince, with a group of pale courtiers by his
               side. At first, as he spoke, there was a slight rushing movement of this group in the
               direction of the intruder, who at the moment was also near at hand, and now, with
               deliberate and stately step, made closer approach to the speaker. But from a certain
               nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole
               party, there were found none who put forth hand to seize him; so that, unimpeded, he
               passed within a yard of the prince’s person; and, while the vast assembly, as if with
               one impulse, shrank from the centres of the rooms to the walls, he made his way
               uninterruptedly, but with the same solemn and measured step which had distinguished
               him from the first, through the blue chamber to the purple—through the purple to the
               green—through the green to the orange—through this again to the white—and even thence
               to the violet, ere a decided movement had been made to arrest him. It was then,
               however, that the Prince Prospero, maddening with rage and the shame of his own
               momentary cowardice, rushed hurriedly through the six chambers, while none followed
               him on account of a deadly terror that had seized upon all. He bore aloft a drawn
               dagger, and had approached, in rapid impetuosity, to within three or four feet of the
               retreating figure, when the latter, having attained the extremity of the velvet
               apartment, turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer. There was a sharp cry—and the
               dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet, upon which, instantly afterwards, fell
               prostrate in death the Prince Prospero. Then, summoning the wild courage of despair,
               a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black apartment, and,
               seizing the mummer, whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of
               the ebony clock, gasped in unutterable horror at finding the grave cerements and
               corpse-like mask, which they handled with so violent a rudeness, untenanted by any
               tangible form.</p>

            <p>And now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death. He had come like a thief in
               the night. And one by one dropped the revellers in the blood-bedewed halls of their
               revel, and died each in the despairing posture of his fall. And the life of the ebony
               clock went out with that of the last of the gay. And the flames of the tripods
               expired. And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over
               all.</p>
