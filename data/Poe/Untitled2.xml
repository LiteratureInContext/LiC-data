Ligeia

I cannot, for my soul, remember how, when, or even precisely where, I
first became acquainted with the lady Ligeia.  Long years have since
elapsed, and my memory is feeble through much suffering.  Or, perhaps,
I cannot now bring these points to mind, because, in truth, the character
of my beloved, her rare learning, her singular yet placid cast of beauty,
and the thrilling and enthralling eloquence of her low musical language,
made their way into my heart by paces so steadily and stealthily progressive
that they have been unnoticed and unknown.  Yet I believe that I met her
first and most frequently in some large, old, decaying city near the
Rhine.  Of her family--I have surely heard her speak.  That it is of a
remotely ancient date cannot be doubted.  Ligeia!  Ligeia!  Buried in studies
of a nature more than all else adapted to deaden impressions of the outward
world, it is by that sweet word alone--by Ligeia--that I bring before mine
eyes in fancy the image of her who is no more.  And now, while I write,
a recollection flashes upon me that I have never known the paternal name
of her who was my friend and my betrothed, and who became the partner of
my studies, and finally the wife of my bosom.  Was it a playful charge on
the part of my Ligeia? or was it a test of my strength of affection, that
I should insitute no inquiries upon this point?  or was it rather a caprice
of my own--a wildly romantic offering on the shrine of the most passionate
devotion?  I but indistinctly recall the fact itself--what wonder that I
have utterly forgotten the circumstances which originated or attended it?
And, indeed, if ever that spirit which is entitled Romance--if ever she,
the wan an the misty-winged Ashtophet of idolatrous Egypt, presided, as
they tell, over marriages ill-omened, then most surely she presided over
mine.

There is one dear topic, however, on which my memory fails me not.  It is
the person of Ligeia.  In stature she was tall, somewhat slender, and, in
her latter days, even emaciated.  I would in vain attempt to portray the
majesty, the quiet ease, of her demeanor, or the incomprehensible lightness
and elasticity of her footfall.  She came and departed as a shadow.  I was
never made aware of her entrance into my closed study save by the dear music
of her low sweet voice, as she placed her marble hand upon my shoulder.
In beauty of face no maiden ever equalled her.  It was the radiance of an
opium-dream--an airy and spirit-lifting vision more wildly divine than the
phantasies which hovered about the slumbering souls of the daughters of
Delos.  Yet her featues wer not of that regular mould which we have been
falsely taught to worship in the classical labors of the heathen.  'There
is no exquisite beauty,' says Bacon, Lord Verulam, speaking truly of all
the forms and genera of beauty, 'without some strangeness in the 
proportion.'  Yet, although I saw that the features of Ligeia were not of
a classic regularity--although I perceived that her loveliness was indeed
'exquisite,' and felt that there was much of 'strangeness' pervading it,
yet I have tried in vain to detect the irregularity and to trace home my
own perception of 'the strange.'  I examined the contour of the lofty and
pale forehead--it was faultless--how cold indeed that word when applied to
a majesty so divine!--the skin rivalling the purest ivory, the commanding
extent and repose, the gently prominence of the regions above the temples;
and then the raven-black, the glossy, the luxuriant and naturally-curling
tresses, setting forth the full force of the Homeric epithet, 'hyacinthine!'
I looked at the delicate outlines of the nose--and nowhere but in the 
gracefull medallions of the Hebrews had I beheld a similar perfection.
There were the same luxurious smoothness of surface, the same scarcely 
perceptible tendency to the aquiline, the same harmoniously curved nostrils
speaking the free spirit.  I regarded the sweet mouth.  Here was indeed
the triumph of all things heavenly--the magnificent turn of the short
upper lip--the soft, voluputous slumber of the under--the dimples which
sported, and the color which spoke--the teeth glancing back, with a
brilliancy almost startling, every ray of the holy light which fell upon
them in her serence and placid, yet most exultingly radiant of all smiles.
I scrutinized the formation of the chin--and here, too, I found the
gentleness of breadth, the softness and the majesty, the fullness and the
spirituality, of the Greek--the contour which the god Apollo revealed but
in a dream, to Cleomenes, the son of the Athenian.  And then I peered into
the large eyes of Ligeia.

For eyes we have no models in the remotely antique.  It might have been,
too, that in these eyes of my beloved lay the secret to which Lord Verulam
alludes. They were, I must believe, far larger than the oridnary eyes of our
own race.  They were even fuller than the fullest of the gazelle eyes of the
tribe of the valley of Nourjahad.  Yet it was only at intervals--in moments
of intense excitement--that this peculiarity became more than slightly
noticeable in Ligeia.  And at such moments was her beauty--in my heated
fancy thus it appeared perhaps--the beauty of beings either above or apart
from the earth--the beauty of the fabulous Houri of the Turk.  The hue of
the orbs was the most brilliant of black, and, far over them, hung jetty
lashes of great length.  The brows, slightly irregular in outline, had the
same tint.  The 'strangeness,' however, which I found in the eyes, was of a
nature distinct from the formation, or the color, or the brilliancy of the
features, and must, after all, be referred to the expression.  Ah, word of
no meaning! behind whose vast latitude of mere sound we intrench our 
ignorance of so much of the spiritual.  The expression of the eyes of Ligeia!
How for long hours have I pondered upon it!  How have I, through the whole
of a midsummer night, struggled to fathom it!  What was it--that something
more profound than the well of Democritus--which lay far within the pupils
of my beloved?  What was it?  I was possessed with a passion to discover.
Those eyes! those large, those shining, those divine orbs! they became to 
me twin stars of Leda, and I to them devoutest of astrologers.

There is no point, among the many incomprehensible anomolies of the science
of mind, more thrillingly exciting than the fact--never, I believe, noticed
in the schools--that, in our endeavors to recall to memory something long
forgotten, we often find ourselves upon the very verge of remembrance,
without being able, in the end, to remember.  And thus how frequently, in
my intense scrutiny of Ligeia's eyes, have I felt approaching the full
knowledge of their expression--felt it approaching--yet not quite be mine--
and so at length entirely depart!  And (strange, oh strangest mystery of all!)
I found, in the commonest objects of the universe, a circle of analogies to
that expression.  I mean to say that, subsequently to the period when Ligeia's
beauty passed into my spirit, there dwelling as in a shrine, I derived, from
many existences in the material world, a sentiment such as I felt always
aroused within me by her large and luminous orbs.  Yet not the more could I
define that sentiment, or analyze, or even steadily view it.  I recognized
it, let me repeat, sometimes in the survey of a rapidly-growing vine--in the
contemplation of a moth, a butterfly, a chrysalis, a stream of running water.
I have felt it in the ocean; in the falling of a meteor.  I have felt it in
the glances of unusally aged people.  And there are one or two stars in
heaven--(one especially, a star of the sixth magnitude, double and changeable,
to be found near the large star in Lyra) in a telescopic scrutiny of which
I have been made aware of the feeling.  I have been filled with it by certain
sounds from stringed instruments, and not unfrequently by passages from
books.  Among innumerable other instances, I well remember something in a
volume of Joseph Glanvill, which (perhaps merely from its quaintness--who
shall say?) never failed to inspire me with the sentiment;--'And the will
therein lieth, which dieth not.  Who knoweth the mysteries of the will,
with its vigor?  For God is but a great  will pervading all things by nature
of its intentness.  Man doth not yield him to the angels, nor unto death
utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will.'

Length of years, and subsequent reflection, have enabled me to trace, indeed,
some remote connection between this passage in the English moralist and a 
portion of the character of Ligeia.  An intensity in thought, action, or
speech, was possibly, in her, a result, or at least an index, of that
gigantic volition which, during our long intercourse, failed to give other
and more immediate evidence of its existence.  Of all the women whom I have
ever known, she, the outwardly calm, the ever-placid Ligeia, was the most
violently a prey to the tumultuous vultures of stern passion.  And of such
passion I could form no estimate, save by the miraculous expansion of those
eyes which at once so delighted and appalled me--by the almost magical
melody, modulation, distinctness and placidity of her very low voice--and
by the fierce energy (rendered doubly effective by contrast with her manner
of utterance) of the wild words which she habitully uttered.

I have spoken of the learning of Ligeia: it was immense--such as I have never
known in woman. In the classical tongues was she deeply proficient, and as
far as my own acquaintance extended in regard to the modern dialects of
Europe, I have never known her at fault.  Indeed upon any theme of the most
admired, because simply the most abstruse of the boasted erudition of the
academy, have I ever found Ligeia at fault?  How singularly--how thrillingly,
this one point in the nature of my wife has forced itself, at this late
period only, upon my attention!  I said her knowledge was such as I have
never known in woman--but where breathes the man who has traversed, and
successfully, all the wide areas of moral, physical, and mathematical
science?  I saw not then what I now clearly perceive, that the acquisitions
of Ligeia were gigantic, were astounding; yet I was sufficiently aware of
her infinite supremacy to resign myself, with a childlike confidence, to
her guidance through the chaotic world of metaphysical investigation at
which I was most busily occupied during the earlier years of our marriage.
With how vast a triumph--with how vivid a delight--with how much of all that
is ethereal in hope--did I feel, as she bent over me in studies but little
sought--but less know--that delicious vista by slow degrees expanding before
me, down whose long, gorgeous, and all untrodden path, I might at length
pass onward to the goal of a wisdom too divinely precious not to be forbidden!

How poignant, then, must have been the grief with which, after some years,
Ibeheld my well-grounded expectations take wings to themselves and fly away!
Without Ligeia I was but as a child groping benighted.  Her presence, her
readings alone, rendered vividly luminous the many mysteries of the 
transcendentalism in which we were immersed.  Wanting the radiant lustre
of her eyes, letters, lambent and golden, grew duller than Saturnian lead.
And now those eyes shone less and less frequently upon the pages over which
I pored.  Ligeia grew ill.  The wild eyes blazed with a too--too glorious
effulgence; the pale fingers became of th transparent waxen hue of the grave,
and the blue veins upon the lofty forehead swelled and sank impetuously with
the tides of the most gentle emotion.  I saw that she must die--and I
struggled desperately in spirit with the grim Azrael.  And the struggles of
the passionate wife were, to my astonishment, even more energetic than my
own.  There had been much in her stern nature to impress me with the belief
that, to her, death would have come without its terrors;--but not so.  Words
are very imptent to convey any just idea of the fierceness of resistance
with which she wrestled with the Shadow.  I groaned in anguish at the 
pitiable spectacle.  I would have soothed--I would have reasoned; but, in
the intensity of her wild desire for life,--for life--but for life--solace
and reason were alike the uttermost of folly.  Yet not until the last
instance, amid the most convulsive writhings of her fierce spirit, was 
shaken by the external placidity of her demeanor.  Her voice grew more
gentle--grew more low--yet I would not wish to dwell upon the wild meaning
of the quietly uttered words.  My brain reeled as I hearkened entranced,
to a melody more than mortal--to assumptions and aspirations which mortality
had never before known.

That she love me I should not have doubted; and I might have been easily 
aware that, in a bosom such as hers, love woudl have reigned no ordinary
passion.  But in death only, was I fully impressed with the strength of her
affection.  For long hours, detaining my hand, would she pour out before me
the overflowing of a heart whose more than passionate devotion amounted to
idolatry.  How had I deserved to be so blessed by such confessions?--how
had I deserved to be so cursed with the removal of my beloved in the hour of
her making them?  But upon this subject I cannot bear to dilate.  Let me say
only, that in Ligeia's more than womanly abandonment to a love, alas! all
unmerited, all unworthily bestowed, I at length recognized the principal of
her longing with so wildly earnest a desire for the life which was now fleeing
so rapidly away.  It is this wild longing--it is this eager vehemence of desire
for life--but for life--that I have no power to portray--no utterance capable
of expressing.

At high noon on the night in which she departed, beckoning me, peremptorily,
to her side, she bad me repeat certain verses composed by herself not many
days before.  I obeyed her.--They were these:

'O God!' half shrieked Ligeia, leaping to her feet an extending her arms
aloft with a spasmodic movement, as I made an end of these lines--'O God!
O Divine Father! shall these things be undeviatingly so?--shall this
Conqueror be not once conquered?  Are we not part and parcel in Thee?  Who
--who knoweth the mysteries of th will with its vigor?  Man doth not yield
him to the angels, nor unto death utterly, save only through the weakness of
his feeble will.'

And now, as if exhausted with emotion, she suffered her white arms to fall,
and returned solemnly to her bed of death.  And as she breathed her last
sighs, there came mingled with them a low murmer from her lips.  I bent to
them my ear and distinguished, again, the concluding words of the passage
in Glandvill--'Man doth not yield him to the angels, nor unto death utterly,
save only through the weakness of his feeble will.'

She died;--and I, crushed into the very dust with sorrow, could no longer
endure the lonely desolation of my dwelling in the dim and decaying city
by the Rhine.  I had no lack of what the world calls wealth.  Ligeia had
brought me far more, very far more than ordinarily falls the lot of mortals.
After a few months, therefore, of weary and aimless wandering, I purchased,
and put in some repair, an abbey, which I shall not name, in one of the
wildest and least frequented portions of fair England.  The gloomy and dreary
grandeur of the building, the almost savage aspect of the domain, the many
melancholy and time-honored memories connected with both, had much in unison
with the feelings of utter abandonment which had driven me into that remote
and unsocial region of the country.  Yet although the external abbey, with
its verdant decay hanging about it, suffered but little alteration, I gave
way, with a child-like perversity, and perchance with a faint hope of
alleviating my sorrows, to a display of more than regal magnificence within.
--For such follies, even in childhood, I had imbibed a tast and now they
came back to me as in the dotage of grief.  Alas, I feel how much even of
incipient madness might have been discovered in the gorgeous and fantastic
draperies, in the solemn carving of Egypt, in the wild cornices and furniture,
in the Bedlam patterns of the carpets of tufted gold!  I had become a bounden
slave in the trammels of opium, and my labors and my orders had taken a 
coloring from my dreams.  But these absurdities I must not pause to detail.
Let me speak only of that one chamber, ever accursed, whither in a moment of
mental alienation, I lead from the altar as my bride--as the successor of the
unforgotten Ligeia--the fair-haired and blue-eyed Lady Rowena Trevanion,
of Tremaine.

There is no individual portion of the architecture and decoration of that
bridal chamber which is not now visibly before me.  Where were the souls of
the haughty family of the bride, when, through thirst of gold, they permitted
to pass the threshold of an apartment so bedecked, a maiden and  daughter so
beloved?  I have said that I minutely remember the details of the chamber--yet
I am sadly forgetful on topics of deep moment--and here there was no system,
no keeping, in the fantastic display, to take hold upon the memory.  The room
lay in a high turret of the castellated abbey, was pentagonal in shape, and
of capacious size.  Occupying the whole southern face of the pentagon was the
sole window--an immense sheet of unbroken glass from Venice--a single pane,
and tinted of a leaden hue, so that the rays of either the sun or moon, passing
through it, fell with a ghastly lustre on the objects within.  Over the upper
portion of this huge window, extended the trellice-work of an aged vine, which
clambered up the massy walls of the turret.  The ceiling, of gloomy-looking
oak, was excessively lofty, vaulted, and elaborately fretted with the wildest
and most grotesque specimens of a semi-Gothic, semi-Druidical device.  From
out the most central recess of this melancholy vaulting, depended, by a single
chain of gold with long links, a huge censer of the same metal, Saracenic in
pattern, and with many perforations so contrived that there writhed in and
out of them, as if endued with a serpent vitality, a continual succession
of parti-colored fires.

Some few ottomans and golden candelabra, of Eastern figure, were in various
stations about--and there was the couch, too--the bridal couch--of an Indian
model, and low, and sculptured of solide ebony, with a pall-like canopy above.
In each of the angles of the chamber stood on end a gigantic sarcophagus fo
black granite, from the tombs of the kings over against Luxor, with their
aged lids full of immemorial sculpture.  But in the draping of the apartment
lay, alas! the chief phantasy of all. The lofty walls, gigantic in height--
even unproportionably so--were hung from summit to foot, in vast folds, with
a heavy and massive-looking tapestry--tapestry of a material which was found
alike as a carpet on the floor, as a covering for the ottomans and the ebony
bed, as a canopy for the bed, and as the gorgeous volutes of th curtains which
partially shaded the window.  The material was the richest cloth of gold.  It
was spotted all over, at irregular intervals, with arabesque figures, about a
foot in diameter, and wrought upon the cloth in patterns of the most jetty
black.  But these figurs partook of the true character of the arabesque only
when regarded from a single point of view.  By a contrivance now common, and
indeed traceable to a very remote period of antiquity, they were made 
changeable in aspect.  To one entering the room, they bore the appearance of
simple monstrosities; but upon a farther advance, this appearance gradually
departed; and step by step, as the visiter moved his station in the chamber,
he saw himself surrounded by an endless succession of the ghastly forms which
belong to the superstition of the Norman, or arise in the guilty slumbers of
the monk.  The phantasmagoric effect was vastly heightened by the artificial
introduction of a strong continual current of the wind behind the draperies--
giving a hideous and uneasy animation to the whole.

In halls such as these--in a bridal chamber such as this--I passed, with the
Lady of Tremaine, the unhallowed hours of the first month of our marriage--
passed them with but little disquietude.  That my wife dreaded the fierce 
moodiness of my temper--that she shunned me and loved me but little--I could
not help perceiving; but it gave me rather pleasure than otherwise.  I loathed
her with a hatred belong more to demon than to man.  My memory flew back,
(oh, with what intensity of regret!) to Ligeia, the beloved, the august, the
beautiful, the entombed.  I revelled in recollections of her purity, of her
wisdom, of her lofty, her ethereal nature, of her passionate, her idolatrous
love.  Now, then, did my spirit fully and freely burn with more than all the 
fires of her own.  In the excitement of my opium dreams (for I was habitually
fettered in the shackles of the drug) I would call aloud upon her name, during
the silence of the night, or among the sheltered recesses of the glens by day,
as if, through the wild eagerness, the solemn passion, the consuming ardor
of my longing for the departed, I could restore her to the pathway she had
abandoned--ah, could it be forever?--upon the earth.  

About the commencement of the second month of the marriage, the Lady Rowena
was attacked with sudden illness, from which her recovery was slow.  The fever
which consumed her rendered her nights uneasy; and in her perturbed state of 
half-slumber, she spoke of sounds, and of motions, in and about the chamber 
of the turret, which I concluded had no origin save in the distemper of her
fancy, or perhaps in the phantasmagoric influences of the chamber itself.
She became at length convalescent--finally well.  Yet but a brief period
elapsed, ere a second more violent disorder again threw her upon a bed of
suffering; and from this attack her frame, at all times feeble, never 
altogether recovered.  Her illnesses were, after this epoch, of alarming
character, and of more alarming recurrence, defying alkike the knowledge
and the great exertions of her physicians.  With the increase of the chronic
disease which had thus, apparently, taken too sure hold upon her constitution
to be eradicated by human means, I could not fail to observe a similar
increase in the nervous irritation of her temperament, and in her excitability
by trivial causes of fear.  She spoke again, and now more frequently and
pertinaciously, of the sounds--of the slight sounds--and of the unusual
motions among the tapestries, to which she had formerly alluded.

One night, near the closing in of September, she pressed this distressing
subject with more than usual emphasis upon my attention.  She had just
awakned from an unquiet slumber, and I had been watching, with feelings
half of anxiety, half of vague terror, the workings of her emaciated
countenance.  I sat by the side of her ebony bed, upon one of the ottomans
of India.  She partly arose, and spoke, in an earnest low whisper, of sounds
which she then heard, but which I could not hear--of motions which she then
saw, but which I could not perceive.  The wind was rushing hurriedly behind
the tapestries, and I wished to show her (what, let me confess it, I could
not all believe) that those almost inarticulate breathings, and those very
gentle variations of the figures upon the wall, were but the natural effects
of that customary rushing of the wind.  But a deadly pallor, overspreading
her face, had proved to me that my exertions to reassure her would be 
fruitless.  She appeared to be fainting, and no attendants were within call.
I remembered where was deposited a decanter of light wine which had been
ordered by her physicians, and hastened across the chamber to procure it.
But, as I stepped beneath the light of the censer, two circumstances of a
startling nature attracted my attention.  I had felt that some palpable
although invisible object had passed lightly by my person; and I saw that
there lay upon the golden carpet, in the very middle of the rich lustre 
thrown from th censer, a shadow--a faint, indefinie shadow of angelic aspect--
such as might be fancied for the shadow of a shade.  But I was wild with the
excitement of an immoderate dose of opium, and heeded these things but little,
nor spoke of them to Rowena.  Having found the wine, I recrossed the chamber,
and poured out a goblet-ful, which I held to the lips of the fainting lady.
She had now partially recovered, however, and took th vessel herself, while
I sank upon an ottoman near me, with my eyes fastened upon her person.  It
was then that I became distinctly aware of a gentle foot-fall upon the carpet,
and near the couch; and in a second thereafter, as Rowena was in the act of
raising the wine to her lips, I saw, or may have dreamed that I saw, fall 
within the goblet, as if from some invisible spring in the atmosphere of the
room, three or four large drops of a brilliant and ruby colored fluid.  If
this I saw--not so Rowena.  She swallowed the wine unhesitatingly, and I
forbore ot speak to her of a circumstance which must, after all, I considered,
have been but the suggestion of a vivid imagination, rendered morbidly active
by the terror of the lady, by the opium, and by the hour.

Yet I cannot conceal it from my own perception that, immediately subsequent
to the fall of the ruby-drops, a rapid change for th worse took place in the
disorder of my wife; so that, on the third subsequent night, the hands of her
menials prepared her for the tomb, and on the fourth, I sat alone, with her
shrouded body, in that fantastic chamber which had received her as my bride.
--Wild visions, opium-engendered, flitted, shadow-like, before me.  I gazed
with unquiet eye upon the sarcophagi in the angles of the room, upon the
varying figures of the drapery, and upon the writhing of the parti-colored
fires in the censer overhead.  My eyes then fell, as I called to mind the
circumstances of a former night, to the spot beneath the glare of the censer
where I had seen the faint traces of the shadow.  It was there, however,
no longer; and breathing with greater freedom, I turned my glances to the
pallid and rigid figure upon the bed.  Then rushed back upon me a thousand
memories of Ligeia--and then came back upon my heart, with the turbulent
violence of a flood, the whole of that unuttterable wo with which I had 
regarded her thus enshrouded.  The night waned; and still, with a bosom
full of bitter thoughts of the one only and supremely beloved, I remained
gazing upon the body of Rowena.

It might have been midnight, or perhaps earlier, or later, for I had taken
no note of time, when a sob, low, gentle, but very distinct, startled me
from my revery.--I felt that it came from the bed of ebony--the bed of death.
I listened in an agony of superstitious terror--but there was no repetition of
the sound.  I strained my vision to detect any motion in the corpse--but
there was not the slightest perceptible.  Yet I could not have been deceived.
I had heard the noise, however faint, and my soul was awakened within me.
I resolutely and perseveringly kept my attention riveted upon the body.  Many
minutes elapsed before any circumstance occurred tending to throw light upon
the mystery.  At length it became evident that a slight, a very feeble, and
barely noticeable tinge of color had flushed up within the cheeks, and along
the sunken small veins of the eyelids.  Through a species of unutterable
horror and awe, for which the language of mortality has no sufficiently 
energetic expression, I felt my heart cease to beat, my limbs grow rigid
where I sat.  Yet a sense of duty finally operated to restore my 
self-possession.  I could no longer doubt that we had been precipitate in
our preparations--that Rowena still lived.  It was necessary that some
immediate exertion be made; yet the turret was altogether apart from the
portion of the abbey tenanted by the servants--there were none within call--
I had no means of summoning them to my aid without leaving the room for
many minutes--and this I could not venture to do.  I therefore struggled
along in my endeavors to call back the spirit still hovering.  In a short
period it was certain, however, that a relapse had  taken place; the color
disappeared from both eyelid and cheek, leaving a wanness even more than 
that of marble; the lips became doubly shrivelled and pinhed up in the 
ghastly expression of death; a repulsive clamminess and coldness overspread
rapidly the surface of the body; and all the usual rigorous stiffness 
immediately supervened.  I fell back with a shudder upon the couch from 
which I had been so startlingly aroused, and again gave myself up to 
passionate waking visions of Ligeia.

An hour thus elapsed when (could it be possible?) I was a second time aware
of some vague sound issuing from the region of the bed.  I listened--in
extremity of horror.  The sound came again--it was a sigh.  Rushing to the
corpse, I saw--distinctly saw--a tremorupon the lips.  In a minute afterward
tye relaxed, disclosing a bright line of the pearly teeth.  Amazement now
struggled in my bosom with the profound awe which had hitherto reigned there
alone.  I felt that my vision grew dim, that my reason wandered; and it was
only by a violent effort that I at length succeeded in nerving myself to the
task which duty thus once more had pointed out.  There was now a partial
glow upon the forehead and upon the cheek and throat; a perceptible warmth
pervaded the whole frame; there was even a slight pulsation at the heart.
The lady lived; and with redoubled ardor I betook myself to the task of
restoration.  I chafed and bathed the temples and the hands, and used every
exertion which experience, and no little medical reading, could suggest.
But in vain.  Suddenly, the color fled, the pulsation ceased, the lips
resumed the expression of the dead, and, in an instant afterward, the whole
body took upon itself the icy chilliness, the livid hue, the intense 
rigidity, the sunken outline, and all the loathsome peculiarities of that
which has been, for many days, a tenant of the tomb.

And again I sunk into visions of Ligeia--and again, (what marvel that I 
shudder while I write?) again there reached my ears a low sob from the region
of the ebony bed.  But why shall I minutely detail the unspeakable horrors
of that night?  Why shall I pause to relate how, time after time, until near
the period of the gray dawn, this hideous drama of revification was repeated;
how each terrific relapse wasonly into a sterner and apparently more
irredeemable death; how each agony wore the aspect of a struggle with some
invisible foe; and how each struggle was succeeded by I know not what of wild
change in the personal appearance of the corpse?  Let me hurry to a conclusion.

The greater part of the fearful night had worn away, and she who had been
dead, one again stirred--and now more vigorously than hitherto, although 
arousing from a dissolution more appalling in its utter hopelessness than any.
I had long ceased to struggle or to move, and remained sitting rigidly upon
the ottoman, a helpless prey to a whirl of violent emotions, of which extreme
awe was perhaps the least terrible, the least consuming.  The corpse, I
repeat, stirred, and now more vigorously than before.  The hues of life
flushed up with unwonted energy into the countenance--the limbs relaxed--and,
save that they eyelids were yet pressed heavily together, and that the 
bandages and draperies of the grave still imparted their charnel character
to the figure, I might have dreamed that Rowena had indeed shaken off, utterly,
the fetters of Death.  But if this idea was not, even then, altogether
adopted, I could at least doubt no longer, when, arising from the bed, 
tottering, with feeble steps, with closed eyes, and with the manner of one
bewildered in a dream, the thing that was enshrouded advanced boldly and
palpably into the middle of the apartment.

I trembled not--I stirred not--for a crowd of unutterable fancies connected
with the air, the stature, the demeanor of the figure, rushing hurriedly
through my brain, had paralyzed--had chilled me into stone.  I stirred not--
but gazed upon the apparition.  There was a mad disorder in my thoughts--
a tumult unappeasable.  Could it, indeed, be the living Rowena who confronted
me?  Could it indeed be Rowena at all--the fair-haired, the blue-eyed Lady 
Rowena Trevanion of Tremaine?  Why, why should I doubt it?  The bandage lay
heavily about the mouth--but then might it not be the mouth of the breathing
Lady of Tremaine.  And the cheeks--there were the roses as in her noon of
life--yes, these might indeed be the fair cheeks of the living Lady of 
Tremaine.  And the chin, with its dimples, as in health, might it not be hers?
--but had she then grown taller since her malady?  What inexpressible madness 
seized me with that thought?  One bound, and I had reached her feet!
Shrinking from my touch, she let fall from her head, unloosened, the ghastly
cerements which had confined it, and there streamed forth, into the rushing
atmosphere of the chamber, huge masses of long and dishevelled hair; it was
blacker than the raven wings of the midnight!  And now slowly opened the 
eyes of the figure which stood before me.  'Here than, at least,' I shrieked
aloud, 'can I never--can I never be mistaken--these are the full, and the 
black, and the wild eyes--of my lost love--of the lady--of the LADY LIGEIA.'
