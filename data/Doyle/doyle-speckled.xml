                    VIII.--THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND<lb/></head>
                <head type="sub">BY A. CONAN DOYLE</head>

                <p> In glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the
                    last eight years studied the methods of my friend <persName> Sherlock Holmes
                    </persName>, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange, but
                    none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for
                    the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any
                    investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic. Of
                    all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which presented more
                    singular features than that which was associated with the well-known <persName>
                        Surrey </persName> family of the <persName> Roylotts </persName> of
                        <placeName> Stoke Moran</placeName>. The events in question occurred in the
                    early days of my association with <persName> Holmes </persName>, when we were
                    sharing rooms as bachelors, in <placeName> Baker-street </placeName>. It is
                    possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of
                    secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been freed during the last
                    month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It is
                    perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to
                    know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of <persName> Dr.
                        Grimesby Roylott </persName> which tend to make the matter even more
                    terrible than the truth. </p>
                <p>It was early in April in the <ref target="year_" corresp="year">year ’83</ref>
                    that I woke one morning to find <persName> Sherlock Holmes </persName> standing,
                    fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was a late riser as a rule, and, as the
                    clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter past seven, I
                    blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I
                    was myself regular in my habits.</p>
                <p>“Very sorry to knock you up, <persName> Watson </persName> ," said he, “but it’s
                    the common lot this morning. <persName> Mrs. Hudson </persName> has been knocked
                    up, she retorted upon me, and I on you."</p>
                <p>“What is it, then—a fire?"</p>
                <p>“No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of
                    excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in the sitting-room.
                    Now, when young ladies wander about the <placeName>Metropolis</placeName> at
                    this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I
                    presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate.
                    Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow
                    it from the outset. I thought at any rate that I should call you and give you
                    the chance."</p>
                <p>“My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything."</p>
                <p>I had no keener pleasure than in following <persName>Holmes</persName> in his
                    professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as
                    intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis, with which he unravelled
                    the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes, and was
                    ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A lady
                    dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as
                    we entered.</p>
                <p>“Good-morning, madam," said <persName>Holmes </persName>, cheerily. “My name is
                        <persName>Sherlock Holmes</persName>. This is my intimate friend and
                    associate, <persName>Dr. Watson</persName>, before whom you can speak as freely
                    as before myself. Ha, I am glad to see that <persName>Mrs. Hudson</persName> has
                    had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you
                    a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you are shivering."</p>
                <p>“It is not cold which makes me shiver," said the woman in a low voice, changing
                    her seat as requested.</p>
                <p>“What, then?"</p>
                <p>“It is fear, <persName> Mr. Holmes</persName>. It is terror." She raised her veil
                    as she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of
                    agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless, frightened eyes, like
                    those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of a woman of
                    thirty, <pb n="143" facs="pageImages/Speckled-Band_0143.jpg"/> but her hair was
                    shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard.
                        <persName>Sherlock Holmes</persName> ran her over with one of his quick,
                    all-comprehensive glances.</p>
                <p>“You must not fear," said he soothingly, bending forward and patting her forearm.
                    “We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You have come in by train
                    this morning, I see." </p>
                <p>“You know me, then?"</p>
                <p>“No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left
                    glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart,
                    along heavy roads, before you reached the station."</p>
                <p>The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion.</p>
                <p>“There is no mystery, my dear madam," said he, smiling. “The left arm of your
                    jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The marks are
                    perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that
                    way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the driver."</p>
                <p>“Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct," said she. “I started
                    from home before six, reached <ref target="Leatherhead_" corresp="Leatherhead">

                    I have no one to turn to—none, save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor
                    fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you, <persName>Mr.
                        Holmes</persName>; I have heard of you from <persName>Mrs.
                        Farintosh</persName>, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was
                    from her that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help
                    me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which
                    surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward you for your services,
                    but in a month or six weeks I shall be married, with the control of my own
                    income, and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful."</p>
                <p><persName>Holmes</persName> turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a
                    small case-book, which he consulted.</p>
                <p>"<persName>Farintosh</persName>," said he. “Ah, yes, I recall the case; it was
                    concerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time,
                        <persName>Watson</persName>. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to
                    devote the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend. As to reward,
                    my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever
                    expenses I may be put to, at the time which suits you best. And now I beg that
                    you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon
                    the matter." </p>
                <p>“Alas!" replied our visitor. “The very horror of my situation lies in the fact
                    that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small
                    points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he to whom of all others
                    I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about
                    it as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from
                    his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have heard, <persName>Mr.
                        Holmes</persName>, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of
                    the human heart. <pb n="144" facs="pageImages/Speckled-Band_0144.jpg"/> You may
                    advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me."</p>
                <p>“I am all attention, madam."</p>
                <p>“My name is <persName>Helen Stoner</persName>, and I am living with my
                    stepfather, who is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in
                        <placeName>England</placeName>, the <persName>Roylotts</persName> of

                <p><persName>Holmes</persName> nodded his head. “The name is familiar to me," said
                    he.</p>
                <p>“The family was at one time among the richest in <placeName> England </placeName>
                    , and the estates extended over the borders into <ref target="Berkshire_"

                    a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually
                    completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few
                    acres of ground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed
                    under a heavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living
                    the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather,
                    seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an advance
                    from a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to <ref

                    established a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused by some
                    robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to
                    death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long
                    term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and
                    disappointed man.</p>
                <p>“When <persName>Dr. Roylott </persName> was in <placeName>India </placeName> he
                    married my mother, <persName>Mrs. Stoner</persName>, the young widow of

                    </persName> and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of my
                    mother’s re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money, not less than a
                    thousand year, and this she <ref target="bequeathed_" corresp="bequeathed">
                        bequeathed </ref> to <persName>Dr. Roylott</persName> entirely while we

                    to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return to
                        <placeName> England </placeName> my mother died—she was killed eight years
                    ago in a <ref target="rail_" corresp="rail"> railway accident </ref> near
                        <placeName type="tgn" key="1028972">Crewe</placeName> . <persName>Dr.

                    to live with him in the old ancestral house at <placeName> Stoke Moran
                    </placeName>. The money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants,
                    and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.</p>
                <p>“But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time. Instead of
                    making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at first been
                    overjoyed to see a <persName>Roylott </persName> of <placeName>Stoke Moran
                    </placeName>back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house, and
                    seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross
                    his path. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men
                    of the family, and in my stepfather’s case it had, I believe, been intensified
                    by his long residence in the tropics. A series of disgraceful brawls took place,
                    two of which ended in the police-court, until at last he became the terror of
                    the village, and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense
                    strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger. </p>
                <p>“Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, and it

                    able to avert another public exposure. He had no friends at all save the

                    also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a correspondent, and he
                    has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds
                    and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master. </p>

                    and I had no great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for
                    a long time we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the time of
                    her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has."</p>

                    met there a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My stepfather
                    learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to
                    the marriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the
                    wedding, the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only

                    glanced across at his visitor. </p>
                <p>“Pray be precise as to details," said he. </p>
                <p>“It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is seared into

                    of the buildings. Of these bedrooms the first is <persName> Dr. Roylott’s
                    </persName>, the second my sister’s, and the third my own. There is no

                <p>“The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal night
                        <persName>Dr. Roylott </persName>had gone to his room early, though we knew
                    that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the
                    strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. She left her room,
                    therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her
                    approaching wedding. At eleven o’clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at
                    the door and looked back.</p>
                <p>“‘Tell me, <persName>Helen </persName>,’ said she, ‘have you ever heard anyone
                    whistle in the dead of the night?’ </p>
                <p>“‘Never,’ said I.</p>
                <p>“‘I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?’</p>
                <p>“‘Certainly not. But why?’</p>
                <p>“‘Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the morning,
                    heard a low clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it has awakened me. I
                    cannot tell where it came from—perhaps from the next room, perhaps from the
                    lawn. I thought that I would just ask you whether you had heard it.’</p>
                <p>“‘No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.’ </p>
                <p>“‘Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did not hear it
                    also.’</p>
                <p>“‘Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.’</p>
                <p>“‘Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.’ She smiled back at me,
                    closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock."</p>
                <p>“Indeed," said <persName> Holmes </persName> . “Was it your custom always to lock
                    yourselves in at night?"</p>
                <p>“Always."</p>
                <p>“And why?"</p>
                <p>“I think that I mentioned to you that the Doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon. We
                    had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked."</p>
                <p>“Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement."</p>
                <p>“I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed
                    me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you know how subtle are
                    the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied. It was a wild night.
                    The wind was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing against the
                    windows. Suddenly, amidst all the hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild
                    scream of a terrified woman. I knew that it was my sister’s voice. I sprang from
                    my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my
                    door I <pb n="146" facs="pageImages/Speckled-Band_0146.jpg"/> seemed to hear a
                    low whistle, such as my sister described, and a few moments later a clanging
                    sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen. As I ran down the passage my sister’s
                    door was unlocked and revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it
                    horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. By the light of
                    the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with
                    terror, her hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like
                    that of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that moment
                    her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She writhed as one who
                    is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed. At first I thought
                    that she had not recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out
                    in a voice which I shall never forget, ‘Oh, my God!<persName> Helen</persName>!
                    It was the band! The speckled band!’ There was something else which she would
                    fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of
                    the Doctor’s room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I
                    rushed out, calling loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his
                    room in his dressing-gown. When he reached my sister’s side she was unconscious,
                    and though he poured brandy down her throat, and sent for medical aid from the
                    village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died without having
                    recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my beloved
                    sister."</p>
                <p>“One moment," said <persName>Holmes </persName>, “are you sure about this whistle
                    and metallic sound? Could you swear to it?"</p>
                <p>“That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my strong
                    impression that I heard it, and yet among the crash of the gale and the creaking
                    of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived."</p>
                <p>“Was your sister dressed?"</p>
                <p>“No, she was in her night dress. In her right hand was found the charred stump of
                    a match, and in her left a match-box."</p>
                <p>“Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took
                    place. That is important. And what conclusions did the coroner come to?"</p>
                <p>“He investigated the case with great care, for <persName>Dr. Roylott’s</persName>
                    conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any
                    satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had been fastened
                    upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned <pb n="147"
                        facs="pageImages/Speckled-Band_0147.jpg"/> shutters with broad iron bars,
                    which were secured every night. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown
                    to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with
                    the same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large staples. It
                    is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end.
                    Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her."</p>
                <p>“How about poison?"</p>
                <p>“The doctors examined her for it, but without success."</p>
                <p>“What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?"</p>
                <p>“It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though what it was
                    that frightened her I cannot imagine."</p>
                <p>“Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?"</p>
                <p>“Yes, there are nearly always some there."</p>
                <p>“Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band—a speckled band?"</p>
                <p>“Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium, sometimes
                    that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to these very gipsies
                    in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many
                    of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which
                    she used."</p>
                <p><persName>Holmes </persName> shook his head like a man who is far from being
                    satisfied.</p>
                <p>“These are very deep waters," said he; “pray go on with your narrative."</p>
                <p>“Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately lonelier
                    than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have known for many
                    years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage. His name is<persName>
                        Armitage </persName>—<persName>Percy Armitage</persName>—the second son of
                        <persName>Mr. Armitage </persName>, of <placeName>Crane Water </placeName>,
                    near <placeName> Reading</placeName>. My stepfather has offered no opposition to
                    the match, and we are to be married in the course of the spring. Two days ago
                    some repairs were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall
                    has been pierced, so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my sister
                    died, and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill
                    of terror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I
                    suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the
                    herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be
                    seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed,
                    and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the
                        <placeName>“Crown" inn </placeName>, which is opposite, and drove to
                        <placeName> Leatherhead</placeName>, from whence I have come on this morning
                    with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice."</p>
                <p>“You have done wisely," said my friend. “But have you told me all?"</p>
                <p>“Yes, all."</p>
                <p>“<persName>Miss Roylott </persName>, you have not. You are screening your
                    stepfather."</p>
                <p>“Why, what do you mean?"</p>
                <p>For answer <persName> Holmes </persName> pushed back the frill of black lace
                    which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor’s knee. Five little livid
                    spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white
                    wrist.</p>
                <p>“You have been cruelly used," said<persName> Holmes </persName> .</p>
                <p>The lady coloured deeply and ‘covered over her injured wrist. “He is a hard man,"
                    she said, “and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength."</p>
                <p>There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and
                    stared into the crackling fire.</p>
                <p>“This is a very deep business," he said at last. “There are a thousand details
                    which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course of action. Yet we
                    have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to <placeName>Stoke Moran
                    </placeName> to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without
                    the knowledge of your stepfather?"</p>
                <p>“As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important
                    business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and that there would be
                    nothing to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish,
                    and I could easily get her out of the way."</p>
                <p>“Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?"</p>
                <p>“By no means."</p>
                <p>“Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?"</p>
                <p>“I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town. But I
                    shall return by the twelve o’clock train, so as to be there in time for your
                    coming."</p>
                <p>“And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small business
                    matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?"</p>
                <p>“No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided my trouble to
                    you. I shall look forward to seeing you <pb n="148"
                        facs="pageImages/Speckled-Band_0148.jpg"/> again this afternoon." She
                    dropped her thick black veil over her face and, glided from the room. </p>
                <p>“And what do you think of it all, <persName> Watson </persName>?" asked
                        <persName> Sherlock Holmes </persName>, leaning back in his chair.</p>
                <p>“It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business." </p>
                <p>“Dark enough and sinister enough."</p>
                <p>“Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound, and
                    that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her sister must have
                    been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end."</p>
                <p>“What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar
                    words of the dying woman?"</p>
                <p>“I cannot think."</p>
                <p>“When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a band of
                    gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the fact that we have
                    every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his
                    stepdaughter’s marriage, the dying allusion to a band, and finally, the fact
                    that Miss <persName>Helen Stoner </persName>heard a metallic clang, which might
                    have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling
                    back into their place, I think that there is good ground to think that the
                    mystery may be cleared along those lines."</p>
                <p>“But what, then, did the gipsies do?"</p>
                <p>“I cannot imagine."</p>
                <p>“I see many objections to any such theory."</p>
                <p>“And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to
                        <placeName>Stoke Moran </placeName> this day. I want to see whether the
                    objections are fatal, or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of
                    the devil!"</p>
                <p>The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had
                    been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed himself in the
                    aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the
                    agricultural, having a black top hat, a long frock coat, and a pair of high
                    gaiters, with a hunting crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his hat
                    actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it
                    across from side to side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned
                    yellow with the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to
                    the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high thin fleshless
                    nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey.</p>
                <p>“Which of you is <persName>Holmes </persName>?" asked this apparition.</p>
                <p>“My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me," said my companion quietly. </p>
                <p>“I am Dr. <persName> Grimesby Roylott </persName>, of <placeName>Stoke
                        Moran</placeName> ."</p>
                <p>“Indeed, Doctor," said Holmes blandly. “Pray take a seat."</p>
                <p>“I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I have traced her.
                    What has she been saying to you?"</p>
                <p>“It is a little cold for the time of the year," said <persName> Holmes
                    </persName> .</p>
                <p>“What has she been saying to you?" screamed the old man furiously.</p>
                <p>“But I have heard that the crocuses promise well," continued my companion
                    imperturbably.</p>

                <pb n="149" facs="pageImages/Speckled-Band_0149.jpg"/>
                <p>“Ha! You put me off, do you?" said our new visitor, taking a step forward and
                    shaking his hunting-crop. “I know you, you scoundrel! I have heard of you
                    before. You are <persName> Holmes</persName>, the meddler."</p>
                <p>My friend smiled.</p>
                <p>“<persName>Holmes</persName>, the busybody!"</p>
                <p>His smile broadened.</p>
                <p>“<persName>Holmes</persName>, the <placeName> Scotland </placeName>- yard
                    Jack-in-office!"</p>
                <p><persName>Holmes</persName> chuckled heartily. “Your conversation is most
                    entertaining," said he. “When you go out close the door, for there is a decided
                    draught."</p>
                <p>“I will go when I have said my say. Don’t you dare to meddle with my affairs. I
                    know that Miss <persName>Stoner</persName> has been here- I traced her! I am a
                    dangerous man to fall foul of! See here." He stepped swiftly forward, seized the
                    poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.</p>
                <p>“See that you keep yourself out of my grip," he snarled, and hurling the twisted
                    poker into the fireplace, he strode out of the room.</p>
                <p>“He seems a very amiable person," said <persName> Holmes </persName>, laughing.
                    “I am not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my
                    grip was not much more feeble than his own." As he spoke he picked up the steel
                    poker, and with a sudden effort straightened it out again.</p>
                <p>“Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force!
                    This incident gives zest to our investigation, however, and I only trust that
                    our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to
                    trace her. And now, <persName> Watson </persName>, we shall order breakfast, and
                    afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors’ Commons, where I hope to get some data
                    which may help us in this matter."</p>
                <p>It was nearly one o’clock when <persName> Sherlock Holmes </persName> returned
                    from his excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over
                    with notes and figures.</p>
                <p>“I have seen the will of the deceased wife," said he. “To determine its exact
                    meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments
                    with which it is concerned. The total income, which at the time of the wife’s
                    death was little short of £ 1,100, is now, through the fall in agricultural
                    prices, not more than £ 750. Each daughter can claim an income of £ 250, in case
                    of marriage. It is evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this
                    beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him
                    to a very serious extent. My morning’s work has not been wasted, since it has
                    proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of
                    anything of the sort. And now, <persName> Watson </persName>, this is too
                    serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting
                    ourselves in his affairs, so if you are ready we shall call a cab and drive to
                        <placeName> Waterloo </placeName>. I should be very much obliged if you
                    would slip your revolver into your pocket. An Eley’s No. 2 is an excellent
                    argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a
                    tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need."</p>
                <p>At <placeName>Waterloo </placeName> we were fortunate in catching a train for
                        <placeName> Leatherhead </placeName>, where we hired a trap at the station
                    inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a
                    perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees
                    and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the air
                    was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at least there was a
                    strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest
                    upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in the front of the trap, his arms
                    folded, his hat pulled down over his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast,
                    buried in the deepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the
                    shoulder, and pointed over the meadows.</p>
                <p>“Look there!" said he.</p>
                <p>A heavily- timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a grove
                    at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables
                    and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.</p>
                <p>“<placeName>Stoke Moran</placeName>?" said he.</p>
                <p>“Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr.<persName>Grimesby Roylott</persName>,"
                    remarked the driver.</p>
                <p>“There is some building going on there," said <persName>Holmes</persName>; “that
                    is where we are going."</p>
                <p>“There’s the village," said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs some
                    distance to the left; “but if you want to get to the house, you’ll find it
                    shorter to get over this stile, and so by the footpath over the fields. There it
                    is, where the lady is walking."</p>
                <p>“And the lady, I fancy, is<persName> Miss Stoner</persName>," observed
                        <persName>Holmes</persName>, shading his eyes. “Yes, I think we had better
                    do as you suggest."</p>
                <p>We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to
                        <placeName>Leatherhead</placeName>.</p>
                <pb n="150" facs="pageImages/Speckled-Band_0150.jpg"/>
                <p>“I thought it as well," said <persName>Holmes</persName>, as we climbed the
                    stile, “that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some
                    definite business. It may stop his gossip. Good afternoon, <persName>Miss
                        Stoner</persName>. You see that we have been as good as our word."</p>
                <p>Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke
                    her joy. “I have been waiting so eagerly for you," she cried, shaking hands with
                    us warmly. “All has turned out splendidly. <persName>Dr. Roylott</persName> has
                    gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening."</p>
                <p>“We have had the pleasure of making the Doctor’s acquaintance," said
                        <persName>Holmes</persName>, and in a few words he sketched out what had
                    occurred. <persName>Miss Stoner</persName> turned white to the lips as she
                    listened.</p>
                <p>“Good heavens!" she cried, “he has followed me, then."</p>
                <p>“So it appears."</p>
                <p>“He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will he say
                    when he returns?"</p>
                <p>“He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more cunning than
                    himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him to-night. If he is
                    violent, we shall take you away to your aunt’s at <placeName>Harrow</placeName>.
                    Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us at once to the
                    rooms which we are to examine."</p>
                <p>The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion, and
                    two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side. In one of
                    these wings the windows were broken, and blocked with wooden boards, while the
                    roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little
                    better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds
                    in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that
                    this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected against the
                    end wall, and the stonework had been broken into, but there were no signs of any
                    workmen at the moment of our visit. <persName>Holmes</persName> walked slowly up
                    and down the ill-trimmed lawn, and examined with deep attention the outsides of
                    the windows.</p>
                <p>“This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the centre one
                    to your sister’s, and the one next to the main building to <persName>Dr.
                        Roylott</persName>’s chamber?"</p>
                <p>“Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one."</p>
                <p>“Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does not seem to be
                    any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall."</p>
                <p>“There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room."</p>
                <p>“Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs the
                    corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows in it, of
                    course?"</p>
                <p>“Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through."</p>
                <p>“As you both locked your doors at night your rooms were unapproachable from that
                    side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room, and to bar your
                    shutters?"</p>
                <p><persName>Miss Stoner</persName> did so, and <persName>Holmes</persName>, after a
                    careful examination through the open window, endeavoured in every way to force
                        <pb n="151" facs="pageImages/Speckled-Band_0151.jpg"/> the shutter open, but
                    without success. There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to
                    raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid
                    iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. “Hum!" said he, scratching his chin
                    in some perplexity, “my theory certainly presents some difficulties. No one
                    could pass these shutters if they were bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside
                    throws any light upon the matter."</p>
                <p>A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms
                    opened. <persName>Holmes</persName> refused to examine the third chamber, so we
                    passed at once to the second, that in which <persName>Miss Stoner</persName> was
                    now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a homely
                    little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old
                    country houses. A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow
                    white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of
                    the window. These articles, with two small wickerwork chairs, made up all the
                    furniture in the room, save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The
                    boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so
                    old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the
                    house. <persName>Holmes</persName> drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat
                    silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in
                    every detail of the apartment.</p>
                <p>“Where does that bell communicate with?" he asked at last, pointing to a thick
                    bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying upon the
                    pillow.</p>
                <p>“It goes to the housekeeper’s room."</p>
                <p>“It looks newer than the other things?"</p>
                <p>“Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago."</p>
                <p>“Your sister asked for it, I suppose?"</p>
                <p>“No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we wanted for
                    ourselves."</p>
                <p>“Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You will excuse
                    me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this floor." He threw himself
                    down upon his face with his lens in his hand, and crawled swiftly backward and
                    forward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards. Then he did the same
                    with the woodwork with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to
                    the bed and spent some time in staring at it, and in running his eye up and down
                    the wall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.</p>
                <p>“Why, it’s a dummy," said he.</p>
                <p>“Won’t it ring?"</p>
                <p>“No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You can see now
                    that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the
                    ventilator is."</p>
                <p>“How very absurd! I never noticed that before."</p>
                <p>“Very strange!" muttered <persName>Holmes</persName>, pulling at the rope. “There
                    are one or two very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a
                    builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same
                    trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!"</p>
                <p>“That is also quite modern," said the lady.</p>
                <p>“Done about the same time as the bell-rope?" remarked
                    <persName>Holmes</persName>.</p>
                <p>“Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time."</p>
                <p>“They seem to have been of a most interesting character—dummy bell-ropes, and
                    ventilators which do not ventilate. With your permission, <persName>Miss
                        Stoner</persName>, we shall now carry our researches into the inner
                    apartment."</p>
                <p><persName>Dr. Grimesby Roylott</persName>’s chamber was larger than that of his
                    step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp bed, a small wooden shelf
                    full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair beside the bed, a
                    plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were
                    the principal things which met the eye. <persName>Holmes</persName> walked
                    slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest.</p>
                <p>“What’s in here?" he asked, tapping the safe.</p>
                <p>“My stepfather’s business papers."</p>
                <p>“Oh! you have seen inside, then?"</p>
                <p>“Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers."</p>
                <p>“There isn’t a cat in it, for example?"</p>
                <p>“No. What a strange idea!"</p>
                <p>“Well, look at this!" He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of
                    it.</p>
                <p>“No; we don’t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon."</p>
                <p>“Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a saucer of milk
                        <pb n="152" facs="pageImages/Speckled-Band_0152.jpg"/> does not go very far
                    in satisfying its wants, I daresay. There is one point which I should wish to
                    determine." He squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat
                    of it with the greatest attention.</p>
                <p>“Thank you. That is quite settled," said he, rising and putting his lens in his
                    pocket. “Hullo! here is something interesting!"</p>
                <p>The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of
                    the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself, and tied so as to make a
                    loop of whipcord.</p>
                <p>“What do you make of that, <persName>Watson</persName>?"</p>
                <p>“It’s a common enough lash. But I don’t know why it should be tied."</p>
                <p>“That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it’s a wicked world, and when a
                    clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I think that I have
                    seen enough now, <persName>Miss Stoner</persName>, and, with your permission, we
                    shall walk out upon the lawn."</p>
                <p>I had never seen my friend’s face so grim, or his brow so dark, as it was when we
                    turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked several times up and
                    down the lawn, neither <persName>Miss Stoner</persName> nor myself liking to
                    break in upon his thoughts, before he roused himself from his reverie.</p>
                <p>“It is very essential, <persName>Miss Stoner</persName>," said he, “that you
                    should absolutely follow my advice in every respect."</p>
                <p>“I shall most certainly do so."</p>
                <p>“The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend upon your
                    compliance."</p>
                <p>“I assure you that I am in your hands."</p>
                <p>“In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your room."</p>
                <p>Both <persName>Miss Stoner</persName> and I gazed at him in astonishment.</p>
                <p>“Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village inn over
                    there?"</p>
                <p>“Yes, that is the ‘<placeName>Crown</placeName>.’"</p>
                <p>“Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?"</p>
                <p>“Certainly."</p>
                <p>“You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, when your
                    stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the night, you must
                    open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal
                    to us, and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want
                    into the room which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the
                    repairs, you could manage there for one night."</p>
                <p>“Oh, yes, easily."</p>
                <p>“The rest you will leave in our hands."</p>
                <p>“But what will you do?"</p>
                <p>“We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the cause of
                    this noise which has disturbed you."</p>
                <p>“I believe, <persName>Mr. Holmes</persName>, that you have already made up your
                    mind," said <persName>Miss Stoner</persName>, laying her hand upon my
                    companion’s sleeve.</p>
                <p>“Perhaps I have."</p>
                <p>“Then for pity’s sake tell me what was the cause of my sister’s death."</p>
                <p>“I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak."</p>
                <p>“You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she died from
                    some sudden fright."</p>
                <p>“No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more tangible cause.
                    And now, <persName>Miss Stoner</persName>, we must leave you, for if
                        <persName>Dr. Roylott</persName> returned and <pb n="153"
                        facs="pageImages/Speckled-Band_0153.jpg"/> saw us, our journey would be in
                    vain. Good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may
                    rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you."</p>
                <p><persName>Sherlock Holmes</persName> and I had no difficulty in engaging a
                    bedroom and sitting-room at the <placeName>“Crown" Inn</placeName>. They were on
                    the upper floor, and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate,
                    and of the inhabited wing of <placeName>Stoke Moran Manor House</placeName>. At
                    dusk we saw <persName>Dr. Grimesby Roylott</persName> drive past, his huge form
                    looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him. The boy had some
                    slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar
                    of the doctor’s voice, and saw the fury with which he shook his clenched fists
                    at him. The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring
                    up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.</p>
                <p>“Do you know, <persName>Watson</persName>," said <persName>Holmes</persName>, as
                    we sat together in the gathering darkness, “I have really some scruples as to
                    taking you to-night. There is a distinct element of danger."</p>
                <p>“Can I be of assistance?"</p>
                <p>“Your presence might be invaluable."</p>
                <p>“Then I shall certainly come."</p>
                <p>“It is very kind of you."</p>
                <p>“You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than was
                    visible to me."</p>
                <p>“No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that you saw
                    all that I did."</p>
                <p>“I saw nothing remarkable save the bell rope, and what purpose that could answer
                    I confess is more than I can imagine."</p>
                <p>“You saw the ventilator, too?"</p>
                <p>“Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small
                    opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could hardly pass
                    through."</p>
                <p>“I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke Moran."</p>
                <p>“My dear <persName>Holmes</persName>!"</p>
                <p>“Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister could
                    smell <persName>Dr. Roylott</persName>’s cigar. Now, of course that suggested at
                    once that there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only be
                    a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the Coroner’s inquiry. I
                    deduced a ventilator."</p>
                <p>“But what harm can there be in that?"</p>
                <p>“Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator is made, a
                    cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does not that strike
                    you?"</p>
                <p>“I cannot as yet see any connection."</p>
                <p>“Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?"</p>
                <p>“No."</p>
                <p>“It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that
                    before?"</p>
                <p>“I cannot say that I have."</p>
                <pb n="154" facs="pageImages/Speckled-Band_0154.jpg"/>
                <p>“The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same relative position
                    to the ventilator and to the rope—for so we may call it, since it was clearly
                    never meant for a bell-pull."</p>
                <p>“<persName>Holmes</persName>," I cried, “I seem to see dimly what you are hinting
                    at. We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime."</p>
                <p>“Subtle enough, and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong, he is the first
                    of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. <persName>Palmer</persName> and
                        <persName>Pritchard</persName> were among the heads of their profession.
                    This man strikes even deeper, but I think, <persName>Watson</persName>, that we
                    shall be able to strike deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before
                    the night is over; for goodness’ sake let us have a quiet pipe, and turn our
                    minds for a few hours to something more cheerful."</p>
                <p>About nine o’clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all was dark
                    in the direction of the <placeName>Manor House</placeName>. Two hours passed
                    slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright
                    light shone out right in front of us.</p>
                <p>“That is our signal," said <persName>Holmes</persName>, springing to his feet;
                    “it comes from the middle window."</p>
                <p>As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining that we
                    were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was possible that we
                    might spend the night there. A moment later we were out on the dark road, a
                    chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us
                    through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.</p>
                <p>There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches
                    gaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees, we reached the lawn,
                    crossed it, and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of
                    laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child, who
                    threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the
                    lawn into the darkness.</p>
                <p>“My God!" I whispered; “did you see it?"</p>
                <p><persName>Holmes</persName> was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed
                    like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and
                    put his lips to my ear.</p>
                <p>“It is a nice household," he murmured. “That is the baboon."</p>
                <p>I had forgotten the strange pets which the Doctor affected. There was a cheetah,
                    too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment. I confess that I
                    felt easier in my mind when, after following <persName>Holmes</persName>’
                    example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the bedroom. My
                    companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp on to the table, and
                    cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then
                    creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered into my ear
                    again so gently that it was all that I could do to distinguish the words:</p>
                <p>“The least sound would be fatal to our plans."</p>
                <p>I nodded to show that I had heard.</p>
                <p>“We must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator."</p>
                <p>I nodded again.</p>
                <p>“Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol ready in
                    case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and you in that
                    chair."</p>
                <p>I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.</p>
                <p><persName>Holmes</persName> had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed
                    upon the bed beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a
                    candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.</p>
                <p>How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound, not even
                    the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat open-eyed, within
                    a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension in which I was myself.
                    The shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.
                    (¶ no) From outside came the occasional cry of a night bird, and once at our
                    very window a long drawn, cat-like whine, which told us that the cheetah was
                    indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock,
                    which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they seemed, those quarters!
                    Twelve struck, and one, and two, and three, and still we sat waiting silently
                    for whatever might befall.</p>
                <p>Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the
                    ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong smell of
                    burning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room had lit a dark lantern. I
                    heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the
                        <pb n="155" facs="pageImages/Speckled-Band_0155.jpg"/> smell grew stronger.
                    For half an hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became
                    audible—a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam
                    escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it,
                        <persName>Holmes</persName> sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed
                    furiously with his cane at the bell-pull.</p>
                <p>“You see it, <persName>Watson</persName>?" he yelled. “You see it?"</p>
                <p>But I saw nothing. At the moment when <persName>Holmes</persName> struck the
                    light I heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary
                    eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so
                    savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale, and filled with
                    horror and loathing. </p>
                <p>He had ceased to strike, and was gazing up at the ventilator, when suddenly there
                    broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which I have ever
                    listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and
                    anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the
                    village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from
                    their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood gazing at
                        <persName>Holmes</persName>, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had
                    died away into the silence from which it rose.</p>
                <p>“What can it mean?" I gasped.</p>
                <p>“It means that it is all over," <persName>Holmes</persName> answered. “And
                    perhaps, after all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we shall enter
                        <persName>Dr. Roylott</persName>’s room."</p>
                <p>With a grave face he lit the lamp, and led the way down the corridor. Twice he
                    struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then he turned the
                    handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.</p>
                <p>It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a dark lantern
                    with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron
                    safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat
                        <persName>Dr. Grimesby Roylott</persName> clad in a long grey dressing-gown,
                    his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless
                    Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we
                    had noticed during the day. His chin was cocked upwards, and his eyes were fixed
                    in a dreadful rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a
                    peculiar yellow band, with brownish <pb n="156"
                        facs="pageImages/Speckled-Band_0156.jpg"/> speckles, which seemed to be
                    bound tightly round his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor
                    motion.</p>
                <p>“The band! the speckled band!" whispered <persName>Holmes</persName>.</p>
                <p>I took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to move, and
                    there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed
                    neck of a loathsome serpent.</p>
                <p>“It is a swamp adder!" cried <persName>Holmes</persName>— “the deadliest snake in
                        <placeName>India</placeName>. He has died within ten seconds of being
                    bitten. Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls
                    into the pit which he digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into
                    its den, and we can then remove <persName>Miss Stoner</persName> to some place
                    of shelter, and let the county police know what has happened."</p>
                <p>As he spoke he drew the dog whip swiftly from the dead man’s lap, and throwing
                    the noose round the reptile’s neck, he drew it from its horrid perch, and,
                    carrying it at arm’s length threw it into the iron safe, which he closed upon
                    it.</p>
                <p>Such are the true facts of the death of <persName>Dr. Grimesby
                    Roylott</persName>, of <placeName>Stoke Moran</placeName>. It is not necessary
                    that I should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length,
                    by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her
                    by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at
                        <placeName>Harrow</placeName>, of how the slow process of official inquiry
                    came to the conclusion that the Doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing
                    with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet to learn of the case was told
                    me by <persName>Sherlock Holmes</persName> as we travelled back next day.</p>
                <p>“I had," said he, “come to an entirely erroneous conclusion, which shows, my dear
                        <persName>Watson</persName>, how dangerous it always is to reason from
                    insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word ‘band,’
                    which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the appearance which she
                    had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were sufficient to
                    put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly
                    reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me that whatever
                    danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window
                    or the <pb n="157" facs="pageImages/Speckled-Band_0157.jpg"/> door. My attention
                    was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and
                    to the bell rope which hung down to the bed. The discovery that this was a
                    dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the
                    suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the
                    hole, and coming to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and
                    when I coupled it with my knowledge that the Doctor was furnished with a supply
                    of creatures from <placeName>India</placeName>, I felt that I was probably on
                    the right track. The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be
                    discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever
                    and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity with which such a
                    poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be an advantage. It
                    would be a sharp-eyed coroner indeed who could distinguish the two little dark
                    punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work. Then I
                    thought of the whistle. Of course, he must recall the snake before the morning
                    light revealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the
                    milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this
                    ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would
                    crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the
                    occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but sooner or later
                    she must fall a victim.</p>
                <p>“I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An
                    inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on
                    it, which, of course, would be necessary in order that he should reach the
                    ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord
                    were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallic
                    clang heard by <persName>Miss Stoner</persName> was obviously caused by her
                    stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant.
                    Having once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in order to put the
                    matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss, as I have no doubt that you did
                    also, and I instantly lit the light and attacked it."</p>
                <p>“With the result of driving it through the ventilator."</p>
                <p>“And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other
                    side. Some of the blows of my cane came home, and roused its snakish temper, so
                    that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly
                    responsible for <persName>Dr. Grimesby Roylott</persName>’s death, and I cannot
                    say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience."</p>
