        <p>“To the man who loves art for its own sake," remarked <persName>Sherlock
            Holmes</persName>, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of <ref target="newspaper_"

                <hi rend="italic">The Daily Telegraph</hi>, originally called the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph and Courier</hi>, was <ref target="https://www.gale.com/binaries/content/assets/gale-us-en/primary-sources/newsvault/gps_newsvault_thetelegraphhistoricalarchive_specialcorrespondent_fuller.pdf">established in 1855 as a penny paper</ref>, published daily in London. The paper is still in existence today. The word “telegraph” was included in the name due to the mode by which the paper received its news, which was the newly invented electric telegraph.</note>, “it is frequently
          in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be
          derived. It is pleasant to me to observe, <persName>Watson</persName>, that you have so
          far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good
          enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given
          prominence not so much to the many <hi rend="italic">causes célèbres</hi> and sensational
          trials in which I have figured, but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial
          in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical
          synthesis which I have made my special province."</p>
        <p>“And yet," said I, smiling, “I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of
          sensationalism which has been urged against my records."</p>
        <p>"You have erred, perhaps," he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs, and
          lighting with it the long cherry wood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was
          in a disputatious, rather than a meditative mood— “you have erred perhaps in attempting to
          put colour and life into each of your statements, instead of confining yourself to the
          task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the
          only notable feature about the thing."</p>
        <p>“It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter," I remarked, with some
          coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more than once observed to be a
          strong factor in my friend's singular character.</p>
        <p>“No, it is not selfishness or conceit," said he, answering, as was his wont, my thoughts
          rather than my words. “If I claim full justice for my art, it is because it is an
          impersonal thing—a thing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is
          upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what
          should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales."</p>
        <p>It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on either side of a
          cheery fire in the old room at <placeName>Baker-street</placeName>. A thick fog rolled
          down between the lines of <ref target="dun_" corresp="dun">dun-coloured</ref><note xml:id="dun" target="dun_" type="editorial" resp="editors.xml#AC">

              >"Dun-colored”</ref> is a brownish, dark gray color (or sandy yellow) specifically,
            although the term can also generally mean dull or drab overall. The term derives from a
            particular kind of gene <ref target="https://vgl.ucdavis.edu/test/dun-horse">(the dun
              gene)</ref> found in horses that lightens their coat while keeping the mane, tail, and

            from a societal understanding of what a dun-colored horse looked like.</note> houses,
          and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow
          wreaths. Our gas was lit, and shone on the white cloth, and glimmer of china and metal,
          for the table had not been cleared yet. <persName>Sherlock Holmes</persName> had been<pb
            n="614" facs="pageImages/Copper-Beeches_0614.jpg"/> silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of
          a succession of papers, until at last, having apparently given up his search, he had
          emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.</p>
        <p>“At the same time," he remarked, after a pause, during which he had sat puffing at his
          long pipe and gazing down into the fire, “you can hardly be open to a charge of
          sensationalism, for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself
          in, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense, at all. The small matter
          in which I endeavoured to help <persName>the King of Bohemia</persName>, the singular
          experience of <persName>Miss Mary Sutherland</persName>, the problem connected with the
          man with the twisted lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which
          are outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I fear that you may have
          bordered on the trivial."</p>
        <p>“The end may have been so," I answered, “but the methods I hold to have been novel and of
          interest."</p>
        <p>“Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant public, who could

               setting the type in with the other (usually the right). Therefore, the thumb that held the
               type in place was usually the left, meaning that a compositor would likely form a callus

          shades of analysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial, I cannot blame you, for
          the days of the great cases are past. Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all
          enterprise and originality. As to my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into
          an agency for recovering lost lead pencils, and giving advice to young ladies from
          boarding-schools. I think that I have touched bottom at last, however. This note I had
          this morning marks my zero point, I fancy. Read it! " He tossed a crumpled letter across
          to me.</p>
        <p>It was dated from <placeName>Montague-place</placeName> upon the preceding evening, and
          ran thus:—</p>

      
        <floatingText><body><opener><salute>“Dear Mr. Holmes,</salute></opener>
        <p>—I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I should or should not accept a situation
          which has been offered to me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow, if I
          do not inconvenience you.</p>

        <p>“Do you know the young lady ? " I asked.</p>
        <p>“Not I."</p>
        <p>“It is half-past ten now."</p>
        <p>“Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring."</p>
        <p>“It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You remember that the affair of
          the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious
          investigation. It may be so in this case, also."</p>
        <p>“Well, let us hope so ! But our doubts will very soon be solved, for here, unless I am
          much mistaken, is the person in question."</p>
        <p>As he spoke the door opened, and a young lady entered the room. She was plainly but
          neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a plover’s egg, and with the
          brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world.</p>
        <p>“You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure," said she, as my companion rose to greet
          her; “but I have had a very strange experience, and as I have no parents or relations of
          any sort from whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to
          tell me what I should do."</p>
        <p>“Pray take a seat, <persName>Miss Hunter</persName>. I shall be happy to do anything that
          I can to serve you."</p>
        <p>I could see that <persName>Holmes</persName> was favourably impressed by the manner and
          speech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion, and then composed
          himself with his lids drooping and his finger tips together to listen to her story.</p>
        <p>“I have been a governess for five years," said she, “in the family of <persName>Colonel
            Spence Munro</persName>, but two months ago <persName>the Colonel</persName> received an
          appointment at <placeName type="tgn" key="7013046">Halifax</placeName>, in <placeName type="tgn" key="7005802">Nova Scotia</placeName>, and
          took his children over to <placeName type="tgn" key="7012149">America</placeName> with him, so that I found myself
          without a situation. I advertised, and I answered advertisements, but without success. At
          last the little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my wit’s end as
          to what I should do.</p>
        <p>“There is a well-known agency for governesses in the <placeName>West-end</placeName>
          called Westaway’s, and there I used to call about once a week in order to see whether
          anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was the name of the founder of the
          business, but it is really managed by <persName>Miss Stoper</persName>. She sits in her
          own little office, and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an ante-room, and are
          then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers, and sees whether she has anything
          which would suit them.</p>
        <p>“Well, when I called last week<pb n="615" facs="pageImages/Copper-Beeches_0616.jpg"/> I was shown into the little office as usual,
          but I found that <persName>Miss Stoper</persName> was not alone. A prodigiously stout man
          with a very smiling face, and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over
          his throat, sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at
          the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair, and turned quickly
          to <persName>Miss Stoper</persName>:</p>
        <p>“‘That will do,’ said he, ‘I could not ask for anything better. Capital! capital!’ He
          seemed quite enthusiastic, and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion. He
          was such a comfortable looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.</p>
        <p>‘“You are looking for a situation, miss?' he asked.</p>
        <p>“‘Yes, sir.'</p>
        <p>“‘As governess?’</p>
        <p>“‘Yes, sir.'</p>
        <p>“‘And what salary do you ask?’</p>
        <p>“‘I had four pounds a month in my last place with <persName>Colonel Spence
            Munro</persName>.'</p>
        <p>‘“Oh, tut, tut! Sweating --rank sweating!’ he cried, throwing his fat hands out into the
          air like a man who is in a boiling passion. ‘How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a
          lady with such attractions and accomplishments?’</p>
        <p>“‘My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,’ said I. ‘ A little French, a
          little German, music and drawing-’</p>
        <p>“‘Tut, tut! ’ he cried. ‘This is all quite beside the question. The point is, have you or
          have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have
          not, you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable
          part in the history of the country. But if you have, why, then, how could any gentleman
          ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures ? Your salary with me,
          madam, would commence at a hundred pounds a year.’</p>
        <p>“You may imagine, <persName>Mr. Holmes</persName>, that to me, destitute as I was, such
          an offer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing perhaps the
          look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and took out a note.</p>
        <p>“‘It is also my custom,’ said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes
          were just two little shining slits, amid the white creases of his face, ‘to advance to my
          young ladies half their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of
          their journey and their wardrobe.’</p>
        <p>“It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man. As I was
          already in debt to my tradesmen the advance was a great convenience, and yet there was
          something unnatural about the<pb n="616" facs="pageImages/Copper-Beeches_0616.jpg"/> whole transaction which made me wish to know a
          little more before I quite committed myself. </p>
        <p>“‘May I ask where you live, sir?’ said I.</p>

                (especially the relocation of the mint) established London as the premiere social and
                economic center.</note>. It is the most lovely country, my dear young
          lady, and the dearest old country house.’</p>
        <p>“‘And my duties, sir ? I should be glad to know what they would be.’</p>
        <p>“‘One child—one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if you could see him killing
          cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack! smack ! Three gone before you could wink!’ He
          leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.</p>
        <p>“I was a little startled at the nature of the child’s amusement, but the father’s
          laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.</p>
        <p>“‘My sole duties, then,’ I asked, ‘are to take charge of a single child?’</p>
        <p>“‘No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,' he cried. ‘Your duty would be,
          as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to obey any little commands which my wife
          might give, provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety
          obey. You see no difficulty, heh?’ </p>
        <p>“‘I should be happy to make myself useful.’</p>
        <p>“‘Quite so. In dress now, for example! We are faddy people, you know—faddy but
          kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you, you would not
          object to our little whim. Heh?’</p>
        <p>“‘No,’ said I, considerably astonished at his words.</p>
        <p>“‘Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?’</p>
        <p>“‘Oh, no.’</p>
        <p>“‘Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us.’</p>
        <p>“I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, <persName>Mr. Holmes</persName>, my
          hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut. It has been
          considered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion.</p>
        <p>“‘I am afraid that that is quite impossible,’ said I. He had been watching me eagerly out
          of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow pass over his face as I spoke.</p>
        <p>“‘I am afraid that it is quite essential,’ said he. ‘It is a little fancy of my wife’s,
          and ladies’ fancies, you know, madam, ladies’ fancies must be consulted. And so you won’t
          cut your hair?’</p>
        <p>“‘No, sir, I really could not,’ I answered firmly.</p>
        <p>“‘Ah, very well, then that quite settles the matter. It is a pity, because in other
          respects you would really have done very nicely. In that case, <persName>Miss
            Stoper</persName>, I had best inspect a few more of your young ladies.’</p>
        <p>“The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of
          us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that I could not help
          suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.</p>
        <p>“‘Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?’ she asked.</p>
        <p>“‘If you please, <persName>Miss Stoper</persName>.’</p>
        <p>“‘Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most excellent offers in
          this fashion,’ said she sharply. ‘You can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find
          another such opening for you. Good day to you, <persName>Miss Hunter</persName>.' She
          struck a gong upon the table, and I was shown out by the page.</p>
        <p>“Well, <persName>Mr. Holmes</persName>, when I got back to my lodgings and found little
          enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table, I began to ask myself
          whether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all, if these people had strange fads,
          and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay
          for their eccentricity. Very few governesses in <placeName>England</placeName> are getting
          a hundred a year. Besides, what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by wearing
          it short, and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I was inclined to think that
          I had made a mistake, and by the day after I was sure of it. I had almost overcome my
          pride, so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open,
          when I received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it here, and I will read it
          to you:—</p>

              <salute>‘‘‘Dear Miss Hunter, </salute></opener>
            <p>—<persName>Miss Stoper</persName> has very kindly given me your address, and I write
              from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision. My wife is very
              anxious that you should come, for she has been much attracted by my description of
              you. We are willing to give thirty pounds a quarter, or £120 a year, so as to<pb
                n="617" facs="pageImages/Copper-Beeches_0617.jpg"/> recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you.
              They are not very exacting after all. My wife is fond of a particular shade of
              electric blue, and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning. You
              need not, however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one belonging to my
              dear daughter <persName>Alice</persName> (now in <placeName type="tgn" key="7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>)
              which would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting here or there, or
              amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no inconvenience. As
              regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its
              beauty during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this
              point, and I only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss. Your
              duties, as far as the child is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I
              shall meet you with the dogcart at <placeName>Winchester</placeName>. Let me know your
              train,</p>

        <p>“That is the letter which I have just received, <persName>Mr. Holmes</persName>, and my
          mind is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before taking the final
          step, I should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration."</p>
        <p>“Well, <persName>Miss Hunter</persName>, if your mind is made up, that settles the
          question," said <persName>Holmes</persName>, smiling.</p>
        <p>“But you would not advise me to refuse?"</p>
        <p>“I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a sister of mine apply
          for."</p>
        <p>“What is the meaning of it all, <persName>Mr. Holmes</persName>?"</p>
        <p>“Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion?"</p>
        <p>“Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. <persName>Mr.
            Rucastle</persName> seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that
          his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the<pb n="618" facs="pageImages/Copper-Beeches_0618.jpg"/> matter quiet for fear she
          should be taken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to
          prevent an outbreak."</p>
        <p>“That is a possible solution—in fact, as matters stand, it is the most probable one. But
          in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady."</p>
        <p>“But the money, <persName>Mr. Holmes</persName>, the money!"</p>
        <p>“Well, yes, of course the pay is good— too good. That is what makes me uneasy. Why should
          they give you £120 a year, when they could have their pick for £40? There must be some
          strong reason behind."</p>
        <p>“I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if I
          wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of
          me."</p>
        <p>“Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that your little problem
          promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months. There is
          something distinctly novel about some of the features. If you should find yourself in
          doubt or in danger-"</p>
        <p>“Danger ! What danger do you foresee?"</p>
        <p><persName>Holmes</persName> shook his head gravely. “It would cease to be a danger if we
          could define it," said he. “But at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring me down
          to your help."</p>
        <p>“That is enough." She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her
          face. “I shall go down to <placeName>Hampshire</placeName> quite easy in my mind now. I
          shall write to <persName>Mr. Rucastle</persName> at once, sacrifice my poor hair to-night,
          and start for <placeName>Winchester</placeName> to-morrow." With a few grateful words to
            <persName>Holmes</persName> she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her
          way.</p>
        <p>“At least," said I, as we heard her quick, firm step descending the stairs, “she seems to
          be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself."</p>
        <p>“And she would need to be," said <persName>Holmes</persName>, gravely; “I am much
          mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past."</p>
        <p>It was not very long before my friend’s prediction was fulfilled. A fortnight went by,
          during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction, and wondering what
          strange side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual
          salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something abnormal,
          though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it
          was quite beyond my powers to determine. As to <persName>Holmes</persName>, I observed
          that he sat frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air,
          but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it. “Data ! data !
          data ! " he cried impatiently. “I can’t make bricks without clay." And yet he would always
          wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation.</p>
        <p>The telegram which we eventually received came late one night, just as I was thinking of
          turning in, and <persName>Holmes</persName> was settling down to one of those all-night
          chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over
          a retort and a test-tube at night, and find him in the same position when I came down to
          breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the
          message, threw it across to me.</p>
        <p>“Just look up the trains in <placeName>Bradshaw</placeName>," said he, and turned back to
          his chemical studies.</p>
        <p>The summons was a brief and urgent one.</p>
      <floatingText><body>
        <p>“Please be at the <placeName>‘Black Swan’ Hotel</placeName> at
            <placeName>Winchester</placeName> at midday to-morrow," it said. “Do come! I am at my
          wit’s end.<lb/></p>

        <p>“Will you come with me?" asked <persName>Holmes</persName>, glancing up.</p>
        <p>“I should wish to."</p>
        <p>“Just look it up, then."</p>
        <p>“There is a train at half-past nine," said I, glancing over my Bradshaw. “It is due at
            <placeName>Winchester</placeName> at 11.30."</p>
        <p>“That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my analysis of the
          acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the morning."</p>

        <p>By eleven o’clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old English capital.
            <persName>Holmes</persName> had been buried in the morning papers all the way down, but
          after we had passed the <placeName>Hampshire</placeName> border he threw them down, and
          began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with
          little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining very
          brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man’s
          energy. All over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around
            <placeName>Aldershot</placeName>, the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings
          peeped out from amidst the light green of the new foliage.</p>
        <p>“Are they not fresh and beautiful?" I cried, with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from
          the <ref target="fog_" corresp="fog">fogs</ref> of

        <p>But <persName>Holmes</persName> shook his head gravely.</p>
        <p>“Do you know, <persName>Watson</persName>," said he, “that it is one of the curses of a
          mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to my own special
          subject. You look at these scattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look
          at them, and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation, and of
          the impunity with which crime may be committed there."</p>
        <p>“Good heavens!" I cried. “Who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?"</p>
        <p>“They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, <persName>Watson</persName>,
          founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in
            <placeName>London</placeName> do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the
          smiling and beautiful countryside."</p>
        <p>“You horrify me ! "</p>
        <p>“But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what
          the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child,
          or the thud of a drunkard’s blow, does not beget sympathy and<pb n="619" facs="pageImages/Copper-Beeches_0619.jpg"/>indignation
          among the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word
          of complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock. But
          look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor
          ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the
          hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser.
          Had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in
          <placeName>Winchester</placeName>, I should never have had a fear for her. It is the five
          miles of country which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is not personally
          threatened."</p>
        <p>“No. If she can come to <placeName>Winchester</placeName> to meet us she can get
          away."</p>
        <p>“Quite so. She has her freedom."</p>
        <p>“What can be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?"</p>
        <p>“I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover the facts as far
          as we know them. But which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh
          information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of the

            rests on the site of one of the first Christian churches in England, and the original

        <p>The “<placeName>Black Swan</placeName>" is an inn of repute in the
            <placeName>High-street</placeName>, at no distance from the station, and there we found
          the young lady waiting for us. She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us
          upon the table.</p>
        <p>“I am so delighted that you have come," she said, earnestly. “It is so very kind of you
          both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your advice will be altogether invaluable
          to me."</p>
        <p>“Pray tell us what has happened to you."</p>
        <p>“I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised <persName>Mr. Rucastle</persName>
          to be back before three. I got his leave to come into town this morning, though he little
          knew for what purpose."</p>
        <p>“Let us have everything in its due order." <persName>Holmes</persName> thrust his long
          thin legs out towards the fire, and composed himself to listen.</p>
        <p>“In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no actual
          ill-treatment from <persName>Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle</persName>. It is only fair to them to
          say that. But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my mind about them."</p>
        <p>“What can you not understand?" </p>
        <p>“Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it occurred. When I
          came down <persName>Mr. Rucastle</persName> met me here, and drove me in his dogcart to
            <placeName>the Copper Beeches</placeName>. It is, as he said, beautifully situated, but
          it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but
          all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds round it, woods on
          three sides, and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the
          <placeName>Southampton</placeName> high road, which curves<pb n="620" facs="pageImages/Copper-Beeches_0620.jpg"/>past about a
          hundred yards from the front door. This ground in front belongs to the house, but the
          woods all round are part of <persName>Lord Southerton</persName>’s preserves. A clump of
          copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.</p>
        <p>“I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was introduced by him
          that evening to his wife and the child. There was no truth, <persName>Mr.
            Holmes</persName>, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at
            <placeName>Baker-street</placeName>. <persName>Mrs. Rucastle</persName> is not mad. I
          found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more than
          thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their
          conversation I have gathered that they have been married about seven years, that he was a
          widower, and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to
            <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>. <persName>Mr. Rucastle</persName> told me in
          private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to
          her step-mother. As the daughter could not have been less than twenty I can quite imagine
          that her position must have been uncomfortable with her father’s young wife.</p>
        <p>“<persName>Mrs. Rucastle</persName> seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in
          feature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse. She was a nonentity. It was
          easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son.
          Her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every little want
          and forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her also in his bluff boisterous fashion,
          and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow,
          this woman. She would often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face.
          More than once I have surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the
          disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so utterly
          spoilt and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small for his age, with a head which is
          quite disproportionately large. His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation
          between savage fits of passion, and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any
          creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and he shows quite
          remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I would
          rather not talk about the creature, <persName>Mr. Holmes</persName>, and, indeed, he has
          little to do with my story."</p>
        <p>“I am glad of all details," remarked my friend, “ whether they seem to you to be relevant
          or not."</p>
        <p>“I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant thing about the
          house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and conduct of the servants. There are
          only two, a man and his wife. <persName>Toller</persName>, for that is his name, is a
          rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. Twice
          since I have been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet <persName>Mr.
            Rucastle</persName> seemed to take no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong
          woman with a sour face, as silent as <persName>Mrs. Rucastle</persName>, and much less
          amiable. They are a most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the
          nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of the building.</p>
        <p>“For two days after my arrival at the <placeName>Copper Beeches</placeName> my life was
          very quiet; on the third, <persName>Mrs. Rucastle</persName> came down just after
          breakfast and whispered something to her husband.</p>
        <p>“‘Oh yes,’ said he, turning to me; ' we are very much obliged to you, <persName>Miss
            Hunter</persName>, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair. I assure
          you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance. We shall now see
          how the electric blue dress will become you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in
          your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely
          obliged.’</p>
        <p>“The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue. It was of
          excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn
          before. It could not have been a better fit if I had been measured for it. Both
            <persName>Mr.</persName> and <persName>Mrs. Rucastle</persName> expressed a delight at
          the look of it which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for me
          in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the
          house, with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair had been placed close
          to the central window, with its back turned towards it. In this I was asked to sit, and
          then <persName>Mr. Rucastle</persName>, walking up and down on the other side of the room,
          began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that I<pb n="621"
            facs="pageImages/Copper-Beeches_0621.jpg"/>have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how
          comical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. <persName>Mrs. Rucastle</persName>,
          however, who has evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with her
          hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an hour or so,
            <persName>Mr. Rucastle</persName> suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the
          duties of the day, and that I might change my dress, and go to little
            <persName>Edward</persName> in the nursery.</p>
        <p>“Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar
          circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the window, and again I laughed
          very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense <hi rend="italics"
            >répertoire</hi>, and which he told inimitably. Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel,
          and, moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page,
          he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of
          a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and to
          change my dress.</p>
        <p>“You can easily imagine, <persName>Mr. Holmes</persName>, how curious I became as to what
          the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They were always very
          careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the window, so that I became consumed with
          the desire to see what was going on behind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible,
          but I soon devised a means. My hand mirror had been broken, so a happy thought seized me,
          and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the
          midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little
          management to see all that there was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There
          was nothing.</p>
        <p>“At least, that was my first impression. At the second glance, however, I perceived that
          there was a man standing in the <placeName>Southampton Road</placeName>, a small bearded
          man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction. The road is an important
          highway, and there are usually people there. This man, however, was leaning against the
          railings which bordered our field, and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my hand¬
          kerchief, and glanced at <persName>Mrs. Rucastle</persName> to find her eyes fixed upon me
          with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am convinced that she had divined that
          I had a mirror in my hand, and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once.</p>
        <p>“‘<persName>Jephro</persName>,' said she, ‘there is an impertinent fellow upon the road
          there who stares up at <persName>Miss Hunter</persName>.’</p>
        <p>“‘No friend of yours, <persName>Miss Hunter</persName>?’ he asked.</p>
        <p>“‘No; I know no one in these parts.’</p>
        <p>‘“Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round, and motion to him to go away!’</p>
        <p>“‘Surely it would be better to take no notice.’</p>
        <p>“‘No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round, and wave him away
          like that.'</p>
        <p>“I did as I was told, and at the same instant <persName>Mrs. Rucastle</persName> drew
          down the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again in the
          window, nor have<pb n="622" facs="pageImages/Copper-Beeches_0622.jpg"/>I worn the blue
          dress, nor seen the man in the road.’'</p>
        <p>“Pray continue," said <persName>Holmes</persName>. “Your narrative promises to be a most
          interesting one."</p>
        <p>“You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to be little relation
          between the different incidents of which I speak. On the very first day that I was at the
            <placeName>Copper Beeches</placeName>, <persName>Mr. Rucastle</persName> took me to a
          small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the sharp
          rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving about.</p>
        <p>“‘Look in here!’ said <persName>Mr. Rucastle</persName>, showing me a slit between two
          planks. ‘Is he not a beauty?’</p>
        <p>“I looked through, and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague figure huddled
          up in the darkness.</p>
        <p>“‘Don’t be frightened,’ said my employer, laughing at the start which I had given. ‘ It’s
          only <persName>Carlo</persName>, my <ref target="mastiff_" corresp="mastiff">mastiff</ref><note xml:id="mastiff" target="mastiff_" type="editorial" resp="editors.xml#NJA"> A mastiff is a

          call him mine, but really old <persName>Toller</persName>, my groom, is the only man who
          can do anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is
          always as <ref target="keen_" corresp="keen">keen as mustard</ref><note xml:id="keen" target="keen_" type="editorial" resp="editors.xml#NJA"> Keen as mustard

            <persName>Toller</persName> lets him loose every night, and <persName>God</persName>
          help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness' sake don’t you ever on any
          pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it is as much as your life is
          worth.’</p>
        <p>“The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look out of my bedroom
          window about two o'clock in the morning. It was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn
          in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was standing, wrapt
          in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was moving under the
          shadow of the <ref target="beeches_" corresp="beeches">copper beeches</ref><note xml:id="beeches" target="beeches_" type="editorial" resp="editors.xml#NJA"> A copper beech
            is a large, European tree with burgundy leaves that turn into a shade of copper by
            Autumn.</note>. As it emerged into
          the moonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted,
          with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly across the
          lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side. That dreadful silent sentinel sent
          a chill to my heart which I do not think that any burglar could have done.</p>
        <p>“And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you know, cut off my
          hair in <placeName>London</placeName>, and I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom
          of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining
          the furniture of my room, and by rearranging my own little things. There was an old chest
          of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. I had
          filled the two first with my linen, and, as I had still much to pack away, I was naturally
          annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It struck me that it might have been
          fastened by a mere oversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The
          very first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one thing
          in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It was my coil of hair.</p>
        <p>“I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and the same thickness.
          But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me. How <hi rend="italics"
            >could</hi> my hair have been locked in the drawer?<pb n="623"
            facs="pageImages/Copper-Beeches_0623.jpg"/>With trembling hands I undid my trunk turned
          out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together,
          and I assure you that they were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I
          could make nothing at all of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and
          I said nothing of the matter to the <persName>Rucastles</persName>, as I felt that I had
          put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked.</p>
        <p>“I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, <persName>Mr. Holmes</persName>, and
          I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was one wing, however,
          which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door which faced that which led into the
          quarters of the <persName>Tollers</persName> opened into this suite, but it was invariably
          locked. One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met <persName>Mr. Rucastle</persName>
          coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him
          a very different person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were
          red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his temples with
          passion. He locked the door, and hurried past me without a word or a look.</p>
        <p>“This aroused my curiosity ; so when I went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge,
          I strolled round to the side from which I could see the windows of this part of the house.
          There were four of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was
          shuttered up. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down, glancing at
          them occasionally, <persName>Mr. Rucastle</persName> came out to me, looking as merry and
          jovial as ever.</p>
        <p>“Ah!' said he, ‘you must not think me rude if I passed you without a word, my dear young
          lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.’</p>
        <p>“I assured him that I was not offended. ‘By the way,’ said I, ‘you seem to have quite a
          suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the shutters up.’</p>
        <p>“ He looked surprised, and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my remark.</p>
        <p>“‘Photography is one of my hobbies,’ said he. ‘ I have made my <ref target="darkroom_"
          corresp="darkroom">dark room</ref><note xml:id="darkroom" target="darkroom_" type="gloss" resp="editors.xml#NJA"> A darkroom is
            where photographers process their photos and films, as they are light-sensitive material
            and need to be in a room that is completely dark.</note> up there. But, dear me ! what an observant young lady we
          have come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever believed it?’ He spoke in
          a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me. I read suspicion
          there, and annoyance, but no jest.</p>
        <p>“Well, <persName>Mr. Holmes</persName>, from the moment that I understood that there was
          something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all on fire to go over
          them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my share of that. It was more a feeling of
          duty—a feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place. They talk of
          woman’s instinct; perhaps it was woman’s instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate,
          it was there ; and I was keenly on the look-out for any chance to pass the forbidden
          door.</p>
        <p>“It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that, besides <persName>Mr.
            Rucastle</persName>, both <persName>Toller</persName> and his wife find something to do
          in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him
          through the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very
          drunk; and, when I came upstairs, there was the key in the door. I have no doubt at all
          that he had left it there. <persName>Mr.</persName> and <persName>Mrs. Rucastle</persName>
          were both downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an admirable opportunity.
          I turned the key gently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.</p>
        <p>“There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted, which turned at a
          right angle at the further end. Round this corner were three doors in a line, the first
          and third of which were open. They each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with
          two windows in the one, and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening light
          glimmered dimly through them. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had
          been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the
          wall, and fastened at the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and
          the key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window
          outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in
          darkness. Evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the
          passage gazing at this sinister door, and wondering what secret it might veil, I suddenly
          heard the sound of steps within the room, and saw a shadow pass backwards and forwards
          against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door. A mad,
          unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, <persName>Mr. Holmes</persName>. My
          overstrung nerves failed me<pb n="624" facs="pageImages/Copper-Beeches_0624.jpg"
          />​​suddenly, and I turned and ran—ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me,
          clutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the door, and
          straight into the arms of <persName>Mr. Rucastle</persName>, who was waiting outside.</p>
        <p>“‘So,’ said he, smiling, ‘it was you, then, I thought that it must be when I saw the door
          open.’</p>
        <p>“‘Oh, I am so frightened!’ I panted.</p>
        <p>“‘My dear young lady! my dear young lady!’ —you cannot think how caressing and soothing
          his manner was—‘and what has frightened you, my dear young lady?’</p>
        <p>“But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it, I was keenly on my guard
          against him.</p>
        <p>“‘I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,’ I answered. ‘But it is so lonely and
          eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully
          still in there!’</p>
        <p>“‘Only that?’ said he, looking at me keenly.</p>
        <p>“‘Why, what did you think?’ I asked.</p>
        <p>“‘Why do you think that I lock this door?’</p>
        <p>“‘I am sure that I do not know.’</p>
        <p>“‘It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you see?’ He was still smiling
          in the most amiable manner.</p>
        <p>“‘I am sure if I had known—’</p>
        <p>“‘Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over that threshold again—’
          here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with
          the face of a demon, ‘I’ll throw you to the mastiff,’</p>
        <p>“I was so terrified that I do not know what 1 did. I suppose that I must have rushed past
          him into my room, I remember nothing until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all
          over. Then I thought of you, <persName>Mr. Holmes</persName>. I could not live there
          longer without some advice. I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of
          the servants, even of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could only bring you
          down all would be well. Of course I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was
          almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would send you a wire. I put on
          my hat and cloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and
          then returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind as I
          approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered that
            <persName>Toller</persName> had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that
          evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with
          the savage creature, or who would venture to set him free. I slipped in in safety, and lay
          awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in
          getting leave to come into <placeName>Winchester</placeName> this morning, but I must be
          back before three o'clock, for <persName>Mr.</persName> and <persName>Mrs.
            Rucastle</persName> are going on a visit, and will be away all the evening, so that I
          must look after the child. Now I have told you all my adventures, <persName>Mr,
            Holmes</persName>, and I should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means,
          and, above all what I should do."</p>
        <p><persName>Holmes</persName> and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story.
            <pb n="625" facs="pageImages/Copper-Beeches_0625.jpg"/>My friend rose now, and paced up
          and down the room, his hands in his pockets, and an expression of the most profound
          gravity upon his face.</p>
        <p>“Is <persName>Toller</persName> still drunk?" he asked.</p>
        <p>“Yes. I heard his wife tell <persName>Mrs. Rucastle</persName> that she could do nothing
          with him."</p>
        <p>“That is well. And the <persName>Rucastles</persName> go out to-night?"</p>
        <p>“Yes."</p>
        <p>“Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?"</p>
        <p>“Yes, the wine cellar."</p>
        <p>“You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible
          girl, <persName>Miss Hunter</persName>. Do you think that you could perform one more feat?
          I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite exceptional woman."</p>
        <p>“I will try. What is it?"</p>
        <p>“We shall be at the <placeName>Copper Beeches</placeName> by seven o’clock, my friend and
          I. The <persName>Rucastles</persName> will be gone by that time, and
            <persName>Toller</persName> will, we hope, be incapable. There only remains
            <persName>Mrs. Toller</persName>, who might give the alarm. If you could send her into
          the cellar on some errand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate matters
          immensely."</p>
        <p>“ I will do it."</p>
        <p>“Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course there is only one
          feasible explanation. You have been brought there to personate someone, and the real
          person is imprisoned in this chamber. That is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have
          no doubt that it is the daughter, <persName>Miss Alice Rucastle</persName>, if I remember
          right, who was said to have gone to <placeName>America</placeName>. You were chosen,
          doubtless, as resembling her in height, figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been
          cut off, very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of course,
          yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came upon her tresses. The man in
          the road was, undoubtedly, some friend of hers—possibly her <hi rend="italics">fiance</hi>
          —and no doubt as you wore the girl’s dress, and were so like her, he was convinced from
          your laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that <persName>Miss
            Rucastle</persName> was perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions.
          The dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her. So
          much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the case is the disposition of the
          child."</p>
        <p>“What on earth has that to do with it?" I ejaculated.</p>
        <p>“My dear <persName>Watson</persName>, you as a medical man are continually gaining light
          as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don’t you see that the
          converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first real insight into the
          character of parents by studying their children. This child’s disposition is abnormally
          cruel, merely for cruelty’s sake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as
          I should suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their
          power."</p>
        <p>“I am sure that you are right, <persName>Mr. Holmes</persName>," cried our client. “ A
          thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it. Oh, let us
          lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature."</p>
        <p>“We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We can do nothing
          until seven o’clock. At that hour we shall be with you, and it will not be long before we
          solve the mystery."</p>
        <p>We were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the <placeName>Copper
            Beeches</placeName>, having put up our trap at a wayside <ref target="pub_"
              corresp="pub">publichouse</ref><note xml:id="pub" target="pub_" type="editorial" resp="editors.xml#NJA">A public house
                is a pub or tavern where alcoholic beverages are served. These establishments were
                started in England, originally, in the 17th century, and were distinguished from private houses. As noted in <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://www.britannica.com/topic/public-house">Encyclopedia Britannica</ref></hi>A public house was legally required to allow anyone to enter, provided they could pay their way.</note>. The group of trees, with their dark leaves shining
          like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house
          even had <persName>Miss Hunter</persName> not been standing smiling on the doorstep.</p>
        <p>“Have you managed it?" asked <persName>Holmes</persName>.</p>
        <p>A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. “That is <persName>Mrs.
            Toller</persName> in the cellar," said she. “Her husband lies snoring on the kitchen
          rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of <persName>Mr.
          Rucastle’s</persName>."</p>
        <p>“You have done well indeed!" cried Holmes, with enthusiasm. “Now lead the way, and we
          shall soon see the end of this black business."</p>
        <p>We passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and found
          ourselves in front of the barricade which <persName>Miss Hunter</persName> had described.
            <persName>Holmes</persName> cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he tried
          the various keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came from within, and at the
          silence <persName>Holmes’</persName> face clouded over.</p>
        <p>“I trust that we are not too late," said he. “I think, <persName>Miss Hunter</persName>,
          that we had better go in without you. Now, <persName>Watson</persName>, put your shoulder
          to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in."</p>
        <pb n="626" facs="pageImages/Copper-Beeches_0626.jpg"/>
        <p>“It was an old rickety door, and gave at once before our united strength. Together we
          rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no furniture save a little pallet bed, a
          small table, and a basketful of linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner
          gone.</p>
        <p>“There has been some villainy here," said <persName>Holmes</persName>, “this beauty has
          guessed <persName>Miss Hunter’s</persName> intentions, and has carried his victim
          off."</p>
        <p>“But how?"</p>
        <p>“Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it." He swung himself up on to
          the roof. “Ah, yes," he cried, “here’s the end of a long light ladder against the eaves.
          That is how he did it."</p>
        <p>“But it is impossible," said <persName>Miss Hunter</persName>, “the ladder was not there
          when the <persName>Rucastles</persName> went away."</p>
        <p>“He has come back and done it, I tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man. I should
          not be very much surprised if this were he whose step I hear now upon the stain I think,
            <persName>Watson</persName>, that it would be as well for you to have your pistol
          ready."</p>
        <p>The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room, a
          very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his hand. <persName>Miss Hunter</persName>
          screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him, but <persName>Sherlock
            Holmes</persName> sprang forward and confronted him.</p>
        <p>“You villain!" said he, “where's your daughter?"</p>
        <p>The fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.</p>
        <p>“It is for me to ask you that," he shrieked, “you thieves! Spies and thieves! I have
          caught you, have I? You are in my power. I’ll serve you!" He turned and clattered down the
          stairs as hard as he could go.</p>
        <p>"He’s gone for the dog!" cried <persName>Miss Hunter</persName>.</p>
        <p>“ I have my revolver," said I.</p>
        <p>“Better close the front door." cried <persName>Holmes</persName>, and we all rushed down
          the stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound,
          and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen
          to. An elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side
          door.</p>
        <p>“My <persName>God</persName>!" he cried, “Some one has loosed the dog. It’s not been fed
          for two days. Quick, quick, or it’ll be too late!"</p>
        <pb n="627" facs="pageImages/Copper-Beeches_0627.jpg"/>
        <p><persName>Holmes</persName> and I rushed out, and round the angle of the house, with
            <persName>Toller</persName> hurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its
          black muzzle buried in <persName>Rucastle’s</persName> throat, while he writhed and
          screamed upon the ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its
          keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck. With much labour we
          separated them, and carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house. We laid him
          upon the drawing-room sofa, and, having despatched the sobered <persName>Toller</persName>
          to bear the news to his wife, 1 did what I could to relieve his pain. We were all
          assembled round him when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.</p>
        <p>“<persName>Mrs. Toller</persName>!" cried <persName>Miss Hunter</persName>.</p>
        <p>“Yes, miss. <persName>Mr. Rucastle</persName> let me out when he came back before he went
          up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn’t let me know what you were planning, for I
          would have told you that your pains were wasted."</p>
        <p>“Ha!" said <persName>Holmes</persName>, looking keenly at her, “It is clear that
            <persName>Mrs. Toller</persName> knows more about this matter than anyone else."</p>
        <p>“Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know."</p>
        <p>“Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it, for there are several points on which I must
          confess that I am still in the dark."</p>
        <p>“I will soon make it clear to you," said she; “and I’d have done so before now if I could
          ha’ got out from the cellar. If there's police-court business over this, you’ll remember
          that I was the one that stood your friend, and that I was <persName>Miss
            Alice’s</persName> friend too.</p>
        <p>“She was never happy at home, <persName>Miss Alice</persName> wasn’t, from the time that
          her father married again. She was slighted like, and had no say in anything; but it never
          really became bad for her until after she met <persName>Mr. Fowler</persName> at a
          friend’s house. As well as I could learn, <persName>Miss Alice</persName> had rights of
          her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word
          about them, but just left everything in <persName>Mr. Rucastle’s</persName> hands. He knew
          he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward, who would
          ask for all that the law would give him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on
          it, He wanted her to sign a paper so that whether she married or not, he could use her
          money. When she wouldn’t do it, he kept on worrying her until she got brain fever, and for
          six weeks was at death's door. Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with
          her beautiful hair cut off; but that didn’t make no change in her young man, and he stuck
          to her as true as man could be.</p>
        <p>“Ah," said <persName>Holmes</persName>, “I think that what you have been good enough to
          tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that remains.
            <persName>Mr. Rucastle</persName> then, I presume, took to this system of
          imprisonment?"</p>
        <pb n="628" facs="pageImages/Copper-Beeches_0628.jpg"/>
        <p>“Yes, sir."</p>
        <p>“And brought <persName>Miss Hunter</persName> down from <placeName>London</placeName> in
          order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of <persName>Mr. Fowler</persName>."</p>
        <p>“That was it, sir."</p>
        <p>“But <persName>Mr. Fowler</persName> being a persevering man, as a good <ref
          target="seaman_" corresp="seaman">seaman</ref><note xml:id="seaman" target="seaman_" type="gloss" resp="editors.xml#NJA"> A seaman is a

          met you, succeeded by certain arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that
          your interests were the same as his."</p>
        <p>“<persName>Mr. Fowler</persName> was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman," said
            <persName>Mrs. Toller</persName> serenely.</p>
        <p>“And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink, and that a
          ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out."</p>
        <p>“You have it, sir, just as it happened."</p>
        <p>“I am sure we owe you an apology, <persName>Mrs. Toller</persName>," said
            <persName>Holmes</persName>, “for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled
          us. And here comes the country surgeon and <persName>Mrs. Rucastle</persName>, so I think,
            <persName>Watson</persName>, that we had best escort <persName>Miss Hunter</persName>
          back to <placeName>Winchester</placeName>, as it seems to me that our <ref target="locus-standi_"

              it is the right for someone to stand before a court and/or be heard--someone who has standing to bring a case before the court.</note> now is rather a questionable one."</p>
        <p>And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of
          the door. <persName>Mr. Rucastle</persName> survived, but was always a broken man, kept
          alive solely through the care of his devoted wife. They still live with their old
          servants, who probably know so much of <persName>Rucastle’s</persName> past life that he
          finds it difficult to part from them. <persName>Mr. Fowler</persName> and <persName>Miss
            Rucastle</persName> were married, by special licence, in
            <placeName>Southampton</placeName> the day after their flight, and he is now the holder
          of a Government appointment in the <placeName>Island of Mauritius</placeName>. As to
            <persName>Miss Violet Hunter</persName>, my friend <persName>Holmes</persName>, rather
          to my disappointment, manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be
          the centre of one of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at
            <placeName>Walsall</placeName>, where I believe that she has met with considerable
          success.</p>
