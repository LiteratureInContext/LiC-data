                     <note resp="editors.xml#JOB"> Pope published a short, two-canto version of this
                        poem in 1712. He then reworked and republished the poem in a five-canto
                        version in 1714, which is the work that is most read today, and that we reproduce here. The main difference                               between the two is that he added what he called the "apparatus" of fairies and sylphs that surround the human actors in the poem. This text follows the first edition of the 1714 version. The

               designed by Louis du Guernier (1677-1716) a well-known illustrator of the period; he
               also designed the images that appear before each of the five cantos. They were
               engraved by Claude du Bosc (1682-1745?); both men had been born in France but moved
               to London, probably in pursuit of the good opportunities for skilled engravers in the
               London book trade, and worked together on a number of projects for London patrons and
               booksellers in these years. Illustrations as detailed as these were very
               time-consuming and therefore expensive to produce, and the presence of six
               custom-engraved images was a sign that Pope and his publisher Bernard Lintot were
               trying to create a particularly impressive and beautiful object. Pope, who was a
               talented amateur painter in his own right, almost certainly had a role in designing
               the images, although we do not know exactly how he participated. The frontispiece is
               a composite of major events in the poem to follow. The "sylphs," spirits of vanity
               and erotic desire, float around Belinda, the heroine of the poem, as she puts on her
               makeup; they also drop playing cards, alluding to the card game in Canto III, and
               point to the shooting star that ascends at the end of Canto V. In the front lower
               right of the image, a satyr, with pointed ears and cloven hoofs, holds the kind of
               mask that women in the period sometimes wore in public; like many authors in the
               period, Pope is playing on the homophone between "satyr," the sexually-aggressive
               half-human, half-animals of Greek mythology, and "satire," the literary form of which
               "The Rape of the Lock" is an example. Behind the characters is the facade of Hampton
               Court Palace, the royal home down the Thames from London where much of the action of
               the poem takes place. Pope clearly intended the images and the poem to be read
               together, a feature that is not possible in most modern reproductions of the poem,
               which rely on the poetic text alone.</note>

                        Pope’s "The Rape of the Lock" is the most famous poem written in English in
                        the eighteenth century. Chances are, if a modern reader knows only one poem
                        from the period, this is the one. Which is a strange thing. The poem’s
                        subject matter is unusual, even unique: the cutting off of a lock of hair
                        from the head of a young woman and the aftermath of that event. And the poem
                        is written in a form, the heroic couplet, that is rarely used today. But
                        "The Rape of the Lock" has endured because it so fully captured, while also
                        satirizing, an image of a particular world, a world of aristocratic ease,
                        but also great anxiety. And it is also an astonishing accomplishment simply
                        as a poem. No poet of the eighteenth century used the heroic couplet more
                        deftly than Alexander Pope (depicted here in a contemporary painting by
                        Charles Jervis; National Portrait Gallery, London), and perhaps nowhere in
                        his career did he craft couplets and the larger units he built from
                        them—verse paragraphs, cantos, the entire poem itself—with greater verve and
                        delicacy.</p>
                     <p>The poem is based on a true story. At a party one day in 1710 or 1711,
                        Robert Petre, a young man from an aristocratic family, crept up behind
                        Arabella Fermor, a young woman also from a prosperous household, and cut off
                        a lock of her hair. Petre may have thought of this as an amusing, or even a
                        flirtatious prank, but she was angry, and the two families started snubbing
                        and sniping at each other. Years later, Pope described what happened next:
                        “The stealing of Miss Belle Fermor’s hair was taken too seriously, and
                        caused an estrangement between the two families, though they had lived long
                        in great friendship before. A common acquaintance and well-wisher to both
                        desired me to write a poem to make a jest of it, and laugh them together
                        again. It was in this view that I wrote my Rape of the Lock, which was well
                        received and had its effect in the two families.” The “common acquaintance”
                        was John Caryll, a friend of Pope’s who was also close to both the Fermor
                        and Petre families. Like all of them, Caryll was also a Catholic who faced
                        persecution in an era when the government of Britain continued to suspect
                        that Catholics were potentially a subversive force whose loyalties to the
                        Protestant monarchy could not be assured. And sometimes with reason; Caryll
                        was a Jacobite, a supporter of the exiled Pretender, the Stuart James III, then living in exile in France.
                        James continued to claim that he was the true king of Britain, and there were 
                        Jacobites who called for the restoration of the Stuart monarchy until 
                        the movement was finally defeated at the Battle of Culloden in Scotland in 1745. Caryll never
                        joined in any of the conspiracies that took place in the early part of the 
                        century to restore the Stuart monarchy, but he did secretly give financial support to a Catholic
                        church in his neighborhood, which was itself illegal. Caryll may have felt that Catholics in Britain
                        had enough problems without feuding among themselves. Pope, who was at this
                        point starting work on a massive translation of Homer’s poem <hi
                           rend="italic">The Iliad</hi>, seems quickly to have seen the possibility
                        of re-imagining the incident in epic terms, creating what has been called a
                        “mock epic” for the way in which it uses the conventions of epic poetry to
                        describe what is by comparison a trivial event. </p>
                     <p>Pope’s memory of the happy outcome of the poem was, however, a little rose
                        colored from time. Pope wrote the first version of "The Rape of the Lock"
                        quickly—he said it took two weeks; he may have been exaggerating—and it then
                        circulated among the families and their friends in manuscript for a while.
                        That version of the poem, which was much shorter than the one that has
                        ultimately been most read, was published anonymously in 1712, and at this
                        point things got more complicated. As more and more people read the poem now
                        that it was in print, the double entendres and erotic implications of Pope’s
                        work became clearer, and Arabella Fermor—who had initially agreed with
                        letting the poem be printed—was embarrassed as friends started pointing out
                        to her where the dirty jokes were. Sir Charles Brown, the original for the
                        “Sir Plume” of the poem, was also angry at the way he was portrayed (as an
                        idiot). Pope went back to work, and over the course of the next couple of
                        years, added the elaborate “machinery” of the poem, the sylphs and fairies
                        that hover around the action, embedding the original story in a framework of
                        fantasy that deflects some of the agency of the central characters. (Robert
                        Petre’s response to the publication of the first version of the poem is, by
                        the way, unrecorded. Petre married Catherine Walsmeley in 1712, but he died
                        only a few months later from smallpox.) Pope included a letter of dedication
                        to Arabella Fermor that aimed to defuse some of her anger. That new edition,
                        handsomely printed with engravings accompanying each canto, was published as
                        a separate volume in 1714, and immediately became a best-seller, selling

                        >Metamorphoses</hi>, should read, "Ciris et, a tonso est hoc nomen adepta
                     capillo": "She acquired the name from the cutting of the hair." Ovid's story,
                     first published in 8 CE, goes like this. Nisus was the King of Alcathous and he
                     had a lock of purple hair on his crown that (somehow) guaranteed the safety of his
                     kingdom. Scylla, his daughter, fell in love with King Minos, who was conquering
                     the kingdom, and in order to gain his favor, Scylla cut off the lock of her
                     father's hair. But, disgusted with her disloyalty, Minos left by ship. As
                     Scylla swam after Minos, King Nisos, having been transformed into a sea eagle,
                     attempted to drown her. Instead of drowning, Scylla was turned to a sea bird and
                     called Ciris, (i.e. "cutter"), being named after the lock that she cut off. See Ovid's

                  She came to public attention in an unwelcome way when Robert Petre, from another
                  prominent Catholic family, surreptitiously cut off a lock of her hair at a party. 
                  He may have thought it was a good prank, but she was
                  (justifiably) angry, and the Fermor and Petre families (who may have been in
                  negotiations to marry the two), became estranged. John Caryll, a friend of Pope's
                  who was also Robert Petre's guardian, asked Pope to write about the incident in such a
                  way as to make a joke of it and smooth relations. <hi rend="italic">The Rape of
                     the Lock</hi> is Pope's effort to heal the breach. He did not, however, ask
                  Arabella Fermor for her approval before publishing the first version of the poem
                  in 1712, and she was initially unhappy at the poem's double-entendre and the way
                  that it seemed to compare her situation to raped heroines of antiquity like Helen
                  of Troy or Lucrece. This letter, published with the much-enlarged 1714 edition of
                  the poem, can be read in part as Pope's attempt to mollify her.</note>

                  Belinda, to violate your locks, but I am pleased to have granted that much to your

It was an odd combination of Christian mysticism and other kinds of esoteric teaching, such as the Kabbala, which comes out of the Jewish tradition. There were several Rosicrucian manifestos that laid out theories of mystical knowledge, and the movement had adherents and drew curious thinkers to it throughout Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Pope does not seem to have been a serious adherent, but is here using some of the supernatural apparatus associated with Rosicrucianism to frame his story.</note> Doctrine of Spirits.</p>

The Count introduces such things as the Sylphs of the Air, the Undines of the Water, the Gnomes of the Earth and the Salamanders of Fire. It is entirely possible that de Villars is satirizing occult sciences, which had a vogue in seventeenth century Europe, as absurd or incompatible with orthodox religion.

                  understood to be a serious genre, a form of literature. Any reading of a novel for

                     became the dominant empire among European trading empires as it became the
                     first western nation to industrialize. During this time, merchants began
                     trading with both North America and the West Indies, where colonies had been
                     established. This granted Britain access to parts of the world and their
                     amenities that had previously been unbeknownst to them. The ability to interact
                     with far-off countries such as India and Arabia yielded new luxuries and a new

The palace was originally built by Cardinal Wolsey starting in 1514. He gave it to Henry VIII as a way of trying to get back in Henry's good graces, but it did not work; Wolsey was executed anyway for failing to get Henry the divorce he wanted. Henry built Hampton Court into an enormous royal palace. In the late 1600s, the great architect Christopher Wren built an enormous extension for William III. They tore down part of the earlier palace and added on in what was then the modern style, creating a large Baroque palace designed to emulate the Palace of Versailles in France, at that time the grandest royal palace in Europe. In the early part of the eighteenth century, when this poem takes place, Hampton Court was the most important royal palace in England, where the monarch usually lived, and courtiers like Belinda and the Baron would have flocked there to make their presence known at court. <hi rend="italic">Image: Hampton Court Palace by Andreas Tille, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons</hi></note> takes its Name. </l>

                  <note xml:id="ombre" target="ombre_" type="gloss">Ombre was a popular three-player
                     card game similar to the modern game of Bridge. Each game can have nine rounds (“tricks”).
                     The most straightforward way to win is by taking five tricks (drawing the
                     highest-ranked card in each round), after which the game ends. The game begins
                     with an auction to decide the trump suit. The highest-bidding player is the
                     “ombre” (from the Spanish “hombre” for "man"), and the other two play against her while
                     trying to ensure their individual successes. The penalty enacted on each of the
                     two non-ombres is greater if the ombre wins than if the other non-ombre wins.
                     Similarly, the ombre will lose more if either of the two gains five tricks than
                     if no one has won five at the end of nine rounds. The game was  popular among
                     the aristocratic class throughout Europe. The joke throughout is that Belinda is 
                     in effect playing the game of "man," both on the card table and in life. The game as 
                     it plays out over the next section of the poem is an entirely plausible game, with each
                     move following according to the actual rules of ombre. Belinda, for example, wins the starting auction
                     and becomes the "ombre" for duration of this game. See Alban George Henry Gibbs,

                     of human psychology, which held sway from the middle ages into the early modern period,  
                     a person's temperament was set by the mixture of various fluids--humours--in the body.
                     The spleen was thought to produce yellow bile, an excess of which would lead to depression. 
                     So by analogy "the spleen" became shorthand for a state of depression, which Belinda 
                     is experiencing in the wake of the theft of her lock of hair. Umbriel's journey through the Cave
                     of Spleen is analogous to the journeys, fraught with many perils, which Aeneas
                     (in Vergil's <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi>) and Odysseus (Homer's <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi>) made to the

                     century England was a scathing form of satire that attacked a specific person's
                     appearance. It originates from the French word "lampons," which means "let's
                     drink," and Alexander Pope himself lampooned a fellow writer, Joseph Addison,
                     in his work "An Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot." The form fell into disuse soon after
                     this time but the term "lampoon" still refers to an insult directed at a
                     specific person or institution. Werlock, Abby H. P. <hi rend="italic">The Facts on File Companion
