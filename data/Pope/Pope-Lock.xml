                  <note xml:id="n002" target="a002" type="gloss">The full quote, which comes from Book VIII of Ovid's Metamorphoses, should read, "Ciris et, a tonso est hoc nomen adepta capillo": she acquired the name from the cutting of the hair.  Ovid's story, first published in 8 CE, goes like this. Nisus was the King of Alcathous and he had a lock of purple hair on his
                     crown that guaranteed the safety of his kingdom. Scylla, his daughter, fell in
                     love with King Minos, who was conquering this kingdom and in order to gain his
                     favor, Scylla cut off the lock of her father's hair. But, disgusted with her
                     disloyalty, Minos left by ship. As Scylla swam after Minos, King Nisos, having
                     been transformed into a sea eagle, attempted to drown her. Instead of drowning,
                     Scylla was turned to a sea bird and called Ciris, (cutter), being named after
                     the lock that she cut off. See Ovid's Metamorphoses, translated by Anthony S. Kline

               <note xml:id="n003" target="a003" type="gloss">Arabella Fermor (1696-1737) was from a prominent Catholic family, and she came to public attention in an unwelcome way when Robert Petre, from another prominent Catholic family, surreptitiously cut off a lock of her hair. She was (justifiably) angry, and the Fermor and Petre families (who may have been in negotiations to marry the two), became estranged. John Caryll, a friend of Pope's and also Robert Petre's guardian, asked Pope to write about the incident in such a way as to make a joke of it and smooth relations. <hi rend="italic">The Rape of the Lock</hi> is Pope's effort to heal the breach. He did not, however, ask Arabella Fermor for her approval before publishing the first version of the poem in 1712, and she was initially unhappy at the poem's double-entendre and the way that it seemed to compare her situation to raped heroines of antiquity like Helen of Troy or Lucrece. This letter, published with the much-enlarged 1714 edition of the poem, can be read in part as Pope's attempt to mollify her.<media

               <note xml:id="n004" target="a004" type="gloss">Pope is probably referring to the Latin epigraph that appeared with the first edition of the poem: "Nolueram, Belinda, tuos violare capillos, / Sed juvat hoc precibus me
                  tribuisse tuis," by the Roman poet Martial, in his Epigrams xii, 84, translates
                  as, "I was loathe, Belinda, to violate your locks, but I am pleased to have
                  granted that much to your prayers." Pope is insinuating that Arabella Fermor

                  letter to Arabella Fermor. Instead there was a different Latin motto, as noted
                  earlier. Apparently, even though J. Caryll asked Pope to write it, <hi>The Rape of The
                     Lock</hi> was written without the knowledge and permission of Arabella. Upon finding
                  out that it displeased her, Pope wrote this letter to appease her, and with the
                  current Latin phrase at the beginning. Here, he is praising her good nature to

                  into the status of the novel in popular culture at this time. To an English reader of 1714, the word "novel" still sounded like a French import, and it would have denoted a short, perhaps slightly scandalous, love story. The novel was not understood to be a genre capable of intricate themes. Any reading of a novel for more than entertainment is
                  a "mistake" This was a popular stance given how new the form was, not
                  nearly as well established as the 3,000 year old epic poetry of Homer and Virgil.</note>.

                  (1667-1736), the IInd Baron Caryll of Durford. Caryll, Sr. was a close friend of
                  Pope and the guardian of Baron Petre, who was the perpetrator of the crime of
                  cutting off a lock of Arabella's hair in real life. Caryll requested Pope to write

                     sex or not have sex is decided by a seductive whisper. The women are not
                     allowed to decide by their own agency, but must rather be lured to or away from

                     to a religious rite that might take place as a hero prepares for battle in his
                     own ritualized manner. The objects involved in the performance of this "rite"
                     are simple objects with earthly purposes, just as the objects would be with the
                     readying of a hero, thus making this a reference to traditional epic poetry
                     Pope is imitating. Epics always involve otherwordly forces, such as gods, and
                     most actions take place in deference to these forces. Thus, it would not be
                     unusual to perform some form of sacred rite before embarking into battle,
                     whether the battle is one of swords and death or one of mere social

                  <note xml:id="n060" target="a060" type="gloss">During the 18th century, Britain
                     became the dominant empire among European trading empires as it became the
                     first western nation to industrialize. During this time, merchants began
                     trading with both North America and the West Indies, where colonies had been
                     established. This granted Britain access to parts of the world and their
                     amenities that had previously been unbeknownst to them. The ability to interact
                     with far-off countries such as India and Arabia yielded new luxuries and a new
                     understanding of the world outside of Europe. The ability for Belinda to have
                     access to these luxuries further exemplifies her wealth. Morgan, Kenneth.

                     card game similar to modern Bridge. Each game can have nine rounds (“tricks”).
                     The most straightforward way to win is by taking five tricks (drawing the
                     highest-ranked card in each round), after which the game ends. The game begins
                     with an auction to decide the trump suit. The highest-bidding player is the
                     “ombre” (from the Spanish “hombre”), and the other two play against her while
                     trying to ensure their individual successes. The penalty enacted on each of the
                     two non-ombres is greater if the ombre wins than if the other non-ombre wins.
                     Similarly, the ombre will lose more if either of the two gains five tricks than
                     if no one has won five at the end of nine rounds. Gibbs, Alban George Henry.

                     hand is made up of spadillio, manillio, basto, the king of spades, the king and
                     queen of hearts, and the 5 and 4 of diamonds. The Baron begins the game with
                     the king of clubs, the jack, 7, 5, and 3 of spades (the trump suit), the king,
                     queen, and jack of diamonds, and the ace of hearts. Belinda and the Baron both
                     have extremely strong hands, while the third character has no strong cards.

                     century England was a scathing form of satire that attacked a specific person's
                     appearance. It originates from the French word "lampons," which means "let's
                     drink," and Alexander Pope himself lampooned a fellow writer, Joseph Addison,
                     in his work "An Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot." The form fell into disuse soon after
                     this time but the term "lampoon" still refers to an insult directed at a

                     Odysseus's men thought that the bag contained silver and gold, and so their

                     Thalestris believed that she had conceived, and so Alexander and his men
                     departed for Parthia. The realm of Thalestris encompassed the area between the

                     and commemorate the death of Patroclus. This leads many of his men to follow
                     suit and cut off locks of their own hair to place, and Achilles then cuts off
                     another lock of his hair that he had been growing for the river Spercheus to
                     make his trip home safer. This continues the trend throughout the poem of using

                     These gnomes were often poor people in society who needed a place to live, and
