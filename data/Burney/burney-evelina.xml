The extensive plan of your critical observations,—which, not confined to works of utility or ingenuity, is equally open to those of frivolous amusement, and yet worse than frivolous dullness,—encourages me to seek for your protec

tion, since,—perhaps for my sins!—it entitles me to your annotations. To resent, therefore, this offering, howe

ver insignificant, would ill become the universality of your undertaking, tho' not to despise it may, alas! be out of your power.

member, Gentlemen, you were all young writers once, and the most ex

perienced veteran of your corps, may, by recollecting his first publication, re

novate his first terrors, and learn to al

low for mine. For, though Courage is one of the noblest virtues of this nether sphere, and though scarcely more re

quisite in the field of battle, to guard the fighting hero from disgrace, than in the private commerce of the world, to ward off that littleness of soul which leads by steps imperceptible, to all the base train of the inferior passions, and
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:1259700101:9"/>
by which the too timid mind is be

trayed into a servility derogatory to the dignity of human nature;—yet is it a virtue of no necessity in a situation such as mine; a situation which removes, even from cowardice itself, the sting of ignominy;—for surely that Courage may easily be dispensed with, which would rather raise disgust than admi

ration? Indeed, it is the peculiar pri

vilege of an author, to rob terror of contempt, and pusillanimity of re

proach.

In addressing you jointly, I mean but to mark the generous sentiments by

<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>
IN the republic of letters, there is no member of such inferior rank, or who is so much dis

dained by his brethren of the quill, as the humble Novelist: nor is his fate less hard in the world at large, since, among the whole class of writers, perhaps not one can be named, of whom the votaries are more numerous, but less respect

able.
</p>
<p>
Yet, while in the annals of those few of our predecessors, to whom this species of writing is indebted for being saved from contempt, and res

cued from depravity, we can trace such names as Rousseau, Johnson,
<note n="*" place="bottom">
However superior the capacities in which these great writers deserve to be considered, they must par

don me that, for the dignity of my subject, I here rank the authors of Rasselas and Eloïse as Novelists.
</note>
Marivaux, Fielding, Ri

chardson, and Smollet, no man need blush at
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:1259700101:12"/>
starting from the same post, though many, nay, most men, may sigh at finding themselves di

stanced.
</p>
<p>
The following letters are presented to the public—for such, by novel writers, novel read

ers will be called,—with a very singular mix

ture of timidity and confidence, resulting from the peculiar situation of the editor, who, though trembling for their success from a consciousness of their imperfections, yet fears not being in

volved in their disgrace, while happily wrapped up in a mantle of impenetrable obscurity.
</p>
<p>
To draw characters from nature, though not from life, and to mark the manners of the times, is the attempted plan of the following letters. For this purpose, a young female, educated in the most secluded retirement, makes, at the age of seventeen, her first appearance upon the great and busy stage of life; with a virtuous mind, a cultivated understanding, and a feeling heart, her ignorance of the forms, and inexperience in the manners, of the world, occasion all the little incidents which these volumes record, and which form the natural progression of the life of a young woman of obscure birth, but conspicuous beauty, for the first six months after her
<hi>
En

trance into the World.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Perhaps were it possible to effect the total extirpation of novels, our young ladies in gene

ral,
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:1259700101:13"/>
and boarding-school damsels in particular, might profit from their annihilation: but since the distemper they have spread seems incurable, since their contagion bids defiance to the medicine of advice or reprehension, and since they are found to baffle all the mental art of physic, save what is prescribed by the slow regimen of Time, and bitter diet of Experience, surely all attempts to contribute to the number of those which may be read, if not with advantage, at least without injury, ought rather to be encouraged than con

temned.
</p>
<p>
Let me, therefore, prepare for dsiappointment those who, in the perusal of these sheets, enter

tain the gentle expectation of being transported to the fantastic regions of Romance, where Fiction is coloured by all the gay tints of luxurious Ima

gination, where Reason is an outcast, and where the sublimity of
<hi>the Marvellous</hi>
rejects all aid from sober Probability. The heroine of these memoirs, young, artless, and inexperienced, is
<q>
<l>No faultless Monster, that the World ne'er saw,</l>
</q>
but the offspring of Nature, and of Nature in her simplest attire.
</p>
<p>
In all the Arts, the value of copies can only be proportioned to the scarceness of originals: among sculptors and painters, a fine statue, or a beautiful picture, of some great master, may de

servedly employ the imitative talents of younger and inferior artists, that their appropriation to
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:1259700101:14"/>
one spot, may not wholly prevent the more ge

neral expansion of their excellence; but, among authors, the reverse is the case, since the noblest productions of literature, are almost equally at

tainable with the meanest. In books, therefore, imitation cannot be shunned too sedulously; for the very perfection of a model which is frequent

ly seen, serves but more forcibly to mark the in

feriority of a copy.
</p>
<p>
To avoid what is common, without adopting what is unnatural, must limit the ambition of the vulgar herd of authors: however zealous, therefore, my veneration of the great writers I have mentioned, however 1 may feel myself en

lightened by the knowledge of Johnson, charmed with the eloquence of Rousseau, softened by the pathetic powers of Richardson, and exhilarated by the wit of Fielding, and humour of Smollet; I yet presume not to attempt pursuing the same ground which they have tracked; whence, though they may have cleared the weeds, they have also culled the flowers, and though they have rendered the path plain, they have left it barren.
</p>
<p>
The candour of my readers, I have not the impertinence to doubt, and to their indulgence, I am sensible I have no claim: I have, there

fore, only to entreat, that my own words may not pronounce my condemnation, and that what I have here ventured to say in regard to imita

tion, may be understood, as it is meant, in a ge

neral
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:1259700101:15"/>
sense, and not be imputed to an opinion of my own originality, which I have not the vanity, the folly, or the blindness, to entertain.
</p>
<p>
Whatever may be the fate of these letters, the editor is satisfied they will meet with jus

tice; and commits them to the press, though hopeless of fame, yet not regardless of cen

sure.

<p>
CAN there, my good Sir, be any thing more painful to a friendly mind, than a necessity of com

municating disagreeable intelligence? Indeed, it is sometimes difficult to determine, whether the rela

tor or the receiver of evil tidings is most to be pitied.
</p>
<p>
I have just had a letter from Madame Duval; she is totally at a loss in what manner to behave; she seems desirous to repair the wrongs she has done, yet wishes the world to believe her blame

less. She would fain cast upon another the odium of those misfortunes for which she alone is answer

able. Her letter is violent, sometimes abusive, and that of
<hi>you!—you,</hi>
to whom she is under obliga

tions which are greater even than her faults, but to whose advice she wickedly imputes all the suf

ferings of her much injured daughter, the late Lady Belmont. The chief purport of her writing I will acquaint you with; the letter itself is not worthy your notice.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1259700101:17"/>
She tells me that she has, for many years past, been in continual expectation of making a journey to England, which prevented her writing for in

formation concerning this melancholy subject, by giving her hopes of making personal enquiries; but family occurrences have still detained her in France, which country she now sees no prospect of quitting. She has, therefore, lately used her ut

most endeavours to obtain a faithful account of whatever related to her
<hi>ill-advised</hi>
daughter; the result of which giving her
<hi>some reason</hi>
to apprehend that, upon her death bed, she bequeathed an infant orphan to the world, she most graciously says that if
<hi>you,</hi>
with whom
<hi>she understands</hi>
the child is pla

ced, will procure authentic proofs of its relation

ship to her, you may send it to Paris, where she will properly provide for it.
</p>
<p>
This woman is, undoubtedly, at length, con

scious of her most unnatural conduct: it is evident, from her writing, that she is still as vulgar and illi

terate as when her first husband, Mr. Evelyn, had the weakness to marry her; nor does she at all apo

logise for addressing herself to me, though I was only once in her company.
</p>
<p>
This letter has excited in my daughter Mirvan, a strong desire to be informed of the motives which induced Madame Duval to abandon the unfortu

nate Lady Belmont, at a time when a mother's pro

tection was so peculiarly necessary for her peace and her reputation. Notwithstanding I was per

sonally acquainted with all the parties concerned in that affair, the subject always appeared of too de

licate a nature to be spoken of with the principals; I cannot, therefore, satisfy Mrs. Mirvan otherwise than by applying to you.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1259700101:18"/>
By saying that you
<hi>may</hi>
send the child, Madame Duval aims at
<hi>conferring,</hi>
where she most
<hi>owes</hi>
obli

gation. I pretend not to give you advice; you, to whose generous protection this helpless orphan is indebted for every thing, are the best and only judge of what she ought to do; but I am much concern

ed for the trouble and uneasiness which this unwor

thy woman may occasion you.
</p>
<p>
My daughter and my grandchild join with me in desiring to be most kindly remembered to the amiable girl; and they bid me remind you, that the annual visit to Howard Grove, which we were formerly promised, has been discontinued for more than four years.

<head>LETTER II.</head>
<head type="sub">Mr. Villars to Lady Howard.</head>
<opener>
<dateline>Berry Hill, Dorsetshire.</dateline>
</opener>
<p>
YOUR Ladyship did but too well foresee the perplexity and uneasiness of which Madame Du

val's letter has been productive. However, I ought rather to be thankful that I have so many years remained unmolested, than repine at my pre

sent embarrassment; since it proves, at least, that this wretched woman is at length awakened to re

morse.
</p>
<p>
In regard to my answer, I must humbly request your Ladyship to write to this effect:
<q rend="inline">
"That I would not, upon any account, intentionally offend Madame Duval, but that I have weighty, nay un

answerable
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1259700101:19"/>
reasons for detaining her grand-daughter at present in England; the principal of which is, that it was the earnest desire of one to whose will she owes implicit duty. Madame Duval may be assured that she meets with the utmost attention and tenderness; that her education, however short of my wishes, almost exceeds my abilities; and that I flatter myself, when the time arrives that she shall pay her duty to her grand-mother, Madame Duval will find no reason to be dissatisfied with what has been done for her."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Your Ladyship will not, I am sure, be surprised at this answer. Madame Duval is by no means a proper companion or guardian for a young woman: she is at once uneducated and unprincipled; ungen

tle in her temper, and unamiable in her manners. I have long known that she has persuaded herself to harbour an aversion for me—Unhappy woman! I can only regard her as an object of pity!
</p>
<p>
I dare not hesitate at a request from Mrs. Mir

van, yet, in complying with it, I shall, for her own sake, be as concise as I possibly can; since the cruel transactions which preceded the birth of my ward, can afford no entertainment to a mind so humane as her's.
</p>
<p>
Your Ladyship may probably have heard, that I had the honour to accompany Mr. Evelyn, the grand-father of my young charge, when upon his travels, in capacity of tutor. His unhappy mar

riage, immediately upon his return to England, with Madame Duval, then a waiting-girl at a ta

vern, contrary to the advice and entreaties of all his friends, among whom I was myself the most ur

gent to dissuade him, induced him to abandon his native land, and fix his abode in France. Thither he was followed by shame and repentance; feelings
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1259700101:20"/>
which his heart was not formed to support: for, notwithstanding he had been too weak to resist the allurements of beauty, which nature, though a niggard to her of every other boon, had with a la

vish hand bestowed on his wife; yet he was a young man of excellent character, and, till thus unac

countably infatuated, of unblemished conduct. He survived this ill-judged marriage but two years. Upon his death-bed, with an unsteady hand, he wrote me the following note:
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"My friend! forget your resentment, in favour of your humanity;—a father, trembling for the welfare of his child, bequeaths her to your care.—O Villars! hear! pity! and relieve me!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Had my circumstances permitted, I should have answered these words by an immediate journey to Paris; but I was obliged to act by the agency of a friend, who was upon the spot, and present at the opening of the will.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Evelyn left to me a legacy of a thousand pounds, and the sole guardianship of his daughter's person till her eighteenth year, conjuring me, in the most affecting terms, to take the charge of her education till she was able to act with propriety for herself; but in regard to fortune, he left her wholly dependent on her mother, to whose tenderness he earnestly recommended her.
</p>
<p>
Thus, though he would not, to a woman low

bred and illiberal as Mrs. Evelyn, trust the mind and morals of his daughter, he nevertheless thought proper to secure to her that respect and duty which, from her own child, were certainly her due; but, unhappily, it never occurred to him that the mo

ther, on her part, could fail in affection or justice.
</p>
<p>
Miss Evelyn, Madam, from the second to the eighteenth year of her life, was brought up under
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1259700101:21"/>
my care, and, except when at school, under my roof. I need not speak to your Ladyship of the virtues of that excellent young creature. She loved me as her father; nor was Mrs. Villars less valued by her; while to me she became so dear, that her loss was little less afflicting to me than that which I have since sustained of Mrs. Villars herself.
</p>
<p>
At that period of her life we parted; her mo

ther, then married to Monsieur Duval, sent for her to Paris. How often have I since regretted that I did not accompany her thither! protected and supported by me, the misery and disgrace which awaited her, might, perhaps, have been avoided. But—to be brief, Madame Duval, at the instiga

tion of her husband, earnestly, or rather tyran

nically, endeavoured to effect an union between Miss Evelyn and one of his nephews. And, when she found her power inadequate to her attempt, enraged at her non-compliance, she treated her with the grossest unkindness, and threatened her with poverty and ruin.
</p>
<p>
Miss Evelyn, to whom wrath and violence had hitherto been strangers, soon grew weary of this usage; and rashly, and without a witness, con

sented to a private marriage with Sir John Bel

mont, a very profligate young man, who had but too successfully found means to insinuate himself into her favour. He promised to conduct her to England—he did.—O, Madam, you know the rest!—Disappointed of the fortune he expect

ed, by the inexorable rancour of the Duvals, he infamously burnt the certificate of their marriage, and denied that they had ever been united!
</p>
<p>
She flew to me for protection. With what mixed transports of joy and anguish did I again
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1259700101:22"/>
see her! By my advice she endeavoured to procure proofs of her marriage;—but in vain: her cre

dulity had been no match for his art.
</p>
<p>
Every body believed her innocent, from the guiltless tenor of her unspotted youth, and from the known libertinism of her barbarous betrayer. Yet her sufferings were too acute for her tender frame, and the same moment that gave birth to her infant, put an end at once to the sorrows and the life of its mother.
</p>
<p>
The rage of Madame Duval at her elopement, abated not while this injured victim of cruelty yet drew breath. She probably intended, in time, to have pardoned her, but time was not allowed. When she was informed of her death, I have been told, that the agonies of grief and remorse, with which she was seized, occasioned her a severe fit of illness. But, from the time of her recovery to the date of her letter to your Ladyship, I had ne

ver heard that she manifested any desire to be made acquainted with the circumstances which attended the death of Lady-Belmont, and the birth of her helpless child.
</p>
<p>
That child, Madam, shall never, while life is lent me, know the loss she has sustained. I have cherished, succoured, and supported her, from her earliest infancy to her sixteenth year; and so amply has she repaid my care and affection, that my fondest wish is now bounded in the desire of bestowing her on one who may be sensible of her worth, and then sinking to eternal rest in her arms.
</p>
<p>
Thus it has happened that the education of the father, daughter, and grand-daughter has devolved on me. What infinite misery have the two first caused me! Should the fate of the dear survivor be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1259700101:23"/>
equally adverse, how wretched will be the end of my cares—the end of my days!
</p>
<p>
Even had Madame Duval merited the charge she claims, I fear my fortitude would have been unequal to such a parting; but, being such as she is, not only my affection, but my humanity re

coils, at the barbarous idea of deserting the sacred trust reposed in me. Indeed, I could but ill sup

port her former yearly visits to the respectable mansion at Howard Grove; pardon me, dear Ma

dam, and do not think me insensible of the honour which your Ladyship's condescension confers upon us both; but so deep is the impression which the misfortunes of her mother have made on my heart, that she does not, even for a moment, quit my sight, without exciting apprehensions and terrors which almost overpower me. Such, Madam, is my ten

derness, and such my weakness! But she is the only tie I have upon earth, and I trust to your Ladyship's goodness not to judge of my feelings with severity.

<p>
I beg leave to present my humble respects to Mrs. and Miss Mirvan; and have the honour to be,

<head type="sub">Lady Howard to the Rev. Mr. Villars.</head>
<opener>
<dateline>
Howard Grove,
<date>March 8.</date>
</dateline>
<salute>Dear and Rev. Sir,</salute>
</opener>
<p>
YOUR last letter gave me infinite pleasure: after so long and tedious an illness, how grateful to yourself and to your friends must be your return

ing health! You have the hearty wishes of every individual of this place for its continuance and in

crease.
</p>
<p>
Will you not think I talk advantage of your ac

knowledged recovery, if I once more venture to mention your pupil and Howard Grove together? Yet you must remember the patience with which we submitted to your desire of not parting with her during the bad state of your health, though it was with much reluctance we forbore to solicit her company. My grand-daughter, in particular, has scarce been able to repress her eagerness to again meet the friend of her infancy; and for my own part, it is very strongly my wish to manifest the regard which I had for the unfortunate Lady Bel

mont, by proving serviceable to her child; which seems to me the best respect that can be paid to her memory. Permit me, therefore, to lay before you a plan which Mrs. Mirvan and I have formed, in consequence of your restoration to health.
</p>
<p>
I would not frighten you;—but do you think you could bear to part with your young companion for two or three months? Mrs. Mirvan proposes to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1259700101:25"/>
spend the ensuing spring in London, whither, for the first time, my grandchild will accompany her: Now, my good friend, it is very earnestly their wish to enlarge and enliven their party by the ad

dition of your amiable ward, who would share, equally with her own daughter, the care and at

tention of Mrs. Mirvan. Do not start at this pro

posal; it is time that she should see something of the world. When young people are too rigidly sequestered from it, their lively and romantic ima

ginations paint it to them as a paradise of which they have been beguiled; but when they are shown it properly, and in due time, they see it such as it really is, equally shared by pain and pleasure, hope and disappointment.
</p>
<p>
You have nothing to apprehend from her meet

ing with Sir John Belmont, as that abandoned man is now abroad, and not expected home this year.
</p>
<p>
Well, my good Sir, what say you to our scheme? I hope it will meet with your approbation; but if it should not, be assured I can never be dis

pleased at any decision made by one who is so much respected and esteemed as yourself by,

<head type="sub">Mr. Villars to Lady Howard.</head>
<opener>
<dateline>
Berry Hill,
<date>March 12.</date>
</dateline>
</opener>
<p>
I AM grieved, Madam, to appear obstinate, and I blush to incur the imputation of selfishness. In detaining my young charge thus long with myself in the country, I consulted not solely my own in

clination. Destined, in all probability, to possess a very moderate fortune, I wished to contract her views to something within it. The mind is but too naturally prone to pleasure, but too easily yield

ed to dissipation: it has been my study to guard her against their delusions, by preparing her to ex

pect,—and to despise them. But the time draws on for experience and observation to take place of instruc

tion: if I have, in some measure, rendered her capable of using the one with discretion, and mak

ing the other with improvement, I shall rejoice myself with the assurance of having largely con

tributed to her welfare. She is now of an age that happiness is eager to attend,—let her then enjoy it! I commit her to the protection of your Lady

ship, and only hope she may be found worthy half the goodness I am satisfied she will meet with at your hospitable mansion.
</p>
<p>
Thus far, Madam, I chearfully submit to your desire. In confiding my ward to the care of Lady Howard, I can feel no uneasiness from her absence, but what will arise from the loss of her company, since I shall be as well convinced of her safety, as if she were under my own roof;—but, can your Ladyship be serious in proposing to introduce her to the gaieties of a London life? Permit me to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1259700101:27"/>
ask, for what end, or what purpose? A youthful mind is seldom totally free from ambition; to curb that, is the first step to contentment, since to di

minish expectation, is to increase enjoyment. I apprehend nothing more than too much raising her hopes and her views, which the natural vivacity of her disposition would render but too easy to effect. The town acquaintance of Mrs. Mirvan are all in the circle of high life; this artless young creature, with too much beauty to escape notice, has too much sensibility to be indifferent to it; but she has too little wealth to be sought with propriety by men of the fashionable world.
</p>
<p>
Consider, Madam, the peculiar cruelty of her situation; only child of a wealthy baronet, whose person she has never seen, whose character she has reason to abhor, and whose name she is forbidden to claim; entitled as she is to lawfully inherit his fortune and estate, is there any probability that he will
<hi>properly</hi>
own her? And while he continues to persevere in disavowing his marriage with Miss Evelyn, she shall never, at the expence of her mo

ther's honour, receive a part of her right, as the donation of his bounty.
</p>
<p>
And as to Mr. Evelyn's estate, I have no doubt but that Madame Duval and her relations will dis

pose of it among themselves.
</p>
<p>
It seems, therefore, as if this deserted child, though legally heiress to two large fortunes, must owe all her rational expectations to adoption and friendship. Yet her income will be such as may make her happy, if she is disposed to be so in pri

vate life; though it will by no means allow her to enjoy the luxury of a London fine lady.
</p>
<p>
Let Miss Mirvan, then, Madam, shine in all the splendor of high life, but suffer my child still
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1259700101:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to enjoy the pleasures of humble retirement, with a mind to which greater views are unknown.
</p>
<p>
I hope this reasoning will be honoured with your approbation; and I have yet another motive that has some weight with me; I would not wil

lingly give offence to any human being, and surely Madame Duval might accuse me of injustice, if, while I refuse to let her grand-daughter wait upon her, I consent to her joining a party of pleasure to London.
</p>
<p>
In sending her to Howard Grove, not one of these scruples arise; and therefore Mrs. Clinton, a most worthy woman, formerly her nurse, and now my housekeeper, shall attend her thither next week.
</p>
<p>
Though I have always called her by the name of Anville, and reported in this neighbourhood that her father, my intimate friend, left her to my guardianship, yet I have thought it necessary to let her be herself acquainted with the melancholy circumstances attending her birth; for, though I am very desirous of guarding her from curiosity and impertinence, by concealing her name, fa

mily, and story, yet I would not leave it in the power of charce, to shock her gentle nature with a tale of so much sorrow.
</p>
<p>
You must not, Madam, expect too much from my pupil. She is quite a little rustic, and knows nothing of the world; and though her education has been the best I could bestow in this retired place, to which Dorchester, the nearest town, is seven miles distant, yet I shall not be surprised if you should discover in her a thousand deficiencies of which I have never dreamt.

<salute>Dear Madam,</salute>

<p>
THIS letter will be delivered to you by my child,—the child of my adoption,—my affection! Unblest with one natural friend, she merits a thousand. I send her to you, innocent as an an

gel, and artless as purity itself: and I send you with her the heart of your friend, the only hope he has on earth, the subject of his tenderest thoughts, and the object of his latest cares. She is one, Madam, for whom alone I have lately wished to live; and she is one whom to serve I would with transport die! Restore her but to me all innocence as you receive her, and the fondest hope of my heart will be amply gratified!

<dateline>Howard Grove.</dateline>
<salute>Dear and Rev. Sir,</salute>
</opener>
<p>
THE solemn manner in which you have com

mitted your child to my care, has in some mea

sure dampt the pleasure which I receive from the trust, as it makes me fear that you suffer from your compliance, in which case I shall very sin

cerely blame myself for the earnestness with which I have requested this favour; but remember, my good Sir, she is within a few days summons, and be assured I will not detain her a moment longer than you wish.
</p>
<p>You desire my opinion of her.</p>
<p>
She is a little angel! I cannot wonder that you sought to monopolize her. Neither ought you, at finding it impossible.
</p>
<p>
Her face and person answer my most refined ideas of complete beauty: and this, though a subject of praise less important to you, or to me, than any other, is yet so striking, it is not possible to pass it unnoticed. Had I not known from whom she received her education, I should, at first sight of so perfect a face, have been in pain for her understanding; since it has been long and justly remarked, that folly has ever sought alli

ance with beauty.
</p>
<p>
She has the same gentleness in her manners, the same natural grace in her motions, that I formerly so much admired in her mother. Her character seems truly ingenuous and simple; and, at the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1259700101:31"/>
same time that nature hus blessed her with an ex

cellent understanding, and great quickness of parts, she has a certain air of inexperience and in

nocency that is extremely interesting.
</p>
<p>
You have no reason to regret the retirement in which she has lived; since that politeness which is acquired by an acquaintance with high life, is in her so well supplied by a natural desire of ob

liging, joined to a deportment infinitely engaging.
</p>
<p>
I observe with great satisfaction a growing affec

tion between this amiable girl and my grand-daugh

ter, whose heart is as free from selfishness or con

ceit, as that of her young friend is from all guile. Their attachment may be mutually useful, since much is to be expected from emulation, where nothing is to be feared from envy. I would have them love each other as sisters, and reciprocally supply the place of that tender and happy relati

onship to which neither of them have a natural claim.
</p>
<p>
Be satisfied, my good Sir, that your child shall meet with the same attention as our own. We all join in most hearty wishes for your health and happiness, and in returning our sincere thanks for the favour you have conserred on us.

Howard Grove,

</dateline>
</opener>
<p>
BE not alarmed, my worthy friend, at my so speedily troubling you again; I seldom use the ceremony of waiting for answers, or writing with any regularity, and I have at present immediate occasion for begging your patience.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Mirvan has just received a letter from her long-absent husband, containing the welcome news of his hoping to reach London by the be

ginning of next week. My daughter and the Captain have been separated almost seven years, and it would therefore be needless to say what joy, surprise, and consequently confusion, his, at present, unexpected return has caused at Howard Grove. Mrs. Mirvan, you cannot doubt, will go instantly to town to meet him; her daughter is under a thousand obligations to attend her; I grieve that her mother cannot.
</p>
<p>
And now, my good Sir, I almost blush to pro

ceed;—but, tell me, may I ask—will you permit—that your child may accompany them? Do not think us unreasonable, but consider the many in

ducements which conspire to make London the happiest place at present she can be in. The joyful occasion of the journey; the gaiety of the whole party; opposed to the dull life she must lead if left here, with a solitary old woman for her sole companion, while she so well knows the chearfulness and felicity enjoyed by the rest of the family,—are circumstances that seem to merit
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1259700101:33"/>
your consideration. Mrs. Mirvan desires me to assure you, that one week is all she asks, as she is certain that the Captain, who hates London, will be eager to revisit. Howard Grove: and Maria is so very earnest in wishing to have the company of her friend, that, if you are inexora

ble, she will be deprived of half the pleasure she otherwise hopes to receive.
</p>
<p>
However, I will not, my good Sir, deceive you into an opinion that they intend to live in a retired manner, as that cannot be fairly expected. But you have no reason to be uneasy concerning Madame Duval; she has no correspondent in England, and only gains intelligence by common report. She must be a stranger to the name your child bears; and, even should she hear of this excursion, so short a time as a week, or less, spent in town upon so particular an occasion, though previous to their meeting, cannot be con

strued into disrespect to herself.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Mirvan desires me to assure you, that if you will oblige her, her
<hi>two</hi>
children shall equally share her time and her attention. She has sent a commission to a friend in town to take a house for her, and while she waits for an answer con

cerning it, I shall for one from you to our pe

tition. However, your child is writing herself, and that, I doubt not, will more avail than all we can possibly urge.
</p>
<p>
My daughter desires her best compliments to you,
<hi>if,</hi>
she says, you will grant her request, but
<hi>not else.</hi>
</p>
<p>
Adieu, my dear Sir,—we all hope every thing from your goodness.

<p>
THIS house seems to be the house of joy; every face wears a smile, and a laugh is at every body's service. It is quite amusing to walk about, and see the general confusion; a room leading to the garden is fitting up for Captain Mirvan's study. Lady Howard does not sit a moment in a place; Miss Mirvan is making caps; every body so busy!—such flying from room to room!—so many orders given, and retracted, and given again!—nothing but hurry and perturbation.
</p>
<p>
Well but, my dear Sir, I am desired to make a request to you. I hope you will not think me an incroacher; Lady Howard insists upon my writing!—yet I hardly know how to go on; a petition implies a want,—and have you left me one? No, indeed.
</p>
<p>
I am half ashamed of myself for beginning this letter. But these dear ladies are so pressing—I cannot, for my life, resist wishing for the pleasures they offer me,—provided you do not dis

approve them.
</p>
<p>
They are to make a very short stay in town. The captain will meet them in a day or two. Mrs. Mirvan and her sweet daughter both go;—what a happy party! Yet I am not
<hi>very</hi>
eager to accom

pany them: at least, I shall be very well con

tented to remain where I am, if you desire that I should.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1259700101:35"/>
Assured, my dearest Sir, of your goodness, your bounty, and your indulgent kindness, ought I to form a wish that has not your sanction? Decide for me, therefore, without the least apprehen

sion that I shall be uneasy, or discontented. While I am yet in suspense, perhaps I may
<hi>hope,</hi>
but I am most certain, that when you have once determined, I shall not repine.
</p>
<p>
They tell me that London is now in full splen

dour. Two Play-houses are open,—the Opera-House,—Ranelagh,—the Pantheon.—You see I have learned all their names. However, pray don't suppose that I make any point of going, for I shall hardly sigh to see them depart without me; though I shall probably never meet with such ano

ther opportunity. And, indeed, their domestic happiness will be so great,—it is natural to wish to partake of it.
</p>
<p>
I believe I am bewitched! I made a resolution when I began, that I would not be urgent; but my pen—or rather my thoughts, will not suffer me to keep it—for I acknowledge, I must acknowledge, I cannot help wishing for your permission.
</p>
<p>
I almost repent already that I have made this confession; pray forget that you have read it, if this journey is displeasing to you. But I will not write any longer; for the more I think of this affair, the less indifferent to it I find my

self.
</p>
<p>
Adieu, my most honoured, most reverenced, most beloved father! for by what other name can I call you? I have no happiness or sorrow, no hope or fear, but what your kindness bestows, or your displeasure may cause. You will not, I am sure, send a refusal, without reasons unanswerable, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1259700101:36"/>
therefore I shall chearfully acquiesce. Yet I hope—I hope you will be able to permit me to go.

TO resist the urgency of entreaty, is a power which I have not yet acquired: I aim not at an au

Your impatience to fly to a place which your imagination has painted to you in colours so attractive, surprizes me not; I have only to hope that the liveliness of your fancy may not deceive you: to refuse, would be to raise it still higher. To see my Evelina happy, is to see myself without a wish: go then, my child, and may that Heaven which alone can, direct, preserve, and strengthen you! To That, my love, will I daily offer prayers for your felicity; O may it guard, watch over you! defend you from danger, save you from distress, and keep vice as distant from your person as from your heart!

THIS moment arrived. Just going to Drury-Lane Theatre. The celebrated Mr. Garrick per

forms Ranger. I am quite in extacy. So is Miss Mirvan. How fortunate, that he should happen to play! We would not let Mrs. Mirvan rest till she consented to go; her chief objection was to our dress, for we have had no time to
<hi>Londonize</hi>
our

selves; but we teized her into compliance, and so we are to sit in some obscure place, that she may not be seen. As to me, I should be alike unknown in the most conspicuous or most private part of the house.
</p>
<p>
I can write no more now. I have hardly time to breathe—only just this, the houses and streets are not quite so superb as I expected. However, I have seen nothing yet, so I ought not to judge.
</p>
<p>
Well, adieu, my dearest Sir, for the present; I could not forbear writing a few words instantly on my arrival; though I suppose my letter of thanks for your consent is still on the road.
</p>

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1259700101:38"/>
Saturday Night.
</p>
<p>
O my dear Sir, in what raptures am I returned! Well may Mr. Garrick be so celebrated, so univer

sally admired—I had not any idea of so great a performer.
</p>
<p>
Such ease! such vivacity in his manner! such grace in his motions! such fire and meaning in his eyes!—I could hardly believe he had studied a written part, for every word seemed spoke from the impulse of the moment.
</p>
<p>
His action—at once so graceful and so free!—his voice—so clear, so melodious, yet so wonder

fully various in its tones—such animation!—every look
<hi>speaks!</hi>
</p>
<p>
I would have given the world to have had the whole play acted over again. And when he danced—O how I envied Clarinda! I almost wished to have jumped on the stage and joined them.
</p>
<p>
I am afraid you will think me mad, so I won't say any more; yet I really believe Mr. Garrick would make you mad too, if you could see him. I intend to ask Mrs. Mirvan to go to the play every night while we stay in town. She is extremely kind to me, and Maria, her charming daughter, is the sweetest girl in the world.
</p>
<p>
I shall write to you every evening all that passes in the day, and that in the same manner as, if I could see, I should tell you.
</p>
<p>Sunday.</p>
<p>
This morning we went to Portland chapel, and afterwards we walked in the Mall in St. James's Park, which by no means answered my expectati

ons: it is a long straight walk, of dirty gravel, ve

ry uneasy to the feet; and at each end, instead of an open prospect, nothing is to be seen but houses
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1259700101:39"/>
built of brick. When Mrs. Mirvan pointed out the
<hi>Palace</hi>
to me—I think I was never much more surprised.
</p>
<p>
However the walk was very agreeable to us; every body looked gay, and seemed pleased, and the ladies were so much dressed, that Miss Mirvan and I could do nothing but look at them. Mrs. Mirvan met several of her friends. No wonder, for I never saw so many people assembled together before. I looked about for some of
<hi>my</hi>
acquaint

ance, but in vain, for I saw not one person that I knew, which is very odd, for all the world seemed there.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Mirvan says we are not to walk in the Park again next Sunday, even if we should be in town, because there is better company in Kensing

ton Gardens. But really if you had seen how much every body was dressed, you would not think that possible.
</p>
<p>
We are to go this evening to a private ball, gi

ven by Mrs. Stanley, a very fashionable lady of Mrs. Mirvan's acquaintance.
</p>
<p>
We have been a
<hi>shopping,</hi>
as Mrs. Mirvan calls it, all this morning, to buy silks, caps, gauzes, and so forth.
</p>
<p>
The shops are really very entertaining, especially the mercers; there seem to be six or seven men be

longing to each shop, and every one took care, by bowing and smirking, to be noticed; we were con

ducted from one to another, and carried from room to room, with so much ceremony, that at first I was almost afraid to follow.
</p>
<p>
I thought I should never have chosen a silk, for they produced so many, I knew not which to fix upon, and they recommended them all so strongly that I fancy they thought I only wanted persuasion
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1259700101:40"/>
to buy every thing they shewed me. And, indeed, they took so much trouble, that I was almost asha

med I could not.
</p>
<p>
At the milliners, the ladies we met were so much dressed, that I should rather have imagined they were making visits than purchases. But what most diverted me was, that we were more frequently served by men than by women; and such men! so finical, so affected! they seemed to understand eve

ry part of a woman's dress better than we do our

selves; and they recommended caps and ribbands with an air of so much importance, that I wished to ask them how long they had left off wearing them!
</p>
<p>
The dispatch with which they work in these great shops is amazing, for they have promised me a com

pleat suit of linen against the evening.
</p>
<p>
I have just had my hair dressed. You can't think how oddly my head feels; full of powder and black pins, and a great
<hi>cushion</hi>
on the top of it. I believe you would hardly know me, for my face looks quite different from what it did before my hair was dressed. When I shall be able to make use of a comb for myself I cannot tell, for my hair is so much entangled,
<hi>frizzled</hi>
they call it, that I fear it will be very difficult.
</p>
<p>
I am half afraid of this ball to-night, for, you know, I have never danced but at school; however, Miss Mirvan says there is nothing in it. Yet I wish it was over.
</p>
<p>
Adieu, my dear Sir; pray excuse the wretched stuff I write, perhaps I may improve by being in this town, and then my letters will be less unwor

Queen-Anne-Street,
<date>April 5, Tuesday morning.</date>
</dateline>
</opener>
<p>
I HAVE a vast deal to say, and shall give all this morning to my pen. As to my plan of writ

ing every evening the adventures of the day, I find it impracticable; for the diversions here are so very late, that if I begin my letters after them, I could not go to bed at all.
</p>
<p>
We past a most extraordinary evening. A
<hi>
pri

vate
</hi>
ball this was called, so I expected to have seen about four or five couple; but, Lord, my dear Sir, I believe I saw half the world! Two very large rooms were full of company; in one, were cards for the elderly ladies, and in the other, were the dancers. My mamma Mirvan, for she always calls me her child, said she would sit with Ma

ria and me till we were provided with partners, and then join the card players.
</p>
<p>
The gentlemen, as they passed and repassed, looked as if they thought we were quite at their disposal, and only waiting for the honour of their commands; and they sauntered about in a careless indolent manner, as if with a view to keep us in suspense. I don't speak of this in regard to Miss Mirvan and myself only, but to the ladies in ge

neral; and I thought it so provoking, that I de

termined, in my own mind, that, far from humour

ing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1259700101:42"/>
such airs, I would rather not dance at all, than with any one who should seem to think me ready to accept the first partner who would con

descend to take me.
</p>
<p>
Not long after, a young man, who had for some time looked at us with a kind of negligent imper

tinence, advanced, on tiptoe, towards me; he had a set smile on his face, and his dress was so fop

pish, that I really believe he even wished to be stared at; and yet he was very ugly.
</p>
<p>
Bowing almost to the ground, with a sort of swing, and waving his hand with the greatest con

ceit, after a short and silly pause, he said,
<q rend="inline">
"Ma

dam—may I presume?"—
</q>
and stopt, offering to take my hand, I drew it back, but could scarce forbear laughing.
<q rend="inline">"Allow me, Madam,"</q>
(con

tinued he, affectedly breaking off every half mo

ment)
<q rend="inline">
"the honour and happiness—if I am not so unhappy as to address you too late—to have the happiness and honour—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Again he would have taken my hand, but, bow

ing my head, I begged to be excused, and turned to Miss Mirvan to conceal my laughter. He then desired to know if I had already engaged myself to some more fortunate man? I said No, and that I believed I should not dance at all. He would keep himself, he told me, disengaged, in hopes I should relent; and then, uttering some ridiculous speeches of sorrow and disappointment, though his face still wore the same invariable smile, he re

treated.
</p>
<p>
It so happened, as we have since recollected, that during this little dialogue, Mrs. Mirvan was con

versing with the lady of the house. And very soon after another gentleman, who seemed about six

and-twenty years old, gayly, but not soppishly,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1259700101:43"/>
dressed, and indeed extremely handsome, with an air of mixed politeness and gallantry, desired to know if I was engaged, or would honour him with my hand. So he was pleased to say, though I am sure I know not what honour he could re

ceive from me; but these sort of expressions, I find, are used as words of course, without any dis

tinction of persons, or study of propriety.
</p>
<p>
Well, I bowed, and I am sure I coloured; for indeed I was frightened at the thoughts of dancing before so many people, all strangers, and, which was worse,
<hi>with</hi>
a stranger; however, that was unavoidable, for though I looked round the room several times, I could not see one person that I knew. And so, he took my hand, and led me to join in the dance.
</p>
<p>
The minuets were over before we arrived, for we were kept late by the milliner's making us wait for our things.
</p>
<p>
He seemed very desirous of entering into con

versation with me; but I was seized with such a panic, that I could hardly speak a word, and no

thing but the shame of so soon changing my mind, prevented my returning to my seat, and declining to dance at all.
</p>
<p>
He appeared to be surprised at my terror, which I believe was but too apparent: however, he asked no questions, though I fear he must think it very odd; for I did not choose to tell him it was owing to my never before dancing but with a school

girl.
</p>
<p>
His conversation was sensible and spirited; his air and address were open and noble; his manners gentle, attentive, and infinitely engaging; his per

son is all elegance, and his countenance the most animated and expressive I have ever seen.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1259700101:44"/>
In a short time we were joined by Miss Mirvan, who stood next couple to us. But how was I startled, when she whispered me that my partner was a nobleman! This gave me a new alarm; how will he be provoked, thought I, when he finds what a simple rustic he has honoured with his choice! one whose ignorance of the world makes her perpetually fear doing something wrong!
</p>
<p>
That he should be so much my superior every way, quite disconcerted me; and you will suppose my spirits were not much raised, when I heard a lady in passing us, say,
<q rend="inline">"This is the most difficult dance I ever saw."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O dear, then,"</q>
cried Maria to her partner,
<q rend="inline">"with your leave, I'll sit down till the next."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"So will I too, then,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">"for I am sure I can hardly stand."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"But you must speak to your partner first,"</q>
answered she; for he had turned aside to talk with some gentlemen. However, I had not sufficient courage to address him, and so away we all three tript, and seated ourselves at another end of the room.
</p>
<p>
But, unfortunately for me, Miss Mirvan soon after suffered herself to be prevailed upon to at

tempt the dance; and just as she rose to go, she cried,
<q rend="inline">
"My dear, yonder is your partner, Lord Orville, walking about the room in search of you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Don't leave me, then, dear girl!"</q>
cried I; but she was obliged to go. And then I was more uneasy than ever; I would have given the world to have seen Mrs. Mirvan, and begged of her to make my apologies; for what, thought I, can I possibly say for myself in excuse for running away? he must either conclude me a fool, or half mad, for any one brought up in the great world, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1259700101:45"/>
accustomed to its ways, can have no idea of such sort of fears as mine.
</p>
<p>
I was in the utmost confusion, when I observed that he was every where seeking me, with apparent perplexity and surprise; but when, at last, I saw him move towards the place where I sat, I was ready to sink with shame and distress. I found it absolutely impossible to keep my seat, because I could not think of a word to say for myself, and so I rose, and walked hastily towards the card-room, resolving to stay with Mrs. Mirvan the rest of the evening, and not to dance at all. But before I could find her, Lord Orville saw and approached me.
</p>
<p>
He begged to know if I was not well? You may easily imagine how much I was confused. I made no answer, but hung my head, like a fool, and looked on my fan.
</p>
<p>
He then, with an air the most respectfully se

rious, asked if he had been so unhappy as to of

fend me?
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, indeed!"</q>
cried I: and then, in hopes of changing the discourse, and preventing his further inquiries, I desired to know if he had seen the young lady who had been conversing with me?
</p>
<p>
No;—but would I honour him with my com

mands to see for her?
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O by no means!"</q>
</p>
<p>
Was there any other person with whom I wished to speak?
</p>
<p>
I said
<hi>no,</hi>
before I knew I had answered at all.
</p>
<p>
Should he have the pleasure of bringing me any refreshment?
</p>
<p>I bowed, almost involuntarily. And away he flew.</p>
<p>
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1259700101:46"/>
I was quite ashamed at being so troublesome, and so much
<hi>above</hi>
myself as these seeming airs made me appear; but indeed I was too much confused to think or act with any consistency.

<p>
If he had not been swift as lightning, I don't know whether I should not have stolen away again; but he returned in a moment. When I had drank a glass of lemonade, he hoped, he said, that I would again honour him with my hand, as a new dance was just begun. I had not the presence of mind to say a single word, and so I let him once more lead me to the place I had left.
</p>
<p>
Shocked to find how silly, how childish a part I had acted, my former fears of dancing before such a company, and with such a partner, returned more forcibly than ever. I suppose he perceived my uneasiness, for he intreated me to sit down again, if dancing was disagreeable to me. But I was quite satisfied with the folly I had already shewn, and therefore declined his offer, though I was really scarce able to stand.
</p>
<p>
Under such conscious disadvantages, you may easily imagine, my dear Sir, how ill I acquitted myself. But, though I both expected and de

served to find him very much mortified and dis

pleased at his ill fortune in the choice he had made, yet, to my very great relief, he appeared to be even contented, and very much assisted and en

couraged me. These people in high life have too much presence of mind, I believe, to
<hi>seem</hi>
discon

certed, or out of humour, however they may feel; for had I been the person of the most consequence in the room, I could not have met with more at

tention and respect.
</p>
<p>
When the dance was over, seeing me still very much slurried, he led me to a seat, saying that he
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1259700101:47"/>
would not suffer me to fatigue myself from po

liteness.
</p>
<p>
And then, if my capacity, or even if my spirits had been better, in how animated a conver
<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>
sation might I have been engaged! It was then that I saw the rank of Lord Orville was his least recommendation, his understanding and his man

ners being far more distinguished. His remarks upon the company in general were so apt, so just, so lively, I am almost surprised myself that they did not re-animate me; but indeed I was too well convinced of the ridiculous part I had myself played before so nice an observer, to be able to enjoy his pleasantry: so self-compassion gave me feeling for others. Yet I had not the courage to attempt either to defend them, or to rally in my turn, but listened to him in silent embarrass

ment.
</p>
<p>
When he found this, he changed the subject, and talked of public places, and public performers; but he soon discovered that I was totally igno

rant of them.
</p>
<p>
He then, very ingeniously, turned the dis

course to the amusements and occupations of the country.
</p>
<p>
It now struck me, that he was resolved to try whether or not I was capable of talking upon
<hi>any</hi>
subject. This put so great a constraint upon my thoughts, that I was unable to go further than a monosyllable, and not even so far, when I could possibly avoid it.
</p>
<p>
We were sitting in this manner, he conversing with all gaiety, I looking down with all foolish

ness, when that fop who had first asked me to dance, with a most ridiculous solemnity, approach

ed, and after a profound bow or two, said,
<q rend="inline">
"I
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1259700101:48"/>
humbly beg pardon, Madam,—and of you too, my Lord,—for breaking in upon such agreeable conversation—which must, doubtless, be much more delectable—than what I have the honour to offer—but—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I interrupted him—I blush for my folly,—with laughing; yet I could not help it, for, added to the man's stately foppishness, (and he actually took snuff between every three words) when I looked round at Lord Orville, I saw such ex

treme surprise in his face,—the cause of which appeared so absurd, that I could not for my life preserve my gravity.
</p>
<p>
I had not laughed before from the time I had left Miss Mirvan, and I had much better have cried then; Lord Orville actually stared at me; the beau, I know not his name, looked quite enraged.
<q rend="inline">"Refrain—Madam,"</q>
(said he, with an important air,)
<q rend="inline">
"a few moments refrain!—I have but a sentence to trouble you with.—May I know to what accident I must attribute not having the honour of your hand?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Accident, Sir!"</q>
repeated I, much asto

nished.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Yes, accident, Madam—for surely,—I must take the liberty to observe—pardon me, Madam, it ought to be no common one—that should tempt a lady—so young a one too,—to be guilty of ill manners."
</q>
</p>
<p>
A confused idea now for the first time entered my head, something I had heard of the rules of assemblies; but I was never at one before,—I have only danced at school,—and so giddy and heedless I was, that I had not once considered the impropriety of refusing one partner, and after

wards accepting another. I was thunderstruck at
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1259700101:49"/>
the recollection: but, while these thoughts were rushing into my head, Lord Orville, with some warmth, said,
<q rend="inline">
"This lady, Sir, is incapable of meriting such an accusation!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
The creature—for I am very angry with him,—made a low bow, and with a grin the most malicious I ever saw,
<q rend="inline">
"My Lord, said he, far be it from me to
<hi>accuse</hi>
the lady, for having the discernment to distinguish and prefer—the superior attractions of your Lordship."
</q>
</p>
<p>Again he bowed, and walked off.</p>
<p>
Was ever any thing so provoking? I was ready to die with shame.
<q rend="inline">"What a coxcomb!"</q>
ex

claimed Lord Orville; while I, without know

ing what I did, rose hastily, and moving off,
<q rend="inline">
"I can't imagine, cried I, where Mrs. Mirvan has hid herself!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Give me leave to see,"</q>
answered he. I bowed and sat down again, not daring to meet his eyes; for what must he think of me, between my blunder and the supposed preference?
</p>
<p>
He returned in a moment, and told me that Mrs. Mirvan was at cards, but would be glad to see me; and I went immediately. There was but one chair vacant, so, to my great relief, Lord Orville presently left us. I then told Mrs. Mirvan my disasters, and she good-naturedly blamed her

self for not having better instructed me, but said she had taken it for granted that I must know such common customs. However, the man may, I think, be satisfied with his pretty speech, and carry his resentment no farther.
</p>
<p>
In a short time, Lord Orville returned. I con

sented, with the best grace I could, to go down another dance, for I had had time to recollect myself, and therefore resolved to use some exer

tion,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1259700101:50"/>
and, if possible, appear less a fool than I hitherto had: for it occurred to me that, insigni

ficant as I was, compared to a man of his rank and figure, yet, since he had been so unfortunate as to make choice of me for a partner, why I should endeavour to make the best of it.
</p>
<p>
The dance, however, was short, and he spoke very little; so I had no opportunity of putting my re

solution in practice. He was satisfied, I suppose, with his former successless efforts to draw me out: or, rather, I fancied, he has been inquiring
<hi>who I was.</hi>
This again disconcerted me, and the spi

rits I had determined to exert, again failed me. Tired, ashamed, and mortified, I begged to sit down till we returned home, which we did soon after. Lord Orville did me the honour to hand me to the coach, talking all the way of the honour
<hi>I</hi>
had done
<hi>him!</hi>
O these fashionable people!
</p>
<p>
Well, my dear Sir, was it not a strange even

ing? I could not help being thus particular, be

<p>
THERE is to be no end to the troubles of last night. I have, this moment, between persuasion and laughter, gathered from Maria the most curi

ous dialogue that ever I heard. You will, at first, be startled at my vanity; but, my dear Sir, have patience!
</p>
<p>
It must have passed while I was sitting with Mrs. Mirvan in the card-room. Maria was taking some refreshment, and saw Lord Orville advanc

ing for the same purpose himself; but he did not know her, though she immediately recollected him. Presently after, a very gay-looking man, stepping hastily up to him, cried,
<q rend="inline">
"Why, my Lord, what have you done with your lovely partner!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Nothing!</hi>
"
</q>
answered Lord Orville, with a smile and a shrug.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"By Jove, cried the man, she is the most beau

tiful creature I ever saw in my life!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Lord Orville, as he well might, laughed, but answered,
<q rend="inline">"Yes, a pretty modest-looking girl."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O my Lord!"</q>
cried the madman,
<q rend="inline">"she is an angel!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"A
<hi>silent</hi>
one,"
</q>
returned he.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why ay, my Lord, how stands she as to that? She looks all intelligence and expression."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"A poor weak girl!"</q>
answered Lord Orville, shaking his head.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1259700101:52"/>
<q rend="inline">"By Jove,"</q>
cried the other,
<q rend="inline">"I am glad to hear it!"</q>
</p>
<p>
At that moment, the same odious creature who had been my former torment, joined them. Ad

dressing Lord Orville with great respect, he said,
<q rend="inline">
"I beg pardon, my Lord,—if I was—as I fear might be the case—rather too severe in my cen

sure of the lady who is honoured with your pro

tection—but, my Lord, ill breeding is apt to pro

voke a man."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Ill-breeding!"</q>
cried my unknown champion,
<q rend="inline">
"impossible! that elegant face can never be so vile a mask!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O Sir, as to that,"</q>
answered he,
<q rend="inline">
"you must allow
<hi>me</hi>
to judge; for though I pay all deference to your opinion—in other things,—yet I hope you will grant—and I appeal to your Lordship also—that I am not totally despicable as a judge of good or ill manners."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I was so wholly ignorant,"</q>
said Lord Orville gravely,
<q rend="inline">
"of the provocation you might have had, that I could not but be surprised at your singular resentment."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"It was far from my intention, answered he, to offend your Lordship; but really, for a per

son who is nobody, to give herself such airs,—I own I could not command my passions. For, my Lord, though I have made diligent enquiry—I cannot learn who she is."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"By what I can make out,"</q>
cried my defender,
<q rend="inline">"she must be a country parson's daughter."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"He! he! he! very good, 'pon honour!"</q>
cried the fop,—
<q rend="inline">"well, so I could have sworn by her manners."</q>
</p>
<p>
And then, delighted at his own wit, he laughed, and went away, as I suppose, to repeat it.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1259700101:53"/>
<q rend="inline">"But what the deuce is all this?</q>
demanded the other.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why a very foolish affair,"</q>
answered Lord Orville;
<q rend="inline">
"your Helen first refused this coxcomb, and then—danced with me. This is all I can ga

ther of it."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O Orville,"</q>
returned he,
<q rend="inline">
"you are a happy man!—But,
<hi>ill-bred?</hi>
—I can never believe it? And she looks too sensible to be
<hi>ignorant.</hi>
"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Whether ignorant or mischievous, I will not pretend to determine, but certain it is, she attended to all
<hi>I</hi>
could say to her, though I have really fatigued myself with fruitless endeavours to enter

tain her, with the most immoveable gravity; but no sooner did Lovel begin his complaint, than she was seized with a fit of Laughing, first af

fronting the poor beau, and then enjoying his mor

tification."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Ha! ha! ha! why there's some
<hi>genius</hi>
in that, my Lord, though perhaps rather
<hi>rustick.</hi>
"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Here Maria was called to dance, and so heard no more.
</p>
<p>
Now tell me, my dear Sir, did you ever know any thing more provoking?
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>A poor weak girl!</hi>
" "
<hi>ignorant or mischievous!</hi>
"
</q>
What mortifying words! I'm resolved, however, that I will never again be tempted to go to an assembly. I wish I had been in Dorsetshire.
</p>
<p>
Well, after this, you will not be surprised that Lord Orville contented himself with an enquiry after our healths this morning, by his servant, without troubling himself to call; as Miss Mirvan had told me he would: but perhaps it may be only a country custom.
</p>
<p>
I would not live here for the world. I don't care how soon we leave town. London soon
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1259700101:54"/>
grows tiresome. I wish the Captain would come Mrs. Mirvan talks of the opera for this evening; however, I am very indifferent about it.

<p>
Well, my dear Sir, I have been pleased, against my will, I could almost say, for I must own I went out in very ill-humour, which I think you can't wonder at: but the music and the singing were charming; they soothed me into a pleasure the most grateful, the best suited to my present disposition in the world. I hope to persuade Mrs. Mirvan to go again on Saturday. I wish the opera was every night. It is, of all entertain

ments, the sweetest and most delightful. Some of the songs seemed to melt my very soul. It was what they call a
<hi>serious</hi>
opera, as the
<hi>comic</hi>
first singer was ill.
</p>
<p>
To-night we go to Ranelagh. If any of those three gentlemen who conversed so freely about me should be there—but I won't think of it.

<p>
Well, my dear Sir, we went to Ranelagh. It is a charming place, and the brilliancy of the lights, on my first entrance, made me almost think I was in some inchanted castle, or fairy palace, for all looked like magic to me.
</p>
<p>
The very first person I saw was Lord Orville. I felt so confused!—but he did not see me. After tea, Mrs. Mirvan being tired, Maria and I walked round the room alone. Then again we saw him, standing by the orchestra. We, too, stopt to hear a singer. He bowed to me; I courtsied, and I am sure I coloured. We soon
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1259700101:55"/>
walked on, not liking our situation; however, he did not follow us, and when we past by the orchestra again, he was gone. Afterwards, in the course of the evening, we met him several times, but he was always with some party, and never spoke to us, tho' whenever he chanced to meet my eyes, he condescended to bow.
</p>
<p>
I cannot but be hurt at the opinion he enter

tains of me. It is true, my own behaviour in

curred it—yet is himself the most agreeable, and, seemingly, the most amiable man in the world, and therefore it is, that I am grieved to be thought ill of by him: for of whose esteem ought we to be ambitious, if not of those who most merit our own?—But it is too late to reflect upon this now. Well, I can't help it;—How

ever, I think I have done with assemblies!
</p>
<p>
This morning was destined for
<hi>seeing sights,</hi>
auc

tions, curious shops, and so forth; but my head ached, and I was not in a humour to be amused, and so I made them go without me, though very unwillingly. They are all kindness.
</p>
<p>
And now I am sorry I did not accompany them, for I know not what to do with myself. I had re

solved not to go to the play to-night; but I believe I shall. In short, I hardly care whether I do or not.
</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<p>
I thought I had done wrong! Mrs. Mirvan and Maria have been half the town over, and so en

tertained!—while I, like a fool, stayed at home to do nothing. And, at an auction in Pall-Mall, who should they meet but Lord Orville! He sat next to Mrs Mirvan, and they talked a great deal
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1259700101:56"/>
together: but she gave me no account of the con

versation.
</p>
<p>
I may never have such another opportunity of seeing London; I am quite sorry that I was not of the party; but I deserve this mortification, for having indulged my ill-humour.

Captain Mirvan is arrived. I have not spirits to give an account of his introduction, for he has really shocked me. I do not like him. He seems to be surly, vulgar, and disagreeable.
</p>
<p>
Almost the same moment that Maria was pre

sented to him, he began some rude jests upon the bad shape of her nose, and called her a tall, ill

formed thing. She bore it with the utmost good

humour; but that kind and sweet-tempered wo

man, Mrs. Mirvan, deserved a better lot. I am amazed she would marry him.
</p>
<p>
For my own part, I have been so shy, that I have hardly spoken to him, or he to me. I can

not imagine why the family was so rejoiced at his return. If he had spent his whole life abroad, I should have supposed they might rather have been thankful than sorrowful. However, I hope they do not think so ill of him as I do. At least, I am sure they have too much prudence to make it known.

We have been to the opera, and I am still more pleased than I was on Tuesday. I could have thought myself in paradise, but for the continual talking of the company around me. We sat in the pit, where every body was dressed in so high a style, that, if I had been less delighted with the performance, my eyes would have found me suffi

cient entertainment from looking at the ladies.
</p>
<p>
I was very glad I did not sit next the Captain, for he could not bear the music, or singers, and was extremely gross in his observations on both. When the opera was over, we went into a place called the coffee-room, where ladies as well as gentlemen assemble. There are all sorts of re

<hi>chat,</hi>
with the same ease and freedom as in a pri

<p>
WE came home from the ridotto so late, or ra

ther, so early, that it was not possible for me to write. Indeed we did not
<hi>go,</hi>
you will be fright

ened to hear it,—till past eleven o'clock: but nobody does. A terrible reverse of the order of nature! We sleep with the sun, and wake with the moon.
</p>
<p>
The room was very magnificent, the lights and decorations brilliant, and the company gay and splendid. But I should have told you, that I made very many objections to being of the party, according to the resolution I had formed. How

ever, Maria laughed me out of my scruples, and so, once again—I went to an assembly.
</p>
<p>
Miss Mirvan danced a minuet, but I had not the courage to follow her example. In our walks I saw Lord Orville. He was quite alone, but did not observe us. Yet, as he seemed of no party, I thought it was not impossible that he might join us; and tho' I did not wish much to dance at all,—yet, as I was more acquainted with him than with any other person in the room, I must own I could not help thinking it would be infinitely more desireable to dance again with him, than with an entire stranger. To be sure, after all that had passed, it was very ridiculous to suppose it even probable, that Lord Orville would again honour
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1259700101:59"/>
me with his choice; yet I am compelled to con

fess my absurdity, by way of explaining what fol

lows.
</p>
<p>
Miss Mirvan was soon engaged; and, presently after, a very fashionable, gay-looking man, who seemed about 30 years of age, addressed himself to me, and begged to have the honour of dancing with me. Now Maria's partner was a gentleman of Mrs. Mirvan's acquaintance; for she had told us it was highly improper for young women to dance with strangers, at any public assembly. In

deed it was by no means my wish so to do; yet I did not like to confine myself from dancing at all; neither did I dare refuse this gentleman, as I had done Mr. Lovel, and then, if any acquaint

ance should offer, accept him: and so, all these reasons combining, induced me to tell him—yet I blush to write it to you!—that I was
<hi>
already en

gaged;
</hi>
by which I meant to keep myself at liberty to dance or not, as matters should fall out.
</p>
<p>
I suppose my consciousness betrayed my artifice, for he looked at me as if incredulous; and, instead of being satisfied with my answer, and leaving me, according to my expectation, he walked at my side, and, with the greatest ease imaginable, began a conversation, in that free style which only belongs to old and intimate acquaintance. But, what was most provoking, he asked me a thousand questions concerning
<hi>the partner to whom I was engaged.</hi>
And, at last, he said,
<q rend="inline">
"Is it really possible that a man whom you have honoured with your accept

ance, can fail to be at hand to profit from your goodness?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I felt extremely foolish, and begged Mrs. Mir

van to lead to a seat, which she very obligingly did. The Captain sat next her, and, to my great sur

prise,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1259700101:60"/>
this gentleman thought proper to follow, and seat himself next to me.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"What an insensible!"</q>
continued he,
<q rend="inline">
"why, Madam, you are missing the most delightful dance in the world! The man must be either mad, or a fool.—Which do you incline to think him your

self?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Neither, Sir,"</q>
answered I, in some confusion.
</p>
<p>
He begged my pardon for the freedom of his supposition, saying,
<q rend="inline">
"I really was off my guard, from astonishment that any man can be so much and so unaccountably his own enemy. But where, Madam, can he possibly be?—has he left the room?—or has not he been in it?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Indeed, Sir,"</q>
said I peevishly,
<q rend="inline">
"I know no

thing of him."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I don't wonder that you are disconcerted, Madam, it is really very provoking. The best part of the evening will be absolutely lost. He deserves not that you should wait for him."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I do not, Sir,"</q>
said I,
<q rend="inline">"and I beg you not to—"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Mortifying, indeed, Madam,"</q>
interrupted he,
<q rend="inline">
"a lady to wait for a gentleman!—O fie!—care

less fellow!—what can detain him?—Will you give me leave to seek him?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"If you please, Sir,"</q>
answered I, quite terri

fied lest Mrs. Mirvan should attend to him, for she looked very much surprised at seeing me enter into conversation with a stranger.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"With all my heart,"</q>
cried he;
<q rend="inline">"pray what coat has he on?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Indeed I never looked at it."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Out upon him!"</q>
cried he;
<q rend="inline">
"What! did he address you in a coat not worth looking at?—What a shabby dog!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1259700101:61"/>
How ridiculous! I really could not help laugh

ing, which, I fear, encouraged him, for he went on.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Charming creature!—and can you really bear ill usage with so much sweetness?—Can you,
<hi>like patience on a monument,</hi>
smile in the midst of disappointment?—For my part, though I am not the offended person, my indignation is so great, that I long to kick the fellow round the room!—unless, indeed,—(hesitating and looking earnestly at me,) unless, indeed—it is a partner of your own
<hi>creating?</hi>
"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I was dreadfully abashed, and could not make any answer.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"But no!"</q>
cried he, (again, and with warmth,)
<q rend="inline">
"it cannot be that you are so cruel! Softness itself is painted in your eyes:—You could not, surely, have the barbarity so wantonly to trifle with my misery?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I turned away from this nonsense, with real disgust. Mrs. Mirvan saw my confusion, but was perplexed what to think of it, and I could not ex

plain to her the cause, lest the captain should hear me. I therefore proposed to walk, she consented, and we all rose; but, would you believe it? this man had the assurance to rise too, and walk close by my side, as if of my party!
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Now,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">"I hope we shall see this ingrate.—Is that he?"—</q>
pointing to an old man, who was lame,
<q rend="inline">"or that?"</q>
And in this manner he asked me of whoever was old or ugly in the room. I made no sort of answer; and when he found that I was resolutely silent, and walked on, as much as I could, without observing him, he suddenly stamped his foot, and cried out, in a pas

sion,
<q rend="inline">"Fool! idiot! booby!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1259700101:62"/>
I turned hastily toward him:
<q rend="inline">"O Madam,"</q>
continued he,
<q rend="inline">
"forgive my vehemence, but I am distracted to think there should exist a wretch who can slight a blessing for which I would forfeit my life!—O! that I could but meet him!—I would soon—But I grow angry: pardon me, Madam, my passions are violent, and your injuries affect me!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I began to apprehend he was a madman, and stared at him with the utmost astonishment.
<q rend="inline">"I see you are moved, Madam,"</q>
said he,
<q rend="inline">
"generous creature!—but don't be alarmed, I am cool again, I am indeed,—upon my soul I am,—I entreat you, most lovely of mortals! I entreat you to be easy."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Indeed, Sir,"</q>
said I very seriously,
<q rend="inline">
"I must insist upon your leaving me; you are quite a stran

ger to me, and I am both unused, and averse to your language and your manners."
</q>
</p>
<p>
This seemed to have some effect on him. He made me a low bow, begged my pardon, and vowed he would not for the world offend me.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Then, Sir, you must leave me,"</q>
cried I.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I am gone, Madam, I am gone!"</q>
with a most tragical air; and he marched away, a quick pace, out of sight in a moment; but before I had time to congratulate myself, he was again at my elbow.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"And could you really let me go, and not be sorry?—Can you see me suffer torments inexpres

sible, and yet retain all your favour for that mis

creant who flies you?—Ungrateful puppy!—I could bastinado him!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"For Heaven's sake,"</q>
my dear, cried Mrs. Mirvan,
<q rend="inline">"who is he talking of?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Indeed—I do not know, Madam,"</q>
said I,
<q rend="inline">"but I wish he would leave me."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"What's all that there?"</q>
cried the Captain.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1259700101:63"/>
The man made a low bow, and said,
<q rend="inline">
"Only, Sir, a slight objection which this young lady makes to dancing with me, and which I am endeavour

ing to obviate. I shall think myself greatly ho

noured, if you will intercede for me."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"That lady, Sir,</q>
said the Captain coldly,
<q rend="inline">"is her own mistress."</q>
And he walked sullenly on.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You Madam,"</q>
said the man, (who looked de

lighted, to Mrs. Mirvan,)
<q rend="inline">
"you, I hope, will have the goodness to speak for me."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Sir,"</q>
answered she gravely,
<q rend="inline">
"I have not the pleasure of being acquainted with you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I hope when you have, Ma'am,"</q>
cried he, (undaunted,)
<q rend="inline">
"you will honour me with your ap

probation; but while I am yet unknown to you, it would be truly generous in you to countenance me; and, I flatter myself, Madam, that you will not have cause to repent it."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Mirvan, with an embarrassed air, replied,
<q rend="inline">
"I do not at all mean, Sir, to doubt your being a gentleman,—but,—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"But
<hi>what,</hi>
Madam?—that doubt removed, why a
<hi>but?</hi>
"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Well, Sir,"</q>
said Mrs. Mirvan, (with a good

humoured smile,)
<q rend="inline">
"I will even treat you with your own plainness, and try what effect that will have on you: I must therefore tell you, once for all,—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O pardon me, Madam!"</q>
interrupted he eager

ly,
<q rend="inline">
"you must not proceed with those words,
<hi>once for all;</hi>
no, if
<hi>I</hi>
have been too
<hi>plain,</hi>
and though a
<hi>man,</hi>
deserve a rebuke, remember, dear ladies, that if you
<hi>copy,</hi>
you ought, in justice, to
<hi>excuse</hi>
me."
</q>
</p>
<p>We both stared at the man's strange behaviour.</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Be nobler than your sex,"</q>
continued he, turn

ing to me,
<q rend="inline">
"honour me with one dance, and give
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1259700101:64"/>
up the ingrate who has merited so ill your pa

tience."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Mirvan looked with astonishment at us both.
<q rend="inline">
"Who does he speak of, my dear?—you never mentioned—.
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O Madam!"</q>
exclaimed he,
<q rend="inline">
"he was not worth mentioning—it is pity he was ever thought of; but let us forget his existence. One dance is all I solicit; permit me, madam, the honour of this young lady's hand; it will be a favour I shall ever most gratefully acknowledge."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Sir,"</q>
answered she,
<q rend="inline">
"favours and strangers have with me no connection."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"If you have hitherto,"</q>
said he,
<q rend="inline">
"confined your benevolence to your intimate friends, suffer me to be the first for whom your charity is en

larged."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Well, Sir, I know not what to say to you,—but—"</q>
</p>
<p>
He stopt her
<hi>but</hi>
with so many urgent entreaties, that she at last told me, I must either go down one dance, or avoid his importunities by returning home. I hesitated which alternative to chuse; but this impetuous man at length prevailed, and I was obliged to consent to dance with him.
</p>
<p>
And thus was my deviation from truth punished; and thus did this man's determined boldness con

quer.
</p>
<p>
During the dance, before we were too much engaged in it for conversation, he was extremely provoking about
<hi>my partner,</hi>
and tried every means in his power to make me own that I had deceived him; which, though I would not so far humble myself, was indeed but too obvious.
</p>
<p>
Lord Orville, I fancy, did not dance at all; he seemed to have a large acquaintance, and joined
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1259700101:65"/>
several different parties: but you will easily sup

pose I was not much pleased to see him, in a few minutes after I was gone, walk towards the place I had just left, and bow to, and join Mrs. Mir

van!
</p>
<p>
How unlucky I thought myself, that I had not longer withstood this stranger's importunities! The moment we had gone down the dance, I was has

tening away from him, but he stopt me, and said that I could by no means return to my party, without giving offence, before we had
<hi>
done our duty of walk

ing up the dance.
</hi>
As I know nothing at all of these rules and customs, I was obliged to submit to his directions; but I fancy I looked rather uneasy, for he took notice of my inattention, saying, in his free way,
<q rend="inline">
"Whence that anxiety?—Why are those lovely eyes perpetually averted?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I wish you would say no more to me, Sir,"</q>
(cried I peevishly)
<q rend="inline">
"you have already destroyed all my happiness for this evening."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Good Heaven; what is it I have done?—How have I merited this scorn?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"You have tormented me to death; you have forced me from my friends, and intruded yourself upon me, against my will, for a partner."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Surely, my dear madam, we ought to be better friends, since there seems to be something of a sympathy in the frankness of our dispositions—And yet, were you not an angel—how do you think I could brook such contempt?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"If I have offended you, cried I, you have but to leave me—and O how I wish you would!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My dear creature,"</q>
(cried he, half laugh

ing)
<q rend="inline">"why where could you be educated?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Where I most sincerely wish I now was!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1259700101:66"/>
<q rend="inline">
"How conscious you must be, all beautiful that you are, that those charming airs serve only to heighten the bloom of your complexion!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Your freedom, Sir, where you are more ac

quainted, may perhaps be less disagreeable; but to
<hi>me</hi>
—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You do me justice,"</q>
(cried he, interrupting me)
<q rend="inline">
"yes, I do indeed improve upon acquaint

ance; you will hereafter be quite charmed with me."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Hereafter, Sir, I hope I shall never—"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"O hush!—hush!—have you forgot the situ

ation in which I found you?—Have you forgot, that when deserted, I pursued you,—when betrayed, I adored you?—but for me—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"But for you, Sir, I might, perhaps, have been happy."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"What, then, am I to conclude that,
<hi>but for me,</hi>
your
<hi>partner</hi>
would have appeared?—poor fellow!—and did my presence awe him?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I wish
<hi>his</hi>
presence, Sir, could awe
<hi>you!</hi>
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"His presence!—perhaps then you see him?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Perhaps, Sir, I do;"</q>
cried I, quite wearied of his raillery.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Where?—where?—for Heaven's sake shew me the wretch!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Wretch, Sir?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"O, a very savage!—a sneaking, shame-faced, despicable puppy!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I know not what bewitched me,—but my pride was hurt, and my spirits were tired, and—in short—I had the solly, looking at Lord Orville, to repeat,
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Despicable,</hi>
you think?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
His eyes instantly followed mine;
<q rend="inline">
"why, is
<hi>that</hi>
the gentleman?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1259700101:67"/>
I made no answer; I could not affirm, and I would not deny; for I hoped to be relieved from his teizing, by his mistake.
</p>
<p>
The very moment we had done what he called our duty, I eagerly desired to return to Mrs. Mir

van.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"To your
<hi>partner,</hi>
I presume, Madam?"
</q>
said he, very gravely.
</p>
<p>
This quite confounded me; I dreaded lest this mischievous man, ignorant of his rank, should ad

dress himself to Lord Orville, and say something which might expose my artifice. Fool! to involve myself in such difficulties! I now feared what I had before wished, and, therefore, to
<hi>avoid</hi>
Lord Orville, I was obliged myself to
<hi>propose</hi>
going down another dance, though I was ready to sink with shame while I spoke.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"But your
<hi>partner,</hi>
Ma'am?"
</q>
(said he, af

fecting a very solemn air)
<q rend="inline">
"perhaps he may resent my detaining you: if you will give me leave to ask his consent—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Not for the universe."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Who is he, Madam?"</q>
</p>
<p>
I wished myself a hundred miles off. He re

peated his question.
<q rend="inline">"What is his name?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Nothing—nobody—I don't know.—"</q>
</p>
<p>
He assumed a most important solemnity;
<q rend="inline">
"How!—not know? Give me leave, my dear Madam, to recommend this caution to you; never dance in public with a stranger,—with one whose name you are unacquainted with,—who may be a mere adventurer,—a man of no character,—con

sider to what impertinence you may expose your

self."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Was ever any thing so ridiculous? I could not help laughing, in spite of my vexation.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1259700101:68"/>
At this instant, Mrs. Mirvan, followed by Lord Orville, walked up to us. You will easily believe it was not difficult for me to recover my gravity; but what was my consternation, when this strange man, destined to be the scourge of my artifice, exclaimed,
<q rend="inline">
"Ha! my Lord Orville!—I protest I did not know your Lordship. What can I say for my usurpation
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
<desc>•…</desc>
</gap>
—Yet, faith, my Lord, such a prize was not to be neglected."
</q>
</p>
<p>
My shame and confusion were unspeakable. Who could have supposed or foreseen that this man knew Lord Orville! But falsehood is not more unjustifiable than unsafe.
</p>
<p>Lord Orville—well he might,—looked all amazement.</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"The philosophic coldness of your Lordship,"</q>
continued this odious creature,
<q rend="inline">
"every man is not endowed with. I have used my utmost endeavours to entertain this lady, though I fear without suc

cess; and your Lordship would not be a little flat

tered, if acquainted with the difficulty which at

tended my procuring the honour of only one dance."
</q>
Then, turning to me, who was sinking with shame, while Lord Orville stood motionless, and Mrs. Mirvan astonished,—he suddenly seized my hand, saying,
<q rend="inline">
"Think, my Lord, what must be my reluctance to resign this fair hand to your Lordship!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
In the same instant, Lord Orville took it of him; I coloured violently, and made an effort to recover it.
<q rend="inline">"You do me too much honour, Sir, cried he,"</q>
(with an air of gallantry, pressing it to his lips ere he let it go)
<q rend="inline">
"however, I shall be happy to profit by it, if this lady,"
</q>
(turning to Mrs. Mirvan)
<q rend="inline">"will permit me to seek for her party."</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1259700101:69"/>
To compel him thus to dance, I could not en

dure, and eagerly called out,
<q rend="inline">"By no means,—not for the world!—I must beg—"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Will you honour
<hi>me,</hi>
Madam, with your commands,"
</q>
cried my tormentor;
<q rend="inline">
"may
<hi>I</hi>
seek the lady's party?
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, Sir,"</q>
answered I, turning from him.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"What
<hi>shall</hi>
be done, my dear,"
</q>
said Mrs. Mirvan?
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Nothing, Ma'am;—any thing, I mean.—"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"But do you dance, or not? you see his Lord

ship waits."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I hope not,—I beg that—I would not for the world—I am sure I ought to—to—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I could not speak; but that confident man, de

termined to discover whether or not I had deceived him, said to Lord Orville, who stood suspended,
<q rend="inline">
"My Lord, this affair, which, at present, seems perplexed, I will briefly explain;—this Lady pro

posed to me another dance,—nothing could have made me more happy—I only wished for your Lordship's permission, which, if now granted, will, I am persuaded, set every thing right."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I glowed with indignation.
<q rend="inline">
"No, Sir—It is your absence, and that alone, can set every thing right."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"For Heaven's sake, my dear,"</q>
(cried Mrs. Mirvan, who could no longer contain her sur

prise,)
<q rend="inline">
"what does all this mean?—were you pre-engaged?—had Lord Orville?—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"No, Madam, cried I,—only,—only I did not know that gentleman,—and so,—and so I thought—I intended—I—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Overpowered by all that had passed, I had not strength to make my mortifying explanation;—my spirits quite sailed me, and I burst into tears.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1259700101:70"/>
They all seemed shocked and amazed.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"What is the matter, my dearest love?"</q>
cried Mrs. Mirvan, with the kindest concern.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"What have I done?"</q>
exclaimed my evil ge

nius, and ran officiously for a glass of water.
</p>
<p>
However, a hint was sufficient for Lord Orville, who comprehended all I would have explained. He immediately led me to a seat, and said, in a low voice,
<q rend="inline">
"Be not distressed, I beseech you; I shall ever think my name honoured by your making use of it."
</q>
</p>
<p>
This politeness relieved me. A general mur

mur had alarmed Miss Mirvan, who flew instantly to me; while Lord Orville, the moment Mrs. Mirvan had taken the water, led my tormentor away.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"For Heaven's sake, dear Madam,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">
"let me go home,—indeed I cannot stay here any longer."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Let us all go,"</q>
cried my kind Maria.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"But the Captain—what will he say?—I had better go home in a chair."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Mirvan consented, and I rose to depart. Lord Orville and that man both came to me. The first, with an attention I had but ill merited from him, led me to a chair,, while the other followed, pestering me with apologies. I wished to have made mine to Lord Orville, but was too much ashamed.
</p>
<p>
It was about one o'clock. Mrs. Mirvan's ser

vants saw me home.
</p>
<p>
And now,—what again shall ever tempt me to an assembly? I dread to hear what you will think of me, my most dear and honoured Sir: you will need your utmost partiality to receive me without displeasure.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1259700101:71"/>
This morning Lord Orville has sent to enquire after our healths: and Sir Clement Willoughby, for that, I find, is the name of my persecutor, has called: but I would not go down stairs till he was gone.
</p>
<p>
And now, my dear Sir, I can somewhat account for the strange, provoking, and ridiculous conduct of this Sir Clement last night; for Miss Mirvan says, he is the very man with whom she heard Lord Orville conversing at Mrs. Stanley's, when I was spoken of in so mortifying a manner. He was pleased to say he was glad to hear I was a fool, and therefore, I suppose, he concluded he might talk as much nonsense as he pleased to me: however, I am very indifferent as to his opinion;—but for Lord Orville,—if then he thought me an idiot, now, I am sure, he must believe me both bold and presuming. Make use of his name!—what impertinence!—he can never know how it hap

pened,—he can only imagine it was from an ex

cess of vanity:—well, however, I shall leave this bad city to-morrow, and never again will I enter it!
</p>
<p>
The Captain intends to take us to-night to the Fantocini. I cannot bear that Captain; I can give you no idea how gross he is. I heartily rejoice that he was not present at the disagreeable con

clusion of yesterday's adventure, for I am sure he would have contributed to my confusion; which might perhaps have diverted him, as he seldom or never smiles but at some other person's ex

pence.
</p>
<p>
And here I conclude my London letters;—and without any regret, for I am too inexperienced and ignorant to conduct myself with propriety in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1259700101:72"/>
this town, where every thing is new to me, and many things are unaccountable and perplexing.
</p>
<p>
Adieu, my dear Sir; Heaven restore me safely to you! I wish I was to go immediately to Berry Hill; yet the wish is ungrateful to Mrs. Mirvan, and therefore I will repress it. I shall write an account of the Fantocini from Howard Grove. We have not been to half the public places that are now open, though I dare say you will think we have been to all. But they are almost as in

numerable as the persons who fill them.
</p>

Queen-Ann-street,
<date>April 13.</date>
</dateline>
</opener>
<p>
HOW much will you be surprised, my dear

est Sir, at receiving another letter from London of your Evelina's writing! But, believe me, it was not my fault, neither is it my happiness, that I am still here: our journey has been postponed by an accident equally unexpected and disagree

able.
</p>
<p>
We went last night to see the Fantocini, where we had infinite entertainment from the perform

ance of a little comedy, in French and Italian, by puppets, so admirably managed, that they both astonished and diverted us all, except the Captain, who has a fixed and most prejudiced hatred of whatever is not English.
</p>
<p>
When it was over, while we waited for the coach, a tall elderly woman brushed quickly past us, calling out,
<q rend="inline">"My God! what shall I do?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1259700101:73"/>
<q rend="inline">
"Why what
<hi>would</hi>
you do,"
</q>
cried the Captain.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Ma foi, Monsieur,</hi>
"
</q>
answered she,
<q rend="inline">
"I have lost my company, and in this place I don't know nobody."
</q>
</p>
<p>
There was something foreign in her accent, though it was difficult to discover whether she was an English or a French woman. She was very well dressed, and seemed so entirely at a loss what to do, that Mrs. Mirvan proposed to the Captain to assist her.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Assist her!"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"ay, with all my heart;—let a link-boy call her a coach."
</q>
</p>
<p>
There was not one to be had, and it rained very fast.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Mon Dieu,</hi>
"
</q>
exclaimed the stranger,
<q rend="inline">
"what shall become of me?
<hi>Je suis au désespoir!</hi>
"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Dear Sir,"</q>
cried Miss Mirvan,
<q rend="inline">
"pray let us take the poor lady into our coach. She is quite alone, and a foreigner—."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"She's never the better for that,"</q>
answered he:
<q rend="inline">
"she may be a woman of the town, for any thing you know."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"She does not appear such,"</q>
said Mrs. Mirvan,
<q rend="inline">
"and indeed she seems so much distressed, that we shall but follow the golden rule, if we carry her to her lodgings."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You are mighty fond of new acquaintance,"</q>
returned he,
<q rend="inline">"but first let us know if she be going our way."</q>
</p>
<p>
Upon enquiry, we found that she lived in Ox

ford Road, and, after some disputing, the Captain, surlily, and with a very bad grace, consented to admit her into his coach; though he soon con

vinced us, that he was determined she should not be too much obliged to him, for he seemed ab

solutely bent upon quarrelling with her: for which
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1259700101:74"/>
strange inhospitality, I can assign no other reason, than that she appeared to be a foreigner.
</p>
<p>
The conversation began, by her telling us, that she had been in England only two days; that the gentlemen belonging to her were Parisians, and had left her, to see for a hackney-coach, as her own carriage was abroad; and that she had waited for them till she was quite frightened, and con

cluded that they had lost themselves.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"And pray,"</q>
said the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"why did you go to a public place without an Englishman?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Ma foi,</hi>
Sir,"
</q>
answered she,
<q rend="inline">"because none of my acquaintance is in town."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why then,"</q>
said he,
<q rend="inline">
"I'll tell you what; your best way is to go out of it yourself."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Pardie, Monsieur,</hi>
"
</q>
returned she,
<q rend="inline">
"and so I shall; for, I promise you, I think the English a parcel of brutes; and I'll go back to France as fast as I can, for I would not live among none of you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Who wants you?"</q>
cried the Captain;
<q rend="inline">
"do you suppose, Madam French, we have not enough of other nations to pick our pockets already? I'll warrant you, there's no need of you for to put in your oar."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Pick your pockets, Sir! I wish nobody wanted to pick your pockets no more than I do; and I'll promise you, you'd be safe enough. But there's no nation under the sun can beat the English for ill-politeness: for my part, I hate the very sight of them, and so I shall only just visit a person of quality or two, of my particular acquaintance, and then I shall go back again to France."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Ay, do,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"and then go to the devil together, for that's the fittest voyage for the French and the quality."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1259700101:75"/>
<q rend="inline">"We'll take care, however,"</q>
cried the stranger, with great vehemence,
<q rend="inline">
"not to admit none of your vulgar, unmannered English among us."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O never fear,"</q>
(returned he coolly)
<q rend="inline">
"we shan't dispute the point with you; you and the quality may have the devil all to yourselves."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Desirous of changing the subject of a conver

sation which now became very alarming, Miss Mirvan called out,
<q rend="inline">"Lord, how slow the man drives!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Never mind, Moll,"</q>
said her father,
<q rend="inline">
"I'll warrant you he'll drive fast enough to-morrow, when you're going to Howard Grove."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"To Howard Grove!"</q>
exclaimed the stranger;
<q rend="inline">
"why,
<hi>mon Dieu,</hi>
do you know Lady Howard?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why, what if we do?"</q>
answered he,
<q rend="inline">
"that's nothing to you; she's none of
<hi>your</hi>
quality, I'll promise you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Who told you that?</q>
cried she,
<q rend="inline">
"you don't know nothing about the matter; besides, you're the ill-bredest person ever I see; and as to your knowing Lady Howard, I don't believe no such a thing; unless, indeed, you are her steward."
</q>
</p>
<p>
The Captain, swearing terribly, said, with great fury,
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>you</hi>
would much sooner be taken for her wash-woman."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Her wash-woman, indeed!—Ha, ha, ha!—why you han't no eyes; did you ever see a wash

woman in such a gown as this?—besides, I'm no such mean person, for I'm as good as Lady Howard, and as rich too; and besides, I'm now come to England to visit her."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You may spare yourself that there trouble,"</q>
said the Captain,
<q rend="inline">"she has paupers enough about her already."</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1259700101:76"/>
<q rend="inline">
"Paupers, Mr.!—no more a pauper than yourself, nor so much neither;—but you're a low, dirty fellow, and I shan't stoop to take no more notice of you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Dirty fellow!"</q>
(exclaimed the Captain, seiz

ing both her wrists)
<q rend="inline">
"hark you, Mrs. Frog, you'd best hold your tongue, for I must make bold to tell you, if you don't, that I shall make no ceremony of tripping you out of the window; and there you may lie in the mud till some of your Monsieurs come to help you out of it."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Their encreasing passion quite terrified us; and Mrs. Mirvan was beginning to remonstrate with the Captain, when we were all silenced by what follows.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Let me go, villain that you are, let me go, or I'll promise you I'll get you put to prison for this usage; I'm no common person, I assure you, and,
<hi>ma foi,</hi>
I'll go to Justice Fielding about you; for I'm a person of fashion, and I'll make you know it, or my name i' n't Duval."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I heard no more: amazed, frightened, and un

speakably shocked, an involuntary exclamation of
<hi>Gracious Heaven!</hi>
escaped me, and more dead than alive, I sunk into Mrs. Mirvan's arms. But let me draw a veil over a scene too cruel for a heart so compassionately tender as yours; it is sufficient that you know this supposed foreigner proved to be Madame Duval,—the grandmother of your Evelina.
</p>
<p>
O, Sir, to discover so near a relation in a woman who had thus introduced herself!—what would become of me, were it not for you, my protector, my friend, and my refuge?
</p>
<p>
My extreme concern, and Mrs. Mirvan's sur

prise, immediately betrayed me. But I will not
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1259700101:77"/>
shock you with the manner of her acknowledging me, or the bitterness, the
<hi>grossness</hi>
—I cannot other

wise express myself,—with which she spoke of those unhappy past transactions you have so pa

thetically related to me. All the misery of a much

injured parent, dear, though never seen, regretted though never known, crowded so forcibly upon my memory, that they rendered this interview—one only excepted—the most afflicting I can ever know.
</p>
<p>
When we stopt at her lodgings, she desired me to accompany her into the house, and said she could easily procure a room for me to sleep in. Alarmed and trembling, I turned to Mrs. Mirvan.
<q rend="inline">"My daughter, Madam,</q>
said that sweet woman,"
<q rend="inline">
cannot so abruptly part with her young friend; you must allow a little time to wean them from each other."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Pardon me, Ma'am,"</q>
answered Madame Du

val, (who, from the time of her being known some

what softened her manners)
<q rend="inline">
"Miss can't possibly be so nearly connected to this child as I am."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No matter for that,"</q>
cried the Captain, (who espoused my cause to satisfy his own pique, though an awkward apology had passed between them)
<q rend="inline">
"she was sent to us, and so, d'ye see, we don't chuse for to part with her."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I promised to wait upon her at what time she pleased the next day, and, after a short debate, she desired me to breakfast with her, and we pro

ceeded to Queen-Ann-Street.
</p>
<p>
What an unfortunate adventure! I could not close my eyes the whole night. A thousand times I wished I had never left Berry Hill; however, my return thither shall be accelerated to the utmost of my power; and once more in that abode of tran

quil
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1259700101:78"/>
happiness, I will suffer no temptation to al

lure me elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Mirvan was so kind as to accompany me to Madame Duval's house this morning. The Captain, too, offered his service, which I de

clined, from a fear she should suppose I meant to insult her.
</p>
<p>
She frowned most terribly upon Mrs. Mirvan, but she received me with as much tenderness as I believe she is capable of feeling. Indeed, our meeting seems really to have affected her; for when, overcome by the variety of emotions which the sight of her occasioned, I almost fainted in her arms, she burst into tears, and said,
<q rend="inline">"Let me not lose my poor daughter a second time!"</q>
This unexpected humanity softened me extremely; but she very soon excited my warmest indignation, by the ungrateful mention she made of the best of men, my dear, and most generous benefactor. However, grief and anger mutually gave way to terror, upon her avowing the intention of her vi

siting England was to make me return with her to France. This, she said, was a plan she had form

ed from the instant she had heard of my birth, which, she protested, did not reach her ears till I must have been twelve years of age; but Mon

sieur Duval, who, she declared, was the worst husband in the world, would not permit her to do any thing she wished: he had been dead but three months, which had been employed in ar

ranging certain affairs, that were no sooner settled, than she set off for England. She was already out of mourning, for she said nobody here could tell how long she had been a widow.
</p>
<p>
She must have been married very early in life; what her age is, I do not know, but she really
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1259700101:79"/>
looks to be less than fifty. She dresses very gaily, paints very high, and the traces of former beauty are still very visible in her face.
</p>
<p>
I know not, when, or how, this visit would have ended, had not the Captain called for Mrs. Mir

van, and absolutely insisted upon my attending her. He is become, very suddenly, so warmly my friend, that I quite dread his officiousness. Mrs. Mirvan, however, whose principal study seems to be healing those wounds which her husband inflicts, appeased Madame Duval's wrath, by a very polite invita

tion to drink tea and spend the evening here. Not without great difficulty was the Captain prevailed upon to defer his journey some time longer; but what could be done? it would have been indecent for me to have quitted the town the very instant I discovered that Madame Duval was in it; and to have stayed here solely under her protection—Mrs. Mirvan, thank Heaven, was too kind for such a thought. That she should follow us to Howard Grove, I almost equally dreaded; it is, therefore, determined that we remain in London for some days, or a week: though the Captain has de

clared that the
<hi>old French hag,</hi>
as he is pleased to call her, shall fare never the better for it.
</p>
<p>
My only hope, is to get safe to Berry Hill; where, counselled and sheltered by you, I shall have nothing more to fear. Adieu, my ever dear and most honoured Sir! I shall have no happiness till I am again with you!

<head type="sub">Mr. Villars to Evelina.</head>
<opener>
<dateline>
Berry-Hill,
<date>April 16.</date>
</dateline>
</opener>
<p>
IN the belief and hope that my Evelina would ere now have bid adieu to London, I had intended to have deferred writing, till I heard of her return to Howard Grove; but the letter I have this moment received, with intelligence of Madame Duval's ar

rival in England, demands an immediate answer.
</p>
<p>
Her journey hither equally grieves and alarms me: how much did I pity my child, when I read of a discovery at once so unexpected and unwished! I have long dreaded this meeting and its conse

quence; to claim you, seems naturally to follow acknowledging you: I am well acquainted with her disposition, and have for many years foreseen the contest which now threatens us.
</p>
<p>
Cruel as are the circumstances of this affair, you must not, my love, suffer it to depress your spirits; remember, that while life is lent me, I will devote it to your service; and, for future time, I will make such provision as shall seem to me most conducive to your future happiness. Se

cure of my protection, and relying on my tender

ness, let no apprehensions of Madame Duval dis

turb your peace; conduct yourself towards her with all the respect and deference due to so near a relation, remembering always, that the failure of duty on her part, can by no means justify any ne

glect on yours: indeed, the more forcibly you are struck with improprieties and misconduct in ano

ther,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1259700101:81"/>
the greater should be your observance and diligence to avoid even the shadow of similar er

rors. Be careful, therefore, that no remissness of attention, no indifference of obliging, make known to her the independence I assure you of; but when she fixes the time for her leaving England, trust to me the task of refusing your attending her: disa

greeable to myself I own it will be, yet to you, it would be improper, if not impossible.
</p>
<p>
In regard to her opinion of me, I am more sorry than surprised at her determined blindness; the palliation, which she feels the want of, for her own conduct, leads her to seek for failings in all who were concerned in those unhappy transactions which she has so much reason to lament. And this, as it is the cause, so we must, in some mea

sure, consider it as the excuse of her inveteracy.
</p>
<p>
How grateful to me are your wishes to return to Berry Hill! your lengthened stay in London, and the dissipation in which I find you are involved, fill me with uneasiness: I mean not, however, that I would have you sequester yourself from the party to which you belong, since Mrs. Mirvan might thence infer a reproof which your youth and her kindness would render inexcusable. I will not, therefore, enlarge upon this subject, but content myself with telling you, that I shall heartily re

joice when I hear of your safe arrival at How

ard Grove, for which place I hope you will be preparing at the time you receive this letter.
</p>
<p>
I cannot too much thank you, my best Evelina, for the minuteness of your communications; con

tinue to me this indulgence, for I should be mi

serable if in ignorance of your proceedings.
</p>
<p>
How new to you is the scene of life in which you are now engaged,—balls—plays—operas—ri

dottos
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1259700101:82"/>
—Ah, my child! at your return hither, how will you bear the change? My heart trembles for your future tranquillity.—Yet I will hope every thing from the unsullied whiteness of your soul, and the native liveliness of your disposition.
</p>
<p>
I am sure I need not say, how much more I was pleased with the mistakes of your inexperience at the private ball, than with the attempted adoption of more fashionable manners at the ridotto. But your confusion and mortifications were such as to entirely silence all reproofs on my part.
</p>
<p>
I hope you will see no more of Sir Clement Wil

loughby, whose conversation and boldness are ex

tremely disgustful to me. I was gratified by the good-nature of Lord Orville, upon your making use of his name, but I hope you will never again put it to such a trial.
</p>
<p>
Heaven bless thee, my dear child, and grant that neither misfortune nor vice may ever rob thee of that gaiety of heart which, resulting from in

nocence, while it constitutes your own, contributes also to the felicity of all who know you!

Queen-Ann-Street,
<date>Thursday morning, April 14.</date>
</dateline>

<p>
BEFORE our dinner was over yesterday, Ma

dame Duval came to tea; though it will lessen your surprise, to hear that it was near five o'clock, for we never dine till the day is almost over. She was asked into another room, while the table was
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1259700101:83"/>
cleared, and then was invited to partake of the dessert.
</p>
<p>
She was attended by a French gentleman, whom she introduced by the name of Monsieur Du Bois: Mrs. Mirvan received them both with her usual politeness; but the Captain looked very much dis

pleased, and, after a short silence, very sternly said to Madame Duval,
<q rend="inline">
"Pray who asked you to bring that there spark with you?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O,"</q>
cried she,
<q rend="inline">
"I never go no-where with

out him."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Another short silence ensued, which was termi

nated by the Captain's turning roughly to the fo

reigner, and saying,
<q rend="inline">
"Do you know, Monsieur, that you're the first Frenchman I ever let come into my house?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Monsieur Du Bois made a profound bow. He speaks no English and understands it so imperfectly, that he might possibly imagine he had received a compliment.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Mirvan endeavoured to divert the Cap

tain's ill-humour, by starting new subjects; but he left to her all the trouble of supporting them, and leant back in his chair in gloomy silence, ex

cept when any opportunity offered of uttering some sarcasm upon the French. Finding her efforts to render the evening agreeable were fruitless, Mrs. Mirvan proposed a party to Ranelagh. Madame Duval joyfully consented to it, and the Captain, though he railed against the dissipation of the wo

men, did not oppose it, and therefore Maria and I ran up stairs to dress ourselves.
</p>
<p>
Before we were ready, word was brought us, that Sir Clement Willoughby was in the draw

ing-room. He introduced himself under the pre

tence of enquiring after all our healths, and entered
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1259700101:84"/>
the room with the easy air of an old acquaintance; though Mrs. Mirvan confesses that he seemed em

barrassed, when he found how coldly he was re

ceived, not only by the Captain, but by herself.
</p>
<p>
I was extremely disconcerted at the thoughts of seeing this man again, and did not go down stairs till I was called to tea. He was then deeply en

gaged in a discourse upon French manners with Madame Duval and the Captain, and the subject seemed so entirely to engross him, that he did not, at first, observe my entrance into the room. Their conversation was supported with great vehemence; the Captain roughly maintaining the superiority of the English in every particular, and Madame Duval warmly refusing to allow of it in any; while Sir Clement exerted all his powers of argu

ment and of ridicule to second and strengthen whatever was advanced by the Captain: for he had the sagacity to discover, that he could take no method so effectual for making the master of the house his friend, as to make Madame Duval his enemy: and indeed, in a very short time, he had reason to congratulate himself upon his success

ful discernment.
</p>
<p>
As soon as he saw me he made a most respect

ful bow, and hoped I had not suffered from the fatigue of the ridotto: I made no other answer than a slight inclination of the head, for I was very much ashamed of that whole affair. He then returned to the disputants, where he mana

ged the argument so skilfully, at once provoking Madame Duval and delighting the Captain, that I could not forbear admiring his address, though I condemned his subtlety. Mrs. Mirvan, dreading such violent antagonists, attempted frequently to change the subject; and she might have succeeded
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1259700101:85"/>
but for the interposition of Sir Clement, who would not suffer it to be given up, and supported it with such humour and satire, that he seems to have won the Captain's heart; though their uni

ted forces so enraged and overpowered Madame Duval, that she really trembled with passion.
</p>
<p>
I was very glad when Mrs. Mirvan said it was time to be gone. Sir Clement arose to take leave; but the Captain very cordially invited him to join our party: he
<hi>had</hi>
an engagement, he said, but would give it up to have that pleasure.
</p>
<p>
Some little confusion ensued in regard to our manner of setting off: Mrs. Mirvan offered Ma

dame Duval a place in her coach, and proposed that we four females should go all together; how

ever, this she rejected, declaring she would by no means go so far without a gentleman, and won

dering so polite a lady could make
<hi>so English</hi>
a proposal. Sir Clement Willoughby said his cha

riot was waiting at the door, and begged to know if it could be of any use. It was, at last, deci

ded, that a hackney-coach should be called for Monsieur Du Bois and Madame Duval, in which the Captain, and, at his request, Sir Clement, went also; Mrs. and Miss Mirvan and I had a peaceful and comfortable ride by ourselves.
</p>
<p>
I don't doubt but they quarrelled all the way; for when we met at Ranelagh, every one seemed out of humour: and, though we joined parties, poor Madame Duval was avoided as much as pos

sible by all but me, and I did not dare quit her for an instant: indeed I believe she was resolved I should not, for she leant upon my arm almost all the evening.
</p>
<p>
The room was so very much crowded, that, but for the uncommon assiduity of Sir Clement
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1259700101:86"/>
Willoughby, we should not have been able to pro

cure a box (which is the name given to the arched recesses which are appropriated for tea-parties) till half the company had retired. As we were taking possession of our places, some ladies of Mrs. Mir

van's acquaintance stopped to speak to her, and persuaded her to
<hi>take a round</hi>
with them. When she returned to us, what was my surprize, to see that Lord Orville had joined her party! The ladies walked on; Mrs. Mirvan seated herself, and made a slight, though respectful invitation to Lord Orville to drink his tea with us, which, to my no small consternation, he accepted.
</p>
<p>
I felt a confusion unspeakable at again seeing him, from the recollection of the ridotto adven

ture: nor did my situation lessen it, for I was seated between Madame Duval and Sir Clement, who seemed as little as myself to desire Lord Orville's presence. Indeed, the continual wrangling and ill-breeding of Captain Mirvan and Madame Du

val, made me blush that I belonged to them. And poor Mrs. Mirvan and her amiable daughter had still less reason to be satisfied.
</p>
<p>
A general silence ensued after he was seated: his appearance, from different motives, gave a universal restraint to every body. What his own reasons were for honouring us with his company, I cannot imagine, unless, indeed, he had a curiosity to know whether I should invent any new imperti

nence concerning him.
</p>
<p>
The first speech was made by Madame Duval, who said,
<q rend="inline">
"It's quite a shocking thing to see ladies come to so genteel a place as Ranelagh with hats on; it has a monstrous vulgar look: I can't think what they wear them for. There's no such a thing to be seen in Paris."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1259700101:87"/>
<q rend="inline">"Indeed,"</q>
cried Sir Clement,
<q rend="inline">
"I must own myself no advocate for hats; I am sorry the la

dies ever invented or adopted so tantalizing a fa

shion; for, where there is beauty, they only serve to shade it, and where there is none, to excite an unavailing curiosity. I fancy they were originally worn by some young and whimsical coquet."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"More likely,"</q>
answered the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"they were invented by some wrinkled old hag, who'd a mind for to keep the young fellows in chace, let them be never so weary."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I don't know what you may do in England,"</q>
cried Madame Duval,
<q rend="inline">
"but I know in Paris no woman need n't be at such a trouble as that, to be taken very genteel notice of."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why, will you pretend for to say,"</q>
returned the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"that they don't distinguish the old from the young there as well as here?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"They don't make no distinguishments at all,"</q>
said she;
<q rend="inline">"they're vastly too polite."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"More fools they!"</q>
said the Captain sneer

ingly.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Would to Heaven,"</q>
cried Sir Clement,
<q rend="inline">
"that, for our own sakes, we Englishmen too were blest with so accommodating a blindness!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why the devil do you make such a prayer as that?"</q>
demanded the Captain:
<q rend="inline">
"them are the first foolish words I've heard you speak; but I suppose you're not much used to that sort of work. Did you ever make a prayer before, since you were a sniveler?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Ay, now,"</q>
cried Madame Duval,
<q rend="inline">
"that's another of the unpolitenesses of you English, to go to talking of such things as that: now, in Paris, nobody never says nothing about religion, no more than about politics."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:1259700101:88"/>
<q rend="inline">"Why then,"</q>
answered he,
<q rend="inline">
"it's a sign they take no more care of their souls, than of their country, and so both one and t'other go to old Nick."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Well, if they do,"</q>
said she,
<q rend="inline">
"who's the worse, so long as they don't say nothing about it? it's the tiresomest thing in the world to be always talking of them sort of things, and nobody that's ever been abroad troubles their heads about them."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Pray then,"</q>
cried the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"since you know so much of the matter, be so good as to tell us what they
<hi>do</hi>
trouble their heads about?—hay, Sir Clement! ha'n't we a right to know that much?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"A very comprehensive question,"</q>
said Sir Clement,
<q rend="inline">
"and I expect much instruction from the lady's answer."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Come, Madam,"</q>
continued the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"never flinch; speak at once; don't stop for thinking."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I assure you I am not going,"</q>
answered she;
<q rend="inline">
"for as to what they
<hi>do</hi>
do, why they've enough to do, I promise you, what with one thing or ano

ther."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"But
<hi>what, what</hi>
do they do, these famous Monsieurs?"
</q>
demanded the Captain;
<q rend="inline">
"can't you tell us? do they game?—or drink?—or fiddle?—or are they jockies?—or do they spend all their time in slummering old women?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"As to that, Sir,—but indeed I shan't trouble myself to answer such a parcel of low questions, so don't ask me no more about it."
</q>
And then, to my great vexation, turning to Lord Orville, she said,
<q rend="inline">"Pray, Sir, was you ever in Paris?"</q>
</p>
<p>He only bowed.</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"And pray, Sir, how did you like it?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1259700101:89"/>
This
<hi>comprehensive</hi>
question, as Sir Clement would have called it, though it made him smile, also made him hesitate; however, his answer was expressive of his approbation.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I thought you would like it, Sir, because you look so like a gentleman. As to the Captain, and as to that other gentleman, why they may very well not like what they don't know: for I suppose, Sir, you was never abroad?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Only three years, Ma'am,"</q>
answered Sir Clement, drily.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Well, that's very surprising! I should never have thought it: however, I dare say you only kept company with the English."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why pray, who
<hi>should</hi>
he keep company with?"
</q>
cried the Captain:
<q rend="inline">
"what, I suppose you'd have him ashamed of his own nation, like some other people, not a thousand miles off, on purpose to make his own nation ashamed of him."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I'm sure it would be a very good thing if you'd go abroad yourself."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"How will you make out that, hay, Madam? come, please to tell me, where would be the good of that?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Where! why a great deal. They'd make quite another person of you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"What, I suppose you'd have me learn to cut capers?—and dress like a monkey?—and palavar in French gibberish?—hay, would you?—And powder, and daub, and make myself up, like some other folks?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I would have you learn to be more politer, Sir, and not to talk to ladies in such a rude, old-fa

shion way as this. You, Sir, as have been in Pa

ris"
</q>
(again addressing herself to Lord Orville)
<q rend="inline">
"can tell this English gentleman how he'd be despised,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1259700101:90"/>
if he was to talk in such an ungenteel manner as this, before any foreigners. Why there is n't a hair-dresser, nor a shoe-maker, nor nobody, that would n't blush to be in your company."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why look ye, Madam,"</q>
answered the Cap

tain,
<q rend="inline">
"as to your hair-pinchers and shoe-blacks, you may puff off their manners, and welcome; and I am heartily glad you like 'em so well; but, as to me, since you must needs make so free of your advice, I must e'en tell you, I never kept company with any such gentry."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Come, ladies and gentlemen,"</q>
said Mrs. Mirvan,
<q rend="inline">
"as many of you as have done tea, I invite to walk with me."
</q>
Maria and I started up instantly; Lord Orville followed; and I question whether we were not half round the room ere the angry disputants knew that we had left the box.
</p>
<p>
As the husband of Mrs. Mirvan had borne so large a share in this disagreeable altercation, Lord Orville forbore to make any comments upon it; so that the subject was immediately dropt, and the conversation became calmly sociable, and po

litely chearful, and, to every body but me, must have been highly agreeable:—but, as to myself, I was so eagerly desirous of making some apology to Lord Orville for the impertinence of which he must have thought me guilty at the ridotto, and yet so utterly unable to assume sufficient courage to speak to him concerning an affair in which I had so terribly exposed myself, that I hardly ven

tured to say a word all the time we were walk

ing. Besides, the knowledge of his contemptuous opinion, haunted and dispirited me, and made me fear he might possibly misconstrue whatever I should say. So that, far from enjoying a conver

sation
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1259700101:91"/>
that might, at any other time, have de

lighted me, I continued silent, uncomfortable, and ashamed. O Sir, shall I ever again involve myself in so foolish an embarrassment? I am sure that if I do, I shall deserve yet greater mortification.
</p>
<p>
We were not joined by the rest of the party till we had taken three or four turns round the room, and then, they were so quarrelsome, that Mrs. Mirvan complained of being fatigued, and propo

sed going home. No one dissented. Lord Or

ville joined another party, having first made an offer of his services, which the gentlemen de

clined, and we proceeded to an outward room, where we waited for the carriages. It was settled that we should return to town in the same man

ner we came to Ranelagh, and, accordingly, Mon

sieur Du Bois handed Madame Duval into a hack

ney-coach, and was just preparing to follow her, when she screamed, and jumpt hastily out, de

claring she was wet through all her clothes. In

deed, upon examination, the coach was found to be in a dismal condition; for the weather proved very bad, and the rain had, though I know not how, made its way into the carriage.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. and Miss Mirvan, and myself, were al

ready disposed of as before; but no sooner did the Captain hear this account, than, without any ceremony, he was so civil as to immediately take possession of the vacant seat in his own coach, leaving Madame Duval and Monsieur Du Bois to take care of themselves. As to Sir Clement Wil

loughby, his own chariot was in waiting.
</p>
<p>
I instantly begged permission to offer Madame Duval my own place, and made a motion to get out; but Mrs. Mirvan stopped me, saying that I
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:1259700101:92"/>
should then be obliged to return to town with only the foreigner, or Sir Clement.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O never mind the old Beldame,"</q>
cried the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"she's weather-proof, I'll answer for her; and besides, as we are all, I hope,
<hi>English,</hi>
why she'll meet with no worse than she expects from us."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I do not mean to defend her,"</q>
said Mrs. Mirvan;
<q rend="inline">
"but indeed, as she belongs to our par

ty, we cannot, with any decency, leave the place, till she is, by some means, accommodated."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Lord, my dear,"</q>
cried the Captain, whom the distress of Madame Duval had put into very good humour,
<q rend="inline">
"why she'll break her heart, if she meets with any civility from a filthy Englishman."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Mirvan, however, prevailed, and we all got out of the coach, to wait till Madame Duval could meet with some better carriage. We found her, attended by Monsieur Du Bois, standing amongst the servants, and very busy in wiping her negligee, and endeavouring to save it from being stained by the wet, as she said it was a new Lyons silk. Sir Clement Willoughby offered her the use of his chariot, but she had been too much piqued by his raillery to accept it. We waited some time, but in vain, for no hackney-coach could be procured. The Captain, at last, was persuaded to accompany Sir Clement himself, and we four females were handed into Mrs. Mirvan's carriage, though not before Madame Duval had insisted upon our making room for Monsieur Du Bois, to which the Captain only consented in pre

ference to being incommoded by him in Sir Cle

ment's chariot.
</p>
<p>
Our party drove off first. We were silent and unsociable; for the difficulties attending this ar

rangement
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:1259700101:93"/>
had made every one languid and fa

tigued. Unsociable, I must own, we continued; but very short was the duration of our silence, as we had not proceeded thirty yards, ere every voice was heard at once,—for the coach broke down! I suppose we concluded of course, that we were all half killed, by the violent shrieks that seemed to come from every mouth. The chariot was stopped, the servants came to our assistance, and we were all taken out of the carriage, with

out having been at all hurt. The night was dark and wet; but I had scarce touched the ground, when I was lifted suddenly from it, by Sir Clement Willoughby, who begged permission to assist me, though he did not wait to have it granted, but car

ried me in his arms back to Ranelagh.
</p>
<p>
He enquired very earnestly if I was not hurt by the accident? I assured him I was perfectly safe, and free from injury, and desired he would leave me, and return to the rest of the party, for I was very uneasy to know whether they had been equally fortunate. He told me he was happy in being honoured with my commands, and would joyfully execute them; but insisted upon first con

ducting me to a warm room, as I had not wholly escaped being wet. He did not regard my objec

tions, but made me follow him to an apartment, where we found an excellent fire, and some com

pany waiting for carriages. I readily accepted a seat, and then begged he would go.
</p>
<p>
And go, indeed, he did; but he returned in a moment, telling me that the rain was more violent than ever, and that he had sent his servants to offer their assistance, and acquaint
<hi>the Mirvans</hi>
of my situation. I was very mad that he would not go himself; but as my acquaintance with him
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:1259700101:94"/>
was so very slight, I did not think proper to urge him contrary to his inclination.
</p>
<p>
Well, he drew a chair close to mine, and, after again enquiring how I did, said, in a low voice,
<q rend="inline">
"You will pardon me, Miss Anville, if the eager

ness I feel to vindicate myself, induces me to snatch this opportunity of making sincere acknowledg

ments for the impertinence with which I torment

ed you at the last ridotto. I can assure you, Madam, I have been a true and sorrowful peni

tent ever since; but—shall I tell you honestly what encouraged me to—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
He stopt; but I said nothing, for I thought instantly of the conversation Miss Mirvan had overheard, and supposed he was going to tell me himself what part Lord Orville had borne in it; and really I did not wish to hear it repeated. In

deed, the rest of his speech convinces me that such was his intention; with what view, I know not, except to make a merit of his defending me.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"And yet,</q>
he continued,
<q rend="inline">
"my excuse may only expose my own credulity, and want of judg

ment and penetration. I will, therefore, merely beseech your pardon, and hope that some future time—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Just then, the door was opened by Sir Clement's servant, and I had the pleasure of seeing the Cap

tain, Mrs. and Miss Mirvan, enter the room.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O ho,"</q>
cried the former,
<q rend="inline">
"you have got a good warm birth here; but we shall beat up your quarters. Here, Lucy, Moll, come to the fire, and dry your trumpery. But, hey-day,—why where's old Madam French?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Good God,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">"is not Madame Duval then with you?</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"With me! No,—thank God."</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1259700101:95"/>
I was very uneasy to know what might have become of her, and, if they would have suffered me, I should have gone out in search of her my

self; but all the servants were dispatched to find her, and the Captain said we might be very sure her
<hi>French beau</hi>
would take care of her.
</p>
<p>
We waited some time without any tidings, and were soon the only party in the room. My un

easiness encreased so much, that Sir Clement now made a voluntary offer of seeking her. However, the same moment that he opened the door with this design, she presented herself at it, attended by Monsieur Du Bois.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I was this instant, Madam,"</q>
said he,
<q rend="inline">"coming to see for you."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You are mighty good, truly,"</q>
cried she,
<q rend="inline">"to come when all the mischief's over."</q>
</p>
<p>
She then entered,—in such a condition!—en

tirely covered with mud, and in so great a rage, it was with difficulty she could speak. We all expressed our concern, and offered our assistance,—except the Captain; who no sooner beheld her, than he burst into a loud laugh.
</p>
<p>
We endeavoured, by our enquiries and condole

ments, to prevent her attending to him; and she was, for some time, so wholly engrossed by her anger and her distress, that we succeeded without much trouble. We begged her to inform us how this accident had happened.
<q rend="inline">"How!"</q>
repeated she,—why
<q rend="inline">
"it was all along of your all going away,—and there poor Monsieur Du Bois—but it was n't his fault,—for he's as bad off as me."
</q>
</p>
<p>
All eyes were then turned to Monsieur Du Bois, whose clothes were in the same miserable plight with those of Madame Duval, and who, wet, shivering, and disconsolate, had crept to the fire.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1259700101:96"/>
The Captain laughed yet more heartily; while Mrs. Mirvan, ashamed of his rudeness, repeated her enquiries to Madame Duval; who answered,
<q rend="inline">
"Why, as we were a-coming along, all in the rain, Monsieur Du Bois was so obliging, though I'm sure it was an unlucky obligingness for me, as to lift me up in his arms, to carry me over a place that was ancle-deep in mud; but instead of my being ever the better for it, just as we were in the worst part,—I'm sure I wish we had been fifty miles off,—for somehow or other, his foot slipt,—at least, I suppose so,—though I can't think how it happened, for I'm no such great weight,—but, however that was, down we both came toge

ther, all in the mud;—and the more we tried to get up, the more deeper we got covered with the nastiness,—and my new Lyons negligee, too, quite spoilt!—however, it's well we got up at all, for we might have laid there till now, for aught you all cared; for nobody never came near us."
</q>
</p>
<p>
This recital put the Captain into an extacy; he went from the lady to the gentleman, and from the gentleman to the lady, to enjoy alter

nately the sight of their distress. He really shout

ed with pleasure; and, shaking Monsieur Du Bois strenuously by the hand, wished him joy of having
<hi>touched English ground;</hi>
and then he held a candle to Madame Duval, that he might have a more complete view of her disaster, declaring repeatedly, that he had never been better pleased in his life.
</p>
<p>
The rage of poor Madame Duval was unspeak

able; she dashed the candle out of his hand, stamped upon the floor, and, at last, spat in his face.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:1259700101:97"/>
This action seemed immediately to calm them both, as the joy of the Captain was converted into resentment, and the wrath of Madame Duval into fear; for he put his hands upon her shoulders, and gave her so violent a shake, that she screamed out for help; assuring her, at the same time, that if she had been one ounce less old, or less ugly, she should have had it all returned on her own face.
</p>
<p>
Monsieur Du Bois, who had seated himself very quietly at the fire, approached them, and expostulated very warmly with the Captain; but he was neither understood nor regarded, and Ma

dame Duval was not released, till she quite sobbed with passion.
</p>
<p>
When they were parted, I entreated her to permit the woman who has the charge of the ladies cloaks to assist her in drying her clothes; she con

sented, and we did what was possible to save her from catching cold. We were obliged to wait in this disagreeable situation near an hour, ere a hackney-coach could be found; and then we were disposed in the same manner as before our ac

cident.
</p>
<p>
I am going this morning to see poor Madame Duval, and to enquire after her health, which I think must have suffered by her last night's mis

fortunes; though, indeed, she seems to be natu

rally strong and hearty.
</p>
<closer>Adieu, my dear Sir, till to-morrow.</closer>

<head>LETTER XVII.</head>
<head type="sub">Evelina in continuation.</head>
<opener>
<dateline>
<date>Friday Morning, April 15.</date>
</dateline>
</opener>
<p>
SIR Clement Willoughby called here yester

day at noon, and Captain Mirvan invited him to dinner. For my part, I spent the day in a manner the most uncomfortable imaginable.
</p>
<p>
I found Madame Duval at breakfast in bed, though Monsieur Du Bois was in the chamber; which so much astonished me, that I was, invo

luntarily, retiring, without considering how odd an appearance my retreat would have, when Madame Duval called me back, and laughed very heartily at my ignorance of foreign customs.
</p>
<p>
The conversation, however, very soon took a more serious turn; for she began, with great bit

terness, to inveigh against the
<hi>barbarous brutality of that fellow the Captain,</hi>
and the horrible ill

breeding of the English in general, declaring she should make her escape with all expedition from so
<hi>beastly a nation.</hi>
</p>
<p>
She lamented, very mournfully, the fate of her Lyons silk, and protested she had rather have parted with all the rest of her wardrobe, because it was the first gown she had bought to wear upon leaving off her weeds. She has a very bad cold, and Monsieur Du Bois is so hoarse, he can hardly speak.
</p>
<p>
She insisted upon my staying with her all day, as she intended, she said, to introduce me to some of my own relations. I would very fain have
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1259700101:99"/>
excused myself, but she did not allow me any choice.
</p>
<p>
Till the arrival of these relations, one continu

ed series of questions on her side, and of answers on mine, filled up all the time we passed together. Her curiosity was insatiable; she enquired into every action of my life, and every particular that had fallen under my observation, in the lives of all I knew. Again, she was so cruel as to avow the most inveterate rancour against the sole benefactor her deserted child and grand-child have met with; and such was the indignation her in

gratitude raised, that I would actually have quitted her presence and house, had she not, in a man

ner the most peremptory, absolutely forbid me. But what, good Heaven! can induce her to such shocking injustice? O my friend and father! I have no command of myself when this subject is started.
</p>
<p>
She talked very much of taking me to Paris, and said I greatly wanted the polish of a French education. She lamented that I had been brought up in the country, which, she observed, had given me a very
<hi>bumpkinish air.</hi>
However, she bid me not despair, for she had known many girls, much worse than me, who had become very fine ladies after a few years residence abroad; and she parti

cularly instanced a Miss Polly Moore, daughter of a chandler's-shop woman, who, by an accident not worth relating, happened to be sent to Paris, where, from an awkward, ill-bred girl, she so much improved, that she has since been taken for a woman of quality.
</p>
<p>
The relations to whom she was pleased to in

troduce me, consisted of a Mr. Branghton, who is her nephew, and three of his children, the eldest
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1259700101:100"/>
of which is a son, and the two younger are daughters.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Branghton appears about forty years of age. He does not seem to want a common un

derstanding, though he is very contracted and pre

judiced: he has spent his whole time in the city, and I believe feels a great contempt for all who reside elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
His son seems weaker in his understanding, and more gay in his temper; but his gaiety is that of a foolish, over-grown school-boy, whose mirth consists in noise and disturbance. He disdains his father for his close attention to business, and love of money, though he seems himself to have no talents, spirit, or generosity, to make him supe

rior to either. His chief delight appears to be tormenting and ridiculing his sisters, who, in re

turn, most heartily despise him.
</p>
<p>
Miss Branghton, the eldest daughter, is by no means ugly, but looks proud, ill-tempered, and conceited. She hates the city, though without knowing why; for it is easy to discover she has lived no where else.
</p>
<p>
Miss Polly Branghton is rather pretty, very foolish, very ignorant, very giddy, and, I believe, very good-natured.
</p>
<p>
The first half hour was allotted to
<hi>
making them

selves comfortable,
</hi>
for they complained of having had a very dirty walk, as they came on foot from Snow Hill, where Mr. Branghton keeps a silver

smith's shop; and the young ladies had not only their coats to brush, and shoes to dry, but to ad

just their head dress, which their bonnets had to

tally discomposed.
</p>
<p>
The manner in which Madame Duval was pleased to introduce me to this family, extremely
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:1259700101:101"/>
shocked me.
<q rend="inline">"Here, my dears,"</q>
said she,
<q rend="inline">
"here's a relation you little thought of; but you must know my poor daughter Caroline had this child after she run away from me,—though I never knew nothing of it, not I, for a long while after; for they took care to keep it a secret from me, though the poor child has never a friend in the world besides."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Miss seems very tender-hearted, aunt,"</q>
said Miss Polly,
<q rend="inline">
"and to be sure she's not to blame for her mama's undutifulness, for she could n't help it."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Lord, no,"</q>
answered she,
<q rend="inline">
"and I never took no notice of it to her; for indeed, as to that, my own poor daughter was n't so much to blame as you may think, for she'd never have gone astray, if it had not been for that meddling old parson I told you of."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"If aunt pleases,"</q>
said young Mr. Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"we'll talk o' somewhat else, for Miss looks very uneasy-like."
</q>
</p>
<p>
The next subject that was chosen, was the age of the three young Branghtons and myself. The son is twenty; the daughters upon hearing that I was seventeen, said that was just the age of Miss Polly; but their brother, after a long dispute, proved that she was two years older, to the great anger of both sisters, who agreed that he was very ill-natured and spiteful.
</p>
<p>
When this point was settled, the question was put, which was tallest?—We were desired to mea

sure, as the Branghtons were all of different opi

nions. They, none of them, however, disputed my being the tallest in the company, but, in re

gard to one another, they were extremely quarrel

some: the brother insisted upon their measuring
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:1259700101:102"/>
<hi>fair,</hi>
and not with
<hi>heads</hi>
and
<hi>heels;</hi>
but they would by no means consent to lose these privileges of our sex, and therefore the young man was
<hi>cast,</hi>
as shortest; though he appealed to all present upon the injustice of the decree.
</p>
<p>
This ceremony over, the young ladies, began, very freely, to examine my dress, and to interro

gate me concerning it.
<q rend="inline">
"This apron's your own work, I suppose, Miss? but these sprigs a'n't in fashion now. Pray, if it is not impertinent, what might you give a yard for this lutestring?—Do you make your own caps, Miss?—"
</q>
and many other questions equally interesting and well-bred.
</p>
<p>
They then asked me
<hi>how I liked London?</hi>
and whether I should not think the country a very
<hi>dull place,</hi>
when I returned thither?
<q rend="inline">"Miss must try if she can't get a good husband,"</q>
said Mr. Branghton,
<q rend="inline">"and then she may stay and live here."</q>
</p>
<p>
The next topic was public places, or rather the theatres, for they knew of no other; and the me

rits and defects of all the actors and actresses were discussed: the young man here took the lead, and seemed to be very conversant on the subject. But, during this time, what was my concern, and suf

fer me to add, my indignation, when I found, by some words I occasionally heard, that Madame Duval was entertaining Mr. Branghton with all the most secret and cruel particulars of my situation! The eldest daughter was soon drawn to them by the recital; the youngest and the son still kept their places, intending, I believe, to divert me, though the conversation was all their own.
</p>
<p>
In a few minutes, Miss Branghton, coming sud

denly up to her sister, exclaimed,
<q rend="inline">
"Lord, Polly, only think! Miss never saw her papa!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:1259700101:103"/>
<q rend="inline">"Lord, how odd!"</q>
cried the other;
<q rend="inline">
"why then, Miss, I suppose you would n't know him?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
This was quite too much for me; I rose hastily, and ran out of the room: but I soon regretted I had so little command of myself, for the two sisters both followed, and insisted upon comforting me, notwithstanding my earnest entreaties to be left alone.
</p>
<p>
As soon as I returned to the company, Madame Duval said,
<q rend="inline">
"Why, my dear, what was the matter with you? why did you run away so?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
This question almost made me run again, for I knew not how to answer it. But is it not very extraordinary, that she can put me in situations so shocking, and then wonder to find me sensible of any concern?
</p>
<p>
Mr. Branghton, junior, now enquired of me, whether I had seen the Tower, or St. Paul's church? and, upon answering in the negative, they proposed making a party to shew them to me. Among other questions, they also asked if I had ever seen
<hi>such a thing as an Opera?</hi>
I told them I had.
<q rend="inline">"Well,"</q>
said Mr. Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"I never saw one in my life, so long as I've lived in London, and I never desire to see one, if I live here as much longer."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Lord, Papa,"</q>
cried Miss Polly,
<q rend="inline">
"why not? you might as well for once, for the curiosity of the thing: besides, Miss Pomfret saw one, and she says it was very pretty."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Miss will think us very vulgar,"</q>
said Miss Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"to live in London, and never have been to an Opera; but it's no fault of mine, I as

sure you, Miss, only Papa don't like to go."
</q>
</p>
<p>
The result was, that a party was proposed, and agreed to, for some early opportunity. I did not dare oppose them; but I said that my time, while
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:1259700101:104"/>
I remained in town, was at the disposal of Mrs. Mirvan. However, I am sure I will not attend them, if I can possibly avoid so doing.
</p>
<p>
When we parted, Madame Duval desired to see me the next day; and the Branghtons told me, that the first time I went towards Snow Hill, they should be very glad if I would call upon them.
</p>
<p>
I wish we may not meet again till that time ar

rives.
</p>
<p>
I am sure I shall not be very ambitious of being known to any more of my relations, if they have any resemblance to those whose acquaintance I have been introduced to already.

<head>LETTER XVIII.</head>

<p>
I Had just finished my letter to you this morning, when a violent rapping at the door made me run down stairs; and who should I see in the draw

ing room, but Lord Orville!
</p>
<p>
He was quite alone, for the family had not as

sembled to breakfast. He enquired, first of mine, then of the health of Mrs. and Miss Mirvan, with a degree of concern that rather surprised me, till he said that he had just been informed of the accident we had met with at Ranelagh. He expressed his sorrow upon the occasion with the utmost politeness, and lamented that he had not been so fortunate as to hear of it in time to offer his services.
<q rend="inline">"But, I think,"</q>
he added,
<q rend="inline">
"Sir Clement Willoughby had the honour of assisting you?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"He was with Captain Mirvan, my Lord."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I had heard of his being of your party."</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:1259700101:105"/>
I hope that flighty man has not been telling Lord Orville he only assisted
<hi>me?</hi>
however, he did not pursue the subject, but said,
<q rend="inline">
"This accident, though extremely unfortunate, will not, I hope, be the means of frightening you from gracing Ra

nelagh with your presence in future?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Our time, my Lord, for London is almost expired already."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Indeed! do you leave town so very soon?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"O yes, my Lord, our stay has already exceed

ed our intentions."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Are you, then, so particularly partial to the country?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"We merely came to town, my Lord, to meet Captain Mirvan."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"And does Miss Anville feel no concern at the idea of the many mourners her absence will occa

sion?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O, my Lord,—I'm sure you don't think—"</q>
I stopt there, for, indeed, I hardly knew what I was going to say. My foolish embarrassment, I suppose, was the cause of what followed;—for he came to me, and took my hand, saying,
<q rend="inline">
"I
<hi>do</hi>
think, that whoever has once seen Miss Anville, must re

ceive an impression never to be forgotten."
</q>
</p>
<p>
This compliment,—from Lord Orville,—so sur

prised me, that I could not speak; but felt myself change colour, and stood, for some moments, si

lent and looking down: however, the instant I re

collected my situation, I withdrew my hand, and told him that I would see if Mrs. Mirvan was not dressed. He did not oppose me, so away I went.
</p>
<p>
I met them all on the stairs, and returned with them to breakfast.
</p>
<p>
I have since been extremely angry with myself for neglecting so excellent an opportunity of apo

logizing
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:1259700101:106"/>
for my behaviour at the Ridotto: but, to own the truth, that affair never once occurred to me during the short
<hi>tête-à-tête</hi>
which we had to

gether. But, if, ever we should happen to be so situated again, I will certainly mention it; for I am inexpressibly concerned at the thought of his harbouring an opinion that I am bold or imperti

nent, and I could almost kill myself for having given him the shadow of a reason for so shocking an idea.
</p>
<p>
But was it not very odd, that he should make me such a compliment? I expected it not from him;—but gallantry, I believe, is common to all men, whatever other qualities they may have in particular.
</p>
<p>
Our breakfast was the most agreeable meal, if it may be called a
<hi>meal,</hi>
that we have had since we came to town. Indeed, but for Madame Du

val I should like London extremely.
</p>
<p>
The conversation of Lord Orville is really de

lightful. His manners are so elegant, so gentle, so unassuming, that they at once engage esteem, and diffuse complacence. Far from being indolently satisfied with his own accomplishments, as I have already observed many men here are, though with

out any pretensions to his merit, he is most assi

duously attentive to please and to serve all who are in his company; and, though his success is inva

riable, he never manifests the smallest degree of consciousness.
</p>
<p>
I could wish that
<hi>you,</hi>
my dearest Sir, knew Lord Orville, because I am sure you would love him; and I have felt that wish for no other person I have seen since I came to London. I sometimes imagine, that, when his youth is flown, his viva

city abated, and his life is devoted to retirement, he will, perhaps, resemble him whom I most love
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:1259700101:107"/>
and honour. His present sweetness, politeness, and diffidence, seem to promise in future the same be

nevolence, dignity, and goodness. But I must not expatiate upon this subject.
</p>
<p>
When Lord Orville was gone,—and he made but a very short visit,—I was preparing, most re

luctantly, to wait upon Madame Duval; but Mrs. Mirvan proposed to the Captain, that she should be invited to dinner in Queen-Ann-Street, and he readily consented, for he said he wished to ask after her Lyons negligee.
</p>
<p>
The invitation is accepted, and we expect her every moment. But to me, it is very strange, that a woman, who is the uncontrolled mistress of her time, fortune, and actions, should chuse to ex

pose herself voluntarily to the rudeness of a man who is openly determined to make her his sport. But she has very few acquaintance, and, I fancy, scarce knows how to employ herself.
</p>
<p>
How great is my obligation to Mrs. Mirvan, for bestowing her time in a manner so disagree

able to herself, merely to promote my happiness! every dispute in which her undeserving husband engages, is productive of pain, and uneasines s to herself; of this I am so sensible, that I even be

sought her not to send to Madame Duval, but she declared she could not bear to have me pass all my time, while in town, with her only. Indeed she is so infinitely kind to me, that one would think she was your daughter.

<head>LETTER XIX.</head>
<head type="sub">Evelina in continuation.</head>
<opener>
<dateline>
<date>Saturday Morning, April 16.</date>
</dateline>
</opener>
<p>
MADAME Duval was accompanied by Monsieur Du Bois. I am surprised that she should chuse to introduce him where he is so unwelcome; and, indeed, it is strange that they should be so constantly together: though I believe I should not have taken notice of it, but that Captain Mirvan is perpetually rallying me upon my
<hi>grandmama's beau.</hi>
</p>
<p>
They were both received by Mrs. Mirvan with her usual good-breeding; but the Captain, most provokingly, attacked her immediately, saying,
<q rend="inline">
"Now, Madam, you that have lived abroad, please to tell me this here; Which did you like best, the
<hi>warm room</hi>
at Ranelagh, or the
<hi>cold bath</hi>
you went into afterwards? though, I assure you, you look so well that I should advise you to take another dip."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Ma foi,</hi>
Sir,"
</q>
cried she,
<q rend="inline">
"nobody asked for your advice, so you may as well keep it to your

self: besides, it's no great joke to be splashed, and to catch cold, and spoil all one's things, whatever you may think of it."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Splashed,</hi>
quoth-a!—why I thought you were soused all over.—Come, come, don't mince the matter, never spoil a good story; you know you had n't a dry thread about you—'Fore George, I shall never think on't without hallooing! such a poor, forlorn, draggle-tailed—
<hi>gentlewoman!</hi>
and poor Monsieur French, here, like a drowned rat, by your side!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:1259700101:109"/>
<q rend="inline">
"Well, the worse pickle we was in, so much the worser in you not to help us, for you knowed where we was fast enough, because, while I laid in the mud, I'm pretty sure I heard you snigger; so it's like enough you jostled us down yourself, for Monsieur Du Bois says, that he is sure he had a great jolt given him, or he should n't have fell."
</q>
</p>
<p>
The Captain laughed so immoderately, that he really gave me also a suspicion that he was not entirely innocent of the charge: however, he dis

claimed it very peremptorily.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why then,"</q>
continued she,
<q rend="inline">
"if you did n't do that, why did n't you come to help us?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Who, I?—what, do you suppose I had forgot I was an
<hi>Englishman,</hi>
a filthy, beastly
<hi>Englishman?</hi>
"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Very well, Sir, very well; but I was a fool to expect any better, for it's all of a piece with the rest; you know you wanted to fling me out of the coach-window, the very first time ever I see you: but I'll never go to Ranelagh with you no more, that I'm resolved; for I dare say, if the horses had runn'd over me, as I laid in that nas

tiness, you'd never have stirred a step to save me?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Lord, no, to be sure, Ma'am, not for the world! I know your opinion of our nation too well, to affront you by supposing a
<hi>Frenchman</hi>
would want
<hi>my</hi>
assistance to protect you. Did you think that Monsieur here, and I, had changed characters, and that he should pop you into the mud, and I help you out of it? Ha, ha, ha!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"O, very well, Sir, laugh on, it's like your manners; however, if poor Monsieur Du Bois had n't met with that unlucky accident himself, I should n't have wanted nobody's help."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"O, I promise you, Madam, you'd never have had mine; I knew my distance better;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:1259700101:110"/>
and as to your being a little ducked, or so, why, to be sure, Monsieur and you settled that be

tween yourselves; so it was no business of mine."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"What, then, I suppose, you want to make me believe as Monsieur Du Bois served me that trick o' purpose?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"O' purpose! ay, certainly, who ever doubt

ed that? Do you think a
<hi>Frenchman</hi>
ever made a blunder? If he had been some clumsy-footed
<hi>English</hi>
fellow, indeed, it might have been acci

dental: but what the devil signifies all your hop

ping and capering with your dancing-masters, if you can't balance yourselves upright?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
In the midst of this dialogue, Sir Clement Willoughby made his appearance. He affects to enter the house with the freedom of an old ac

quaintance, and this very
<hi>easiness,</hi>
which, to me, is astonishing, is what most particularly recom

mends him to the Captain. Indeed, he seems very successfully to study all the humours of that gentleman.
</p>
<p>
After having heartily welcomed him,
<q rend="inline">"You are just come in time, my boy,"</q>
said he,
<q rend="inline">
"to settle a little matter of a dispute between this here gentlewoman and I; do you know, she has been trying to persuade me, that she did not above half like the ducking Monsieur gave her t'other night?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I should have hoped,"</q>
(said Sir Clement, with the utmost gravity)
<q rend="inline">
"that the friendship subsisting between that lady and gentleman, would have guarded them against any actions professedly disagreeable to each other; but, probably, they might not have discussed the matter previously; in which case, the gentleman, I must own, seems to have been guilty of inattention, since, in my
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:1259700101:111"/>
humble opinion, it was his business first to have enquired whether the lady preferred soft, or hard ground, before he dropt her."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O very fine, Gentlemen, very fine,"</q>
cried Madame Duval,
<q rend="inline">
"you may try to set us together by the ears as much as you will; but I'm not such an ignorant person as to be made a fool of so easi

ly; so you need n't talk no more about it, for I sees into your designs.
</q>
</p>
<p>
Monsieur Du Bois, who was just able to disco

ver the subject upon which the conversation turn

ed, made his defence, in French, with great so

lemnity; he hoped, he said, that the company would at least acknowledge, he did not come from a nation of brutes, and consequently, that to wil

fully offend any lady, was, to him, utterly impossi

ble; but that, on the contrary, in endeavouring, as was his duty, to save and guard her, he had himself suffered, in a manner which he would for

bear to relate, but which, he greatly apprehended, he should feel the ill effects of for many months; and then, with a countenance exceedingly length

ened, he added, that he hoped it would not be attributed to him as national prejudice, when he owned that he must, to the best of his memory, aver, that his unfortunate fall was owing to a sud

den, but violent push, which, he was shocked to say, some malevolent person, with a design to his injury, must certainly have given him; but whe

ther with a view to mortify him, by making him let the lady fall, or whether merely to spoil his clothes, he could not pretend to determine.
</p>
<p>
This disputation was, at last, concluded by Mrs. Mirvan proposing that we should all go to Cox's Museum. Nobody objected, and carriages were immediately ordered.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:1259700101:112"/>
In our way down stairs, Madame Duval in a very passionate manner, said,
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Ma foi,</hi>
if I would n't give fifty guineas, only to know who gave us that shove!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
This Museum is very astonishing, and very superb; yet, it afforded me but little pleasure, for it is a mere show, though a wonderful one.
</p>
<p>
Sir Clement Willoughby, in our walk round the room, asked me what my opinion was of this brilliant
<hi>spectacle.</hi>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"It is very fine and very ingenious,"</q>
answered I,
<q rend="inline">
"and yet—I don't know how it is,—but I seem to miss something."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Excellently answered!"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"you have exactly defined my own feelings, though in a man

ner I should never have arrived at. But I was certain your taste was too well formed, to be pleased at the expence of your understanding."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Pardie,</hi>
"
</q>
cried Madame Duval,
<q rend="inline">
"I hope you two is difficult enough! I'm sure if you don't like this, you like nothing; for it's the grandest, prettiest, finest sight that ever I see, in England."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"What,"</q>
(cried the Captain, with a sneer)
<q rend="inline">
"I suppose this may be in your French taste? it's like enough, for it's all
<hi>kickshaw</hi>
work. But, pry'thee, friend,"
</q>
(turning to the person who ex

plained the devices)
<q rend="inline">
"will you tell me the
<hi>use</hi>
of all this? for I'm not enough of a conjurer to find it out."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Use, indeed!"</q>
(repeated Madame Duval dis

dainfully)
<q rend="inline">"Lord, if every thing's to be useful!—"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, as to that, Sir,"</q>
said our con

ductor,
<q rend="inline">
"the ingenuity of the mechanism,—the beauty of the workmanship,—the—undoubt

edly, Sir, any person of taste may easily discern the utility of such extraordinary performances."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1259700101:113"/>
<q rend="inline">"Why then, Sir,"</q>
answered the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"your person of taste must be either a coxcomb, or a Frenchman; though, for the matter of that, 'tis the same thing."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Just then, our attention was attracted by a pine

apple, which, suddenly opening, discovered a nest of birds, who immediately began to sing.
<q rend="inline">"Well,"</q>
cried Madame Duval,
<q rend="inline">
"this is prettier than all the rest! I declare, in all my travels, I never see nothing eleganter."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Hark ye, friend,"</q>
said the Captain,
<q rend="inline">"hast never another pine-apple?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Sir?—"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Because, if thou hast, pry'thee give it us without the birds; for, d'ye see, I'm no French

man, and should relish something more substan

tial."
</q>
</p>
<p>
This entertainment concluded with a concert of mechanical music: I cannot explain how it was produced, but the effect was pleasing. Ma

dame Duval was in extacies; and the Captain flung himself into so many ridiculous distortions, by way of mimicking her, that he engaged the attention of all the company; and, in the midst of the performance of the Coronation Anthem, while Madame Duval was affecting to beat time, and uttering many expressions of delight, he called suddenly for salts, which a lady, apprehending some distress, politely handed to him, and which, instantly applying to the nostrils of poor Madame Duval, she involuntarily snuffed up such a quantity, that the pain and surprise made her scream aloud. When she recovered, she reproached him, with her usual vehemence; but he protested he had taken that measure out of pure friendship, as he concluded, from her raptures, that she was going
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:1259700101:114"/>
into hysterics. This excuse by no means appeased her, and they had a violent quarrel; but the only effect her anger had on the Captain, was to encrease his diversion. Indeed, he laughs and talks so terribly loud in public, that he frequently makes us ashamed of belonging to him.
</p>
<p>
Madame Duval, notwithstanding her wrath, made no scruple of returning to dine in Queen-Ann-street. Mrs. Mirvan had secured places for the play at Drury Lane Theatre, and, though ever uneasy in her company, she very politely invited Madame Duval to be of our party; however, she had a bad cold, and chose to nurse it. I was sorry for her indisposition, but I knew not how to be sorry she did not accompany us, for she is—I must not say what, but very unlike other people.
</p>
</div>
<div n="20" type="letter">
<head>LETTER XX.</head>
<head type="sub">Evelina in continuation.</head>
<p>
OUR places were in the front row of a side

box. Sir Clement Willoughby, who knew our intention, was at the door of the Theatre, and handed us from the carriage.
</p>
<p>
We had not been seated five minutes, ere Lord Orville, who we saw in the stage-box, came to us; and he honoured us with his company all the evening. Miss Mirvan and I both rejoiced that Madame Duval was absent, as we hoped for the enjoyment of some conversation, uninterrupted by her quarrels with the Captain: but I soon
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:1259700101:115"/>
found that her presence would have made very little alteration, for so far was I from daring to speak, that I knew not where even to look.
</p>
<p>
The play was Love for Love, and though it is fraught with wit and entertainment, I hope I shall never see it represented again; for it is so ex

tremely indelicate,—to use the softest word I can,—that Miss Mirvan and I were perpetually out of countenance, and could neither make any ob

servations ourselves, nor venture to listen to those of others. This was the more provoking, as Lord Orville was in excellent spirits, and exceedingly entertaining.
</p>
<p>
When the Play was over, I flattered myself I should be able to look about me with less restraint, as we intended to stay the Farce; but the curtain had hardly dropped when the box-door opened, and in came Mr. Lovel, the man by whose fop

pery and impertinence I was so much teazed at the ball where I first saw Lord Orville.
</p>
<p>
I turned away my head, and began talking to Miss Mirvan, for I was desirous to avoid speak

ing to him!—but in vain, for as soon as he had made his compliments to Lord Orville and Sir Clement Willoughby, who returned them very coldly, he bent his head forward, and said to me,
<q rend="inline">
"I hope, Ma'am, you have enjoyed your health since I had the honour—I beg ten thou

sand pardons, but I protest I was going to say the honour of
<hi>dancing</hi>
with you—however, I mean the honour of
<hi>seeing</hi>
you dance?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
He spoke with a self-complacency that con

vinced me he had studied this address, by way of making reprisals for my conduct at the ball: I therefore bowed slightly, but made no answer.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1259700101:116"/>
After a short silence, he again called my atten

tion, by saying, in an easy, negligent way,
<q rend="inline">"I think, Ma'am, you was never in town before?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, Sir."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"So I did presume. Doubtless, Ma'am, every thing must be infinitely novel to you. Our cus

toms, our manners, and
<hi>les etiquettes de nous autres,</hi>
can have very little resemblance to those you have been used to. I imagine, Ma'am, your retirement is at no very small distance from the capital?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I was so much disconcerted at this sneering speech, that I said not a word; though I have since thought my vexation both stimulated and de

lighted him.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"The air we breathe here, however, Ma'am,</q>
(continued he, very conceitedly)
<q rend="inline">
"though foreign to that you have been accustomed to, has not, I hope, been at variance with your health?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Mr. Lovel,"</q>
said Lord Orville,
<q rend="inline">
"could not your
<hi>eye</hi>
have spared that question?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O, my Lord,"</q>
answered he,
<q rend="inline">
"if
<hi>health</hi>
were the only cause of a lady's bloom, my eye, I grant, had been infallible from the first glance; but—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Come, come,"</q>
cried Mrs. Mirvan,
<q rend="inline">
"I must beg no insinuations of that sort; Miss An

ville's colour, as you have successfully tried, may, you see, be heightened;—but I assure you, it would be past your skill to lessen it."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"'Pon honour, Madam,"</q>
returned he,
<q rend="inline">
"you wrong me; I presumed not to infer that
<hi>rouge</hi>
was the only succedaneum for health; but, really, I have known so many different causes for a lady's colour, such as flushing,—anger,—
<hi>mauvaise honte,</hi>
—and so forth, that I never dare decide to which it may be owing."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1259700101:117"/>
<q rend="inline">"As to such causes as them there,"</q>
cried the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"they must belong to those that they keep company with."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Very true, Captain,"</q>
said Sir Clement;
<q rend="inline">
"the natural complexion has nothing to do with occasional sallies of the passions, or any accidental causes."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, truly,"</q>
returned the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"for now here's me, why I look like any other man just now; and yet, if you were to put me in a passion, 'fore George, you'd soon see me have as fine a high colour as any painted Jezebel in all this place, be she never so bedaubed."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"But,"</q>
said Lord Orville,
<q rend="inline">
"the difference of natural and of artificial colour, seems to me very easily discerned; that of Nature, is mottled, and varying; that of art,
<hi>set,</hi>
and
<hi>too</hi>
smooth; it wants that animation, that glow, that
<hi>indescribable something</hi>
which, even now that I see it, wholly surpasses all my powers of expression."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Your Lordship,"</q>
said Sir Clement,
<q rend="inline">
"is universally acknowledged to be a
<hi>connoisseur</hi>
in beauty."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"And you, Sir Clement,"</q>
returned he,
<q rend="inline">
"an
<hi>enthusiast.</hi>
"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I am proud to own it,"</q>
cried Sir Clement;
<q rend="inline">
"in such a cause, and before such objects, en

thusiasm is simply the consequence of not being blind."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Pr'ythee a truce with all this palavering,"</q>
cried the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"the women are vain enough already; no need for to puff 'em up more."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"We must all submit to the commanding offi

cer,"
</q>
said Sir Clement,
<q rend="inline">
"therefore let us call ano

ther subject. Pray, Ladies, how have you been entertained with the play?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1259700101:118"/>
<q rend="inline">"Want of entertainment,"</q>
said Mrs. Mirvan,
<q rend="inline">
"is its least fault; but I own there are objections to it, which I should be glad to see removed."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I could have ventured to answer for the Ladies,"</q>
said Lord Orville,
<q rend="inline">
"since I am sure this is not a play that can be honoured with their approbation."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"What, I suppose it is not sentimental enough!"</q>
cried the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"or else it's too good for them; for I'll maintain it's one of the best come

dies in the language, and has more wit in one scene, than there is in all the new plays put toge

ther."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"For my part,"</q>
said Mr. Lovel,
<q rend="inline">
"I confess I seldom listen to the players: one has so much to do, in looking about, and finding out one's ac

quaintance, that, really, one has no time to mind the stage. Pray,—(most affectedly fixing his eyes upon a diamond-ring on his little finger) pray—what was the play to-night?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why, what the D—l,"</q>
cried the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"do you come to the play, without knowing what it is?
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"O yes, Sir, yes, very frequently; I have no time to read play-bills; one merely comes to meet one's friends; and shew that one's alive."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Ha, ha, ha!—and so,"</q>
cried the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"it costs you five shillings a night, just to shew that you're alive! Well, faith, my friends should all think me dead and under ground, before I'd be at the expence for 'em. Howsomever, this here you may take from me;—they'll find you out fast enough, if you've any thing to give 'em. And so you've been here all this time, and don't know what the play was?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:1259700101:119"/>
<q rend="inline">
"Why, really, Sir, a play requires so much attention,—it is scarcely possible to keep awake, if one listens;—for, indeed, by the time it is even

ing, one has been so fatigued, with dining,—or wine,—or the house,—or studying,—that it is—it is perfectly an impossibility. But, now I think of it, I believe I have a bill in my pocket; O, ay, here it is—Love for Love, ay,—true,—ha, ha,—how could I be so stupid!
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O, easily enough as to that, I warrant you,"</q>
said the Captain;
<q rend="inline">
"but, by my soul, this is one of the best jokes I ever heard! Come to a play, and not know what it is!—Why, I suppose you would n't have found it out, if they had
<hi>fob'd</hi>
you off with a scraping of fidlers, or an opera?—Ha! ha! ha!—why now, I should have thought you might have taken some notice of one Mr.
<hi>Tattle</hi>
that is in this play?
</q>
</p>
<p>
This sarcasm, which caused a general smile, made him colour: but, turning to the Captain with a look of conceit, which implied that he had a retort ready, he said,
<q rend="inline">
"Pray, Sir, give me leave to ask,—what do
<hi>you</hi>
think of
<hi>one Mr. Ben,</hi>
who is also in this play?
</q>
</p>
<p>
The Captain, regarding him with the utmost contempt, answered in a loud voice,
<q rend="inline">
"Think of him!—why I think he's a
<hi>man!</hi>
"
</q>
And then, staring full in his face, he struck his cane on the ground, with a violence that made him start. He did not, however, chuse to take any notice of this; but, having bit his nails some time, in manifest confusion, he turned very quick to me, and, in a sneering tone of voice, said,
<q rend="inline">
"For my part, I was most struck with the
<hi>country</hi>
young lady, Miss Prue; pray what do
<hi>you</hi>
think of her, Ma'am?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1259700101:120"/>
<q rend="inline">"Indeed, Sir,"</q>
cried I, very much provoked,
<q rend="inline">
"I think—that is, I do not think any thing about her."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Well, really, Ma'am, you prodigiously sur

prize me!—
<hi>mais, apparemment ce n'est qu'un façon à parler?</hi>
—though I should beg your pardon, for probably you do not understand French?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I made no answer, for I thought his rudeness intolerable; but Sir Clement, with great warmth, said,
<q rend="inline">
"I am surprised that you can suppose such an object as Miss Prue would engage the attention of Miss Anville even for a moment."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O, Sir,"</q>
returned this fop,
<q rend="inline">
'tis the first character in the piece!—so well drawn,—so much the thing!—such true country-breeding,—such rural ignorance!—ha! ha! ha!—'tis most ad

mirably hit off, 'pon honour!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I could almost have cried, that such imperti

nence should be levelled at me; and yet, chagri

ned as I was, I could never behold Lord Orville and this man at the same time, and feel any regret for the cause I had given of displeasure.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"The only character in the play,"</q>
said Lord Orville,
<q rend="inline">
"worthy of being mentioned to these ladies is Angelica."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Angelica,"</q>
cried Sir Clement,
<q rend="inline">
"is a noble girl; she tries her lover severely, but she rewards him generously."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Yet, in a trial so long,"</q>
said Mrs. Mirvan,
<q rend="inline">
"there seems rather too much consciousness of her power."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Since my opinion has the sanction of Mrs. Mirvan's,"
</q>
added Lord Orville,"
<q rend="inline">
"I will venture to say, that Angelica bestows her hand rather with the air of a benefactress, than with the ten

terness of a mistress. Generosity without delicacy,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1259700101:121"/>
like wit without judgment, generally gives as much pain as pleasure. The uncertainty in which she keeps Valentine, and her manner of trifling with his temper, give no very favourable idea of her own."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Well, my Lord,"</q>
said Mr. Lovel,
<q rend="inline">
"it must, however, be owned, that uncertainty is not the
<hi>ton</hi>
among our ladies at present; nay, indeed, I think they say, though, faith,"
</q>
taking a pinch of snuff,
<q rend="inline">
"I hope it is not true—but they say, that
<hi>we</hi>
now are most shy and backward."
</q>
</p>
<p>
The curtain then drew up, and our conversa

tion ceased. Mr. Lovel finding we chose to attend to the players, lest the box. How strange it is, Sir, that this man, not contented with the large share of foppery and nonsense which he has from nature, should think proper to affect yet more! for what he faid of Tattle and of Miss Prue, con

vinced me that he really had listened to the play, though he was so ridiculous and foolish as to pre

tend ignorance.
</p>
<p>
But how malicicious and impertinent in this creature to talk to me in such a manner! I am sure I hope I shall never see him again. I should have despised him heartily as a fop, had he never spoken to me at at all; but now, that he thinks proper to resent his supposed ill usage, I am really quite afraid of him.
</p>
<p>
The entertainment was, The Deuce is in him, which Lord Orville observed to be the most finish

ed and elegant
<hi>petite piece</hi>
that was ever written in English.
</p>
<p>
In our way home, Mrs. Mirvan put me into some consternation, by saying it was evident, from the resentment which this Mr. Lovel harbours of my conduct, that he would think it a provocation
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1259700101:122"/>
sufficiently important for a duel, if his courage equalled his wrath.
</p>
<p>
I am terrified at the very idea. Good Heaven! that a man so weak and frivolous should be so re

vengeful! However! if bravery would have exci

ted him to affront Lord Orville, how much rea

son have I to rejoice, that cowardice makes him contented with venting his spleen upon me! But we shall leave town soon, and, I hope, see him no more.
</p>
<p>
It was some consolation to me, to hear, from Miss Mirvan, that, while he was speaking to me so cavalierly, Lord Orville regarded him with great indignation.
</p>
<p>
But, really, I think there ought to be a book, of the laws and customs
<hi>a-la-mode,</hi>
presented to all young people, upon their first introduction into public company.
</p>
<p>
To night we go to the opera, where I expect very great pleasure. We shall have the same party as at the play; for Lord Orville said he should be there, and would look for us.
</p>

<p>
I HAVE a volume to write, of the adventures of yesterday.
</p>
<p>
In the afternoon,—at Berry Hill, I should have said the
<hi>evening,</hi>
for it was almost six o'clock,—while Miss Mirvan and I were dressing for the ope

ra, and in high spirits, from the expectation of great entertainment and pleasure, we heard a car

riage
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1259700101:123"/>
stop at the door, and concluded that Sir Clement Willoughby, with his usual assiduity, was come to attend us to the Hay-market; but, in a few moments, what was our surprise, to see our chamber-door flung open, and the two Miss Brangh

tons enter the room! They advanced to me with great familiarity, saying,
<q rend="inline">
"How do you do, cou

sin?—so we've caught you at the glass!—well, I'm determined I'll tell my brother of that!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Miss Mirvan, who had never before seen them, and could not, at first, imagine who they were, looked so much astonished, that I was ready to laugh myself, till the eldest said,
<q rend="inline">
"We're come to take you to the opera, Miss; papa and my brother are below, and we are to call for your grand-mama as we go along."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I am very sorry,"</q>
answered I,
<q rend="inline">
"that you should have taken so much trouble, as I am enga

ged already."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Engaged! Lord, Miss, never mind that,"</q>
cried the youngest,
<q rend="inline">
"this young lady will make your excuses, I dare say; it's only doing as one would be done by, you know."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Indeed, Ma'am,"</q>
said Miss Mirvan,
<q rend="inline">
"I shall myself be very sorry to be deprived of Miss Anville's company this evening."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Well, Miss, that is not so very good-natured in you,"
</q>
said Miss Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"considering we only come to give our cousin pleasure; it's no good to us; it's all upon her account; for we came, I don't know how much round about to take her up."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I am extremely obliged to you,"</q>
said I,
<q rend="inline">
"and very sorry you have lost so much time; but I cannot possibly help it, for I engaged myself with

out knowing you would call."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:1259700101:124"/>
<q rend="inline">"Lord, what signifies that?"</q>
said Miss Polly,
<q rend="inline">
"you're no old maid, and so you need n't be so very formal: besides, I dare say those you are engaged to, a'n't half so near related to you as we are."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I must beg you not to press me any further, for I assure you it is not in my power to attend you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why we came all out of the city on purpose: besides, your grand-mama expects you;—and, pray, what are we to say to her?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Tell her, if you please, that I am much con

cerned,—but that I am pre-engaged."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"And who to?"</q>
demanded the abrupt Miss Branghton.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"To Mrs. Mirvan,—and a large party."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"And, pray, what are you all going to do, that it would be such a mighty matter for you to come along with us?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"We are going to—to the opera."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"O dear, if that be all, why can't we go all together?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I was extremely disconcerted at this forward and ignorant behaviour, and yet their rudeness very much lessened my concern at refusing them. Indeed, their dress was such as would have rendered their scheme of accompanying our party impracticable, even if I had desired it; and this, as they did not them

selves find out, I was obliged, in terms the least mortifying I could think of, to tell them.
</p>
<p>
They were very much chagrined, and asked where I should sit?
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"In the pit,"</q>
answered I.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"In the pit!"</q>
repeated Miss Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"well, really, I must own I should never have supposed that my gown was not good enough for the pit: but come, Polly, let's go; if Miss does not think
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:1259700101:125"/>
us fine enough for her, why to be sure she may chuse."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Surprised at this ignorance, I would have ex

plained to them that the pit at the opera required the same dress as the boxes; but they were so much affronted, they would not hear me, and, in great dis

pleasure, left the room, saying they would not have troubled me, only they thought I should not be so proud with my own relations, and that they had at least as good a right to my company as strangers.
</p>
<p>
I endeavoured to apologize, and would have sent a long message to Madame Duval; but they has

tened away without listening to me; and I could not follow them down stairs, because I was not dressed. The last words I heard them say, were,
<q rend="inline">
"Well, her grand-mama will be in a fine passion, that's one good thing."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Though I was extremely mad at this visit, yet I so heartily rejoiced at their going, that I would not suffer myself to think gravely about it.
</p>
<p>
Soon after, Sir Clement actually came, and we all went down stairs. Mrs. Mirvan ordered tea; and we were engaged in a very lively conversation, when the servant announced Madame Duval, who in

stantly followed him into the room.
</p>
<p>
Her face was the colour of scarlet, and her eyes sparkled with fury. She came up to me with a hasty step, saying,
<q rend="inline">
"So, Miss, you refuses to come to me, do you? And pray who are you, to dare to disobey me?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I was quite frightened;—I made no answer;—I even attempted to rise, and could not, but sat still, mute and motionless.
</p>
<p>
Every body, but Miss Mirvan, seemed in the ut

most astonishment; and the Captain, raising and approaching Madame Duval, with a voice of au

thority,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:1259700101:126"/>
said,
<q rend="inline">
"Why how now, Mrs. Turkey Cock, what's put you into this here fluster?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"It's nothing to you,"</q>
answered she,
<q rend="inline">
"so you may as well hold your tongue, for I sha'n't be called to no account by you, I assure you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"There you're out, Madam Fury,"</q>
returned he,
<q rend="inline">
"for you must know I never suffer any body to be in a passion in my house, but myself."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"But you
<hi>shall,</hi>
"
</q>
cried she, in a great rage,
<q rend="inline">
"for I'll be in as great a passion as ever I please, without asking your leave, so don't give yourself no more airs about it. And as for you, Miss,"
</q>
again advancing to me
<q rend="inline">
"I order you to follow me this moment, or else I'll make you repent it all your life."
</q>
And, with these words, she flung out of the room.
</p>
<p>
I was in such extreme terror at being addressed and threatened in a manner to which I am so wholly unused, that I almost thought I should have fainted.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Don't be alarmed, my love,"</q>
cried Mrs. Mir

van,
<q rend="inline">
"but stay where you are, and I will follow Madame Duval, and try to bring her to reason."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Miss Mirvan took my hand, and most kindly endeavoured to raise my spirits: Sir Clement, too, approached me, with an air so interested in my dis

tress, that I could not but feel myself obliged to him; and, taking my other hand, said,
<q rend="inline">
"For Heaven's sake, my dear Madam, compose your

self; surely the violence of such a wretch ought merely to move your contempt: she can have no right, I imagine, to lay her commands upon you, and I only wish that you would allow
<hi>me</hi>
leave to speak to her."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"O no! not for the world! indeed, I believe,—I am afraid—I had better follow her."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Follow her! Good God, my dear Miss An

ville, would you trust yourself with a mad woman?
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:1259700101:127"/>
for what else can you call a creature whose pas

sions are so insolent? No, no; send her word at once to leave the house, and tell her you desire that she will never see you again."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"O Sir! you don't know who you talk of!—it would ill become me to send Madame Duval such a message."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"But
<hi>why,</hi>
"
</q>
cried he, (looking very inquisitive,)
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>why</hi>
should you scruple to treat her as she de

serves?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I then found that his aim was to discover the nature of her connection with me; but I felt so much ashamed of my near relationship to her, that I could not persuade myself to answer him, and only entreated that he would leave her to Mrs. Mirvan, who just then entered.
</p>
<p>
Before she could speak to me, the Captain called out,
<q rend="inline">
"Well, Goody, what have you done with Madame French? is she cooled a little? 'cause, if she be n't, I've just thought of a most excellent device to bring her to."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My dear Evelina,"</q>
said Mrs. Mirvan,
<q rend="inline">
"I have been vainly endeavouring to appease her; I pleaded your engagement, and promised your fu

ture attendance: but I am sorry to say, my love, that I fear her rage will end in a total breach (which I think you had better avoid) if she is any further opposed."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Then I will go to her, Madam,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">
"and, indeed, it is now no matter, for I should not be able to recover my spirits sufficiently to enjoy much pleasure
<hi>any</hi>
where this evening."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Sir Clement began a very warm expostulation, and entreaty, that I would not go; but I begged him to desist, and told him, very honestly, that, if my compliance were not indispensably necessary,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:1259700101:128"/>
I should require no persuasion to stay. He then took my hand, to lead me down stairs; but the Captain desired him to be quiet, saying he would 'squire me himself,
<q rend="inline">"because,"</q>
he added exult

ingly rubbing his hands,)
<q rend="inline">
"I have a wipe ready for the old lady, which may serve her to
<hi>chew</hi>
as she goes along."
</q>
</p>
<p>
We found her in the parlour.
<q rend="inline">
"O, you're come at last, Miss, are you?—fine airs you give yourself, indeed!—
<hi>ma foi,</hi>
if you had n't come, you might have stayed, I assure you, and have been a beggar for your pains."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Heyday, Madam,"</q>
cried the Captain, pranc

ing forward, with a look of great glee,)
<q rend="inline">
"what, a'n't you got out of that there passion yet? why then, I'll tell you what to do to cool yourself; call upon your old friend, Monsieur Slippery, who was with you at Ranelagh, and give my service to him, and tell him, if he sets any store by your health, that I desire he'll give you such another souse as he did before: he'll know what I mean, and I'll war

rant you he'll do't for my sake."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Let him, if he dares!"</q>
cried Madame Duval;
<q rend="inline">
"but I sha'n't stay to answer you no more; you are a vulgar fellow,—and so, child, let us leave him to himself."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Hark ye, Madam,"</q>
cried the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"you'd best not call names, because, d'ye see, if you do, I shall make bold to show you the door."
</q>
</p>
<p>
She changed colour, and, saying,
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Pardie,</hi>
I can shew it myself,"
</q>
hurried out of the room, and I followed her into a hackney-coach. But, be

fore we drove off, the Captain, looking out of the parlour window, called out,
<q rend="inline">
"D'ye hear, Madam,—don't forget my message to Monsieur."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:1259700101:129"/>
You will believe, our ride was not the most agreeable in the world; indeed, it would be dif

ficult to say which was least pleased, Madame Du

val or me, though the reasons of our discontent were so different: however, Madame Duval soon got the start of me; for we had hardly turned out of Queen-Anne-street, when a man, running full speed, stopt the coach. He came up to the win

dow, and I saw he was the Captain's servant. He had a broad grin on his face, and panted for breath. Madame Duval demanded his business;
<q rend="inline">
"Ma

dam,"
</q>
answered he,
<q rend="inline">
"my master desires his com

pliments to you, and—and—and he says he wishes it well over with you. He! he! he!—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Madame Duval instantly darted forward, and gave him a violent blow on the face;
<q rend="inline">"Take that back for your answer, sirrah,"</q>
cried she,
<q rend="inline">
"and learn to grin at your betters another time. Coach

man, drive on!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
The servant was in a violent passion, and swore terribly; but we were soon out of hearing.
</p>
<p>
The rage of Madame Duval was greater than ever, and she inveighed against the Captain with such fury, that I was even apprehensive she would have returned to his house, purposely to reproach him, which she repeatedly threatened to do; nor would she, I believe, have hesitated a moment, but that, notwithstanding her violence, he has really made her afraid of him.
</p>
<p>
When we came to her lodgings, we found all the Branghtons in the passage, impatiently waiting for us, with the door open.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Only see, here's Miss!"</q>
cried the brother.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Well, I declare I thought as much!"</q>
said the younger sister.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:1259700101:130"/>
<q rend="inline">"Why, Miss,"</q>
said Mr. Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"I think you might as well have come with your cousins at once; it's throwing money in the dirt, to pay two coaches for one fare."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Lord, father,"</q>
cried the son,
<q rend="inline">
"make no words about that; for I'll pay for the coach that Miss had."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O, I know very well,"</q>
answered Mr. Brangh

ton,
<q rend="inline">
"that you're always more ready to spend than to earn."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I then interfered, and begged that I might my

self be allowed to pay the fare, as the expence was incurred upon my account; they all said
<hi>no,</hi>
and proposed that the same coach should carry us on to the opera.
</p>
<p>
While this passed, the Miss Branghtons were examining my dress, which, indeed, was very improper for my company; and, as I was ex

tremely unwilling to be so conspicuous amongst them, I requested Madame Duval to borrow a hat or bonnet for me of the people of the house. But she never wears either herself, and thinks them very
<hi>English</hi>
and barbarous; therefore she insisted that I should go full dressed, as I had pre

pared myself for the pit, though I made many objections.
</p>
<p>
We were then all crowded into the same carri

age; but when we arrived at the opera-house, I contrived to pay the coachman. They made a great many speeches; but Mr. Branghton's reflec

tion had determined me not to be indebted to him.
</p>
<p>
If I had not been too much chagrined to laugh, I should have been extremely diverted at their ig

norance of whatever belongs to an opera. In the first place, they could not tell at what door we
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:1259700101:131"/>
ought to enter, and we wandered about for some time, without knowing which way to turn: they did not chuse to apply to me, though I was the only person of the party who had ever before been at an opera; because they were unwilling to suppose that their
<hi>country cousin,</hi>
as they were pleas

ed to call me, should be better acquainted with any London public place than themselves. I was very indifferent and careless upon this subject, but not a little uneasy at finding my dress, so different from that of the company to which I belonged, attracted general notice and observation.
</p>
<p>
In a short time however we arrived at one of the door-keeper's
<hi>bars.</hi>
Mr. Branghton demand

ed for what part of the house they took money? They answered the pit, and regarded us all with great earnestness. The son then advancing, said,
<q rend="inline">"Sir, if you please, I beg that I may treat Miss."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"We'll settle that another time,"</q>
answered Mr. Branghton, and put down a guinea.
</p>
<p>Two tickets of admission were given to him.</p>
<p>
Mr. Branghton, in his turn, now stared at the door-keeper, and demanded what he meant by giving him only two tickets for a guinea?
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Only two, Sir!"</q>
said the man,
<q rend="inline">
"why don't you know that the tickets are half a guinea each?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Half a guinea each!"</q>
repeated Mr. Brangh

ton,
<q rend="inline">
"why I never heard of such a thing in my life! And pray, Sir, how many will they admit?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Just as usual, Sir, one person each."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"But one person for half a guinea!—why I only want to sit in the pit, friend."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Had not the Ladies better sit in the gallery, Sir; for they'll hardly chuse to go into the pit with their hats on?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:1259700101:132"/>
<q rend="inline">"O, as to that,"</q>
cried Miss Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"if our hats are too high, we'll take them off when we get in. I sha'n't mind it, for I did my hair on purpose."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Another party then approaching, the door-keeper coul no longer attend to Mr. Branghton, who, tak

ing up the guinea, told him it should be long enough before he'd see it again, and walked away.
</p>
<p>
The young ladies, in some confusion, expressed their surprise, that their
<hi>papa</hi>
should not know the opera prices, which for their parts they had read in the papers a thousand times.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"The price of stocks"</q>
said he,
<q rend="inline">
"is enough for me to see after; and I took it for granted it was the same thing here as at the play-house."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I knew well enough what the price was,"</q>
said the son,
<q rend="inline">
"but I would not speak, because I thought perhaps they'd take less, as we're such a large party."
</q>
</p>
<p>
The sisters both laughed very contemptuously at this idea, and asked him if he ever heard of
<hi>people's abating</hi>
any thing at a public place?
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I don't know whether I have or no,"</q>
an

swered he,
<q rend="inline">
"but I'm sure if they would, you'd like it so much the worse."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Very true, Tom,</q>
cried Mr. Branghton;
<q rend="inline">
"tell a woman that any thing is reasonable, and she'll be sure to hate it."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Well,"</q>
said Miss Polly,
<q rend="inline">
"I hope that Aunt and Miss will be of our side, for Papa always takes part with Tom."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Come, come,"</q>
cried Madam Duval,
<q rend="inline">
"if you stand talking here, we sha'n't get no place at all."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Branghton then enquired the way to the gal

lery, and, when we came to the door-keeper, de

manded what was to pay.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:1259700101:133"/>
<q rend="inline">"The usual price, Sir,"</q>
said the man.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Then give me change,"</q>
cried Mr. Branghton, again putting down his guinea.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"For how many, Sir?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why—let's see,—for six."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"For six, Sir? why you've given me but a guinea."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>But</hi>
a guinea! why how much would you have? I suppose it i'n't half a guinea apiece here too?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, Sir, only five shillings."</q>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Branghton again took up his unfortunate guinea, and protested he would submit to no such imposition. I then proposed that we should return home, but Madame Duval would not consent, and we were conducted, by a woman who sells books of the Opera, to another gallery-door, where, after some disputing, Mr. Branghton at last paid, and we all went up stairs.
</p>
<p>
Madame Duval complained very much of the trouble of going so high, but Mr. Branghton de

sired her not to hold the place too cheap,
<q rend="inline">"for, whatever you may think,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"I assure you I paid pit price; so don't suppose I come here to save my money."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Well, to be sure,"</q>
said Miss Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"there's no judging of a place by the outside, else, I must needs say, there's nothing very extraordi

nary in the stair-case."
</q>
</p>
<p>
But, when we entered the gallery, their amaze

ment and disappointment became general. For a few instants, they looked at one another without speaking, and then they all broke silence at once.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Lord, Papa,</q>
exclaimed Miss Polly,
<q rend="inline">
"why you have brought us to the one-shilling gallery!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:1259700101:134"/>
<q rend="inline">"I'll be glad to give you two shillings, though,"</q>
answered he,
<q rend="inline">
"to pay. I was never so fooled out of my money before, since the hour of my birth. Either the door-keeper's a knave, or this is the greatest imposition that ever was put upon the public."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Ma foi,</hi>
"
</q>
cried Madame Duval,
<q rend="inline">
"I never sat in such a mean place in all my life;—why it's as high!—we sha'n't see nothing."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I thought, at the time,"</q>
said Mr. Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"that three shillings was an exorbitant price for a place in the gallery, but as we'd been asked so much more at the other doors, why I paid it with

out many words; but then, to be sure, thinks I, it never can be like any other gallery,—we shall see some
<hi>crinkum-crankum</hi>
or other for our money;—but I find it's as arrant a take-in as ever I met with."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why it's as like the twelvepenny gallery at Drury-lane,"
</q>
cried the son,
<q rend="inline">
"as two peas are one to another. I never knew father so bit before."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Lord,</q>
"said Miss Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"I thought it would have been quite a fine place,—all over I don't know what,—and done quite in taste."
</q>
</p>
<p>
In this manner they continued to express their dissatisfaction till the curtain drew up; after which, their observations were very curious. They made no allowance for the customs, or even for the lan

guage of another country, but formed all their re

marks upon comparisons with the English theatre.
</p>
<p>
Notwithstanding all my vexation at having been forced into a party so very disagreeabl, and that, too, from one so much
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
<desc>•…</desc>
</gap>
so very much the con

trary—yet, would they have suffered me to listen, I should have forgotten every thing unpleasant, and selt nothing but delight, in hearing the sweet voice
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:1259700101:135"/>
of Signor Millico, the first singer; but they tor

mented me with continual talking."
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"What a jabbering they make!"</q>
cried Mr. Branghton;
<q rend="inline">
"there's no knowing a word they say. Pray what's the reason they can't as well sing in English?—but I suppose the fine folks would not like it, if they could understand it."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"How unnatural their action is!"</q>
said the son;
<q rend="inline">
"why now who ever saw an Englishman put him

self in such out-of-the-way postures?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"For my part,"</q>
said Miss Polly,
<q rend="inline">
"I think it's very pretty, only I don't know what it means."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Lord, what does that signify?"</q>
cried her sister;
<q rend="inline">
"mayn't one like a thing without being so very particular?—You may see that Miss likes it, and I don't suppose she knows more of the matter than we do."
</q>
</p>
<p>
A gentleman, soon after, was so obliging as to make room in the front row for Miss Branghton and me. We had no sooner seated ourselves, than Miss Branghton exclaimed,
<q rend="inline">
"Good gracious! only see!—why, Polly, all the people in the pit are without hats, dressed like any thing!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Lord, so they are,</q>
cried Miss Polly,
<q rend="inline">
"well, I never saw the like!—it's worth coming to the Opera if one saw nothing else."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I was then able to distinguish the happy party I had left; and I saw that Lord Orville had seated himself next to Mrs. Mirvan. Sir Clement had his eyes perpetually cast towards the five shilling gallery, where I suppose he concluded that we were seated; however, before the Opera was over, I have reason to believe that he had discovered me, high and distant as I was from him. Pro

bably he distinguished me by my head-dress.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:1259700101:136"/>
At the end of the first act, as the green curtain dropped, to prepare for the dance, they imagined that the Opera was done, and Mr. Branghton ex

pressed great indignation that he had been
<hi>tricked</hi>
out of his money with so little trouble.
<q rend="inline">
"Now if any Englishman was to do such an impudent thing as this,"
</q>
said he,
<q rend="inline">
"why he'd be pelted;—but here, one of these outlandish gentry may do just what he pleases, and come on, and squeak out a song or two, and then pocket your money with

out further ceremony."
</q>
</p>
<p>
However, so determined he was to be dissatis

fied, that, before the conclusion of the third act, he found still more fault with the Opera for being too long, and wondered whether they thought their singing good enough to serve us for supper.
</p>
<p>
During the symphony of a song of Signor Mil

lico's, in the second act, young Mr. Branghton said,
<q rend="inline">
"It's my belief that that fellow's going to sing another song!—why there's nothing but sing

ing!—I wonder when they'll speak."
</q>
</p>
<p>
This song, which was slow and pathetic, caught all my attention, and I leaned my head forward to avoid hearing their observations, that I might listen without interruption; but, upon turning round, when the song was over, I found that I was the object of general diversion to the whole party; for the Miss Branghtons were tittering, and the two gentlemen making signs and faces at me, implying their contempt of my affectation.
</p>
<p>
This discovery determined me to appear as in

attentive as themselves; but I was very much pro

voked at being thus prevented enjoying the only pleasure, which, in such a party, was within my power.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:1259700101:137"/>
<q rend="inline">"So, Miss,"</q>
said Mr. Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"you're quite in the fashion, I see;—so you like Operas? well, I'm not so polite; I can't like nonsense, let it be never so much the taste."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"But pray, Miss,</q>
said the son,
<q rend="inline">
"what makes that fellow look so doleful while he's singing?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Probably because the character he performs is in distress."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why then I think he might as well let alone singing till he's in better cue: it's out of all nature for a man to be piping when he's in distress. For my part, I never sing but when I'm merry; yet I love a song as well as most people."
</q>
</p>
<p>When the curtain dropt, they all rejoiced.</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"How do
<hi>you</hi>
like it?—and how do
<hi>you</hi>
like it?"
</q>
passed from one to another with looks of the utmost contempt.
<q rend="inline">"As for me,"</q>
said Mr. Brangh

ton,
<q rend="inline">
"they've caught me once, but if ever they do again, I'll give 'em leave to sing me to Bedlam for my pains: for such a heap of stuff never did I hear; there is n't one ounce of sense in the whole Opera, nothing but one continued squeaking and squalling from beginning to end."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"If I had been in the pit,"</q>
said Madame Du

val,
<q rend="inline">
"I should have liked it vastly, for music is my passion; but sitting in such a place as this, is quite unbearable."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Miss Branghton, looking at me, declared, that she was not
<hi>genteel</hi>
enough to admire it.
</p>
<p>
Miss Polly confessed, that, if they would but sing
<hi>English,</hi>
she should like it
<hi>very well.</hi>
</p>
<p>
The brother wished he could raise a riot in the house, because then he might get his money again.
</p>
<p>
And, finally, they all agreed, that it was
<hi>
mon

strous dear.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:1259700101:138"/>
During the last dance, I perceived, standing near the gallery-door, Sir Clement Willoughby. I was extremely vexed, and would have given the world to have avoided being seen by him: my chief objection was, from the apprehension that he wou'd hear Miss Branghton call me
<hi>cousin.</hi>
—I fear you will think this London journey has made me grow very proud, but indeed this family is so low-bred and vulgar, that I should be equally ashamed of such a connexion in the country, or any where. And really I had already been so much chagrined that Sir Clement had been a witness of Madame Duval's power over me, that I could not bear to be exposed to any further mortification.
</p>
<p>
As the seats cleared, by parties going away, Sir Clement approached nearer to us; the Miss Branghtons observed with surprise, what a fine gentleman was come into the gallery, and they gave me great reason to expect, that they would endeavour to attract his notice, by familiarity with me, whenever he should join us; and so, I formed a sort of plan, to prevent any conversation. I am afraid you will think it wrong; and so I do myself, now,—but, at the time, I only considered how I might avoid immediate humiliation.
</p>
<p>
As soon as he was within two seats of us, he spoke to me,
<q rend="inline">
"I am very happy, Miss Anville, to have sound you, for the Ladies below have each an humble attendant, and therefore I am come to offer my services here."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why then,"</q>
cried I, (not without hesitating)
<q rend="inline">"if you please,—I will join them."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Will you allow me the honour of conducting you?"</q>
cried he eagerly; and, instantly taking my hand, he would have marched away with me: but I turned to Madame Duval, and said,
<q rend="inline">
"As our
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:1259700101:139"/>
party is so large, Madam, if you will give me leave, I will go down to Mrs. Mirvan, that I may not crowd you in the coach."
</q>
</p>
<p>
And then, without waiting for an answer, I suffered Sir Clement to hand me out of the gal

lery.
</p>
<p>
Madame Duval, I doubt not, will be very an

gry, and so I am with myself, now, and therefore I cannot be surprised: but Mr. Branghton, I am sure, will easily comfort himself, in having escaped the additional coach expence of carrying me to Queen-Ann-street; as to his daughters, they had no time to speak, but I saw they were in utter amazement.
</p>
<p>
My intention was to join Mrs. Mirvan, and accompany her home. Sir Clement was in high spirits and good humour; and, all the way we went, I was fool enough to rejoice in secret at the success of my plan; nor was it till I got down stairs, and amidst the servants, that any difficulty occurred to me of meeting with my friends.
</p>
<p>
I then asked Sir Clement how I should contrive to acquaint Mrs. Mirvan that I had left Madame Duval?
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I fear it will be almost impossible to find her,</q>
answered he;
<q rend="inline">
"but you can have no objec

tion to permitting me to see you safe home."
</q>
</p>
<p>
He then desired his servant, who was waiting, to order his chariot to draw up.
</p>
<p>
This quite startled me; I turned to him hastily, and said that I could not think of going away without Mrs. Mirvan.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"But how can we meet with her?"</q>
cried he;
<q rend="inline">
"you will not chuse to go into the pit yourself; I cannot send a servant there; and it is impossible for
<hi>me</hi>
to go and leave you alone?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:1259700101:140"/>
The truth of this was indisputable, and totally silenced me. Yet, as soon as I could recollect my

self, I determined not to go in his chariot, and told him I believed I had best return to my party up stairs.
</p>
<p>
He would not hear of this; and earnestly en

treated me not to withdraw the trust I had repo

sed in him.
</p>
<p>
While he was speaking, I saw Lord Orville, with several ladies and gentlemen, coming from the pit passage: unfortunately, he saw me too, and, leaving his company, advanced instantly to

wards me, and, with an air and voice of surprise, said,
<q rend="inline">"Good God, do I see Miss Anville!"</q>
</p>
<p>
I now most severely felt the folly of my plan, and the aukwardness of my situation; however, I hastened to tell him, though in a hesitating manner, that I was waiting for Mrs. Mirvan! but what was my disappointment, when he acquainted me that she was already gone home!
</p>
<p>
I was inexpressibly distressed; to suffer Lord Orville to think me satisfied with the single pro

tection of Sir Clement Willoughby, I could not bear; yet I was more than ever averse to return

ing to a party which I dreaded his seeing: I stood some moments in suspense, and could not help ex

claiming,
<q rend="inline">"Good Heaven, what can I do!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why, my dear Madam,"</q>
cried Sir Clement,
<q rend="inline">
"should you be thus uneasy?—you will reach Queen-Ann street almost as soon as Mrs. Mirvan, and I am sure you cannot doubt being as safe."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I made no answer, and Lord Orville then said,
<q rend="inline">
"My coach is here; and my servants are ready to take any commands Miss Anville will honour me with for them. I shall myself go home in a chair, and therefore—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:1259700101:141"/>
How grateful did I feel for a proposal so conside

rate, and made with so much delicacy! I should gladly have accepted it, had I been permitted, but Sir Clement would not let him even finish his speech; he interrupted him with evident displea

sure, and said,
<q rend="inline">"My Lord, my own chariot is now at the door."</q>
</p>
<p>
And just then the servant came, and told him the carriage was ready. He begged to have the honour of conducting me to it, and would have taken my hand, but I drew it back, saying,
<q rend="inline">
"I can't—I can't indeed! pray go by yourself—and as to me, let me have a chair."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Impossible!"</q>
(cried he with vehemence)
<q rend="inline">
"I cannot think of trusting you with strange chairmen,—I cannot answer it to Mrs. Mirvan,—come, dear Madam, we shall be home in five minutes."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Again I stood suspended. With what joy would I then have compromised with my pride, to have been once more with Madame Duval and the Branghtons, provided I had not met with Lord Orville! However, I flatter myself that he not only saw, but pitied my embarrassment, for he said, in a tone of voice unusually softened,
<q rend="inline">
"To offer my services in the presence of Sir Clement Willoughby would be superfluous; but I hope I need not assure Miss Anville, how happy it would make me to be of the least use to her."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I courtsied my thanks. Sir Clement with great eagerness pressed me to go; and while I was thus uneasily deliberating what to do, the dance, I sup

pose, finished, for the people crowded down stairs. Had Lord Orville then repeated his offer, I should have accepted it, notwithstanding Sir Clement's re

pugnance; but I fancy he thought it would be im

pertinent. In a very few minutes I heard Madame
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:1259700101:142"/>
Duval's voice, as she descended from the gallery;
<q rend="inline">"Well,"</q>
cried I, hastily,
<q rend="inline">"if I must go—".</q>
I stopt, but Sir Clement immediately handed me into his chariot, called out
<q rend="inline">"Queen-Ann-street,"</q>
and then jumped in himself. Lord Orville, with a bow and a half smile, wished me good night.
</p>
<p>
My concern was so great, at being seen and left by Lord Orville in so strange a situation, that I should have been best pleased to have remained wholly silent during our ride home: but Sir Cle

ment took care to prevent that.
</p>
<p>
He began by making many complaints of my unwillingness to trust myself with him, and begged to know what could be the reason. This question so much embarrassed me, that I could not tell what to answer, but only said, that I was sorry to have taken up so much of his time.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O Miss Anville,"</q>
(cried he, taking my hand)
<q rend="inline">
"if you knew with what transport I would dedicate to you not only the present but all the future time allotted to me, you would not injure me by making such an apology."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I could not think of a word to say to this, nor to a great many other equally fine speeches with which he ran on, though I would fain have with

drawn my hand, and made almost continual at

tempts; but in vain, for he actually grasped it be

tween both his, without any regard to my resist

ance.
</p>
<p>
Soon after, he said that he believed the coach

man was going the wrong way, and he called to his servant, and gave him directions. Then ad

dressing himself to me,
<q rend="inline">
"How often, how assidu

ously have I sought an opportunity of speaking to you, without the presence of that brute Captain Mirvan! Fortune has now kindly favoured me
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:1259700101:143"/>
with one, and permit me,"
</q>
(again seizing my hand)
<q rend="inline">
"permit me to use it, in telling you that I adore you!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I was quite thunderstruck at this abrupt and un

expected declaration. For some moments I was silent, but, when I recovered from my surprise, I said,
<q rend="inline">
"Indeed, Sir, if you were determined to make me repent leaving my own party so foolishly, you have very well succeeded."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My dearest life,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"is it possible you can be so cruel? Can your nature and your countenance be so totally opposite? Can the sweet bloom upon those charming cheeks, which appears as much the result of good-humour as of beau

ty—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O, Sir,</q>
cried I, interrupting him,
<q rend="inline">
"this is very fine; but I had hoped we had had enough of this sort of conversation at the Ridotto, and I did not expect you would so soon resume it."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"What I then said, my sweet reproacher, was the effect of a mistaken, a prophane idea, that your understanding held no competition with your beauty; but now, now that I find you equally in

comparable in both, all words, all powers of speech, are too feeble to express the admiration I feel of your excellencies."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Indeed,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">
"if you did not talk in one language, and think in another, you would never suppose that I could give credit to praise so very much above my desert."
</q>
</p>
<p>
This speech, which I made very gravely, occa

sioned still stronger protestations, which he conti

nued to pour forth, and I continued to disclaim, till I began to wonder that we were not in Queen-Ann-Street, and begged he would desire the coach

man to drive faster.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:1259700101:144"/>
<q rend="inline">"And does this little moment,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"which is the first of happiness I have ever known, does it already appear so very long to you?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I am afraid the man has mistaken the way,"</q>
answered I,
<q rend="inline">
"or else we should ere now have been at our journey's end. I must beg you will speak to him."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"And can you think me so much my own ene

my?—if my good genius has inspired the man with a desire of prolonging my happiness, can you expect that I should counteract its indul

gence?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I now began to apprehend that he had himself ordered the man to go a wrong way, and I was so much alarmed at the idea, that, the very instant it occurred to me, I let down the glass, and made a sudden effort to open the chariot-door myself, with a view of jumping into the street; but he caught hold of me, exclaiming,
<q rend="inline">"For Heaven's sake, what is the matter?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I—I don't know,"</q>
cried I, (quite out of breath)
<q rend="inline">
"but I am sure the man goes wrong, and, if you will not speak to him, I am determined I will get out myself."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You amaze me,"</q>
answered he, (still holding me)
<q rend="inline">
"I cannot imagine what you apprehend. Surely you can have no doubts of my honour?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
He drew me towards him as he spoke. I was dreadfully frightened, and could hardly say,
<q rend="inline">
"No, Sir, no,—none at all,—only Mrs. Mirvan,—I think she will be uneasy."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Whence this alarm, my dearest angel?—What can you fear?—my life is at your devo

tion, and can you, then, doubt my protection?"
</q>
</p>
<p>And so saying, he passionately kissed my hand.</p>
<p>
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:1259700101:145"/>
Never, in my whole life, have I been so terri

fied. I broke forcibly from him, and, putting my head out of the window, called aloud to the man to stop. Where we then were I knew not, but I saw not a human being, or I should have called for help.
</p>
<p>
Sir Clement, with great earnestness, endeavour

ed to appease and compose me;
<q rend="inline">"If you do not intend to murder me,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">"for mercy's, for pity's sake, let me get out!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Compose your spirits, my dearest life,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">"and I will do every thing you would have me."</q>
And then he called to the man himself, and bid him make haste to Queen-Ann-Street.
<q rend="inline">"This stupid fellow,"</q>
continued he,
<q rend="inline">
"has certainly mis

taken my orders; but I hope you are now fully satisfied."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I made no answer, but kept my head at the window, watching which way he drove, but with

out any comfort to myself, as I was quite unac

quainted with either the right or the wrong.
</p>
<p>
Sir Clement now poured forth abundant protest

ations of honour, and assurances of respect, en

treating my pardon for having offended me, and beseeching my good opinion: but I was quite silent, having too much apprehension to make re

proaches, and too much anger to speak without.
</p>
<p>
In this manner we went through several streets, till at last, to my great terror, he suddenly ordered the man to stop, and said,
<q rend="inline">
"Miss Anville, we are now within twenty yards of your house; but I cannot bear to part with you, till you generously forgive me for the offence you have taken, and pro

mise not to make it known to the Mirvans."
</q>
</p>
<p>I hesitated between fear and indignation.</p>
<p>
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:1259700101:146"/>
<q rend="inline">
"Your reluctance to speak, redoubles my con

trition for having displeased you, since it shews the reliance I might have on a promise which you will not give without consideration."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I am very, very much distressed,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">
"you ask a promise which you must be sensible I ought not to grant, and yet dare not refuse."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Drive on!"</q>
cried he to the coachman;—
<q rend="inline">
"Miss Anville, I will not compel you; I will ex

act no promise, but trust wholly to your genero

sity."
</q>
</p>
<p>
This rather softened me; which advantage he no sooner perceived, than he determined to avail himself of, for he flung himself on his knees, and pleaded with so much submission, that I was really obliged to forgive him, because his humili

ation made me quite ashamed: and, after that, he would not let me rest till I gave him my word that I would not complain of him to Mrs. Mir

van.
</p>
<p>
My own folly and pride, which had put me in his power, were pleas which I could not but at

tend to in his favour. However, I shall take very particular care never to be again alone with him.
</p>
<p>
When, at last, we arrived at our house, I was so overjoyed, that I should certainly have pardoned him then, if I had not before. As he handed me up stairs, he scolded his servant aloud, and very angrily, for having gone so much out of the way. Miss Mirvan ran out to meet me,—and who should I see behind her, but—Lord Orville!
</p>
<p>
All my joy now vanished, and gave place to shame and confusion; for I could not endure that he should know how long a time Sir Clement and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:1259700101:147"/>
I had been together, since I was not at liberty to assign any reason for it.
</p>
<p>
They all expressed great satisfaction at seeing me, and said they had been extremely uneasy and surprised that I was so long coming home, as they had heard from Lord Orville that I was not with Madame Duval. Sir Clement, in an affected passion, said that his booby of a servant had misunderstood his orders, and was driving us to the upper end of Piccadilly. For my part, I only coloured, for though I would not forfeit my word, I yet dis

dained to confirm a tale in which I had myself no belief.
</p>
<p>
Lord Orville, with great politeness, congratu

lated me that the troubles of the evening had so happily ended, and said, that he had found it im

possible to return home, before he enquired after my safety.
</p>
<p>
In a very short time he took leave, and Sir Cle

ment followed him. As soon as they were gone, Mrs. Mirvan, though with great softness, blamed me for having quitted Madame Duval. I assured her, and with truth, that for the future I would be more prudent.
</p>
<p>
The adventures of the evening so much discon

certed me, that I could not sleep all night. I am under the most cruel apprehensions, left Lord Or

ville should suppose my being on the gallery-stairs with Sir Clement was a concerted scheme, and even that our continuing so long together in his chariot, was with my approbation, since I did not say a word on the subject, nor express any dissatis

faction at the coachman's pretended blunder.
</p>
<p>
Yet, his coming hither to wait our arrival, though it seems to imply some doubt, shews also some anxiety. Indeed Miss Mirvan says, that he
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:1259700101:148"/>
appeared
<hi>extremely</hi>
anxious, nay uneasy and impa

tient for my return. If I did not fear to flatter myself, I should think it not impossible but that he had a suspicion of Sir Clement's design, and was therefore concerned for my safety.
</p>
<p>
What a long letter is this! however, I shall not write many more from London, for the Cap

tain said this morning, that he would leave town on Tuesday next. Madame Duval will dine here to-day, and then she is to be told his intention.
</p>
<p>
I am very much amazed that she accepted Mrs. Mirvan's invitation, as she was in such wrath yes

terday. I fear that to-day I shall myself be the principal object of her displeasure; but I must submit patiently, for I cannot defend myself.
</p>
<p>
Adieu, my dearest Sir. Should this letter be productive of any uneasiness to you, more than ever shall I repent the heedless imprudence which it recites.

<head>LETTER XXII.</head>
<head type="sub">Evelina in continuation.</head>
<div type="section">

<dateline>
<date>Monday Morning, April 18.</date>
</dateline>
</opener>
<p>
MRS. Mirvan has just communicated to me an anecdote concerning Lord Orville, which has much surprised, half pleased, and half pained me.
</p>
<p>
While they were sitting together during the Opera, he told her that he had been greatly con

cerned at the impertinence which the young lady under her protection had suffered from Mr. Lovel; but that he had the pleasure of assuring her, she had no future disturbance to apprehend from him.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:1259700101:149"/>
Mrs. Mirvan, with great eagerness, begged he would explain himself, and said she hoped he had not thought so insignificant an affair worthy his se

rious attention.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"There is nothing,"</q>
answered he,
<q rend="inline">
"which re

quires more immediate notice than impertinence, for it ever encroaches when it is tolerated."
</q>
He then added, that he believed he ought to apologize for the liberty he had taken of interfering, but that, as he regarded himself in the light of a
<hi>party concerned,</hi>
from having had the honour of dancing with Miss Anville, he could not possibly reconcile to himself a patient neutrality.
</p>
<p>
He then proceeded to tell her, that he had waited upon Mr. Lovel the morning after the play; that the visit had proved an amicable one, but the particulars were neither entertaining nor necessary; he only assured her, Miss Anville might be perfectly easy, since Mr. Lovel had en

gaged his honour never more to mention, or even to hint at what had passed at Mrs. Stanley's as

sembly.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Mirvan expressed her satisfaction at this conclusion, and thanked him for his polite atten

tion to her young friend.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"It would be needless,"</q>
said he,
<q rend="inline">
"to request that this affair may never transpire, since Mrs. Mir

van cannot but see the necessity of keeping it in

violably secret; but I thought it incumbent upon me, as the young lady is under your protection, to assure both you and her of Mr. Lovel's future respect."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Had I known of this visit previous to Lord Or

ville's making it, what dreadful uneasiness would it have cost me! Yet that he should so much in

terest himself in securing me from offence, gives
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:1259700101:150"/>
me, I must own, an internal pleasure greater than I can express, for I feared he had too contemp

tuous an opinion of me, to take any trouble upon my account. Though, after all, this interference might rather be to satisfy his own delicacy, than from thinking well of me.
</p>
<p>
But how cool, how quiet is true courage! Who, from seeing Lord Orville at the play, would have imagined his resentment would have hazarded his life? yet his displeasure was evident, though his real bravery and his politeness equally guarded him from entering into any discussion in our presence.
</p>
<p>
Madame Duval, as I expected, was most ter

ribly angry yesterday; she scolded me for I believe two hours, on account of having left her, and pro

tested she had been so much surprised at my going, without giving her time to answer, that she hardly knew whether she was awake or asleep. But she assured me, that if ever I did so again, she would never more take me into public. And she expressed an equal degree of displeasure against Sir Clement, because he had not even spoken to her, and because he was always of the Captain's side in an argument. The Captain, as bound in honour, warmly de

fended him, and then followed a dispute in the usual style.
</p>
<p>
After dinner, Mrs. Mirvan introduced the sub

ject of our leaving London. Madame Duval said she should stay a month or two longer. The Cap

tain told her she was welcome, but that he and his family should go into the country on Tuesday morning.
</p>
<p>
A most disagreeable scene followed; Madame Duval insisted upon keeping me with her; but Mrs. Mirvan said, that as I was actually engaged on a visit to Lady Howard, who had only consented to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:1259700101:151"/>
my leaving her for a few days, she could not think of returning without me.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps if the Captain had not interfered, the good-breeding and mildness of Mrs. Mirvan might have had some effect upon Madame Duval; but he passes no opportunity of provoking her, and therefore made so many gross and rude speeches, all of which she retorted, that, in conclusion, she vowed she would sooner go to law, in right of her relationship, than that I should be taken away from her.
</p>
<p>
I heard this account from Mrs. Mirvan, who was so kindly considerate as to give me a pretence for quitting the room, as soon as this dispute begun, lest Madame Duval should refer to me, and insist on my obedience.
</p>
<p>
The final result of the conversation, was, that, to soften matters for the present, Madame Duval should make one in the party for Howard Grove, whither we are positively to go next Wednesday.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Mirvan is now writing to Lady Howard, to excuse bringing this unexpected guest, and to prevent the disagreeable surprise, which must, otherwise, attend her reception. This dear lady seems eternally studying my happiness and advan

tage.
</p>
<p>
To-night we go to the Pantheon, which is the last diversion we shall partake of in London, for to-morrow—
</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<p>
This moment, my dearest Sir, I have received your kind letter.
</p>
<p>
If you thought us too dissipated the first week, I almost fear to know what you will think of us
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:1259700101:152"/>
this second;—however, the Pantheon this even

ing will probably be the last public place which I shall ever see.
</p>
<p>
The assurance of your support and protection in regard to Madame Duval, though what I never doubted, excites my utmost gratitude: how, in

deed, cherished under your roof, the happy ob

ject of your constant indulgence, how could I have borne to become the slave of her tyrannical hu

mours?—pardon me that I speak so hardly of her, but, whenever the idea of passing my days with her occurs to me, the comparison which naturally fol

lows, takes from me all that forbearance, which, I believe, I owe her.
</p>
<p>
You are already displeased with Sir Clement: to be sure, then, his behaviour after the opera will not make his peace with you. Indeed, the more I reflect upon it, the more angry I am. I was en

tirely in his power, and it was cruel in him to cause me so much terror.
</p>
<p>
O my dearest Sir, were I but worthy the prayers and the wishes you offer for me, the utmost am

bition of my heart would be fully satisfied! but I greatly fear you will find me, now that I am out of the reach of your assisting prudence, more weak and imperfect than you could have expected.
</p>
<p>
I have not now time to write another word, for I must immediately hasten to dress for the evening.

<head>LETTER XXIII.</head>
<head type="sub">Evelina in continuation.</head>
<opener>
<dateline>
Queen-Ann-street,
<date>Tuesday, April 19.</date>
</dateline>
</opener>
<p>
THERE is something to me half melancholy in writing an account of our last adventures in London; however, as this day is merely appro

priated to packing, and preparations for our journey, and as I shall shortly have no more adventures to write, I think I may as well complete my town journal at once. And, when you have it all to

gether, I hope, my dear Sir, you will send me your observations and thoughts upon it to Howard Grove.
</p>
<p>
About eight o'clock we went to the Pantheon. I was extremely struck with the beauty of the building, which greatly surpassed whatever I could have expected or imagined. Yet, it has more the appearance of a chapel, than of a place of diver

sion; and, though I was quite charmed with the magnificence of the room, I felt that I could not be as gay and thoughtless there as at Ranelagh, for there is something in it which rather inspires awe and solemnity, than mirth and pleasure. How

ever, perhaps it may only have this effect upon such a novice as myself.
</p>
<p>
I should have said, that our party consisted only of Captain, Mrs. and Miss Mirvan, as Madame Duval spent the day in the city:—which I own I could not lament.
</p>
<p>
There was a great deal of company; but the first person we saw was Sir Clement Willoughby. He addressed us with his usual ease, and joined us
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1259700101:154"/>
for the whole evening. I felt myself very uneasy in his presence; for I could not look at him, nor hear him speak, without recollecting the chariot adventure; but, to my great amazement, I ob

served that he looked at
<hi>me</hi>
without the least ap

parent discomposure, though certainly he ought not to think of his behaviour without blushing. I really wish I had not forgiven him, and then he could not have ventured to speak to me any more.
</p>
<p>
There was an exceeding good concert, but too much talking to hear it well. Indeed I am quite astonished to find how little music is attended to in silence; for though every body seems to admire, hardly any body listens.
</p>
<p>
We did not see Lord Orville, till we went into the tea-room, which is large, low, and under ground, and serves merely as a foil to the apart

ments above; he then sat next to us; he seemed to belong to a large party, chiefly of ladies; but, among the gentlemen attending them, I perceived Mr. Lovel.
</p>
<p>
I was extremely irresolute whether or not I ought to make any acknowledgments to Lord Or

ville for his generous conduct in securing me from the future impertinence of that man; and I thought, that as he had seemed to allow Mrs. Mirvan to ac

quaint me, though no one else, of the measures which he had taken, he might perhaps suppose me ungrateful if silent: however I might have spared myself the trouble of deliberating, as I never once had the shadow of an opportunity of speaking unheard by Sir Clement. On the contrary, he was so exceedingly officious and forward, that I could not say a word to any body, but instantly he bent his head forward, with an air of profound at

tention, as if I had addressed myself wholly to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:1259700101:155"/>
him: and yet, I never once looked at him, and would not have spoken to him on any account.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, Mrs. Mirvan herself, though unac

quainted with the behaviour of Sir Clement after the opera, says it is not right for a young woman to be seen so frequently in public with the same gentleman; and, if our stay in town was to be lengthened, she would endeavour to represent to the Captain the impropriety of allowing his con

stant attendance; for Sir Clement, with all his
<hi>easiness,</hi>
could not be so eternally of our parties, if the Captain was less fond of his company.
</p>
<p>
At the same table with Lord Orville, sat a gen

tleman,—I call him so only because he
<hi>was</hi>
at the same table,—who, almost from the moment I was seated, fixed his eyes stedfastly on my face, and never once removed them to any other object dur

ing tea-time, notwithstanding my dislike of his star

ing must, I am sure, have been very evident. I was quite surprised, that a man whose boldness was so offensive, could have gained admission into a party of which Lord Orville made one; for I na

turally concluded him to be some low-bred, and uneducated man; and I thought my idea was in

dubitably confirmed, when I heard him say to Sir Clement Willoughby, in an
<hi>audible whisper,</hi>
—which is a mode of speech very distressing and disagree

able to by-standers,—
<q rend="inline">
"For Heaven's sake, Wil

loughby, who is that lovely creature?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
But what was my amazement, when, listen

ing attentively for the answer, though my head was turned another away, I heard Sir Clement say,
<q rend="inline">
"I am sorry I cannot inform your Lordship, but I am ignorant myself."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<hi>Lordship!</hi>
—how extraordinary! that a
<hi>nobleman,</hi>
accustomed, in all probability, to the first rank
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:1259700101:156"/>
of company in the kingdom, from his earliest in

fancy, can possibly be deficient in
<hi>good manners,</hi>
however faulty in morals and principles! Even Sir Clement Willoughby appeared modest in compa

rison with this person.
</p>
<p>
During tea, a conversation was commenced up

on the times, fashions, and public places, in which the company of both tables joined. It began by Sir Clement's enquiring of Miss Mirvan and of me if the Pantheon had answered our expectations.
</p>
<p>
We both readily agreed that it had greatly ex

ceeded them.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Ay, to be sure,"</q>
said the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"why you don't suppose they'd confess they did n't like it, do you? Whatever's the fashion, they must like of course;—or else I'd be bound for it they'd own, that there never was such a dull place as this here invented."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"And has, then, this building,"</q>
said Lord Orville,
<q rend="inline">
"no merit that may serve to lessen your censure? Will not your eye, Sir, speak something in its favour?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Eye,"</q>
cried the Lord, (I don't know his name,)
<q rend="inline">
"and is there any eye here, that can find any pleasure in looking at dead walls or statues, when such heavenly living objects as I now see demand all their admiration?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O, certainly,"</q>
said Lord Orville,
<q rend="inline">
"the life

less symmetry of architecture, however beautiful the design and proportion, no man would be so mad as to put in competition with the animated charms of nature: but when, as to-night, the eye may be regaled at the same time, and in one view, with all the excellence of art, and all the perfec

tion of nature, I cannot think that either suffer by being seen together."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:1259700101:157"/>
<q rend="inline">"I grant, my Lord,"</q>
said Sir Clement,
<q rend="inline">
"that the cool eye of unimpassioned philosophy may view both with equal attention, and equal safety; but, where the heart is not so well guarded, it is apt to interfere, and render, even to the eye, all objects but one insipid and uninteresting."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Aye, aye,"</q>
cried the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"you may talk what you will of your eye here, and your eye there, and, for the matter of that, to be sure you have two,—but we all know they both squint one way."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Far be it from me,"</q>
said Lord Orville,
<q rend="inline">
"to dispute the
<hi>magnetic</hi>
power of beauty, which ir

resistibly draws and attracts whatever has soul and sympathy: and I am happy to acknowledge, that though we have now no
<hi>gods</hi>
to occupy a mansion professedly built for them, yet we have secured their
<hi>better halves,</hi>
for we have
<hi>goddesses</hi>
to whom we all most willingly bow down."
</q>
And then, with a very droll air, he made a profound reve

rence to the ladies.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"They'd need be goddesses with a vengeance,"</q>
said the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"for they're mortal dear to look at. Howsomever, I should be glad to know what you can see in e'er a face among them that's worth half a guinea for a sight."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Half a guinea,"</q>
exclaimed that same Lord,
<q rend="inline">
"I would give half I am worth, for a sight of only
<hi>one,</hi>
provided I make my own choice. And, prithee, how can money be better employed than in the service of fine women?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"If the ladies of his own party can pardon the Captain's speech,"
</q>
said Sir Clement,
<q rend="inline">
"I think he has a fair claim to the forgiveness of all."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Then you depend very much, as I doubt not but you may,"
</q>
said Lord Orville,
<q rend="inline">
"upon the ge

neral
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:1259700101:158"/>
sweetness of the sex;—but, as to the ladies of the Captain's party, they may easily pardon, for they cannot be hurt."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"But they must have a devilish good conceit of themselves, though,"
</q>
said the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"to believe all that. Howsomever, whether or no, I should be glad to be told, by some of you who seem to be knowing in them things, what kind of diversion can be found in such a place as this here, for one who has had, long ago, his full of face-hunting?"
</q>
</p>
<p>Every body laughed, but nobody spoke.</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why look you there, now,"</q>
continued the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"you're all at a dead stand!—not a man among you can answer that there question. Why, then, I must make bold to conclude, that you all come here for no manner of purpose but to stare at one another's pretty faces;—though, for the matter of that, half of 'em are plaguy ugly,—and, as to t'other half,—I believe it's none of God's manufactory."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"What the ladies may come hither for, Sir,"</q>
said Mr. Lovel, (stroking his ruffles, and looking down,)
<q rend="inline">
"it would ill become
<hi>us</hi>
to determine; but as to we men, doubtless we can have no other view, than to admire them."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"If I be n't mistaken,"</q>
cried the Captain, (looking earnestly in his face,)
<q rend="inline">
"you are that same person we saw at Love for Love t'other night;—be n't you?"
</q>
</p>
<p>Mr. Lovel bowed.</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why then, Gentlemen,"</q>
continued he, with a loud laugh,
<q rend="inline">
"I must tell you a most excellent good joke;—when all was over, as sure as you're alive, he asked what the play was! Ha, ha, ha!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:1259700101:159"/>
<q rend="inline">"Sir,"</q>
said Mr Lovel, colouring,
<q rend="inline">
"if you were as much used to a town life as I am,—which, I presume, is not precisely the case,—I fancy you would not find so much diversion from a circum

stance so common."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Common! what, is it common?"</q>
repeated the Captain;
<q rend="inline">
"why then, 'fore George, such chaps are more fit to be sent to school, and well disciplined with a cat o' nine tails, than to poke their heads into a play-house. Why, a play is the only thing left, now-a-days, that has a grain of sense in it; for as to all the rest of your public places, d'ye see, if they were all put together, I would n't give
<hi>that</hi>
for 'em!"
</q>
snapping his fingers.
<q rend="inline">
"And now we're talking of them sort of things, there's your operas,—I should like to know, now, what any of you can find to say for them."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Lord Orville, who was most able to have an

swered, seemed by no means to think the Captain worthy an argument, upon a subject concerning which he had neither knowledge nor feeling: but, turning to us, he said,
<q rend="inline">
"The ladies are silent, and we seem to have engrossed the conversation to our

selves, in which we are much more our own ene

mies than theirs. But,"
</q>
addressing himself to Miss Mirvan and me,
<q rend="inline">
"I am most desirous to hear the opinions of these young ladies, to whom all public places must, as yet, be new."
</q>
</p>
<p>
We both, and with eagerness, declared that we had received as much, if not more pleasure, at the opera than any where: but we had better have been silent; for the Captain, quite displeased, said,
<q rend="inline">
what signifies asking them girls? Do you think they know their own minds yet? Ask 'em after any thing that's called diversion, and you're sure they'll say it's vastly fine;—they are set of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:1259700101:160"/>
parrots, and speak by rote, for they all say the same thing: but ask 'em how they like making puddings and pies, and I'll warrant you'll pose 'em. As to them operas, I desire I may hear no more of their liking such monsense; and for you, Moll,"
</q>
to his daughter,
<q rend="inline">
"I charge you, as you value my favour, that you'll never again be so impertinent as to have a taste of your own before my face. There are fools enough in the world, without your adding to their number. I'll have no daugh

ter of mine affect them sort of megrims. It is a shame they a'n't put down; and if I'd my will, there's not a magistrate in this town, but should be knocked of the head for suffering them. If you've a mind to praise any thing, why you may praise a play, and welcome, for I like it my

self."
</q>
</p>
<p>
This reproof effectually silenced us both for the rest of the evening. Nay, indeed, for some mi

nutes it seemed to silence every body else; till Mr. Lovel, not willing to lose an opportunity of re

turning the Captain's sarcasm, said,
<q rend="inline">
"Why, really, Sir, it is but natural, to be most pleased with what is most familiar, and, I think, of all our diversi

ons, there is not one so much in common between us and the country, as a play. Not a village but has its barns and comedians; and as for the stage

business, why it may be pretty equally done any where; and even in regard to
<hi>us,</hi>
and the
<hi>canaille,</hi>
confined as we all are within the semi-circle of a theatre, there is no place where the distinction is less obvious."
</q>
</p>
<p>
While the Captain seemed considering for Mr. Lovel's meaning, Lord Orville, probably with a view to prevent his finding it, changed the subject
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:1259700101:161"/>
to Cox's Museum, and asked what he thought of it?
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Think!—"</q>
said he,
<q rend="inline">
"why I think as how it i'n't worth thinking about. I like no such
<hi>jem cracks.</hi>
It is only fit, in my mind, for monkeys,—though, for I aught I know, they too might turn up their noses at it."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"May we ask your Lordship's own opinion?"</q>
said Mrs. Mirvan.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"The mechanism,"</q>
answered he,
<q rend="inline">
"is wonder

fully ingenious: I am sorry it is turned to no bet

ter account; but its purport is so frivolous, so very remote from all aim at instruction or utility, that the sight of so fine a shew, only leaves a regret on the mind, that so much work, and so much inge

nuity, should not be better bestowed."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"The truth is,"</q>
said the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"that in all this huge town, so full as it is of folks of all sorts, there i'n't so much as one public place, be

sides the play-house, where a man, that's to say a man who
<hi>is</hi>
a man, ought not to be ashamed to shew his face. T'other day, they got me to a ridotto; but I believe it will be long enough be

fore they get me to another. I knew no more what to do with myself, than if my ship's company had been metamorphosed into Frenchmen. Then, again, there's your famous Ranelagh, that you make such a fuss about,—why what a dull place is that!—its the worst of all."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Ranelagh dull!"—"Ranelagh dull!"</q>
was echoed from mouth to mouth, and all the ladies, as if of one accord, regarded the Captain with looks of the most ironical contempt.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"As to Ranelagh,"</q>
said Mr. Lovel,
<q rend="inline">
"most indubitably, though the price is plebeian, it is by no means adapted to the plebeian taste. It requires
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:1259700101:162"/>
a certain acquaintance with high life, and—and—and something of—of—something
<hi>d'un vrai goût,</hi>
to be really sensible of its merit. Those whose—whose connections, and so forth, are not among
<hi>les gens comme il faut,</hi>
can feel nothing but
<hi>ennui</hi>
at such a place as Ranelagh.
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Ranelagh!"</q>
cried Lord —,
<q rend="inline">
"O, 'tis the divinest place under heaven,—or, indeed,—for aught I know —."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O you creature!"</q>
cried a pretty, but affect

ed young lady, patting him with her fan,
<q rend="inline">
"you shan't talk so; I know what you are going to say; but, positively, I won't sit by you, if you're so wicked."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"And how can one sit by you, and be good?"</q>
said he,
<q rend="inline">
"when only to look at you is enough to make one wicked—or wish to be so?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Fie, my Lord!"</q>
returned she,
<q rend="inline">
"you are really insufferable. I don't think I shall speak to you again these seven years."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"What a metamorphosis,"</q>
cried Lord Orville,
<q rend="inline">
"should you make a patriarch of his Lord

ship!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Seven years!"</q>
said he:
<q rend="inline">
"dear Madam, be contented with telling me you will not speak to me
<hi>after</hi>
seven years, and I will endeavour to sub

mit."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O, very well, my Lord,"</q>
answered she,
<q rend="inline">
"pray date the end of our speaking to each other as early as you please, I'll promise to agree to your time."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You know, dear Madam,"</q>
said he, sip

ping his tea,
<q rend="inline">"you know I only live in your sight."</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:1259700101:163"/>
<q rend="inline">
"O yes, my Lord, I have long known that. But I begin to fear we shall be too late for Ranelagh this evening."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O no, Madam,"</q>
said Mr. Lovel, looking at his watch,
<q rend="inline">"it is but just past ten."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No more!"</q>
cried she,
<q rend="inline">"O then we shall do very well."</q>
</p>
<p>
All the ladies then started up, and declared they had no time to lose.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why what the D—l,"</q>
cried the Captain, (leaning forward with both his arms on the ta

ble,)
<q rend="inline">are you going to Ranelagh at this time of night?"</q>
</p>
<p>The ladies looked at one another, and smiled.</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"To Ranelagh?"</q>
cried Lord —,
<q rend="inline">
"Yes, and I hope you are going too; for we cannot possi

bly excuse these ladies."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I go to Ranelagh?—if I do, I'll be —."</q>
</p>
<p>
Every body now stood up, and the stranger Lord, coming round to me, said,
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>You</hi>
go, I hope?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, my Lord, I believe not."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O you cannot, must not be so barbarous."</q>
And he took my hand, and ran on saying such fine speeches and compliments, that I might almost have supposed myself a goddess, and him a pagan, paying me adoration. As soon as I possibly could, I drew back my hand; but he frequently, in the course of conversation, contrived to take it again, though it was extremely disagreeable to me; and the more so, as I saw that Lord Orville had his eyes fixed upon us, with a gravity of attention that made me uneasy.
</p>
<p>
And, surely, my dear Sir, it was a great liberty in this Lord, notwithstanding his rank, to treat me
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:1259700101:164"/>
so freely. As to Sir Clement, he seemed in mise

ry.
</p>
<p>
They all endeavoured to prevail with the Captain to join the Ranelagh party; and this Lord told me, in a low voice, that
<hi>it was tearing his heart out</hi>
to go without me.
</p>
<p>
During this conversation, Mr. Lovel came for

ward, and assuming a look of surprise, made me a bow, and enquired how I did, protesting, upon his honour, that he had not seen me before, or would sooner have paid his respects to me.
</p>
<p>
Though his politeness was evidently constrained, yet I was very glad to be thus assured of having nothing more to fear from him.
</p>
<p>
The Captain, far from listening to their persua

sions of accompanying them to Ranelagh, was quite in a passion at the proposal, and vowed he would sooner go to the
<hi>Black-hole in Calcutta.</hi>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"But,"</q>
said Lord —,
<q rend="inline">
"if the
<hi>ladies</hi>
will take their tea at Ranelagh, you may depend upon our seeing them safe home, for we shall all be proud of the honour of attending them."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"May be so,"</q>
said the Captain;
<q rend="inline">
"but I'll tell you what, if one of these places be n't enough for them to-night, why to-morrow they shall go to ne'er a one."
</q>
</p>
<p>
We instantly declared ourselves very ready to go home.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"It is not for yourselves that we petition,"</q>
said Lord —,
<q rend="inline">
"but for
<hi>us;</hi>
if you have any charity, you will not be so cruel as to deny us; we only beg you to prolong our happiness for a few mi

nutes,—the favour is but a small one for you to grant, though so great a one for us to receive."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"To tell you a piece of my mind,"</q>
said the Captain, surlily,
<q rend="inline">
"I think you might as well not
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:1259700101:165"/>
give the girls so much of this palaver: they'll take it all for gospel. As to Moll, why she's well enough, but nothing extraordinary, though, per

haps, you may persuade her that her pug-nose is all the fashion: and as to the other, why she's good white and red, to be sure; but what of that?—I'll warrant she'll moulder away as fast as her neighbours."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Is there,"</q>
cried Lord —,
<q rend="inline">
"another man in this place, who, seeing such objects, could make such a speech?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"As to that there,"</q>
returned the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"I don't know whether there be or no, and, to make free, I don't care; for I sha'n't go for to model myself by any of these fair-weather chaps, who dare not so much as say their souls are their own,—and, for aught I know, no more they ben't. I'm almost as much ashamed of my countrymen, as if I was a Frenchman, and I believe in my heart there i'n't a pin to chuse between them; and, before long, we shall hear the very sailors talking that lingo, and see never a swabber without a bag and a sword."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"He, he, he!—well, 'pon honour,"</q>
cried Mr. Lovel
<q rend="inline">
"you gentlemen of the ocean have a most severe way of judging."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Severe! 'fore George, that is impossible; for, to cut the matter short, the men, as they call themselves, are no better than monkeys; and as to the women, why they are mere dolls. So, now you've got my opinion of this subject; and so I wish you good night."
</q>
</p>
<p>
The ladies, who were very impatient to be gone, made their courtsies, and tripped away, fol

lowed by all the gentlemen of their party, except the Lord I have before-mentioned, and Lord
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:1259700101:166"/>
Orville, who stayed to make enquiries of Mrs. Mirvan concerning our leaving town; and then saying, with his usual politeness, something civil to each of us, with a very grave air, he quit

ted us.
</p>
<p>
Lord—remained some minutes longer, which he spent in making a prosusion of com

pliments to me, by which he prevented my hear

ing distinctly what Lord Orville said, to my great vexation, especially as he looked—I thought so, at least,—as if displeased at his particularity of be

haviour to me.
</p>
<p>
In going to an outward room, to wait for the carriage, I walked, and could not possibly avoid it, between this nobleman and Sir Clement Wil

loughby; and, when the servant said the coach stopped the way, though the latter offered me his hand, which I should much have preferred, this same Lord, without any ceremony, took mine himself; and Sir Clement, with a look ex

tremely provoked, conducted Mrs. Mirvan.
</p>
<p>
In all ranks and all stations of lise, how strange

ly do characters and manners differ! Lord Orville, with a politeness which knows no intermission, and makes no distinction, is as unassuming and modest, as if he had never mixed with the great, and was totally ignorant of every qualification he possesses; this other Lord, though lavish of compliments and fine speeches, seems to be an entire stranger to real good breeding; whoever strikes his fancy, engrosses his whole attention. He is forward and bold, has an air of haughtiness towards men, and a look of libertinism towards women, and his con

cious quality seems to have given him a freedom in his way of speaking to either sex, that is very lit

tle short of rudeness.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:1259700101:167"/>
When we returned home, we were all low

spirited; the evening's entertainment had displeased the Captain, and his displeasure, I believe, discon

certed us all.
</p>
<p>
And here I thought to have concluded my letter; but, to my great surprise, just now we had a visit from Lord Orville. He called, he said, to pay his respects to us before we left town, and made many enquiries concerning our return; and, when Mrs. Mirvan told him we were going into the country without any view of again quitting it, he expressed his concern in such terms—so polite, so flattering, so serious—that I could hardly forbear being sorry myself. Were I to go immediately to Berry Hill, I am sure I should feel nothing but joy;—but, now we are joined by this Captain, and by Madame Duval, I must own I expect very little pleasure at Howard Grove.
</p>
<p>
Before Lord Orville went Sir Clement Wil

loughby called. He was more grave than I had ever seen him, and made several attempts to speak to me in a low voice, and to assure me that his regret upon the occasion of our journey, was en

tirely upon my account. But I was not in spirits, and could not bear to be teazed by him. However, he has so well paid his court to Captain Mirvan, that he gave him a very hearty invitation to the Grove. At this, he brightened,—and, just then, Lord Orville took his leave!
</p>
<p>
No doubt but he was disgusted at this ill-timed, ill-bred partiality; for surely it was very wrong to make an invitation before Lord Orville, in which he was not included! I was so much chagrined that, as soon as he went, I left the room; and I shall not go down stairs till Sir Clement is gone.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:1259700101:168"/>
Lord Orville cannot but observe his assiduous endeavours to ingratiate himself into my favour; and does not this extravagant civility of Captain Mirvan, give him reason to suppose, that it meets with our general approbation? I cannot think upon this subject, without inexpressible uneasiness;—and yet, I can think of nothing else.
</p>
<p>
Adieu, my dearest Sir. Pray write to me im

mediately. How many long letters has this one short fortnight produced! More than I may, pro

bably, ever write again: I fear I shall have tired you with reading them, but you will now have time to rest, for I shall find but little to say in future.
</p>
<p>
And now, most honoured Sir, with all the fol

lies and imperfections which I have thus faithfully recounted, can you, and with unabated kindness, suffer me to sign myself
</p>
<closer>
<signed>Your dutiful, and most affectionate EVELINA?</signed>

</div>
<div n="24" type="letter">
<head>LETTER XXIV.</head>
<head type="sub">Mr. Villars to Evelina.</head>
<opener>
<dateline>
Berry Hill,
<date>April 22.</date>
</dateline>
</opener>
<p>
HOW much do I rejoice that I can again ad

dress my letters to Howard Grove! My Evelina would have grieved, had she known the anxiety of my mind, during her residence in the great world. My apprehensions have been inexpressibly alarm

ing; and your journal, at once exciting and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:1259700101:169"/>
relieving my fears, has almost wholly occupied me, since the time of your dating it from London.
</p>
<p>
Sir Clement Willoughby must be an artful, de

signing man; I am extremely irritated at his con

duct. The passion he pretends for you has neither sincerity nor honour; the manner and the oppor

tunities he has chosen to declare it, are bordering upon insult.
</p>
<p>
His unworthy behaviour after the opera, convin

ces me, that, had not your vehemence frightened him, Queen-Ann-Street would have been the last place whither he would have ordered his chariot. O my child, how thankful am I for your escape! I need not now, I am sure, enlarge upon your in

discretion and want of thought, in so hastily trust

ing yourself with a man so little known to you, and whose gaiety and flightiness should have put you on your guard.
</p>
<p>
The nobleman you met at the Pantheon, bold and forward as you describe him to be, gives me no apprehension; a man who appears so openly li

centious, and who makes his attack with so little regard to decorum, is one who, to such a mind as my Evelina's, can never be seen but with the disgust which his manners ought to excite.
</p>
<p>
But Sir Clement, though he seeks occasions to give real offence, contrives to avoid all appearance of intentional evil. He is far more dangerous, be

cause more artful; but I am happy to observe, that he seems to have made no impression upon your heart, and therefore a very little care and prudence may secure you from those designs which I fear he has formed.
</p>
<p>
Lord Orville appears to be of a better order of beings. His spirited conduct to the meanly imper

tinent Lovel, and his anxiety for you after the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:1259700101:170"/>
opera, prove him to be a man of sense and of feel

ing. Doubtless he thought there was much reason to tremble for your safety, while exposed to the power of Sir Clement; and he acted with a re

gard to real honour, that will always incline me to think well of him, in so immediately acquaint

ing the Mirvan family with your situation. Many men of this age, from a false and pretended deli

cacy to a friend, would have quietly pursued their own affairs, and thought it more honourable to leave an unsuspecting young creature to the mercy of a libertine, than to risk his displeasure by taking measures for her security.
</p>
<p>
Your evident concern at leaving London, is very natural; and yet it afflicts me. I ever dread

ed your being too much pleased with a life of dis

sipation, which youth and vivacity render but too alluring; and I almost regret the consent for your journey, which I had not the resolution to with

hold.
</p>
<p>
Alas, my child, the artlessness of your nature, and the simplicity of your education, alike unfit you for the thorny paths of the great and busy world. The supposed obscurity of your birth and situation, makes you liable to a thousand disagree

able adventures. Not only my views, but my hopes for your future life, have ever centered in the country. Shall I own to you, that, however I may differ from Captain Mirvan in other re

spects, yet my opinion of the town, its manners, inhabitants, and diversions, is much upon a level with his own? Indeed it is the general harbour of fraud and of folly, of duplicity and of imperti

nence; and I wish few things more fervently, than that you may have taken a lasting leave of it.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:1259700101:171"/>
Remember, however, that I only speak in re

gard to a public and a dissipated life; in private families, we may doubtless find as much goodness, honesty, and virtue, in London as in the country.
</p>
<p>
If contented with a retired station, I still hope I shall live to see my Evelina the ornament of her neighbourhood, and the pride and delight of her family: giving and receiving joy from such society as may best deserve her affection, and employing herself in such useful and innocent occupations as may secure and merit the tenderest love of her friends, and the worthiest satisfaction of her own heart.
</p>
<p>
Such are my hopes, and such have been my expectations. Disappoint them not, my beloved child, but chear me with a few lines, that may assure me, this one short fortnight spent in town, has not undone the work of seventeen years spent in the country.

<p>
NO, my dear Sir, no;
<hi>the work of seventeen years</hi>
remains such as it was, ever unworthy your time and your labour, but not more so now,—at least I hope not,—than before that fortnight which has so much alarmed you.
</p>
<p>
And yet, I must confess, that I am not half so happy here at present, as I was ere I went to town: but the change is in the place, not in me. Captain
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:1259700101:172"/>
Mirvan and Madame Duval have ruined Howard Grove. The harmony that reigned here, is dis

turbed, our schemes are broken, our way of life is altered, and our comfort is destroyed. But do not suppose
<hi>London</hi>
to be the source of these evils; for, had our excursion been any where else, so disagree

able an addition to our houshold, must have caused the same change at our return.
</p>
<p>
I was sure you would be displeased with Sir Cle

ment, and therefore I am by no means surprised at what you say of him: but for lord Orville—I must own I had greatly feared, that my weak and im

perfect account would not have procured him the good opinion which he so well deserves, and which I am delighted to find you seem to have of him. O, Sir, could I have done justice to the merit of which I believe him possessed,—could I have paint

ed him to
<hi>you</hi>
such as he appeared to
<hi>me,</hi>
—then, indeed, you would have had some idea of the claim which he has to your approbation!
</p>
<p>
After the last letter which I wrote in town, no

thing more passed previous to our journey hither, except a very violent quarrel between Captain Mir

van and Madame Duval. As the Captain intend

ed to travel on horseback, he had settled that we four females should make use of his coach. Ma

dame Duval did not come to Queen Ann-street, till the carriage had waited some time at the door, and then, attended by Monsieur Du Bois, she made her appearance.
</p>
<p>
The Captain, impatient to be gone, would not suffer them to enter the house, but insisted that we should immediately get into the coach. We obeyed; but were no sooner seated than Madame Duval said,
<q rend="inline">
"Come, Monsieur Du Bois, these
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:1259700101:173"/>
girls can make very good room for you; sit closer, children."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Mirvan looked quite confounded, and M. Du Bois, after making some apologies about crowd

ing us, actually got into the coach, on the side with Miss Mirvan and me. But no sooner was he seated than the Captain, who had observed this transaction very quietly, walked up to the coach

door, saying,
<q rend="inline">"What neither with your leave, nor by your leave?"</q>
</p>
<p>
M. Du Bois seemed rather shocked, and began to make abundance of excuses; but the Captain neither understood nor regarded him, and, very roughly said,
<q rend="inline">
"Look'ee, Monsieur, this here may be a French fashion, for aught I know;—but Give and Take is fair, in all nations; and so now, d'ye see, I'll make bold to shew you an English one."
</q>
</p>
<p>
And then seizing his wrist, he made him jump out of the coach.
</p>
<p>
M. Du Bois instantly put his hand upon his sword, and threatened to resent this indignity. The Cap

tain, holding up his stick, bid him draw at his peril. Mrs. Mirvan, greatly alarmed, got out of the coach, and standing between them, entreated her husband to re-enter the house.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"None of your clack!"</q>
cried he, angirly,
<q rend="inline">
"what the D—l, do you suppose I can't ma

nage a Frenchman?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Mean time, Madame Duval called out to M. Du Bois,
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>
Eh, laissez-le, mon ami, ne le corriger pas; c' est un vilain bête qui ne vaut pas la peine.
</hi>
"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Monsieur le Capitaine,</hi>
"
</q>
cried M. Du Bois,
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>voulez-vous bien me demander pardon?</hi>
"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O ho, you demand pardon; do you?"</q>
said the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"I thought as much; I thought you'd come to;—so you have lost your relish for
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:1259700101:174"/>
an English salutation, have you?"
</q>
strutting up to him with looks of defiance.
</p>
<p>
A crowd was now gathering, and Mrs. Mirvan again besought her husband to go into the house.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why what a plague is the woman afraid of?—did you ever know a Frenchman that could not take an affront?—I warrant Monsieur knows what he is about;—don't you, Monsieur?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
M. Du Bois, not understanding him, only said,
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>plait-il, Monsieur?</hi>
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"No, nor
<hi>dish</hi>
me, neither,"
</q>
answered the Captain;
<q rend="inline">
"but be that as it may, what signifies our parleying here? if you've any thing to propose, speak at once; if not, why let us go on our journey without more ado."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Parbleu, je n'entends rien, moi!</hi>

</q>
cried M. Du Bois, shrugging his shoulders, and looking very dis

mal.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Mirvan then advanced to him, and faid, in French, that she was sure the Captain had not any intention to affront him, and begged he would de

sist from a dispute which could only be productive of mutual misunderstanding, as neither of them knew the language of the other.
</p>
<p>
This sensible remonstrance had the desired effect, and M. Du Bois, making a bow to every one, ex

cept the Captain, very wisely gave up the point, and took leave.
</p>
<p>
We then hoped to proceed quietly on our jour

ney; but the turbulent Captain would not yet per

mit us: he approached Madame Duval with an exulting air, and said,
<q rend="inline">
"Why how's this, Madam? what, has your champion deserted you? why I thought you told me that you old gentlewomen had it all your own way, among them French sparks?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"As to that, Sir,"</q>
answered she,
<q rend="inline">
"it's not of no consequence what you thought; for a person
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:1259700101:175"/>
who can behave in such a low way, may think what he pleases for me, for I sha'n't mind."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why, then, Mistress, since you must needs make so free,"
</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"please to tell me the reason why you took the liberty for to ask any of your followers into my coach, without my leave? Answer me to that."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why then, pray, Sir,"</q>
returned she,
<q rend="inline">
"tell me, the reason why you took the liberty to treat the gentleman in such a impolite way, as to take and pull him neck and heels out? I'm sure he had n't done nothing to affront you, nor nobody else; and I don't know what great hurt he would have done you, by just sitting still in the coach; he would not have eat it."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"What, do you think, then, that my horses have nothing to do, but to carry about your snivel

ling Frenchmen? If you do, Madam, I must make bold to tell you, you are out, for I'll see 'em hanged first."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"More brute you, then! for they've never carried nobody half so good"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
Why, look'ee, Madam, if you must needs pro

voke me, I'll tell you a piece of my mind; you must know, I can see as far into a mill-stone as another man; and so, if you thought for to fob me off with one of your smirking French puppies for a son-in-law, why you'll find yourself in a hobble,—that's all."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Sir, you're a—but I won't say what;—but, I protest, I had n't no such a thought, no more had n't Monsieur Du Bois."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My dear,"</q>
said Mrs. Mirvan,
<q rend="inline">"we shall be very late."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Well, well,"</q>
answered he,
<q rend="inline">
get away then; off with you, as fast as you can, it's high time. As to Molly, she's fine lady enough in all con

science;

I want none of your French chaps to make her worse."
</q>
</p>
<p>
And so saying, he mounted his horse, and we drove off. And I could not but think with regret of the different feelings we experienced upon leav

ing London, to what had belonged to our enter

ing it!
</p>
<p>
During the journey, Madame Duval was so ve

ry violent against the Captain, that she obliged Mrs. Mirvan to tell her, that, when in her pre

sence, she must beg her to chuse some other subject of discourse.
</p>
<p>
We had a most affectionate reception from Lady Howard, whose kindness and hospitality cannot fail of making every body happy, who is disposed so to be.
</p>
<p>
Adieu, my dearest Sir. I hope, though I have hitherto neglected to mention it, that you have al

Howard Grove,
<date>April 27.</date>
</dateline>
</opener>
<p>
O MY dear Sir, I now write in the greatest un

easiness! Madame Duval has made a proposal which terrifies me to death, and which was as unexpected, as it is shocking.
</p>
<p>
She had been employed for some hoursthis af

ternoon in reading letters from London, and, just about tea-time, she sent for me into her room, and said, with a look of great satisfaction,
<q rend="inline">
"Come
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:1259700101:177"/>
here, child, I've got some very good news to tell you: something that will surprise you, I'll give you my word, for you ha'n't no notion of it."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I begged her to explain herself; and then, in terms which I cannot repeat, she said she had been considering what a shame it was, to see me such a poor country, shame-faced thing, when I ought to be a fine lady; and that she had long, and upon several occasions, blushed for me, though she must own the fault was none of mine: for nothing bet

ter could be expected from a girl who had been so immured. However, she assured me she had, at length, hit upon a plan, which would make quite another creature of me.
</p>
<p>
I waited, without much impatience, to hear what this preface led to; but I was soon awakened to more lively sensations, when she acquainted me, that her intention was to prove my birthright, and to claim, by law, the inheritance of my real fa

mily!
</p>
<p>
It would be impossible for me to express my ex

treme consternation, when she thus unfolded her scheme. My surprise and terror were equally great. I could say nothing; I heard her with a silence which I had not the power to break.
</p>
<p>
She then expatiated very warmly upon the ad

vantages I should reap from her plan; talked in a high style of my future grandeur; assured me how heartily I should despise almost every body and every thing I had hitherto seen; predicted my mar

rying into some family of the first rank in the king

dom; and, finally, said I should spend a few months in Paris, where my education and manners might receive their last polish.
</p>
<p>
She enlarged also upon the delight she should have, in common with myself, from mortifying the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:1259700101:178"/>
pride of certain people, and shewing them, that she was not to be slighted with impunity.
</p>
<p>
In the midst of this discourse I was relieved by a summons to tea. Madame Duval was in great spirits; but my emotion was too painful for con

cealment, and every body enquired into the cause. I would fain have waved the subject, but Madame Duval was determined to make it public. She told them, that she had it in her head to
<hi>make something</hi>
of me, and that they should soon call me by an

other name than that of Anville, and yet that she was not going to have the child married neither.
</p>
<p>
I could not endure to hear her proceed, and was going to leave the room; which, when Lady Howard perceived, she begged Madame Duval would defer her intelligence to some other oppor

tunity; but she was so eager to communicate her scheme, that she could bear no delay, and there

fore they suffered me to go, without opposition. Indeed, whenever my situation or affairs are men

tioned by Madame Duval, she speaks of them with such bluntness and severity, that I cannot be en

joined a task more cruel than to hear her.
</p>
<p>
I was afterwards acquainted with some parti

culars of the conversation by Miss Mirvan, who told me that Madame Duval informed them of her plan with the utmost complacency, and seemed to think herself very fortunate in having suggested it; but soon after, she accidentally betrayed, that she had been instigated to the scheme by her relations the Branghtons, whose letters, which she received to-day, first mentioned the proposal. She declared that she would have nothing to do with any
<hi>
round

about ways,
</hi>
but go openly and instantly to law, in order to prove my birth, real name, and title to the estate of my ancestors.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:1259700101:179"/>
How impertinent and officious, in these Brangh

tons, to interfere thus in my concerns! You can hardly imagine what a disturbance this plan has made in the family. The Captain without en

quiring into any particulars of the affair, has pe

remptorily declared himself against it, merely be

cause it has been proposed by Madame Duval, and they have battled the point together with great violence. Mrs. Mirvan says she will not even
<hi>think,</hi>
till she hears your opinion. But Lady Howard, to my great surprise, openly avows her approba

tion of Madame Duval's intention: however, she will write her reasons and sentiments upon the sub

ject to you herself
</p>
<p>
As to Miss Mirvan, she is my second self, and neither hopes nor fears but as I do. And as to
<hi>me,</hi>
—I know not what to say, nor even what to wish; I have often thought my fate peculiarly cruel, to have but one parent, and from that one to be banished for ever;—while, on the other side, I have but too well known and felt the pro

priety of the separation. And yet, you may much better imagine than I can express the internal an

guish which sometimes oppresses my heart, when I reflect upon the strange indifferency, that must occasion a father never to make the least enquiry after the health, the welfare, or even the life of his child!
</p>
<p>
O Sir, to
<hi>me,</hi>
the loss is nothing!—greatly, sweetly, and most benevolently have you guarded me from seeling it;—but for
<hi>him,</hi>
I grieve indeed!—I must be divested, not merely of a filial piety, but of all humanity, could I ever think upon this subject, and not be wounded to the soul.
</p>
<p>
Again I must repeat, I know not what to
<hi>wish:</hi>
think for me, therefore, my dearest Sir, and suffer
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:1259700101:180"/>
my doubting mind, that knows not which way to direct its hopes, to be guided by your wisdom and unerring counsel.

<head type="sub">Lady Howard to the Rev. Mr. Villars.</head>
<opener>
<dateline>Howard Grove.</dateline>
<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
</opener>
<p>
I Cannot give a greater proof of the high opinion I have of your candour, than by the liberty I am now going to take, of presuming to offer you ad

vice, upon a subject concerning which you have so just a claim to act for yourself: but I know you have too unaffected a love of justice to be par

tially tenacious of your own judgment.
</p>
<p>
Madame Duval has been proposing a scheme which has put us all in commotion, and against which, at first, in common with the rest of my family, I exclaimed; but upon more mature con

sideration, I own my objections have almost wholly vanished.
</p>
<p>
This scheme is no other than to commence a law-suit with Sir John Belmont, to prove the va

lidity of his marriage with Miss Evelyn; the ne

cessary consequence of which proof, will be secur

ing his fortune and estate to his daughter.
</p>
<p>
And why, my dear Sir, should not this be? I know that, upon first hearing, this plan conveys ideas that must shock you; but I know too, that your mind is superior to being governed by preju

dices,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:1259700101:181"/>
or to opposing any important cause on ac

count of a few disagreeable attendant circum

stances.
</p>
<p>
Your lovely charge, now first entering into life, has merit which ought not to be buried in obscu

rity. She seems born for an ornament to the world. Nature has been bountiful to her of whatever she had to bestow; and the peculiar attention you have given to her education, has formed her mind to a degree of excellence, that, in one so young, I have scarce ever seen equalled. Fortune, alone, has hitherto been sparing of her gifts; and she, too, now opens the way which leads to all that is left to wish for her.
</p>
<p>
What your reasons may have been, my good Sir, for so carefully concealing the birth, name, and pretensions of this amiable girl, and forbearing to make any claim upon Sir John Belmont, I am to

tally a stranger to; but without knowing, I re

spect them, from the high opinion I have of your character and judgment: but I hope they are not insuperable; for I cannot but think, that it was never designed, for one who seems meant to grace the world, to have her life devoted to retirement.
</p>
<p>
Surely Sir John Belmont, wretch as he has shewn himself, could never see his accomplished daughter, and not be proud to own her, and eager to se

cure her the inheritance of his fortune. The ad

miration she met with in town, though merely the effect of her external attractions, was such that Mrs. Mirvan assures me, she would have had the most splendid offers, had there not seemed to be some mystery in regard to her birth, which, she was well informed, was assiduously, though vainly, endeavoured to be discovered.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:1259700101:182"/>
Can it be right, my dear Sir, that this promis

ing young creature should be deprived of the for

tune and rank of life, to which she is lawfully en

titled, and which you have prepared her to sup

port and to use her so nobly?—To despise riches, may, indeed, be philosophic, but to dispense them worthily, must surely be more beneficial to man

kind.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps a few years, or indeed, a much shorter time, may make this scheme impracticable: Sir John, though yet young, leads a life too dissipated for long duration; and, when too late, we may regret that something was not sooner done; for it will be next to impossible, after he is gone, to settle or prove any thing with his heirs and exe

cutors.
</p>
<p>
Pardon the earnestness with which I write my sense of this affair; but your charming ward has made me so warmly her friend, that I cannot be in

different upon a subject of such importance to her future life.
</p>
<p>
Adieu, my dear Sir;—send me speedily an an

Berry Hill,

</dateline>
</opener>
<p>
YOUR letter, Madam, has opened a source of anxiety to which I look forward with dread, and which to see closed, I scarcely dare expect. I am
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:1259700101:183"/>
unwilling to oppose my opinion to that of your Ladyship, nor, indeed, can I, but by arguments which, I believe, will rather rank me as a her

mit, ignorant of the world, and fit only for my cell, than as a proper guardian, in an age such as this, for an accomplished young woman. Yet, thus called upon, it behoves me to explain, and en

deavour to vindicate, the reasons by which I have been hitherto guided.
</p>
<p>
The mother of this dear child,—who was led to destruction by her own imprudence, the hard

ness of heart of Madame Duval, and the villainy of Sir John Belmont,—was once, what her daugh

ter is now, the best beloved of my heart; and her memory, so long as my own holds, I shall love, mourn, and honour! On the fatal day that her gentle foul left its mansion, and not many hours ere she ceased to breathe, I solemnly plighted my faith,
<hi>
That her child, if it lived, should know no fa

ther, but myself, or her acknowledged husband.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
You cannot, Madam, suppose that I found much difficulty in adhering to this promise, and forbearing to make any
<hi>claim</hi>
upon Sir John Bel

mont. Could I feel an affection the most paternal for this poor sufferer, and not abominate her de

stroyer? Could I wish to deliver to
<hi>him,</hi>
who had so basely betrayed the mother, the helpless and innocent offspring, who, born in so much sorrow, seemed entitled to all the compassionate tenderness of pity?
</p>
<p>
For many years, the
<hi>name</hi>
alone of that man, accidentally spoken in my hearing, almost divested me of my christianity, and scarce could I forbear to execrate him. Yet I sought not, neither did I desire, to deprive him of his child, had he, with any appearance of contrition, or indeed of huma

nity,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:1259700101:184"/>
endeavoured to become less unworthy such a blessing; but he is a stranger to all parental feel

ings, and has, with a savage insensibility, forborne to enquire even into the existence of this sweet orphan, though the situation of his injured wife was but too well known to him.
</p>
<p>
You wish to be acquainted with my intentions.—I must acknowledge, they were such as I now perceive would not be honoured with your Lady

ship's approbation: for though I have sometimes thought of presenting Evelina to her father, and demanding the justice which is her due, yet, at other times, I have both disdained and feared the application; disdained, lest it should be refused, and feared, lest it should be accepted!
</p>
<p>
Lady Belmont, who was firmly persuaded of her approaching dissolution, frequently and ear

nestly besought me, that if her infant was a fe

male, I would not abandon her to the direction of a man so wholly unfit to take the charge of her education; but, should she be importunately demanded, that I would retire with her abroad, and carefully conceal her from Sir John, till some apparent change in his sentiments and conduct should announce him less improper for such a trust. And often would she say,
<q rend="inline">
"Should the poor babe have any feelings correspondent with its mother's, it will have no want, while under your protection."
</q>
Alas! she had no sooner quitted it herself, than she was plunged into a gulph of misery, that swallowed up her peace, reputation, and life.
</p>
<p>
During the childhood of Evelina, I suggested a thousand plans for the security of her birth

right;—but I as oftentimes rejected them. I was in a perpetual conflict, between the desire that she should have justice done her, and the appre

hension
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:1259700101:185"/>
that, while I improved her fortune, I should endanger her mind. However, as her character began to be formed, and her disposition to be displayed, my perplexity abated; the road before me seemed less thorny and intricate, and I thought I could perceive the right path from the wrong: for, when I observed the artless open

ness, the ingenuous simplicity of her nature; when I saw that her guileless and innocent soul fancied all the world to be pure and disinterested as herself, and that her heart was open to every impression with which love, pity, or art might assail it;—then did I flatter myself, that to follow my own inclination, and to secure her welfare, was the same thing; since, to expose her to the snares and dangers inevitably encircling a house of which the master is dissipated and unprincipled, without the guidance of a mother, or any pru

dent and sensible female, seemed to me no less than suffering her to stumble into some dreadful pit, when the sun was in its meridian. My plan, therefore, was not merely to educate and to che

rish her as my own, but to adopt her the heiress of my small fortune, and to bestow her upon some worthy man, with whom she might spend her days in tranquillity, chearfulness, and good humour, untainted by vice, folly, or ambition.
</p>
<p>
So much for the time past. Such have been the motives by which I have been governed; and I hope they will be allowed not merely to account for, but also to justify the conduct which has re

sulted from them. It now remains to speak of the time to come.
</p>
<p>
And here, indeed, I am sensible of difficulties which I almost despair of surmounting according to my wishes. I pay the highest deference to your
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:1259700101:186"/>
Ladyship's opinion, which it is extremely painful to me not to concur with; yet, I am so well acquainted with your goodness, that I presume to hope it would not be absolutely impossible for me to offer such arguments as might lead you to think with me, that this young creature's chance of happiness seems less doubtful in retirement, than it would be in the gay and dissipated world: but why should I perplex your Ladyship with reasoning that can turn to so little account? for, alas! what arguments, what persuasions can I make use of, with any prospect of success, to such a woman as Madame Duval? Her character, and the violence of her disposition, intimidate me from making the attempt: she is too ignorant for instruction, too obstinate for entreaty, and too weak for reason.
</p>
<p>
I will not, therefore, enter into a contest from which I have nothing to expect but altercation and impertinence. As soon would I discuss the effect of sound with the deaf, or the nature of colours with the blind, as aim at illuminating with conviction a mind so warped by prejudice, so much the slave of unruly and illiberal passions. Unused as she is to controul, persuasion would but harden, and opposition incense her. I yield therefore, to the necessity which compels my reluctant acqui

escence, and shall now turn all my thoughts upon considering of such methods for the conducting this enterprize as may be most conducive to the hap

piness of my child, and least liable to wound her sensibility.
</p>
<p>
The law-suit, therefore, I wholly and absolute

ly disapprove.
</p>
<p>
Will you, my dear Madam, forgive the free

dom of an old man, if I own myself greatly sur

prised, that you could, even for a moment, listen
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:1259700101:187"/>
to a plan so violent, so public, so totally repugnant to all female delicacy? I am satisfied your Lady

ship has not weighed this project. There was a time, indeed, when, to assert the innocence of Lady Belmont, and to blazon to the world the
<hi>wrongs,</hi>
not
<hi>guilt,</hi>
by which she suffered, I pro

posed, nay attempted, a similar plan: but then, all assistance and encouragement was denied. How cruel to the remembrance I bear of her woes, is this tardy resentment of Madame Duval! She was deaf to the voice of Nature, though she has hearkened to that of Ambition.
</p>
<p>
Never can I consent to have this dear and timid girl brought forward to the notice of the world by such a method; a method which will subject her to all the impertinence of curiosity, the sneers of conjecture, and the stings of ridicule. And for what!—the attainment of wealth, which she does not want, and the gratification of vanity, which she does not seel.—A child to appear against a father!—no, Madam, old and infirm as I am, I would even yet sooner convey her myself to some remote part of the world, though I were sure of dying in the expedition.
</p>
<p>
Far different had been the motives which would have stimulated her unhappy mother to such a proceeding; all her felicity in this world was irre

trievably lost; her life was become a burthen to her, and her fair fame, which she had early been taught to prize above all other things, had receiv

ed a mortal wound: therefore to clear her own ho

nour, and to secure from blemish the birth of her child, was all the good which Fortune had reserv

ed herself the
<hi>power</hi>
of bestowing. But even this last consolation was with-held from her!
</p>
<p>
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:1259700101:188"/>
Let milder measures be adopted; and—since it must be so,—let application be made to Sir John Belmont; but as to a law-suit, I hope, upon this subject, never more to hear it mentioned.
</p>
<p>
With Madame Duval, all pleas of delicacy would be ineffectual; her scheme must be opposed by arguments better suited to her understanding. I will not, therefore, talk of its impropriety, but endeavour to prove its inutility. Have the good

ness, then, to tell her, that her own intentions would be frustrated by her plan, since, should the law-suit be commenced, and even should the cause be gained, Sir John Belmont would still have it in his power, and, if irritated, no doubt in his in

clination, to cut off her grand-daughter with a shilling.
</p>
<p>
She cannot do better, herself, than to remain quiet and inactive in the affair: the long and mu

tual animosity between her and Sir John, will make her interference merely productive of debates and ill-will. Neither would I have Evelina ap

pear till summoned. And as to myself, I must wholly decline
<hi>acting,</hi>
though I will, with unwea

ried zeal, devote all my thoughts to giving coun

sel: but, in truth, I have neither inclination nor spirits adequate to engaging personally with this man.
</p>
<p>
My opinion is, that he would pay more respect to a letter from your Ladyship upon this subject, than from any other person. I therefore advise and hope, that you will yourself take the trouble of writing to him, in order to open the affair. When he shall be inclined to see Evelina, I have for him a posthumous letter, which his much-injured lady left to be presented to him, if ever such a meeting should take place.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:1259700101:189"/>
The views of the Branghtons, in suggesting this scheme, are obviously interested; they hope, by securing to Evelina the fortune of her father, to induce Madame Duval to settle her own upon themselves. In this, however, they would proba

bly be mistaken, for little minds have ever a pro

pensity to bestow their wealth upon those who are already in affluence, and therefore, the less her grand-child requires her assistance, the more gladly she will give it.
</p>
<p>
I have but one thing more to add, from which, however, I can by no means recede: my word so solemnly given to Lady Belmont, that her child should never be owned but with herself, must be inviolably adhered to.

HOW sincerely do I sympathise in the uneasi

, with what anxious impatience shall I await its arrival! upon it seems to depend the fate of my future life. My solicitude is so great, and my suspense so pain

ful, that I cannot rest a moment in peace, or turn my thoughts into any other channel.
</p>
<p>
Deeply interested as I now am in the event, most sincerely do I regret that the plan was ever proposed: methinks it

The subject is discussed here eternally. Captain Mirvan and Madame Duval, as usual, quarrel when

tually: at one moment, I am embraced by a kind and relenting parent, who takes me to that heart from which I have hitherto been benished, and supplicates, through me, peace and forgiveness from the ashes of my mother!—at another, he regards me with detestation, considers me as the living image of an injured saint, and repulses me with horror!—But I will not afflict you with the melancholy phantasms of my brain. I will endea

vour to compose my mind to a more tranquil state, and forbear to write again, till I have, in some measure, succeeded.

<head type="sub">Lady Howard to Sir John Belmont, Bart.</head>
<opener>
<dateline>
Howard-Grove,
<date>May 5.</date>
</dateline>
<salute>SIR,</salute>
</opener>
<p>
YOU will, doubtless, be surprised at receiving a letter from one who had for so short a period the honour of your acquaintance, and that at so great a distance of time; but the motive which has in

duced me to take this liberty, is of so delicate a nature, that were I to commence making apologies
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1259700101:192"/>
for my officiousness, I fear my letter would be too long for your patience.
</p>
<p>
You have, probably, already conjectured the subject upon which I mean to treat. My regard for Mr. Evelyn and his amiable daughter, was well known to you: nor can I ever cease to be interested in whatever belongs to their memory or family.
</p>
<p>
I must own myself somewhat distressed in what manner to introduce the purport of my writing; yet, as I think that, in affairs of this kind, frank

ness is the first requisite to a good understanding be

tween the parties concerned, I will neither torment you nor myself with punctilious ceremonies, but proceed instantly and openly to the business which occasions my giving you this trouble.
</p>
<p>
I presume, Sir, it would be superfluous to tell you, that your child resides still in Dorsetshire, and is still under the protection of the Reverend Mr. Villars, in whose house she was born: for, though no enquiries concerning her have reached his ears, or mine, I can never suppose it possible you have forborne to make them. It only remains, therefore, to tell you, that your daughter is now grown up; that she has been educated with the utmost care, and the utmost success; and that she is now a most deserving, accomplished, and amia

ble young woman.
</p>
<p>
Whatever may be your view for her future destination in life, it seems time to declare it. She is greatly admired, and, I doubt not, will be very much sought after: it is proper, therefore, that her future expectations, and your pleasure concern

ing her, should be made known.
</p>
<p>
Believe me, Sir, she merits your utmost atten

tion and regard. You could not see and know her, and remain unmoved by those sensations of affec

tion
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:1259700101:193"/>
which belong to so near and tender a relation

ship. She is the lovely resemblance of her lovely mother;—pardon me, Sir, that I mention that unfortunate lady, but I think it behoves me, upon this occasion, to shew the esteem I felt for her; allow me, therefore, to say, and be not offended at my freedom, that the memory of that excellent lady has but too long remained under the aspersions of calumny; surely it is time to vindicate her fame!—and how can that be done in a manner more eligible, more grateful to her friends, or more honourable to yourself, than by openly re

ceiving as your child,
<hi>the daughter of the late Lady Belmont?</hi>
</p>
<p>
The venerable man who has had the care of her education, deserves your warmest acknowledgments, for the unremitting pains he has taken, and atten

tion he has shewn in the discharge of his trust. Indeed she has been peculiarly fortunate in meeting with such a friend and guardian: a more worthy man, or one whose character seems nearer to per

fection, does not exist.
</p>
<p>
Permit me to assure you, Sir, she will amply repay whatever regard and favour you may hereaf

ter shew her, by the comfort and happiness you cannot fail to find in her affection and duty. To be owned
<hi>properly</hi>
by you, is the first wish of her heart; and I am sure, that to merit your approba

tion will be the first study of her life.
</p>
<p>
I fear that you will think this address imperti

nent; but I must rest upon the goodness of my in

tention to plead my excuse.

I am, Sir, Your most obedient humble servant, M. HOWARD.

Howard Grove,

</opener>
<p>
OUR house has been enlivened to-day, by the arrival of a London visitor; and the necessity I have been under of concealing the uneasiness of my mind, has made me exert myself so effectu

ally, that I even think it is really diminished; or, at least, my thoughts are not so totally, so very anxiously occupied by one only subject, as they lately were.
</p>
<p>
I was strolling this morning with Miss Mirvan, down a lane about a mile from the grove, when we heard the trampling of horses; and, fearing the narrowness of the passage, we were turning hastily back, but stopped upon hearing a voice call out,
<q rend="inline">
"Pray, Ladies, don't be frightened, for I will walk my horse."
</q>
We turned again, and then saw Sir Clement Willoughby. He dismounted, and approaching us, with the reins in his hand, presently recollected us.
<q rend="inline">"Good Heaven,"</q>
cried he, with his usual quickness,
<q rend="inline">
"do I see Miss Anville?—and you, too, Miss Mirvan?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
He immediately ordered his servant to take charge of his horse, and then, advancing to us, took a hand of each, which he pressed to his lips, and said a thousand fine things concerning his good fortune, our improved looks, and the charms of the country, when inhabited by
<hi>such</hi>
rural deities.
<q rend="inline">
"The town, Ladies, has lan

guished since your absence,—or, at least, I have so much languished myself, as to be absolutely
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:1259700101:195"/>
insensible to all it had to offer. One refreshing breeze, such as I now enjoy, awakens me to new vigour, life, and spirit. But I never before had the good luck to see the country in such perfection."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Has not almost every body left town, Sir?"</q>
said Miss Mirvan.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I am ashamed to answer you, Madam—but indeed it is as full as ever, and will continue so, till after the birth-day. However, you ladies, were so little seen, that there were but few who know what it has lost. For my own part, I felt it too sensibly, to be able to endure the place any lon

ger."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Is there any body remaining there, that we were acquainted with?"
</q>
cried I.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O yes, Ma'am."</q>
And then he named two or three persons we had seen when with him; but he did not mention Lord Orville, and I would not ask him, lest he should think me curious. Perhaps, if he stays here some time, he may speak of him by accident.
</p>
<p>
He was proceeding in this complimentary style, when we were met by the Captain; who no sooner perceived Sir Clement, than he hastened up to him, gave him a hearty shake of the hand, a cordial slap on the back, and some other equally gentle tokens of satisfaction, assuring him of his great joy at his visit, and declaring he was as glad to see him as if he had been a messenger who brought news that a French ship was sunk. Sir Clement, on the other side, expressed himself with equal warmth, and protested he had been so eager to pay his re

spects to Captain Mirvan, that he had left Lon

don in its full lustre, and a thousand engage

ments
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:1259700101:196"/>
unanswered, merely to give himself that pleasure.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"We shall have rare sport,"</q>
said the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"for do you know the old French-woman is among us? 'Fore George, I have scarce made any use of her yet, by reason I have had no

body with me that could enjoy a joke: howsom

ever, it shall go hard but we'll have some diver

sion now."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Sir Clement very much approved of the pro

posal; and we then went into the house, where he had a very grave reception from Mrs. Mirvan, who is by no means pleased with his visit, and a look of much discontent from Madame Duval, who said to me, in a low voice,
<q rend="inline">
"I'd as soon have seen Old Nick as that man, for he's the most imper

tinentest person in the world, and is n't never of my side."
</q>
</p>
<p>
The Captain is now actually occupied in con

triving some scheme which, he says, is
<hi>to play the old Dowager off;</hi>
and so eager and delighted is he at the idea, that he can scarcely constrain his raptures sufficiently to conceal his design, even from herself. I wish, however, since I do not dare put Madame Duval upon her guard, that he had the delicacy not to acquaint me with his intention.

<p>
THE Captain's operations are begun,—and, I hope, ended; for indeed poor Madame Duval has already but too much reason to regret Sir Cle

ment's visit to Howard Grove.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday morning, during breakfast, as the Captain was reading the news-paper, Sir Clement suddenly begged to look at it, saying he wanted to know if there was any account of a transaction, at which he had been present the evening before his journey thither, concerning a poor Frenchman, who had got into a scrape which might cost him his life.
</p>
<p>
The Captain demanded particulars; and then Sir Clement told him a long story, of being with a party of country friends, at the Tower, and hearing a man call out for mercy in French; and that, when he enquired into the occasion of his dis

tress, he was informed, that he had been taken up upon suspicion of treasonable practices against the government.
<q rend="inline">"The poor fellow,"</q>
continued he,
<q rend="inline">
"no sooner found that I spoke French, than he besought me to hear him, protesting that he had no evil designs; that he had been but a short time in England, and only waited the return of a Lady from the country, to quit it for ever."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Madame Duval changed colour, and listened with the utmost attention.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Now, though I by no means approve of so many foreigners continually flocking into our coun

try,"
</q>
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:1259700101:198"/>
added he, addressing himself to the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"yet I could not help pitying the poor wretch, because he did not know enough of English to make his defence: however, I found it impossible to assist him, for the mob would not suffer me to interfere. In truth I am afraid he was but roughly handled."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why, did they duck him?"</q>
said the Captain.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Something of that sort,"</q>
answered he.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"So much the better! so much the better!"</q>
cried the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"an impudent French puppy!—I'll bet you what you will he was a rascal. I only wish all his countrymen were served the same."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I wish you had been in his place, with all my soul!"
</q>
cried Madame Duval, warmly;—
<q rend="inline">
"but pray, Sir, did n't nobody know who this poor gentleman was?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why I did hear his name spoke,"</q>
answered Sir Clement,
<q rend="inline">"but I cannot recollect it."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"It was n't,—it was n't—Du Bois?"</q>
stam

mered out Madame Duval.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"The very name!"</q>
answered he,
<q rend="inline">"yes, Du Bois, I remember it now."</q>
</p>
<p>
Madame Duval's cup fell from her hand, as she repeated
<q rend="inline">"Du Bois! Monsieur Du Bois, did you say?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Du Bois! why that's
<hi>my</hi>
friend,
</q>
cried the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"that's
<hi>Monsieur Slippery,</hi>
i'n't it?—Why he's plaguy fond of sousing work; howsom

ever, I'll be sworn they gave him his fill of it."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"And I'll be sworn,"</q>
cried Madame Duval,
<q rend="inline">
"that you're a—but I don't believe nothing about it, so you need n't be so overjoyed, for I dare say it was no more Monsieur Du Bois than I am."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:1259700101:199"/>
<q rend="inline">"I thought at the time,"</q>
said Sir Clement, very gravely,
<q rend="inline">
"that I had seen the gentleman be

fore, and now I recollect, I think it was in com

pany with you, Madam."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"With
<hi>me,</hi>
Sir!"
</q>
cried Madame Duval.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Say you so!"</q>
said the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"why then, it must be he, as sure as you're alive!—Well but, my good friend, what will they do with poor Mon

sieur?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"It is difficult to say,"</q>
answered Sir Clement, very thoughtfully,
<q rend="inline">
"but, I should suppose, that if he has not good friends to appear for him, he will be in a very unpleasant situation; for these are serious sort of affairs.'
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why, do you think they'll hang him?"</q>
de

manded the Captain.
</p>
<p>
Sir Clement shook his head, but made no an

swer.
</p>
<p>
Madame Duval could no longer contain her agitation; she started from her chair, repeating, with a voice half choaked,
<q rend="inline">
"Hang him!—they can't,—they sha'n't—let them at their peril!—however, 'tis all false, and I won't believe a word of it;—but I'll go to town this very moment, and see M. Du Bois myself;—I won't wait for no

thing."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Mirvan begged her not to be alarmed; but she flew out of the room, and up stairs into her own apartment. Lady Howard blamed both the gentle

men for having been so abrupt, and followed her. I would have accompanied her, but the Captain stopped me; and, having first laughed very hear

tily, said he was going to read his commission to his ship's company.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Now, do you see,"</q>
said he,
<q rend="inline">
"as to Lady Howard, I sha'n't pretend for to enlist her into
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:1259700101:200"/>
my service, and so I shall e'en leave her to make it out as well as she can; but as to all you, I ex

pect obedience and submission to orders; I am now upon a hazardous expedition, having undertaken to convoy a crazy vessel to the shore of Mortifi

cation; so, d'ye see, if any of you have any thing to propose, that will forward the enterprize,—why speak and welcome; but if any of you, that are of my chosen crew, capitulate, or enter into any treaty with the enemy,—I shall look upon you as mutinying, and turn you adrift."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Having finished this harangue, which was inter

larded with many expressions, and sea-phrases, that I cannot recollect, he gave Sir Clement a wink of intelligence, and left us to ourselves.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, notwithstanding the attempts I so fre

quently make of writing some of the Captain's conversation, I can only give you a faint idea of his language; for almost every other word he ut

ters is accompanied by an oath, which, I am sure, would be as unpleasant for you to read, as for me to write. And, besides, he makes use of a thou

sand sea-terms, which are to me quite unintel

ligible.
</p>
<p>
Poor Madame Duval sent to enquire at all pro

bable places, whether she could be conveyed to town in any stage-coach; but the Captain's ser

vant brought her for answer, that no London stage would pass near Howard Grove till to-day. She then sent to order a chaise; but was soon as

sured that no horses could be procured. She was so much inflamed by these disappointments, that she threatened to set out for town on foot, and it was with difficulty that Lady Howard dissuaded her from this mad scheme.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:1259700101:201"/>
The whole morning was filled up with these en

quiries. But, when we were all assembled to din

ner, she endeavoured to appear perfectly uncon

cerned, and repeatedly protested that she gave not any credit to the report, as far as it regarded M. Du Bois, being very certain that he was not the person in question.
</p>
<p>
The Captain used the most provoking efforts to convince her that she deceived herself; while Sir Clement, with more art, though not less malice, affected to be of her opinion; but, at the same time that he pretended to relieve her uneasiness, by saying that he doubted not having mistaken the name, he took care to enlarge upon the dan

ger to which the
<hi>unknown gentleman</hi>
was ex

posed, and expressed great concern at his perilous situation.
</p>
<p>
Dinner was hardly removed, when a letter was delivered to Madame Duval. The moment she had read it, she hastily demanded from whom it came?
<q rend="inline">"A country boy brought it,"</q>
answered the servant,
<q rend="inline">"but he would not wait."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Run after him this instant!"</q>
cried she,
<q rend="inline">
"and be sure you bring him back.
<hi>Mon Dieu! quel avanture! que ferai-je?</hi>
"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"What's the matter? what's the matter?"</q>
said the Captain.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why nothing,—nothing's the matter.
<hi>O mon Dieu!</hi>
"
</q>
</p>
<p>And she rose, and walked about the room.</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why, what—has Monsieur sent to you?"</q>
continued the Captain:
<q rend="inline">"is that there letter from him?</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"No,—it i'n't;—besides, if it is, it's nothing to you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:1259700101:202"/>
<q rend="inline">
"O then, I'm sure it is! Pray now, Madame, don't be so close; come, tell us all about it,—what does he say? how did he relish the horse

pond?—which did he find best, sousing
<hi>single</hi>
or
<hi>double?</hi>
—'Fore George, 'twas plaguy unlucky you was not with him!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"It's no such a thing, Sir,"</q>
cried she, very angrily,
<q rend="inline">
"and if you're so very fond of a horse

pond, I wish you'd put yourself into one, and not be always a thinking about other people's being served so."
</q>
</p>
<p>
The man then came in, to acquaint her they could not overtake the boy. She scolded violently, and was in such perturbation, that Lady Howard interfered, and begged to know the cause of her uneasiness, and whether she could assist her?
</p>
<p>
Madame Duval cast her eyes upon the Captain, and Sir Clement, and said she should be glad to speak to her Ladyship, without so many witnesses.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Well, then, Miss Anville,"</q>
said the Cap

tain, turning to me,
<q rend="inline">
"do you and Molly go into another room, and stay there till Mrs. Duval has opened her mind to us."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"So you may think, Sir,"</q>
cried she,
<q rend="inline">
"but who's fool then? no, no, you need n't trouble yourself to make a ninny of me, neither, for I'm not so easily taken in I'll assure you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Lady Howard then invited her into the dressing

room, and I was desired to attend her.
</p>
<p>
As soon as we had shut the door,
<q rend="inline">"O my Lady,"</q>
exclaimed Madame Duval,
<q rend="inline">
"here's the most cruellest thing in the world has happened!—but that Captain is such a beast, I can't say no

thing before him,—but it's all true! poor M. Du Bois is tooked up!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:1259700101:203"/>
Lady Howard begged her to be comforted, say

ing that as M. Du Bois was certainly innocent, there could be no doubt of his ability to clear him

self.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"To be sure, my Lady,"</q>
answered she,
<q rend="inline">
"I know he is innocent; and to be sure they'll never be so wicked as to hang him for nothing?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Certainly not;"</q>
replied Lady Howa:d,
<q rend="inline">
"you have no reason to be uneasy. This is not a coun

try where punishment is inflicted without proof."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Very true, my Lady; but the worst thing is this; I cannot bear that that fellow, the Cap

tain, should know about it; for if he does, I sha'n't never hear the last of it;—no more won't poor M. Du Bois."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Well, well,"</q>
said Lady Howard,
<q rend="inline">
"shew me the letter, and I will endeavour to advise you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
The letter was then produced. It was signed by the clerk of a country justice; who acquainted her, that a prisoner, then upon trial for suspicion of treasonable practices against the government, was just upon the point of being committed to jail, but having declared that he was known to her, this clerk had been prevailed upon to write, in order to enquire if she really could speak to the character and family of a Frenchman who called himself Pierre Du Bois.
</p>
<p>
When I heard the letter, I was quite amazed at its success. So improbable did it seem, that a fo

reigner should be taken before a
<hi>country</hi>
justice of peace, for a crime of so dangerous a nature, that I cannot imagine how Madame Duval could be alarmed, even for a moment. But, with all her violence of temper, I see that she is easily fright

ened, and, in fact, more cowardly than many who
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:1259700101:204"/>
have not half her spirit; and so little does she re

flect upon circumstances, or probability, that she is continually the dupe of her own—I ought not to say
<hi>ignorance,</hi>
but yet, I can think of no other word.
</p>
<p>
I believe that Lady Howard, from the begin

ning of the transaction, suspected some contrivance of the Captain, and this letter, I am sure, must confirm her suspicion: however, though she is not at all pleased with his frolick, yet she would not hazard the consequence of discovering his designs: her looks, her manner, and her character, made me draw this conclusion from her apparent perplex

ity; for not a word did she say, that implied any doubt of the authenticity of the letter. Indeed there seems to be a sort of tacit agreement between her and the Captain, that she should not appear to be acquainted with his schemes; by which means she at once avoids quarrels, and supports her dig

nity.
</p>
<p>
While she was considering what to propose, Madame Duval begged to have the use of her Ladyship's chariot, that she might go immediate

ly to the assistance of her friend. Lady Howard politely assured her that it would be extremely at her service; and then Madame Duval besought her not to own to the Captain what had happened, protesting that she could not endure he should know that poor M. Du Bois had met with so un

fortunate an accident. Lady Howard could not help smiling, though she readily promised not to
<hi>inform</hi>
the Captain of the affair. As to me, she desired my attendance; which I was by no means rejoiced at, as I was certain she was going upon a fruitless errand.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:1259700101:205"/>
I was then commissioned to order the chariot.
</p>
<p>
At the foot of the stairs I met the captain, who was most impatiently waiting the result of the conference. In an instant we were joined by Sir Clement. A thousand enquiries were then made concerning Madame Duval's opinion of the letter, and her intentions upon it: and when I would have left them, Sir Clement, pretending equal eagerness with the Captain, caught my hand, and repeatedly detained me, to ask some frivolous question, to the answer of which he must be to

tally indifferent. At length, however, I broke from them; they retired into the parlour, and I executed my commission.
</p>
<p>
The carriage was soon ready, and Madame Duval, having begged Lady Howard to say she was not well, stole softly down stairs, desiring me to follow her. The chariot was ordered at the garden door; and when we were seated, she told the man, according to the clerk's directions, to drive to Mr. Justice Tyrell's, asking, at the same time, how many miles off he lived?
</p>
<p>
I expected he would have answered that he knew of no such person; but, to my great surprize, he said,
<q rend="inline">
"Why 'Squire Tyrell lives about nine miles beyond the park."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Drive fast, then,"</q>
cried she,
<q rend="inline">"and you sha'n't be no worse for it."</q>
</p>
<p>
During our ride, which was extremely tedious, she tormented herself with a thousand fears for M. Du Bois' safety; and piqued herself very much upon having escaped unseen by the Captain, not only that she avoided his triumph, but because she knew him to be so much M. Du Bois' enemy, that she was sure he would prejudice the Justice against him, and endeavour to take away his life. For
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:1259700101:206"/>
my part, I was quite ashamed of being engaged in so ridiculous an affair, and could only think of the absurd appearance we should make upon our arrival at Mr. Tyrell's.
</p>
<p>
When we had been out near two hours, and expected every moment to stop at the place of our destination, I observed that Lady Howard's ser

vant, who attended us on horseback, rode on for

ward till he was out of sight, and soon after re

turning, came up to the chariot-window, and de

livering a note to Madame Duval, said he had met a boy, who was just coming with it to How

ard Grove, from the clerk of Mr. Tyrell.
</p>
<p>
While she was reading it, he rode round to the other window, and, making a sign for secrecy, put into my hand a slip of paper, on which was written,
<q rend="inline">
"Whatever happens, be not alarmed,—for
<hi>you</hi>
are safe,—though you endanger all man

kind!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I readily imagined that Sir Clement must be the author of this note, which prepared me to expect some disagreeable adventure: but I had no time to ponder upon it, for Madame Duval had no sooner read her own letter, than, in an angry tone of voice, she exclaimed,
<q rend="inline">
"Why now what a thing is this! here we're come all this way for nothing!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
She then gave me the note, which informed her, that she need not trouble herself to go to Mr. Tyrell's, as the prisoner had had the address to escape. I congratulated her upon this fortunate incident; but she was so much concerned at having rode so far in vain, that she seemed less pleased than provoked. However, she ordered the man to make what haste he could home, as she hoped,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:1259700101:207"/>
at least to return before the Captain should suspect what had passed.
</p>
<p>
The carriage turned about, and we journeyed so quietly for near an hour, that I began to flatter myself we should be suffered to proceed to How

ard Grove without further molestation, when, suddenly, the footman called out,
<q rend="inline">"John, are we going right?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why I a'n't sure,"</q>
said the coachman,
<q rend="inline">"but I'm afraid we turned wrong."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"What do you mean by that, Sirrah?"</q>
said Madame Duval,
<q rend="inline">
"why if you lose your way we shall be all in the dark."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I think we should turn to the left,"</q>
said the footman.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"To the left!"</q>
answered the other,
<q rend="inline">
"No, no, I'm partly sure we should turn to the right."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You had better make some enquiry,"</q>
said I.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Ma foi,</hi>
"
</q>
cried Madame Duval,
<q rend="inline">
"we're in a fine hole, here!—they neither of them know more than the post. However, I'll tell my Lady, as sure as you're born, so you'd better find the way."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Let's try this lane,"</q>
said the footman.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No,"</q>
said the coachman,
<q rend="inline">
"that's the road to Canterbury; we had best go straight on."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why that's the direct London road,"</q>
return

ed the footman,
<q rend="inline">"and will lead us twenty miles about."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Pardie,</hi>
"
</q>
cried Madame Duval,
<q rend="inline">
"why they won't go one way nor t'other! and, now we're come all this jaunt for nothing, I suppose we sha'n't get home to-night!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Let's go back to the public-house,"</q>
said the footman,
<q rend="inline">"and ask for a guide."</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:1259700101:208"/>
<q rend="inline">"No, no,"</q>
said the other,
<q rend="inline">
"if we stay here a few minutes, somebody or other will pass by; and the horses are almost knocked up already."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Well, I protest,"</q>
cried Madame Duval,
<q rend="inline">
"I'd give a guinea to see them sots both horse-whipped! As sure as I'm alive, they're drunk! Ten to one but they'll overturn us next!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
After much debating, they, at length, agreed to go on, till we came to some inn, or met with a passenger who could direct us. We soon arrived at a small farm-house, and the footman alighted, and went into it.
</p>
<p>
In a few minutes he returned, and told us we might proceed, for that he had procured a directi

on;
<q rend="inline">"But,"</q>
added he,
<q rend="inline">
"it seems there are some thieves hereabouts; and so the best way will be for you to leave your watches and purses with the farmer, who I know very well, and who is an ho

nest man, and a tenant of my Lady's."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Thieves!"</q>
cried Madame Duval, looking aghast,
<q rend="inline">
"the Lord help us!—I've no doubt but we shall be all murdered!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
The farmer came to us, and we gave him all we were worth, and the servants followed our ex

ample. We then proceeded, and Madame Duval's anger so entirely subsided, that, in the mildest manner imaginable, she intreated them to make haste, and promised to tell their Lady how diligent and obliging they had been. She perpetually stop

ped them, to ask if they apprehended any danger; and was, at length, so much overpowered by her fears, that she made the footman fasten his horse to the back of the carriage, and then come and seat himself within it. My endeavours to encou

rage her were fruitless; she sat in the middle, held the man by the arm, and protested that if he did
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:1259700101:209"/>
but save her life, she would make his fortune. Her uneasiness gave me much concern, and it was with the utmost difficulty I forbore to acquaint her that she was imposed upon; but the mutual fear of the Captain's resentment to me, and of her own to him, neither of which would have any moderation, deterred me. As to the footman, he was evidently in torture from restraining his laughter, and I ob

served that he was frequently obliged to make hor

rid grimaces, from pretended fear, in order to con

ceal his risibility.
</p>
<p>
Very soon after,
<q rend="inline">"The robbers are coming!"</q>
cried the coachman.
</p>
<p>
The footman opened the door, and jumped out of the chariot.
</p>
<p>Madame Duval gave a loud scream.</p>
<p>
I could no longer preserve my silence,
<q rend="inline">"For Heaven's sake, my dear Madam,"</q>
said I,
<q rend="inline">
don't be alarmed,—you are in no danger—you are quite safe, there is nothing but—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Here the chariot was stopped, by two men in masks, who, at each side, put in their hands, as if for our purses. Madame Duval sunk to the bot

tom of the chariot, and implored their mercy. I shrieked involuntarily, although prepared for the attack: one of them held me fast, while the other tore poor Madame Duval out of the carriage, in spite of her cries, threats, and resistance.
</p>
<p>
I was really frightened, and trembled exceed

ingly.
<q rend="inline">"My angel!"</q>
cried the man who held me,
<q rend="inline">
"you cannot surely be alarmed,—do you not know me?—I shall hold myself in eternal abhor

rence, if I have really terrified you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Indeed, Sir Clement, you have,"</q>
cried I,—
<q rend="inline">
"but, for Heaven's sake, where is Madame Du

val?—why is she forced away?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:1259700101:210"/>
<q rend="inline">
"She is perfectly safe; the Captain has her in charge: but suffer me now, my adored Miss An

ville, to take the only opportunity that is allowed me, to speak upon another, a much dearer, much sweeter subject."
</q>
</p>
<p>
And then he hastily came into the chariot, and seated himself next to me. I would fain have disen

gaged myself from him, but he would not let me;
<q rend="inline">"Deny me not, most charming of women,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"deny me not this only moment that is lent me, to pour forth my soul into your gentle ears,—to tell you how much I suffer from your absence,—how much I dread your displeasure,—and how cru

elly I am affected by your coldness!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"O Sir, this is no time for such language,—pray leave me, pray go to the relief of Madame Duval,—I cannot bear that she should be treated with such indignity."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"And will you,—can you command my ab

sence?—When may I speak to you, if not now?—does the Captain suffer me to breathe a moment out of his sight?—and are not a thousand imperti
<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>
nent people for ever at your elbow?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Indeed, Sir Clement, you must change your style, or I will not hear you. The
<hi>
impertinent peo

ple
</hi>
you mean, are among my best friends, and you would not, if you really wished me well, speak of them so disrespectfully."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Wish you well!—O, Miss Anville, point but out to me how, in what manner, I may convince you of the fervour of my passion,—tell me but what services you will accept from me, and you shall find my life, my fortune, my whole soul at your devotion."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I want
<hi>nothing,</hi>
Sir, that you can offer;—I beg you not to talk to me so—so strangely. Pray leave me, and pray assure yourself, you cannot take any
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:1259700101:211"/>
method so successless to shew any regard for me, as entering into schemes so frightful to Madame Duval, and so disagreeable to myself."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"The scheme was the Captain's; I even oppo

sed it: though, I own, I could not refuse myself the so-long-wished-for happiness, of speaking to you once more, without so many of—your
<hi>friends</hi>
to watch me. And I had flattered myself that the note I had charged the footman to give you would have prevented the alarm you have received."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Well, Sir, you have now, I hope, said enough; and, if you will not go yourself to see for Madame Duval, at least suffer
<hi>me</hi>
to enquire what is become of her."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"And when may I speak to you again?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No matter when,—I don't know,—perhaps—"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Perhaps what, my angel?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Perhaps
<hi>never,</hi>
Sir,—if you torment me thus."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Never! O Miss Anville, how cruel, how pier

cing to my soul is that icy word!—Indeed, I cannot endure such displeasure."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
Then, Sir, you must not provoke it. Pray leave me directly."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I will, Madam: but let me, at least, make a merit of my obedience,—allow me to hope, that you will, in future, be less averse to trusting your

self for a few moments alone with me."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I was surprized at the freedom of this request; but while I hesitated how to answer it, the other mask came up to the chariot door, and in a voice almost stifled with laughter, said,
<q rend="inline">
"I've done for her! the old buck is safe;—but we must sheer off directly, or we shall be all a-ground."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:1259700101:212"/>
Sir Clement instantly left me, mounted his horse, and rode off. The Captain, having given some directions to the servants, followed him.
</p>
<p>
I was both uneasy and impatient to know the fate of Madame Duval, and immediately got out of the chariot to seek her. I desired the footman to shew me which was she was gone; he pointed with his finger, by way of answer, and I saw that he dared not trust his voice to make any other. I walked on, a very quick pace, and soon, to my great consternation, perceived the poor lady, seated upright in a ditch. I flew to her, with unfeigned concern at her situation. She was sobbing, nay, almost roaring, and in the utmost agony of rage and terror. As soon as she saw me she redoubled her cries, but her voice was so broken, I could not un

derstand a word she said. I was so much shocked, that it was with difficulty I forbore exclaiming against the cruelty of the Captain, for thus wan

tonly ill-treating her; and I could not forgive my

self for having passively suffered the deception. I used my utmost endeavours to comfort her, assuring her of our present safety, and begging her to rise, and return to the chariot.
</p>
<p>
Almost bursting with passion, she pointed to her feet, and with frightful violence, she actually beat the ground with her hands.
</p>
<p>
I then saw, that her feet were tied together with a strong rope, which was fastened to the upper branch of a tree, even with an hedge which ran along the ditch where she sat. I endeavoured to untie the knot, but soon sound it was infinitely be

yond my strength. I was, therefore, obliged to apply to the footman; but being very unwilling to add to his mirth, by the sight of Madame Duval's situation, I desired him to lend me a knife; I
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:1259700101:213"/>
returned with it, and cut the rope. Her feet were soon disentangled, and then, though with great dif

ficulty, I assisted her to rise. But what was my astonishment, when, the moment she was up, she hit me a violent slap on the face! I retreated from her with precipitation and dread, and she then loaded me with reproaches, which, though almost unintelligible, convinced me that she imagined I had voluntarily deserted her; but she seemed not to have the slightest suspicion that she had not been attacked by real robbers.
</p>
<p>
I was so much surprized and confounded at the blow, that, for some time, I suffered her to rave, without making any answer; but her extreme agi

tation, and real suffering, soon dispelled my an

ger, which all turned into compassion. I then told her, that I had been forcibly detained from following her, and assured her of my real sorrow at her ill usage.
</p>
<p>
She began to be somewhat appeased; and I again entreated her to return to the carriage, or give me leave to order that it should draw up to the place where we stood. She made no answer, till I told her, that the longer we remained still, the greater would be the danger of our ride home. Struck with this hint, she suddenly, and with hasty steps, moved forward.
</p>
<p>
Her dress was in such disorder, that I was quite sorry to have her figure exposed to the servants, who all of them, in imitation of their master, hold her in derision: however, the disgrace was unavoidable.
</p>
<p>
The ditch, happily, was almost quite dry, or she must have suffered still more severely; yet, so forlorn, so miserable a figure, I never before saw. Her head-dress had fallen off; her linen was torn;
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:1259700101:214"/>
her negligee had not a pin left in it; her petticoats she was obliged to hold on; and her shoes were perpetually slipping off. She was covered with dirt, weeds, and filth, and her face was really horrible, for the pomatum and powder from her head, and the dust from the road, were quite
<hi>pasted</hi>
on her skin by her tears, which, with her
<hi>rouge,</hi>
made so frightful a mixture, that she hardly looked hu

man.
</p>
<p>
The servants were ready to die with laughter, the moment they saw her; but not all my remon

strances could prevail upon her to get into the car

riage, till she had most vehemently reproached them both, for not rescuing her. The footman, fixing his eyes on the ground, as if fearful of again trusting himself to look at her, protested that the robbers had vowed they would shoot him, if he moved an inch, and that one of them had stay

ed to watch the chariot, while the other carried her off; adding, that the reason of their behaving so barbarously, was to revenge our having secured our purses. Notwithstanding her anger, she gave immediate credit to what he said, and really ima

gined that her want of money had irritated the pretended robbers to treat her with such cruelty. I determined, therefore, to be carefully upon my guard, not to betray the imposition, which could now answer no other purpose, than occasioning an irreparable breach between her and the Captain.
</p>
<p>
Just as we were seated in the chariot, she dis

covered the loss which her head had sustained, and called out,
<q rend="inline">
"My God! what is become of my hair?—why the villain has stole all my curls!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
She then ordered the man to run and see if he could find any of them in the ditch. He went, and presently returning, produced a great quantity
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:1259700101:215"/>
of hair, in such a nasty condition, that I was amazed she would take it; and the man as he de

livered it to her, found it impossible to keep his countenance; which she had no sooner observed, than all her stormy passions were again raised. She flung the battered curls in his face, saying,
<q rend="inline">
"Sirrah, what do you grin for? I wish you'd been served so yourself, and you would n't have found it no such joke: you are the impudentest fellow ever I see, and if I find you dare grin at me any more, I shall make no ceremony of boxing your ears."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Satisfied with the threat, the man hastily retired, and we drove on.
</p>
<p>
Her anger now subsiding into grief, she began most sorrowfully to lament her case.
<q rend="inline">"I believe,</q>
she cried,
<q rend="inline">
"never nobody was so unlucky as I am! and so here, because I ha'n't had misfortunes enough already, that puppy has made me lose my curls!—Why, I can't see nobody without them:—only look at me,—I was never so bad off in my life before.
<hi>Pardie,</hi>
if I'd know'd as much, I'd have brought two or three sets with me: but I'd never a thought of such a thing as this."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Finding her now somewhat pacified, I ventured to ask an account of her adventure, which I will endeavour to write in her own words.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why, child, all this misfortune comes of that puppy making us leave our money behind us; for as soon as the robber see I did not put nothing in his hands, he lugged me out of the chariot, by main force, and I verily thought he'd have mur

dered me. He was as strong as a lion; I was no more in his hands than a child. But I believe never nobody was so abused before, for he dragged me down the road, pulling and hawling me all the way, as if I'd no more feeling than a horse. I'm sure I
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:1259700101:216"/>
wish I could see that man cut up and quartered alive! however, he'll come to the gallows, that's one good thing. So, as soon as we'd got out of sight of the chariot,—though he need n't have been afraid, for if he'd beat me to a mummy, those cowardly fellows would n't have said nothing to it.—So, when I was got there, what does he do, but, all of a sudden, he takes me by both the shoulders, and he gives me such a shake!—
<hi>Mon Dieu!</hi>
I shall never forget it, if I live to be an hundred. I'm sure I dare say I'm out of joint all over. And, though I made as much noise as ever I could, he took no more notice of it than nothing at all, but there he stood, shaking me in that man

ner, as if he was doing it for a wager. I'm de

termined, if it costs me all my fortune, I'll see that villain hanged. He shall be found out, if there's e're a justice in England. So when he had shooked me till he was tired, and I felt all over like a jelly, without saying never a word, he takes and pops me into the ditch! I'm sure I thought he'd have murdered me, as sure as I ever thought any thing in my life, for he kept bumping me about, as if he thought nothing too bad for me. However, I'm resolved I'll never leave my purse behind me again, the longest day I have to live. So when he could n't stand over me no longer, he holds out his hands again for my money; but he was as cunning as he could be, for he would n't speak a word, because I should n't swear to his voice; however, that sha'nt save him, for I'll swear to him any day in the year, if I can but catch him. So, when I told him I had no money, he fell to jerking me again, just as if he had but that moment begun! And, after that he got me close by a tree, and out of his pocket he pulls a
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:1259700101:217"/>
great cord!—It's a wonder I did not swoon away, for as sure as you're alive, he was going to hang me to that tree. I screamed like any thing mad, and told him if he would but spare my life, I'd never prosecute him, nor tell nobody what he'd done to me: so he stood some time quite in a brown study, a thinking what he should do. And so, after that, he forced me to sit down in the ditch, and he tied my feet together, just as you see them, and then, as if he had not done enough, he twitched off my cap, and, without saying no

thing, got on his horse, and left me in that con

dition, thinking, I suppose, that I might lie there and perish."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Though this narrative almost compelled me to laugh, yet I was really irritated with the Captain, for carrying his love of tormenting,—
<hi>sport,</hi>
he calls it,—to such barbarous and unjustifiable ex

tremes. I consoled and soothed her as well as I was able, and told her that, since M. Du Bois had escaped, I hoped, when she recovered from her fright, all would end well.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Fright, child!"</q>
repeated she,
<q rend="inline">
"why, that's not half;—I promise you, I wish it was; but here I'm bruised from top to toe, and it's well if ever I have the right use of my limbs again. How

ever, I'm glad the villain got nothing but his trouble for his pains. But here the worst is to come, for I can't go out, because I have got no curls, and so he'll be escaped, before I can get to the Justice to stop him. I'm resolved I'll tell Lady Howard how her man served me, for if he had'nt made me fling 'em away, I dare say I could have pinned them up well enough for the country."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Perhaps Lady Howard may be able to lend you a cap that will wear without them."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:1259700101:218"/>
<q rend="inline">
"Lady Howard, indeed! why, do you think I'd wear one of her dowdies? No, I'll promise you, I sha'nt put on no such disguisement. It's the unluckiest thing in the world that I did not make the man pick up the curls again; but he put me in such a passion, I could not think of nothing. I know I can't get none at Howard Grove for love nor money, for of all the stupid places ever I see, that Howard Grove is the worst! there's never no getting nothing one wants."
</q>
</p>
<p>
This sort of conversation lasted till we arrived at our journey's end; and then, a new distress occurred; Madame Duval was eager to speak to Lady Howard and Mrs. Mirvan, and to relate her misfortunes, but she could not endure that Sir Clement or the Captain should see her in such disor

der, for she said they were so ill-natured, that in

stead of pitying her, they would only make a jest of her disasters. She therefore sent me first into the house, to wait for an opportunity of their being out of the way, that she might steal up stairs un

observed. In this I succeeded, as the gentlemen thought it most prudent not to seem watching for her; though they both contrived to divert them

selves with peeping at her as she passed.
</p>
<p>
She went immediately to bed, where she had her supper. Lady Howard and Mrs. Mirvan both of them very kindly sat with her, and listened to her tale with compassionate attention; while Miss Mirvan and I retired to our own room, where I was very glad to end the troubles of the day in a comfortable conversation.
</p>
<p>
The Captain's raptures, during supper, at the success of his plan, were boundless. I spoke, afterwards, to Mrs. Mirvan, with the openness which her kindness encourages, and begged her to
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:1259700101:219"/>
remonstrate with him upon the cruelty of torment

ing Madame Duval so causelessly. She promised to take the first opportunity of starting the subject, but said he was at present, so much elated that he would not listen to her with any patience. How

ever should he make any new efforts to molest her, I can by no means consent to be passive. Had I imagined he would have been so violent, I would have risked his anger in her defence much sooner.
</p>
<p>
She has kept her bed all day, and declares she is almost bruised to death.
</p>
<p>
Adieu, dear Sir. What a long letter have I written! I could almost fancy I sent it you from London!
</p>
</div>
<div n="34" type="letter">

<p>
THIS insatiable Captain, if left to himself, would not, I believe, rest, till he had tormented Madame Duval into a fever. He seems to have no de

light but in terrifying or provoking her, and all his thoughts apparently turn upon inventing such me

thods as may do it most effectually.
</p>
<p>
She had her breakfast again in bed yesterday morning; but during ours, the Captain with a very significant look at Sir Clement, gave us to understand, that he thought she had now rested long enough to bear the hardships of a fresh cam

paign.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:1259700101:220"/>
His meaning was obvious, and, therefore, I re

solved to endeavour immediately to put a stop to his intended exploits. When breakfast was over, I followed Mrs. Mirvan out of the parlour, and begged her to lose no time in pleading the cause of Madame Duval with the Captain.
<q rend="inline">"My love,"</q>
answered she,
<q rend="inline">
I have already expostulated with him; but all I can say is fruitless, while his fa

vourite Sir Clement contrives to urge him on."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Then I will go and speak to Sir Clement,"</q>
said I,
<q rend="inline">"for I know he will desist, if I request him."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Have a care, my dear,"</q>
said she, smiling,
<q rend="inline">
"it is sometimes dangerous to make requests to men, who are too desirous of receiving them."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Well then, my dear Madam, will you give me leave to speak myself to the Captain?
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Willingly; nay, I will accompany you to him."</q>
</p>
<p>
I thanked her, and we went to seek him. He was walking in the garden with Sir Clement. Mrs. Mirvan most obligingly made anopening for my pur

pose, by saying,
<q rend="inline">"Mr. Mirvan, I have brought a petitioner with me."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why, what's the matter now?"</q>
cried he.
</p>
<p>
I was fearful of making him angry, and stam

mered very much, when I told him, I hoped he had no new plan for alarming Madame Duval.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>New</hi>
plan!"
</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"why, you don't sup

pose the
<hi>old</hi>
one would do again, do you? Not but what it was a very good one, only I doubt she would n't bite."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Indeed, Sir,</q>
said I,
<q rend="inline">
"she has already suf

fered too much, and I hope you will pardon me, if I take the liberty of telling you, that I think it
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:1259700101:221"/>
my duty to do all in my power to prevent her being again so much terrified."
</q>
</p>
<p>
A sullen gloominess instantly clouded his face, and, turning short from me, he said, I might do as I pleased, but that I should much sooner repent than repair my officiousness.
</p>
<p>
I was too much disconcerted at this rebuff, to attempt making any answer, and, finding that Sir Clement warmly espoused my cause, I walked away, and left them to discuss the point together.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Mirvan, who never speaks to the Captain when he is out of humour, was glad to follow me, and, with her usual sweetness, made a thousand apologies for her husband's ill-manners.
</p>
<p>
When I left her, I went to Madame Duval, who was just risen, and employed in examining the cloaths she had on the day of her ill usage.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Here's a sight! cried she. Come here, child,—only look—
<hi>Pardie,</hi>
so long as I've lived, I never see so much before! Why all my things are spoilt, and, what's worse, my sacque was as good as new. Here's the second negligee I've used in this man

ner!—I am sure I was a fool to put it on, in such a lonesome place as this; however, if I stay here these ten years, I'll never put on another good gown, that I'm resolved."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Will you let the maid try if she can iron it out, or clean it, Ma'am?
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"No, she'll only make bad worse.—But look here, now, here's a cloak!
<hi>Mon Dieu!</hi>
why it looks like a dish-clout! Of all the unluckinesses that ever I met, this is the worst! for, do you know, I bought it but the day before I left Paris?—Besides, into the bargain, my cap's quite gone; where the villain twitched it, I don't know, but I see no more of it from that time to this Now you
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:1259700101:222"/>
must know this was the becomingest cap I had in the world, for I've never another with pink ribbon in it; and, to tell you the truth, if I had n't thought to have seen M. Du Bois, I'd no more have put it on than I'd have flown; for as to what one wears in such a stupid place as this, it signifies no more than nothing at all."
</q>
</p>
<p>
She then told me, that she had been thinking all night of a contrivance to hinder the Captain's finding out her loss of curls; which was, having a large gauze handkerchief pinned on her head as a hood, and saying she had the tooth-ach.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"To tell you the truth,"</q>
added she,
<q rend="inline">
"I be

lieve that Captain is one of the worst men in the world; he's always making a joke of me; and as to his being a gentleman, he has no more manners than a bear, for he's always upon the grin when one's in distress, and, I declare, I'd rather be done any thing to than laughed at, for, to my mind, it's one or other the disagreeablest thing in the world."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Mirvan, I found, had been endeavouring to dissuade her from the design she had formed, of having recourse to the law, in order to find out the supposed robbers; for she dreads a discovery of the Captain, during Madame Duval's stay at Howard Grove, as it could not fail being productive of in

finite commotion. She has, therefore, taken great pains to shew the inutility of applying to justice, unless she were more able to describe the offen

ders against whom she would appear, and has as

sured her, that as she neither heard their voices, nor saw their faces, she cannot possibly swear to their persons, or obtain any redress.
</p>
<p>
Madame Duval, in telling me this, extremely lamented her hard fate, that she was thus pre

vented
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:1259700101:223"/>
from revenging her injuries; which, how

ever, she vowed she would not be persuaded to
<hi>pocket tamely,</hi>
<q rend="inline">"because,"</q>
added she,
<q rend="inline">
"if such vil

lains as these are let to have their own way, and nobody takes no notice of their impudence, they'll make no more ado than nothing at all of tying people in ditches, and such things as that: however, I shall consult with M. Du Bois, as soon I can ferret out where he's hid himself. I'm sure I've a right to his advice, for it's all along of his gaping about at the Tower that I've met with these misfor

tunes."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"M. Du Bois, said I, will, I am sure, be very sorry when he hears what has happened."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"And what good will that do now?—that won't unspoil all my cloaths; I can tell him, I a'n't much obliged to him, though it's no fault of his;—yet it i'n't the less provokinger for that. I'm sure, if he had been there, to have seen me served in that manner, and put neck and heels into a ditch, he'd no more have thought it was me, than the Pope of Rome. I'll promise you, what

ever you may think of it, I sha'n't have no rest, night nor day, till I find out that rogue."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I have no doubt, Madam, but you will soon discover him."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Pardie,</hi>
if I do, I'll hang him, as sure as fate!—but what's the oddest, is that he should take such a 'special spite against
<hi>me,</hi>
above all the rest! it was as much for nothing, as could be, for I don't know what I have done, so particular bad, to be used in that manner: I'm sure, I had n't given him no of

fence, as I know of, for I never see his face all the time; and as to screaming a little, I think it's very hard if one must n't do such a thing as that, when one's put in fear of one's life."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:1259700101:224"/>
During this conversation, she endeavoured to ad

just her head-dress, but could not at all please her

self. Indeed, had I not been present, I should have thought it impossible for a woman at her time of life to be so very difficult in regard to dress. What she may have in view, I cannot imagine, but the labour of the toilette seems the chief business of her life.
</p>
<p>
When I left her, in my way down stairs, I met with Sir Clement, who, with great earnestness, said he must not be denied the honour of a mo

ment's conversation with me; and then, without waiting for an answer, he led me to the garden, at the door of which, however, I absolutely insisted upon stopping.
</p>
<p>
He seemed very serious, and said, in a very grave tone of voice,
<q rend="inline">
"At length, Miss Anville, I flat

ter myself that I have hit upon an expedient that will oblige you, and therefore, though it is death to myself, I will put it in practice."
</q>
</p>
<p>I begged him to explain himself.</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I saw your desire of saving Madame Duval, and scarce could I refrain giving the brutal Captain my real opinion of his savage conduct; but I am unwilling to quarrel with him, lest I should be de

nied entrance into a house which you inhabit: I have been endeavouring to prevail with him to give up his absurd new scheme, but I find him im

penetrable;—I have therefore determined to make a pretence for suddenly leaving this place, dear as it is to me, and containing all I most admire and adore;—and I will stay in town till the violence of this boobyish humour is abated."
</q>
</p>
<p>
He ssopped; but I was silent, for I knew not what I ought to say. He took my hand, which he pressed to his lips, saying,
<q rend="inline">
"And must I, then,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:1259700101:225"/>
Miss Anville, must I quit you—sacrifice voluntarily my greatest felicity,—and yet not be honoured with one word, one look of approbation?"—
</q>
</p>
<p>
I withdrew my hand, and said, with a half laugh,
<q rend="inline">
"You know so well, Sir Clement, the value of the favours you confer, that it would be superflu

ous for me to point it out."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Charming, charming girl! how does your wit, your understanding rise upon me daily! and must I, can I part with you?—will no other me

thod—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"O Sir, do you so soon repent the good office you had planned for Madame Duval?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"For Madame Duval!—cruel creature, and will you not even suffer me to place to your account the sacrifice I am about to make?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"You must place it, Sir, to what account you please; but I am too much in haste now to stay here any longer."
</q>
</p>
<p>
And then I would have left him, but he held me, and, rather impatiently, said,
<q rend="inline">
"If, then, I cannot be so happy as to oblige
<hi>you,</hi>
Miss Anville, you must not be surprised, should I seek to oblige myself. If my scheme is not honoured with your approbation, for which alone it was formed, why should I, to my own infinite dissatisfaction, pur

sue it?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
We were then, for a few minutes, both silent; I was really unwilling he should give up a plan, which would so effectually break into the Captain's designs, and, at the same time, save me the pain of disobliging him; and I should instantly and thankfully have accepted his offered civility, had not Mrs. Mirvan's caution made me fearful. How

ever, when he pressed me to speak, I said, in an ironical voice,
<q rend="inline">
"I had thought, Sir, that the very
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:1259700101:226"/>
strong sense you have yourself of the favour you propose to me, would sufficiently have repaid you, but, as I was mistaken, I must thank you myself. And now,"
</q>
making a low courtesy,
<q rend="inline">"I hope, Sir, you are satisfied."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Loveliest of thy sex—"</q>
he began, but I for

ced myself from him, and ran up stairs.
</p>
<p>
Soon after, Miss Mirvan told me that Sir Cle

ment had just received a letter, which obliged him instantly to leave the Grove, and that he had actually ordered a chaise. I then acquainted her with the real state of the affair. Indeed, I con

ceal nothing from her, she is so gentle and sweet

tempered, that it gives me great pleasure to place an entire confidence in her.
</p>
<p>
At dinner, I must own, we all missed him; for though the flightiness of his behaviour to me, when we are by ourselves, is very distressing, yet, in large companies, and general conversation, he is ex

tremely entertaining and agreeable. As to the Captain, he has been so much chagrined at his de

parture, that he has scarce spoken a word since he went: but Madame Duval, who made her first pub

lic appearance since her accident, was quite in rap

tures that she escaped seeing him.
</p>
<p>
The money which we left at the farm-house, has been returned to us. What pains the Captain must have taken to arrange and manage the adven

tures which he chose we should meet with! Yet he must certainly be discovered, for Madame Du

val is already very much perplexed, at having re

ceived a letter this morning from M. Du Bois, in which he makes no mention of his imprisonment. However, she has so little suspicion, that she im

putes his silence upon the subject, to his fears that the letter might be intercepted.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:1259700101:227"/>
Not one opportunity could I meet with, while Sir Clement was here, to enquire after his friend Lord Orville: but I think it was strange he should never mention him unasked. Indeed, I rather won

der that Mrs. Mirvan herself did not introduce the subject, for she always seemed particularly atten

tive to him.
</p>
<p>
And now, once more, all my thoughts involun

tarily turn upon the letter I so soon expect from Pa

ris. This visit of Sir Clement has, however, somewhat diverted my fears, and therefore I am ve

ry glad he made it at this time. Adieu, my dear Sir.

<p>
I Have this moment the honour of your Lady

<p>
It seldom happens that a man, though extolled as a saint, is really without blemish; or that another, though reviled as a devil, is really with

</p>

As to the young Lady, whom Mr. Villars so obligingly proposes presenting to me, I wish her all the happiness to which, by your Ladyship's account, she seems entitled; and if she has a third

<p>
WELL, my dear Sir, all is now over! the letter so anxiously expected, is at length arrived, and my doom is fixed. The various feelings which oppress me, I have not language to describe; nor need I,—you know my heart, you have yourself formed it,—and its sensations upon this occasion, you may but too readily imagine
</p>
<p>
Outcast as I am; and rejected for ever by him to whom I of right belong,—shall I now implore
<hi>your</hi>
continual protection?—no, no,—I will not offend your generous heart (which, open to distress, has no wish but to relieve it) with an application that would seem to imply a doubt. I am more secure than ever of your kindness, since you now know upon that is my sole dependance.
</p>
<p>
I endeavour to bear this stroke with composure, and in such a manner as if I had already received your counsel and consolation. Yet, at times, my
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:1259700101:229"/>
emotions are almost too much for me. O Sir, what a letter for a parent to write! must I not myself be deaf to the voice of Nature, if I could endure to be thus absolutely abandoned, without regret? I dare not, even to you, nor would I, could I help it, to myself, acknowledge all that I think; for, indeed, I have, sometimes, sentiments upon this rejection, which my strongest sense of duty can scarcely correct. Yet, suffer me to ask,—might not this answer have been softened?—was it not enough to disclaim me for ever, without treating me with contempt, and wounding me with de

rision?
</p>
<p>
But, while I am thus thinking of myself, I for

get how much more
<hi>he</hi>
is the object of sorrow, than I am! Alas, what amends can he make him

self, for the anguish he is hoarding up for time to come! My heart bleeds for him, whenever this re

flection occurs to me.
</p>
<p>
What is said of
<hi>you,</hi>
my protector, my friend, my benefactor!—I dare not trust myself to com

ment upon. Gracious Heaven! what a return for goodness so unparalleled!
</p>
<p>
I would fain endeavour to divert my thoughts from this subject, but even that is not in my pow

er; for, afflicting as this letter is to me, I find that it will not be allowed to conclude the affair, though it does all my expectations: for Madame Duval has determined not to let it rest here. She heard the letter in great wrath, and protested she would not be so easily answered; she regretted her faci

lity, in having been prevailed upon to yield the di

rection of this affair to those who knew not how to manage it, and vowed she would herself undertake and conduct it in future.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:1259700101:230"/>
It is in vain that I have pleaded against her reso

lution, and besought her to forbear an attack, where she has nothing to expect but resentment; especi

ally as there seems to be a hint, that Lady Howard will one day be more openly dealt with: she will not hear me; she is furiously bent upon a project which is terrible to think of,—for she means to go go herself to Paris, take me with her, and there,
<hi>face to face,</hi>
demand justice!
</p>
<p>
How to appease or to persuade her, I know not; but for the universe would I not be dragged, in such a manner, to an interview so awful, with a parent I have never yet beheld!
</p>
<p>
Lady Howard and Mrs. Mirvan are both of them infinitely shocked at the present situation of affairs, and they seem to be even more kind to me than ever; and my dear Maria, who is the friend of my heart, uses her utmost efforts to console me, and, when she fails in her design, with still greater kind

ness, she sympathises in my sorrow.
</p>
<p>
I very much rejoice, however, that Sir Clement Willoughby had left us before this letter arrived. I am sure the general confusion of the house would, otherwise, have betrayed to him the whole of a tale which I now, more than ever, wish to have buried in oblivion.
</p>
<p>
Lady Howard thinks I ought not to disoblige Madame Duval, yet she acknowledges the impropri

ety of my accompanying her abroad upon such an enterprize. Indeed I would rather die, than force myself into his presence. But so vehement is Ma

dame Duval, that she would instantly have com

pelled me to attend her to town, in her way to Paris, had not Lady Howard so far exerted herself, as to declare she could by no means consent to my
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:1259700101:231"/>
quitting her house, till she gave me up to you, by whose permission I had entered it.
</p>
<p>
She was extremely angry at this denial; and the Captain, by his sneers and raillery, so much en

creased her rage, that she has positively declared, should your next letter dispute her authority to guide me by her own pleasure, she will, without hesitation, make a journey to Berry Hill, and
<hi>teach you to know who she is.</hi>
</p>
<p>
Should she put this threat in execution, nothing could give me greater uneasiness, for her violence and volubility would almost distract you.
</p>
<p>
Unable as I am to act for myself, or to judge what conduct I ought to pursue, how grateful do I feel myself, that I have such a guide and direc

tor to counsel and instruct me as yourself!

<p>
LET not my Evelina be depressed by a stroke of fortune for which she is not responsible. No breach of duty on your part, has incurred the unkind

ness which has been shewn you, nor have you, by any act of imprudence, provoked either censure or reproach. Let me entreat you, therefore, my dearest child, to support yourself with that cou

rage
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:1259700101:232"/>
which your innocency ought to inspire; and let all the affliction you allow yourself, be for him only, who not having that support, must one day be but too severely sensible how much he wants it.
</p>
<p>
The hint thrown out concerning myself, is wholly unintelligible to me: my heart, I dare own, fully acquits me of vice, but
<hi>without blemish,</hi>
I have never ventured to pronounce myself. How

ever, it seems his intention to be hereafter more explicit, and
<hi>then,</hi>
—should any thing appear, that has, on
<hi>my</hi>
part, contributed to those misfortunes we lament, let me, at least, say, that the most partial of my friends cannot be so much astonished as I shall myself be, at such a discovery.
</p>
<p>
The mention, also, of any
<hi>future applications</hi>
I may make, is equally beyond my comprehension. But I will not dwell upon a subject which almost compels from me reflections that cannot but be wounding to a heart so formed for filial tenderness as my Evelina's. There is an air of mystery throughout the letter, the explanation of which I will await in silence.
</p>
<p>
The scheme of Madame Duval is such as might be reasonably expected from a woman so little inured to disappointment, and so totally incapable of considering the delicacy of your situation. Your averseness to her plan gives me pleasure, for it exactly corresponds with my own. Why will she not make the journey she projects by herself? She would not have even the wish of an opposition to encounter. And then, once more, might my child and myself be left to the quiet enjoyment of that peaceful happiness, which she alone has inter

rupted. As to her coming hither, I could, indeed, dispense with such a visit; but, if she will not be
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:1259700101:233"/>
satisfied with my refusal by letter, I must submit to the task of giving it her in person.
</p>
<p>
My impatience for your return is encreased by your account of Sir Clement Willoughby's visit to Howard Grove. I am but little surprized at the perseverance of his assiduities to interest you in his favour; but I am very much hurt that you should be exposed to addresses, which, by their privacy, have an air that shocks me. You cannot, my love, be too circumspect; the slightest carelessness on your part, will be taken advantage of, by a man of his disposition. It is not sufficient for you to be reserved; his conduct even calls for your resent

ment: and should he again, as will doubtless be his endeavour, contrive to solicit your favour in private, let your disdain and displeasure be so marked, as to constrain a change in his behaviour. Though, indeed, should his visit be repeated while you remain at the Grove, Lady Howard must pardon me if I shorten your's.
</p>
<p>
Adieu, my child. You will always make my respects to the hospitable family to which we are so much obliged.

Berry-Hill,

<salute>Dear Madam,</salute>
</opener>
<p>
I BELIEVE your Ladyship will not be surprized at hearing I have had a visit from Madame Duval, as I doubt not her having made known her inten

tion before she left Howard Grove. I would gladly
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:1259700101:234"/>
have excused myself this meeting, could I have avoided it decently; but, after so long a journey, it was not possible to refuse her admittance.
</p>
<p>
She told me, that she came to Berry Hill, in consequence of a letter I had sent to her grand

daughter, in which I had forbid her going to Pa

ris. Very roughly, she then called me to account for the authority which I assumed! and, had I been disposed to have argued with her, she would very angrily have disputed the right by which I used it. But I declined all debating. I therefore listened very quietly, till she had so much fatigued herself with talking, that she was glad, in her turn, to be silent. And then I begged to know the pur

port of her visit.
</p>
<p>
She answered, that she came to make me re

linquish the power I had usurped over her grand

daughter, and assured me she would not quit the place till she succeeded.
</p>
<p>
But I will not trouble your Ladyship with the particulars of this disagreeable conversation; nor should I, but on account of the result, have cho

sen so unpleasant a subject for your perusal. How

ever, I will be as concise as I possibly can, that the better occupations of your ladyship's time may be the less impeded.
</p>
<p>
When she found me inexorable in refusing Eve

lina's attending her to Paris, she peremptorily in

sisted, that she should, at least, live with her in London, till Sir John Belmont's return. I re

monstrated against this scheme with all the energy in my power; but the contest was vain; she lost her patience, and I my time. She declared that if I was resolute in opposing her, she would instantly make a will, in which she would leave all her
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:1259700101:235"/>
fortune to strangers, though, otherwise, she in

tended her grand-daughter for her sole heiress.
</p>
<p>
To me, I own, this threat seemed of little consequence; I have long accustomed myself to think, that, with a competency, of which she is sure, my child might be as happy as in the posses

sion of millions: but the incertitude of her future fate, deters me from following implicitly the dic

tates of my present judgment. The connections she may hereafter form, the style of life for which she may be destined, and the future family to which she may belong, are considerations which give but too much weight to the menaces of Ma

dame Duval. In short, Madam, after a discourse infinitely tedious, I was obliged, though very re

luctantly, to compromise with this ungovernable woman, by consenting that Evelina should pass one month with her.
</p>
<p>
I never made a concession with so bad a grace, or so much regret. The violence and vulgarity of this woman, her total ignorance of propriety, the family to which she is related, and the compa

ny she is likely to keep, are objections so forcible to her having the charge of this dear child, that nothing less than my diffidence of the right I have of depriving her of so large a fortune, would have induced me to listen to her proposal. Indeed we parted, at last, equally discontented, she, at what I had refused, I, at what I had granted.
</p>
<p>
It now only remains for me to return your Lady

ship my humble acknowledgments for the kind

ness which you have so liberally shewn to my ward, and to beg you would have the goodness to part with her, when Madame Duval thinks proper
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:1259700101:236"/>

<p>
WITH a reluctance which occasions me inex

pressible uneasiness, I have been almost compelled to consent that my Evelina should quit the protection of the hospitable and respectable Lady Howard, and accompany Madame Duval to a city to which I had hoped she had bid an eternal adieu. But alas, my dear child, we are the slaves of custom, the dupes of prejudice, and dare not stem the torrent of an opposing world, even though our judgments con

demn our compliance! however, since the die is cast, we must endeavour to make the best of it.
</p>
<p>
You will have occasion, in the course of the month you are to pass with Madame Duval, for all the circumspection and prudence you can call to your aid: she will not, I know, propose any thing to you which she thinks wrong herself; but you must learn not only to

You cannot too assiduously attend to Madame Duval herself; but I would wish you to mix as lit

<p>
ONCE more, my dearest Sir, I write to you from this great city. Yesterday morning, with the truest concern, I quitted the dear inhabitants of Howard Grove, and most impatiently shall I count the days till I see them again. Lady Howard and Mrs. Mirvan took leave of me with the most flatter

ing kindness; but indeed I knew not how to part with Maria, whose own apparent sorrow redoubled mine. She made me promise to send her a letter every post. And I shall write to her with the same fre
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
<desc>••</desc>
</gap>
om, and almost the same confidence, you allow me to make use of to yourself.
</p>
<p>
The Captain was very civil to me, but he wrangled with poor Madame Duval to the last mo

ment; and, taking me aside, just before we got into the chaise, he said,
<q rend="inline">
"Hark'ee, Miss Anville, I've a favour for to ask of you, which is this; that you will write us word how the old gentlewoman finds herself, when she sees it was all a trick; and
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:1259700101:238"/>
what the French lubber says to it, and all about it."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I answered that I would obey him, though I was very little pleased with the commission, which, to me, was highly improper: but he will either treat me as an
<hi>informer,</hi>
or make me a party in his frolic.
</p>
<p>
As soon as we drove away, Madame Duval, with much satisfaction, exclaimed
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Dieu merci,</hi>
we've got off at last! I'm sure I never desire to see that place again. It's a wonder I've got away alive; for I believe I've had the worst luck ever was known, from the time I set my foot upon the threshold. I know I wish I'd never a gone. Besides, into the bargain, it's the most dullest place in all Christen

dom: there's never no diversions, nor nothing at all."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Then she bewailed M. Du Bois, concerning whose adventures she continued to make various conjectures during the rest of our journey.
</p>
<p>
When I asked her what part of London she should reside in, she told me that Mr. Branghton was to meet us at an inn, and would conduct us to a lodging. Accordingly, we proceeded to a house in Bishopsgate-street, and were led by a waiter in

to a room where we found Mr. Branghton.
</p>
<p>
He received us very civilly, but seemed rather surprised at seeing me, saying
<q rend="inline">
"Why I did n't think of your bringing Miss; however she's very welcome."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I'll tell you how it was,"</q>
said Madame Duval;
<q rend="inline">
"you must know I've a mind to take the girl to Paris, that she may see something of the world, and improve herself a little; besides, I've another rea

son, that you and I will talk more about; but do you know, that meddling old parson as I told you of,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
<desc>•…</desc>
</gap>
ould not let her go: however, I'm resolved I'll
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:1259700101:239"/>
be even with him, for I shall take her on with me, without saying never a word more to nobody."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I started at this intimation, which very much surprised me. But I am very glad she has discover

ed her intention, as I shall be carefully upon my guard not to venture from town with her.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Branghton then hoped we had passed our time agreeably in the country.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O Lord, Cousin,"</q>
cried she,
<q rend="inline">
"I've been the miserablest creature in the world! I'm sure all the horses in London shan't drag me into the country again of one while: why how do you think I've been served?—only guess."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Indeed, Cousin, I can't pretend to do that."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why then I'll tell you. Do you know, I've been robbed!—that is, the villain would have robbed me if he could, only I'd secured all my money."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why then, Cousin, I think your loss can't have been very great."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"O Lord, you don't know what you're a say

ing; you're talking in the unthinkingest manner in the world: why it was all along of not having no money, that I met with that misfortune."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"How's that, Cousin? I don't see what great misfortune you can have met with, if you'd se

cured all your money."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"That's because you don't know nothing of the matter; for there the villain came to the chaise, and because we had n't got nothing to give him, though he'd no more right to our money than the man in the moon, yet, do you know, he fell into the greatest passion ever you see, and abused me in such a manner, and put me in a ditch, and got a rope, o' purpose to hang me,—and I'm sure, if that was n't misfortune enough, why I don't know what is."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:1259700101:240"/>
<q rend="inline">
"This is a hard case, indeed, Cousin. But why don't you go to justice Fielding?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"O, as to that, I'm a going to him directly; but only I want first to see poor M. Du Bois, for the oddest thing of all is, that he has wrote to me, and never said nothing of where he is, nor what's become of him, nor nothing else."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"M. Du Bois! why he's at my house at this very time."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"M. Du Bois at your house! well, I declare this is the surprisingest part of all! however, I as

sure you, I think he might have comed for me, as well as you, considering what I have gone through on his account; for, to tell you the truth, it was all along of him that I met with that accident; so I don't take it very kind of him, I promise you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Well but, Cousin, tell me some of the par

ticulars of this affair."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"As to the particulars, I'm sure they'd make your hair stand an end to hear them; however, the beginning of it all was thro' the fault of M. Du Bois: but, I'll assure you, he may take care of himself in future, since he don't so much as come to see if I'm dead or alive;—but there I went for him to a justice of peace, and rode all out of the way, and did every thing in the world, and was used worser than a dog, and all for the sake of serv

ing him, and now, you see, he don't so much—well, I was a fool for my pains,—however, he may get somebody else to be treated so another time, for if he's taken up every day in the week, I'll never go after him no more."
</q>
</p>
<p>
This occasioned an explanation, in the course of which, Madame Duval, to her utter amazement, heard that M. Du Bois had never left London dur

ing her absence! nor did Mr. Branghton believe
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:1259700101:241"/>
that he had ever been to the Tower, or met with any kind of accident.
</p>
<p>
Almost instantly, the whole truth of the tran

saction seemed to
<hi>rush upon her mind,</hi>
and her wrath was inconceivably violent. She asked me a thou

sand questions in a breath, but, fortunately, was too vehement to attend to my embarrassment, which must, otherwise, have betrayed my know

ledge of the deceit. Revenge was her first wish, and she vowed she would go the next morning to Justice Fielding, and enquire what punishment she might lawfully inflict upon the Captain for his assault.
</p>
<p>
I believe we were an hour in Bishopsgate-street, ere poor Madame Duval could allow any thing to be mentioned but her own story; at length, how

ever, Mr. Branghton told her, that M. Du Bois, and all his own family, were waiting for her at his house. A hackney-coach was then called, and we proceeded to Snow-hill.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Branghton's house is small and inconveni

ent, though his shop, which takes in all the ground floor, is large and commodious. I believe I told you before that he is a silver-smith.
</p>
<p>
We were conducted up two pair of stairs, for the dining-room, Mr. Branghton told us, was
<hi>let.</hi>
His two daughters, their brother, M. Du Bois, and a young man, were at tea. They had waited some time for Madame Duval, but I found they had not any expectation that I should accompany her; and the young ladies, I believe, were rather more surprised than pleased when I made my ap

pearance; for they seemed hurt that I should see their apartment. Indeed I would willingly have saved them that pain, had it been in my power.
</p>
<p>
The first person who saw me was M. Du Bois:
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:1259700101:242"/>
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Ah, mon Dieu!</hi>
"
</q>
exclaimed he,
<q rend="inline">
<hi>
voilà Mademoi

selle!
</hi>
"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Goodness,"</q>
cried young Branghton,
<q rend="inline">if there is n't Miss!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Lord, so there is,"</q>
said Miss Polly;
<q rend="inline">
"well, I'm sure I should never have dreamed of Miss's coming."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Nor I neither, I'm sure,"</q>
cried Miss Brangh

ton,
<q rend="inline">
"or else I would not have been in this room to see her; I'm quite ashamed about it,—only not thinking of seeing any body but my aunt—how

ever, Tom, it's all your fault, for you know very well I wanted to borrow Mr. Smith's room, only you were so
<hi>grumty,</hi>
you would not let me."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Lord, what signifies;"</q>
said the brother,
<q rend="inline">
"I dare be sworn Miss has been up two pair of stairs before now;—Ha'n't you, Miss?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I begged that I might not give them the least disturbance, and assured them that I had not any choice in regard to what room we sat in.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Well,"</q>
said Miss Polly,
<q rend="inline">
"when you come next, Miss, we'll have Mr. Smith's room; and it's a very pretty one, and only up one pair of stairs, and nicely furnished, and every thing."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"To say the truth,"</q>
said Miss Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"I thought that my cousin would not, upon any ac

count, have come to town in the summer time; for it's not at all the
<hi>fashion,</hi>
—so, to be sure, thinks I, she'll stay till September, when the play-houses open."
</q>
</p>
<p>
This was my reception, which I believe you will not call a very
<hi>cordial</hi>
one. Madame Duval, who, after having severely reprimanded M. Du Bois for his negligence, was just entering upon the story of her misfortunes, now wholly engaged the company.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:1259700101:243"/>
M. Du Bois listened to her with a look of the utmost horror, repeatedly lifting up his eyes and hands, and exclaiming,
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>O ciel! quel barbare!</hi>
"
</q>
The young ladies gave her the most earnest atten

tion; but their brother, and the young man, kept a broad grin upon their faces during the whole reci

tal. She was, however, too much engaged to observe them: but, when she mentioned having been tied in a ditch, young Branghton, no longer able to constrain himself, burst into a loud laugh, declaring that he had never heard any thing so
<hi>
fun

ny
</hi>
in his life! His laugh was heartily re-echoed by his friend; the Miss Branghtons could not resist the example; and poor Madame Duval, to her extreme amazement, was absolutely overpowered and stopped by the violence of their mirth.
</p>
<p>
For some minutes the room seemed quite in an uproar; the rage of Madame Duval, the astonish

ment of M. Du Bois, and the angry interrogato

ries of Mr. Branghton, on one side; the convul

sive tittering of the sisters, and the loud laughs of the young men, on the other, occasioned such noise, passion, and confusion, that had any one stopped an instant on the stairs, he must have concluded himself in Bedlam. At length, however, the fa

ther brought them to order; and, half laughing, half frightened, they made Madame Duval some very awkward apologies. But she would not be prevailed upon to continue her narrative, till they had protested they were laughing at the Captain, and not at her. Appeased by this, she resumed her story; which, by the help of stuffing hand

kerchiefs into their mouths, the young people heard with tolerable decency.
</p>
<p>
Every body agreed, that the ill usage the Cap

tain had given her was
<hi>actionable,</hi>
and Mr. Brangh

ton
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:1259700101:244"/>
said he was sure she might recover what da

mages she pleased, since she had been put in fear of her life.
</p>
<p>
She then, with great delight, declared, that she would lose no time in satisfying her revenge, and vowed she would not be contented with less than half his fortune:
<q rend="inline">"For though,"</q>
said she,
<q rend="inline">
"I don't put no value upon the money, because,
<hi>Dieu merci,</hi>
I ha'n't no want of it, yet I don't wish for nothing so much as to punish that fellow; for, I'm sure, whatever's the cause of it, he owes me a great
<hi>grudge,</hi>
and I know no more what it's for than you do, but he's always been doing me one spite or other, ever since I knew him."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Soon after tea, Miss Branghton took an oppor

tunity to tell me, in a whisper, that the young man I saw was a lover of her sister's, that his name was Brown, and that he was a haberdasher, with many other particulars of his circumstances and family; and then she declared her utter aversion to the thoughts of such a match; but added, that her sister had no manner of spirit or ambition, though for her part, she would ten times rather die an old maid, than marry any person but a gen

tleman.
<q rend="inline">And, for that matter,"</q>
added she,
<q rend="inline">
"I believe Polly herself don't care much for him, only she's in such a hurry, because, I suppose, she's a mind to be married before me; however, she's very welcome, for I'm sure, I don't care a pin's point whether I ever marry at all;—it's all one to me."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Some time after this, Miss Polly contrived to tell
<hi>her</hi>
story. She assured me, with much titter

ing, that her sister was in a great fright, lest she should be married first,
<q rend="inline">"So I make her believe that I will,"</q>
continued she,
<q rend="inline">
"for I love dearly to plague her a little; though, I declare, I don't
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:1259700101:245"/>
intend to have Mr. Brown in reality; I'm sure I don't like him half well enough,—do you, Miss?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"It is not possible for me to judge of his me

rits, said I, as I am entirely a stranger to him."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"But what do you think of him, Miss?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why, really, I—I don't know—"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"But do you think him handsome? Some peo

ple reckon him to have a good pretty person,—but, I'm sure, for my part, I think he's monstrous ugly:—don't
<hi>you,</hi>
Miss?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I am no judge,—but I think his person is very—very well—."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Very well!</hi>
—Why, pray, Miss,"
</q>
in a tone of vexation,
<q rend="inline">"what fault can you find with it?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O, none at all!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I'm sure you must be very ill-natured if you could. Now there's Biddy says she thinks no

thing of him,—but I know it's all out of spite. You must know, Miss, it makes her as mad as can be, that I should have a lover before her, but she's so proud, that nobody will court her, and I often tell her she'll die an old maid. But, the thing is, she has taken it into her head, to have a liking for Mr. Smith, as lodges on the first floor; but, Lord, he'll never have her, for he's quite a fine gentleman; and besides, Mr. Brown heard him say, one day, that he'd never marry as long as he lived, for he'd no opinion of matrimony."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"And did you tell your sister this?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"O, to be sure I told her directly; but she did not mind me; however, if she will be a fool, she must."
</q>
</p>
<p>
This extreme want of affection, and good-na

ture, increased the distaste I already felt for these unamiable sisters; and a confidence so entirely un

solicited
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:1259700101:246"/>
and unnecessary, manifested equally their folly and their want of decency.
</p>
<p>
I was very glad when the time for our departing arrived. Mr. Branghton said our lodgings were in Holborn, that we might be near his house, and neighbourly. He accompanied us to them himself.
</p>
<p>
Our rooms are large and not inconvenient; our landlord is an hosier. I am sure I have a thousand reasons to rejoice that I am so little known; for my present situation is, in every respect, very un

enviable, and I would not, for the world, be seen by any acquaintance of Mrs. Mirvan.
</p>
<p>
This morning Madame Duval, attended by all the Branghtons, actually went to a Justice in the neighbourhood, to report the Captain's ill usage of her. I had great difficulty in excusing myself from being of the party, which would have given me very serious concern. Indeed, I was extremely anxious, though at home, till I heard the result of the application; for I dread to think of the unea

siness which such an affair would occasion the amiable Mrs. Mirvan. But, fortunately, Madame Duval has received very little encouragement to proceed in her design, for she has been informed that, as she neither heard the voice, nor saw the face of the person suspected, she will find it diffi

cult to cast him upon
<hi>conjecture,</hi>
and will have but little probability of gaining her cause, unless she can procure witnesses of the transaction. Mr. Branghton, therefore, who has considered all the circumstances of the affair, is of opinion, that the law-suit will not only be expensive, but tedious and hazardous, and has advised against it. Ma

dame Duval, though very unwillingly, has ac

quiesced in his decision; but vows that if ever she is so affronted again, she will be revenged, even if
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:1259700101:247"/>
she ruins herself. I am extremeiy glad that this ridiculous adventure seems now likely to end with

out more serious consequences.
</p>
<p>
Adieu, my dearest Sir. My direction is at Mr. Dawkins's, a hosier, in High Holborn.

<p>
I HAVE no words, my sweet friend, to express the thankfulness I feel for the unbounded kindness which you, your dear mother, and the much-ho

noured Lady Howard, have shewn me; and still less can I find language to tell you with what re

luctance I parted from such dear and generous friends, whose goodness reflects, at once, so much honour on their own hearts, and on her to whom it has been so liberally bestowed. But I will not repeat what I have already written to the kind Mrs. Mirvan; I will remember your admonitions, and confine to my own breast that gratitude with which you have filled it, and teach my pen to dwell upon subjects less painful to my generous correspondent.
</p>
<p>
O Maria, London now seems no longer the same place where I lately enjoyed so much happi

ness; every thing is new and strange to me; even the town itself has not the same aspect:—my situ

ation so altered! my home so different!—my com

panions so changed!—But you well know my averseness to this journey.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, to me, London now seems a desart; that gay and busy appearance it so lately wore, is now succeeded by a look of gloom, fatigue, and lassi

tude; the air seems stagnant, the heat is intense,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:1259700101:248"/>
the dust intolerable, and the inhabitants illiterate and under-bred. At least, such is the face of things in the part of the town where I at present reside.
</p>
<p>
Tell me, my dear Maria, do you never re

trace in your memory the time we past here when together? to mine, it recurs for ever! And yet, I think I rather recollect a dream, or some visionary fancy, than a reality.—That I should ever have been known to Lord Orville,—that I should have spoken to—have danced with him,—seems now a romantic illusion: and that elegant politeness, that flattering attention, that high-bred delicacy, which so much distinguished him above all other men, and which struck us with such admiration, I now re

trace the remembrance of, rather as belonging to an object of ideal perfection, formed by my own imagination, than to a being of the same race and nature as those with whom I at present converse.
</p>
<p>
I have no news for you, my dear Miss Mirvan, for all that I could venture to say of Madame Du

val, I have already written to your sweet mother; and as to adventures, I have none to record. Si

tuated as I now am, I heartily hope I shall not meet with any; my wish is to remain quiet and unnoticed.

<p>
YESTERDAY morning, we received an invitation to dine and spend the day at Mr. Brangh

ton's;
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:1259700101:249"/>
and M. Du Bois, who was also invited, called to conduct us to Snow-hill.
</p>
<p>
Young Branghton received us at the door, and the first words he spoke were,
<q rend="inline">"Do you know, "Sisters a'n't dressed yet?"</q>
</p>
<p>
Then, hurrying us into the house, he said to me,
<q rend="inline">
"Come, Miss, you shall go up stairs and catch 'em,—I dare say they're at the glass."
</q>
</p>
<p>
He would have taken my hand, but I declined his civility, and begged to follow Madame Duval. Mr. Branghton then appeared, and led the way himself. We went, as before, up two pair of stairs; but the moment the father opened the door, the daughters both gave a loud scream. We all stopped, and then Miss Branghton called out,
<q rend="inline">
"Lord, Papa, what do you bring the company up here for? why, Polly and I a'n't half dressed."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"More shame for you,"</q>
answered he,
<q rend="inline">
here's your aunt, and cousin, and M. Du Bois, all wait

ing, and ne'er a room to take them to."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Who'd have thought of their coming so soon?"</q>
cried she:
<q rend="inline">
"I'm sure for my part I thought Miss was used to nothing but quality hours."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why, I shan't be ready this half-hour yet,"</q>
said Miss Polly;
<q rend="inline">"can't they stay in the shop till we're dressed?"</q>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Branghton was very angry, and scolded them violently; however, we were obliged to de

scend, and stools were procured for us in the shop, where we found the brother, who was highly de

lighted, he said, that his sisters had been
<hi>catched;</hi>
and he thought proper to entertain me with a long account of their tediousness, and the many quar

rels they all had together.
</p>
<p>
When, at length, these ladies were equipped to their satisfaction, they made their appearance; but
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:1259700101:250"/>
before any conversation was suffered to pass between them and us, they had a long and most disagreeable dialogue with their father, to whose reprimands, though so justly incurred, they replied with the utmost pertness and rudeness, while their brother, all the time, laughed aloud.
</p>
<p>
The moment they perceived this, they were so much provoked, that, instead of making any apologies to Madame Duval, they next began a quarrel with him.
<q rend="inline">
"Tom, what do you laugh for? I wonder what business you have to be al

ways a laughing when Papa scolds us."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Then what business have you to be such a while getting on your cloaths? You're never ready, you know well enough."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Lord, Sir, I wonder what that's to you! I wish you'd mind your own affairs, and not trou

ble yourself about ours. How should a boy like you know any thing?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"A boy, indeed! not such a boy, neither; I'll warrant you'll be glad to be as young, when you come to be old maids."
</q>
</p>
<p>
This sort of dialogue we were amused with till dinner was ready, when we again mounted up two pair of stairs.
</p>
<p>
In our way, Miss Polly told me that her sister had asked Mr. Smith for his room to dine in, but he had refused to lend it;
<q rend="inline">"because,"</q>
she said,
<q rend="inline">
"one day it happened to be a little greased: how

ever, we shall have it to drink tea in, and then, perhaps, you may see him, and I assure you he's quite like one of the quality, and dresses as fine, and goes to balls and dances, and every thing quite in taste;—and besides, Miss, he keeps a foot-boy of his own, too."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:1259700101:251"/>
The dinner was ill-served, ill-cooked, and ill

managed. The maid who waited had so often to go down stairs for something that was forgotten, that the Branghtons were perpetually obliged to rise from table themselves, to get plates, knives and forks, bread, or beer. Had they been with

out
<hi>pretensions,</hi>
all this would have seemed of no consequence; but they aimed at appearing to ad

vantage, and even fancied they succeeded. How

ever, the most disagreeable part of our fare was, that the whole family continually disputed whose turn it was to rise, and whose to be allowed to sit still.
</p>
<p>
When this meal was over, Madame Duval, Mr. Branghton, and, in broken English. M. Du Bois, entered into an argument concerning the French nation; and Miss Polly, then addressing herself to me, said,
<q rend="inline">
"Don't you think, Miss, it's very dull sitting up stairs here? we'd better go down
<hi>to shop,</hi>
and then we shall see the people go by."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Lord, Poll,"</q>
said the brother,
<q rend="inline">
"you're al

ways wanting to be staring and gaping; and I'm sure you need n't be so fond of shewing yourself, for you're ugly enough to frighten a horse."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Ugly, indeed! I wonder which is best, you or me. But, I tell you what, Tom, you've no need to give yourself such airs, for if you do, I'll tell Miss of you know what—."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Who cares if you do? You may tell what you will; I don't mind—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Indeed,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">"I do not desire to hear any secrets."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"O, but I'm resolved I'll tell you, because Tom's so very spiteful. You must know, Miss, t'other night—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:1259700101:252"/>
<q rend="inline">"Poll,"</q>
cried the brother,
<q rend="inline">
"if you tell of that, Miss shall know all about your meeting young Brown,—you know when!—So I'll be quits with you, one way or another."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Miss Polly coloured, and again proposed our go

ing down stairs till Mr. Smith's room was ready for our reception.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Aye, so we will,"</q>
said Miss Branghton;
<q rend="inline">
"I'll assure you, Cousin, we have some very gen

teel people pass by our shop sometimes. Polly and I always go and sit there, when we've cleaned ourselves."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Yes, Miss,"</q>
cried the brother,
<q rend="inline">
"they do nothing else all day long, when father don't scold them. But the best fun is, when they've got all their dirty things on, and all their hair about their ears, sometimes I send young Brown up stairs to them; and then, there's such a fuss!—there they hide themselves, and run away, and squeal and squall like any thing mad: and so then I puts the two cats into the room, and I gives 'em a good whip

ping, and so that sets them a squalling too; so there's such a noise, and such an uproar!—Lord, you can't think, Miss, what fun it is!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
This occasioned a fresh quarrel with the sisters; at the end of which, it was, at length, decided that we should go to the shop.
</p>
<p>
In our way down stairs, Miss Branghton said aloud,
<q rend="inline">"I wonder when Mr. Smith's room will be ready."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"So do I,"</q>
answered Polly;
<q rend="inline">"I'm sure we should not do any harm to it now."</q>
</p>
<p>
This hint had not the desired effect; for we were suffered to proceed very quietly.
</p>
<p>
As we entered the shop, I observed a young man, in deep mourning, leaning against the wall, with
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:1259700101:253"/>
his arms folded, and his eyes fixed on the ground, apparently in profound and melancholy meditation: but the moment he perceived us, he started, and, making a passing bow, very abruptly retired. As I found he was permitted to go quite unnoticed, I could not forbear enquiring who he was.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Lord!"</q>
answered Miss Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"he's no

thing but a poor Scotch poet."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"For my part,"</q>
said Miss Polly,
<q rend="inline">
"I believe he's just starved, for I don't find he has any thing to live upon."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Live upon!"</q>
cried the brother,
<q rend="inline">
"why he's a poet, you know, so he may live upon learning."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Aye, and good enough for him too,"</q>
said Miss Branghton,
<q rend="inline">"for he's as proud as he's poor."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Like enough,"</q>
replied the brother,
<q rend="inline">
"but, for all that, you won't find he will live without meat and drink: no, no, catch a Scotchman at that if you can! why, they only come here for what they can get."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I'm sure,"</q>
said Miss Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"I wonder Papa 'll be such a fool as to let him stay in the house, for I dare say he'll never pay for his lodging."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why, no more he would, if he could get another Lodger: you know the bill's been put up this fortnight. Miss, if you should hear of a per

son that wants a room, I assure you it is a very good one, for all it's up three pair of stairs."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I answered, that as I had no acquaintance in London, I had not any chance of assisting them: but both my compassion and my curiosity were ex

cited for this poor young man: and I asked them some further particulars concerning him.
</p>
<p>
They then acquainted me, that they had only known him three months. When he first lodged
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:1259700101:254"/>
with them, he agreed to board also; but had late

ly told them, he would eat by himself, though they all believed he had hardly ever tasted a morsel of meat since he left their table. They said, that he had always appeared very low-spirited, but, for the last month, he had been
<hi>duller</hi>
than ever, and, all of a sudden, had put himself into mourning, though they knew not for whom, nor for what, but they supposed it was only for convenience, as no person had ever been to see or enquire for him since his residence amongst them: and they were sure he was very poor, as he had not paid for his lodgings the last three weeks: and finally, they concluded he was a poet, or else half-crazy, be

cause they had, at different times, found scraps of poetry in his room.
</p>
<p>
They then produced some unfinished verses, written on small pieces of paper, unconnected, and of a most melancholy cast. Among them was the fragment of an ode, which, at my re

quest, they lent me to copy; and, as you may perhaps like to see it, I will write it now.
</p>
<q>
<l>O LIFE! thou lingering dream of grief, of pain,</l>
<l>And every ill that nature can sustain,</l>
<l>Strange, mutable, and wild!</l>
<l>Now flattering with Hope most fair,</l>
<l>Depressing now with fell Despair,</l>
<l>The nurse of Guilt, the slave of Pride,</l>
<l>That, like a wayward child,</l>
<l>Who, to himself a foe,</l>
<l>Sees joy alone in what's denied,</l>
<l>In what is granted, woe!</l>
<l>
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:1259700101:255"/>
O thou poor, feeble, fleeting pow'r,
</l>
<l>By Vice seduc'd, by Folly woo'd,</l>
<l>By Mis'ry, Shame, Remorse pursu'd!</l>
<l>And as thy toilsome steps proceed,</l>
<l>Seeming to Youth the fairest flow'r,</l>
<l>Proving to Age the rankest weed,</l>
<l>A gilded, but a bitter pill,</l>
<l>Of varied, great, and complicated ill!</l>
</q>
<p>
These lines are harsh, but they indicate an in

ternal wretchedness which, I own, affects me. Surely this young man must be involved in misfor

tunes of no common nature: but I cannot imagine what can induce him to remain with this unfeel

ing family, where he is, most unworthily, de

spised for being poor, and, most illiberally, de

tested for being a Scotchman. He may, indeed, have motives which he cannot surmount, for sub

mitting to such a situation. Whatever they are, I most heartily pity him, and cannot but wish it were in my power to afford him some relief.
</p>
<p>
During this conversation, Mr. Smith's foot boy came to Miss Branghton, and informed her, that his master said she might have the room now when she liked it, for that he was presently going out.
</p>
<p>
This very genteel message, though it perfectly satisfied the Miss Branghtons, by no means added to my desire of being introduced to this gentle

man: and upon their rising, with intention to ac

cept his offer, I begged they would excuse my at

tending them, and said I would sit with Madame Duval till the tea was ready.
</p>
<p>
I therefore once more went up two pair of stairs, with young Branghton, who insisted upon accom

panying me; and there we remained, till Mr.
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:1259700101:256"/>
Smith's foot-boy summoned us to tea, when I fol

lowed Madame Duval into the dining-room.
</p>
<p>
The Miss Branghtons were seated at one win

dow, and Mr. Smith was lolling indolently out of the other. They all approached us at our en

trance, and Mr. Smith, probably, to shew he was master of the apartment, most officiously hand

ed me to a great chair, at the upper end of the room, without taking any notice of Madame Du

val, till I rose, and offered her my own seat.
</p>
<p>
Leaving the rest of the company to entertain themselves, he, very abruptly, began to address himself to me, in a style of gallantry, equally new and disagreeable to me. It is true, no man can possibly pay me greater compliments, or make more fine speeches, than Sir Clement Willoughby, yet his language, though too flowery, is always that of a gentleman, and his address and manners are so very superior to those of the inhabitants of this house, that to make any comparison between him and Mr. Smith would be extremely unjust. This latter seems very desirous of appearing a man of gaiety and spirit; but his vivacity is so low bred, and his whole behaviour so forward and dis

agreeable, that I should prefer the company of
<hi>dullness</hi>
itself, even as that goddess is described by Pope, to that of this
<hi>sprightly</hi>
young man.
</p>
<p>
He made many apologies, that he had not lent his room for our dinner, which, he said, he should certainly have done, had he seen me first; and he assured me, that when I came again, he should be very glad to oblige me.
</p>
<p>
I told him, with sincerity, that every part of the house was equally indifferent to me.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why, Ma'am, the truth is, Miss Biddy and Polly take no care of any thing else. I'm sure,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:1259700101:257"/>
they should be always welcome to my room; for I'm never so happy as in obliging the ladies,—that's my character, Ma'am;—but, really, the last time they had it, every thing was made so greasy and so nasty, that, upon my word, to a man who wishes to have things a little genteel, it was quite cruel. Now, as to you, Ma'am, its quite another thing; for I should not mind if every thing I had was spoilt, for the sake of having the pleasure to oblige you; and, I assure you, Ma'am, it makes me quite happy, that I have a room good enough to receive you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
This elegant speech was followed by many others, so much in the same style, that to write them would be superfluous; and, as he did not allow me a moment to speak to any other person, the rest of the evening was consumed in a painful attention to this irksome young man, who seemed to intend appearing before me to the utmost advan

tage.
</p>
<p>
Adieu, my dear Sir. I fear you will be sick of reading about this family; yet I must write of them, or not of any, since I mix with no other. Happy shall I be, when I quit them all, and again return to Berry Hill!

<head>LETTER XLIII.</head>
<head type="sub">Evelina in continuation.</head>

<dateline>
<date>June 10th.</date>
</dateline>
</opener>
<p>
THIS morning, Mr. Smith called,
<hi>on purpose,</hi>
he said, to offer me a ticket for the next Hamp

stead assembly. I thanked him, but desired to be
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:1259700101:258"/>
excused accepting it; he would not, however, be denied, nor answered, and in a manner both ve

hement and free, pressed and urged his offer till I was wearied to death: but, when he found me resolute, he seemed thunderstruck with amazement, and thought proper to desire I would tell him my reasons.
</p>
<p>
Obvious as they must, surely, have been to any other person, they were such as I knew not how to repeat to him; and, when he found I he

sitated, he said,
<q rend="inline">
"Indeed, Ma'am, you are too modest; I assure you the ticket is quite at your service, and I shall be very happy to dance with you; so pray don't be so coy."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Indeed, Sir,"</q>
returned I,
<q rend="inline">
"you are mistaken; I never supposed you would offer a ticket, with

out wishing it should be accepted; but it would answer no purpose to mention the reasons which make me decline it, since they cannot possibly be removed."
</q>
</p>
<p>
This speech seemed very much to mortify him, which I could not be concerned at, as I did not chuse to be treated by him with so much freedom. When he was, at last, convinced that his appli

cation to me was ineffectual, he addressed himself to Madame Duval, and begged she would interfere in his favour, offering, at the same time, to pro

cure another ticket for herself.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Ma foi,</hi>
Sir,"
</q>
answered she, angrily,
<q rend="inline">
"you might as well have had the complaisance to ask me before, for, I assure you, I don't approve of no such rudeness: however, you may keep your tick

ets to yourself, for we don't want none of 'em.
</q>
</p>
<p>
This rebuke almost over set him; he made many apologies, and said that he should certainly have first applied to her, but that he had no notion the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:1259700101:259"/>
<hi>young</hi>
lady would have refused him, and, on the contrary, had concluded that she would have assist

ed him to persuade Madame Duval herself.
</p>
<p>
This excuse appeased her; and he pleaded his cause so successfully, that, to my great chagrin, he gained it; and Madame Duval promised that she would go herself, and take me to the Hamp

stead assembly whenever he pleased.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Smith then, approaching me with an air of triumph, said,
<q rend="inline">
"Well, Ma'am, now, I think, you can't possibly keep to your denial."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I made no answer, and he soon took leave, though not till he had so wonderfully gained the favour of Madame Duval, that she declared, when he was gone, he was the prettiest young man she had seen since she came to England.
</p>
<p>
As soon as I could find an opportunity, I ven

tured, in the most humble manner, to entreat Ma

dame Duval would not insist upon my attending her to this ball; and represented to her, as well as I was able, the impropriety of my accepting any present from a young man so entirely unknown to me: but she laughed at my scruples, called me a foolish, ignorant, country girl, and said she should make it her business to teach me something of the world.
</p>
<p>
This ball is to be next week. I am sure it is not more improper for, than unpleasant to me, and I will use every possible endeavour to avoid it. Perhaps I may apply to Miss Branghton for advice, as I believe she will be willing to assist me, from disliking, equally with myself, that I should dance with Mr. Smith.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:1259700101:260"/>
July 11th.
</p>
<p>
O, my dear Sir! I have been shocked to death,—and yet, at the same time, delighted beyond ex

pression, in the hope that I have happily been the instrument of saving a human creature from destruc

tion!
</p>
<p>
This morning, Madame Duval said she would invite the Branghton family to return our visit to

morrow; and, not chusing to rise herself,—for she generally spends the morning in bed,—she desi

red me to wait upon them with her message. M. Du Bois, who just then called, insisted upon attend

ing me.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Branghton was in the shop, and told us that his son and daughters were out; but desired me to step up stairs, as he very soon expected them home. This I did, leaving M. Du Bois below. I went into the room where they had dined the day before, and, by a wonderful chance, I happended so to seat myself, that I had a view of the stairs, and yet could not be seen from them.
</p>
<p>
In about ten minutes time, I saw, passing by the door, with a look perturbed and affrighted, the same young man I mentioned in my last letter. Not heeding, as I suppose, how he went, in turn

ing the corner of the stairs, which are narrow and winding, his foot slipped, and he fell, but, almost instantly rising, I plainly perceived the end of a pistol, which started from his pocket, by hitting against the stairs.
</p>
<p>
I was inexpressibly shocked. All that I had heard of his misery occurring to my memory, made me conclude, that he was, at that very moment, meditating suicide! Struck with the dreadful idea, all my strength seemed to fail me;—I sat motion

less;
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:1259700101:261"/>
—I lost all power of action,—and grew almost stiff with horror.
</p>
<p>
He moved on slowly,—yet I soon lost sight of him. I then trembled so violently, that my chair actually shook under me; till, recollecting that it was yet possible to prevent the fatal deed, all my faculties seemed to return, with the hope of saving him.
</p>
<p>
My first thought was to fly to Mr. Branghton, but I feared that an instant of time lost, might for ever be rued; and therefore, guided by the im

pulse of my apprehensions, as well as I was able, I followed him up stairs, stepping very softly, and obliged to support myself by the banisters.
</p>
<p>
When I came within a few stairs of the landing

place, I stopped, for I could then see into his room, as he had not yet shut the door.
</p>
<p>
He had put the pistol upon a table, and had his hand in his pocket, whence, in a few moments, he took out another: He then emptied something on the table from a small leather bag; after which, taking up both the pistols, one in each hand, he dropt hastily upon his knees, and called out
<q rend="inline">"O God!—Forgive me!"</q>
</p>
<p>
In a moment, strength and courage seemed lent me as by inspiration: I started, and rushing pre

cipitately into the room, just caught his arm, and then, overcome by my own fears, I fell down at his side, breathless and senseless. My recovery, however, was, I believe, almost instantaneous; and then the sight of this unhappy man, regarding me with a look of unutterable astonishment, mixed with concern, presently restored to me my recollecti

on. I arose, though with difficulty; he did the same; the pistols, as I soon saw, were both on the floor.
</p>
<p>
Unwilling to leave them, and, indeed, too weak
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:1259700101:262"/>
to move, I leant one hand on the table, and then stood perfectly still: while he, his eyes cast wildly towards me, seemed too infinitely amazed to be ca

pable of either speech or action.
</p>
<p>
I believe we were some minutes in this extraor

dinary situation; but, as my strength returned, I felt myself both ashamed and awkward, and ma

king a slight courtesie, I moved towards the door. Pale, and motionless, he suffered me to pass, with

out changing his posture, or uttering a syllable; and, indeed,
<q>
<l>
He looked a bloodless image of despair!
<note n="*" place="bottom">Pope's Iliad.</note>
</l>
</q>
</p>
<p>
When I reached the door, I turned round; I looked fearfully at the pistols, and, impelled by an emotion I could not repress, I hastily stepped back, with an intention of carrying them away: but their wretched owner, perceiving my design, and reco

vering from his astonishment, darting suddenly down, seized them both himself.
</p>
<p>
Wild with fright, and scarce knowing what I did, I caught, almost involuntarily, hold of both his arms, and exclaimed
<q rend="inline">"O Sir! have mercy on yourself!"</q>
</p>
<p>
The guilty pistols fell from his hands, which, disengaging from me, he fervently clasped, and cried,
<q rend="inline">"Sweet Heaven! is this thy angel?"</q>
</p>
<p>
Encouraged by such gentleness, I again attempted to take the pistols, but, with a look half frantic, he again prevented me, saying,
<q rend="inline">"What would you do?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Awaken you,"</q>
I cried, with a courage I now wonder at,
<q rend="inline">
"to worthier thoughts, and rescue you from perdition."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:1259700101:263"/>
I then seized the pistols; he said not a word,—he made no effort to stop me;—I glided quick by him, and tottered down stairs, ere he had recovered from the extremest amazement.
</p>
<p>
The moment I reached again the room I had so fearfully left, I threw away the pistols, and flinging myself on the first chair, gave free vent to the feelings I had most painfully stifled, in a violent burst of tears, which, indeed, proved a happy re

lief to me.
</p>
<p>
In this situation I remained some time; but when, at length, I lifted up my head, the first object I saw, was the poor man who had occasioned my terror, standing, as if petrified, at the door, and gazing at me with eyes of wild wonder.
</p>
<p>
I started from the chair, but trembled so exces

sively, that I almost instantly sunk again into it. He then, though without advancing, and in a fal

tering voice, said,
<q rend="inline">
"Whoever or whatever you are, relieve me, I pray you, from the suspense un

der which my soul labours—and tell me if indeed I do not dream?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
To this address, so singular and so solemn, I had not then the presence of mind to frame any an

swer; but, as I presently perceived that his eyes turned from me to the pistols, and that he seemed to intend regaining them, I exerted all my strength, and saying
<q rend="inline">"O for Heaven's sake, forbear!"</q>
I rose and took them myself.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Do my senses deceive me!"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"do
<hi>I</hi>
live—? and do you—?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
As he spoke, he advanced towards me, and I, still guarding the pistols, retreated, saying
<q rend="inline">"No, no,—you must not—must not have them!"—</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why—for what purpose, tell me!—do you withhold them?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:1259700101:264"/>
<q rend="inline">
"To give you time to
<hi>think,</hi>
to save you from eternal misery,—and, I hope, to reserve you for mercy and forgiveness."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Wonderful!"</q>
cried he, with uplifted hands and eyes,
<q rend="inline">"most wonderful!"</q>
</p>
<p>
For some time, he seemed wrapped in deep thought, till a sudden noise of tongues below, an

nouncing the approach of the Branghtons, made him start from his reverie: he sprung hastily for

ward,—dropt on one knee,—caught hold of my gown, which he pressed to his lips, and then, quick as lightning, he rose, and flew up stairs to his own room.
</p>
<p>
There was something in the whole of this ex

traordinary and shocking adventure, really too af

fecting to be borne; and so entirely had I spent my spirits and exhausted my courage, that, before the Branghtons reached me, I had sunk on the ground, without sense or motion.
</p>
<p>
I believe I must have been a very horrid sight to them, on their entrance into the room; for, to all appearance, I seemed to have suffered a violent death, either by my own rashness, or the cruelty of some murderer; as the pistols were fallen close by my side.
</p>
<p>
How soon I recovered, I know not, but, pro

bably, I was more indebted to the loudness of their cries, than to their assistance; for they all con

cluded that I was dead, and, for some time, did not make any effort to revive me.
</p>
<p>
Scarcely could I recollect
<hi>where</hi>
or, indeed,
<hi>what</hi>
I was, ere they poured upon me such a tor

rent of questions and enquiries, that I was almost stunned with their vociferation. However, as soon and as well as I was able, I endeavoured
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:1259700101:265"/>
to satisfy their curiosity, by recounting what had happened as clearly as was in my power. They all looked aghast at the recital, but, not being well enough to enter into any discussions, I beg

ged to have a chair called, and to return instantly home.
</p>
<p>
Before I left them, I recommended, with great earnestness, a vigilant observance of their unhappy lodger, and that they would take especial care to keep from him, if possible, all means of self-de

struction.
</p>
<p>
M. Du Bois, who seemed extremely concerned at my indisposition, walked by the side of the chair, and saw me safe to my own apartment.
</p>
<p>
The rashness and the misery of this ill-fated young man, engross all my thoughts. If, indeed, he is bent upon destroying himself, all efforts to save him will be fruitless. How much do I wish it were in my power to discover the nature of the malady which thus maddens him, and to offer or to procure alleviation to his sufferings! I am sure, my dearest Sir, you will be much concerned for this poor man, and were you here, I doubt not but you would find some method of awakening him from the error which blinds him, and of pour

ing the balm of peace and comfort into his afflicted soul!

<p>
YESTERDAY all the Branghtons dined here. Our conversation was almost wholly concerning the adventure of the day before. Mr. Branghton said, that his first thought was instantly to turn his lodger out of doors,
<q rend="inline">"Lest,"</q>
continued he,
<q rend="inline">
"his killing himself in my house, should bring me into any trouble; but then, I was afraid I should never get the money he owes me, whereas, if he dies in my house, I have a right to all he leaves be

hind him, if he goes off in my debt. Indeed, I would put him in prison—but what should I get by that? he could not earn any thing there to pay me. So I considered about it some time, and then I determined to ask him, point-blank, for my money out of hand. And so I did, but he told me he'd pay me next week: however, I gave him to understand, that though I was no Scotch

man, yet I did not like to be over-reached any more than he; so then, he gave me a ring, which, to my certain knowledge, must be worth ten gui

neas, and told me he would not part with it for his life, and a good deal more such sort of stuff, but that I might keep it till he could pay me."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"It is ten to one, Father, said young Branghton, if he came fairly by it."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Very likely not,"</q>
answered he,
<q rend="inline">
"but that will make no great difference; for I shall be able to prove my right to it all one."
</q>
</p>
<p>What principles! I could hardly stay in the room.</p>
<p>
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:1259700101:267"/>
<q rend="inline">"I'm determined,"</q>
said the son,
<q rend="inline">
"I'll take some opportunity to affront him soon, now I know how poor he is, because of the airs he gave him

self to me when he first came."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"And pray how was that, child?"</q>
said Madame Duval.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why you never knew such a fuss in your life as he made, because, one day at dinner, I only happened to say, that I supposed he had never got such a good meal in his life, before he came to England: there he fell in such a passion as you can't think; but, for my part, I took notice of it, for to be sure, thinks I, he must needs be a gentle

man, or he'd never go to be so angry about it. However, he won't put his tricks upon me again, in a hurry."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Well, said Miss Polly, he's grown quite an

other creature to what he was, and he does n't run away from us, nor hide himself, nor any thing: and he's as civil as can be, and he's always in the shop, and he saunters about the stairs, and he looks at every body who comes in."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why you may see what's after plain enough, said Mr. Branghton; he wants to see Miss again."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Ha, ha, ha! Lord, how I should laugh,"</q>
said the son,
<q rend="inline">"if he should have fell in Love with Miss!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I'm sure,"</q>
said Miss Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"Miss is welcome; but, for my part, I should be quite ashamed of such a beggarly conquest."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Such was the conversation till tea time, when the appearance of Mr. Smith gave a new turn to the discourse.
</p>
<p>
Miss Branghton desired me to remark with what a
<hi>smart air</hi>
he entered the room, and asked me if he had not very much a
<hi>quality look?</hi>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:1259700101:268"/>
<q rend="inline">"Come,"</q>
cried he, advancing to us,
<q rend="inline">
"you ladies must not sit together; wherever I go, I always make it a rule to part the ladies."
</q>
</p>
<p>
And then, handing Miss Branghton to the next chair, he seated himself between us.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Well, now, ladies, I think we sit very well. What say you? for my part, I think it was a very good motion."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"If my Cousin likes it,"</q>
said Miss Branghton,
<q rend="inline">"I'm sure I've no objection."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"I always study what the ladies like,—that's my first thought. And, indeed, it is but natural that you should like best to sit by the gentlemen, for what can you find to say to one another?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Say!"</q>
cried young Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"O, never you think of that, they'll find enough to say, I'll be sworn. You know the women are never tired of talking."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Come, come, Tom,"</q>
said Mr. Smith,
<q rend="inline">
"don't be severe upon the ladies; when I'm by; you know I always take their part."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Soon after, when Miss Branghton offered me some cake, this man of gallantry said,
<q rend="inline">
"Well, if I was that lady, I'd never take any thing from a woman."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why not, Sir?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Because I should be afraid of being poisoned for being so handsome."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Who is severe upon the ladies
<hi>now?</hi>
"
</q>
said I.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why, really, Ma'am, it was a slip of the tongue; I did not intend to say such a thing; but one can't always be on one's guard."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Soon after, the conversation turning upon pub

lic places, young Branghton asked if I had ever been to
<hi>George</hi>
's at Hampstead?
</p>
<p>
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:1259700101:269"/>
<q rend="inline">"Indeed I never heard the place mentioned."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Did n't you, Miss?"</q>
cried he, eagerly,
<q rend="inline">
"why then you've a deal of fun to come, I'll promise you; and, I tell you what, I'll treat you there some Sunday soon. So now, Bid and Poll, be sure you don't tell Miss about the chairs, and all that, for I've a mind to surprise her; and if I pay, I think I've a right to have it my own way."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"George's at Hampstead!"</q>
repeated Mr. Smith, contemptuously,
<q rend="inline">
"how came you to think the young Lady would like to go to such a low place as that? But, pray, Ma'am, have you ever been to Don Saltero's at Chelsea?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, Sir"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"No!—No!—nay, then, I must insist on hav

ing the pleasure of conducting you there before long. I assure you, Ma'am, many genteel people go, or else, I give you my word,
<hi>I</hi>
should not re

commend it."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Pray, Cousin,"</q>
said Mr. Branghton,
<q rend="inline">"have you been to Sadler's Wells, yet?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, Sir."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No! why then you've seen nothing!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Pray, Miss,"</q>
said the Son,
<q rend="inline">"how do you like the Tower of London?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I have never been to it, Sir."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Goodness!"</q>
exclaimed he,
<q rend="inline">
"not seen the Tower!—why may be you ha'n't been o' top of the Monument, neither?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, indeed, I have not."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why then you might as well not have come to London, for aught I see, for you've been no where."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Pray, Miss,"</q>
said Polly,
<q rend="inline">"have you been all over Paul's Church, yet?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, Ma'am."</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:1259700101:270"/>
<q rend="inline">"Well, but, Ma'am,"</q>
said Mr. Smith,
<q rend="inline">"how do you like Vauxhall and Marybone?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I never saw either, Sir."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"No!—God bless me!—you really surprise me,—why Vauxhall is the first pleasure in life!—I know nothing like it.—Well, Ma'am, you must have been with staange people, indeed, not to have taken you to Vauxhall. Why you have seen nothing of London yet.—However, we must try if
<hi>we</hi>
can't make you amends."
</q>
</p>
<p>
In the course of this
<hi>catechism,</hi>
many other places were mentioned of which I have forgotten the names; but the looks of surprise and contempt that my repeated negatives incurred, were very di

verting.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Come,"</q>
said Mr. Smith, after tea,
<q rend="inline">
"as this Lady has been with such a queer set of people, let's shew her the difference; suppose we go somewhere to

night?—I love to do things with spirit!—Come, Ladies, where shall we go? For my part I should like Foote's,—but the Ladies must chuse; I never speak myself."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Well, Mr. Smith is always in such spirits!"</q>
said Miss Branghton.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why yes, Ma'am, yes, thank G—, pretty good spirits;—I have not yet the cares of the world upon me,—I am not
<hi>married,</hi>
—ha, ha, ha,—you'll excuse me, Ladies,—but I can't help laughing!—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
No objection being made, to my great relief, we all proceeded to the little theatre in the Hay

market, where I was extremely entertained by the performance of the Minor and the Commissary.
</p>
<p>They all returned hither to supper.</p>

<p>
YESTERDAY morning, Madame Duval again sent me to Mr. Branghton's, attended by M. Du Bois, to make some party for the evening; be

cause she had had the vapours the preceding day, from staying at home.
</p>
<p>
As I entered the shop, I perceived the unfortu

nate North Briton, seated in a corner, with a book in his hand. He cast his melancholy eyes up, as we came in, and, I believe, immediately recol

lected my face, for he started and changed colour. I delivered Madame Duval's message to Mr. Branghton; who told me I should find Polly up stairs, but that the others were gone out.
</p>
<p>
Up stairs, therefore, I went; and, seated on a window, with Mr. Brown at her side, sat Miss Polly. I felt a little awkward at disturbing them, and much more so, at their behaviour afterwards: for, as soon as the common enquiries were over, Mr. Brown grew so fond, and so foolish, that I was extremely disgusted. Polly, all the time, on

ly rebuked him with
<q rend="inline">
"La, now, Mr. Brown, do be quiet, can't you?—you should not behave so before company.—Why now what will Miss think of me?"—
</q>
while her looks plainly shewed not merely the pleasure, but the pride which she took in his caresses.
</p>
<p>
I did not, by any means, think it necessary to punish myself by witnessing their tenderness, and,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:1259700101:272"/>
therefore, telling them I would see if Miss Brangh

ton was returned home, I soon left them, and again descended into the shop.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"So, Miss, you've come again,"</q>
said Mr. Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"what, I suppose, you've a mind to sit a little in the shop, and see how the world goes, hay, Miss?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I made no answer; and M. Du Bois instantly brought me a chair.
</p>
<p>
The unhappy stranger, who had risen at my en

trance, again seated himself; and, though his head leant towards his book, I could not help ob

serving, that his eyes were most intently and ear

nestly turned towards me.
</p>
<p>
M. Du Bois, as well as his broken English would allow him, endeavoured to entertain us, till the return of Miss Branghton and her brother.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Lord, how tired I am!"</q>
cried the former,
<q rend="inline">"I have not a foot to stand upon."</q>
And then, without any ceremony, she flung herself into the chair from which I had risen to receive her.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You tired!"</q>
said the brother,
<q rend="inline">
"why then what I must be, that have walked twice as far?"
</q>
And with equal politeness, he paid the same com

pliment to M. Du Bois which his sister had done to me.
</p>
<p>
Two chairs and three stools compleated the fur

niture of the shop, and Mr. Branghton, who chose to keep his own seat himself, desired M. Du Bois to take another; and then, seeing that I was with

out any, called out to the stranger,
<q rend="inline">"Come, Mr. Macartney, lend us your stool."</q>
</p>
<p>
Shocked at their rudeness, I declined the offer, and approaching Miss Branghton, said,
<q rend="inline">
"If you will be so good as to make room for me on your
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:1259700101:273"/>
chair, there will be no occasion to disturb that gentleman."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Lord, what signifies that?"</q>
cried the brother,
<q rend="inline">"he has had his share of sitting, I'll be sworn."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"And if he has not,"</q>
said the sister,
<q rend="inline">
he has a chair up stairs; and the shop is our own, I hope."
</q>
</p>
<p>
This grossness so much disgusted me, that I took the stool, and carrying it back to Mr. Macartney myself, I returned him thanks, as civilly as I could, for his politeness, but said that I had rather stand.
</p>
<p>
He looked at me as if unaccustomed to such at

tention, bowed very respectfully, but neither spoke, nor yet made use of it.
</p>
<p>
I soon found that I was an object of derision to all present, except M. Du Bois, and, therefore, I begged Mr. Branghton would give me an answer for Madame Duval, as I was in haste to return.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Well, then, Tom,—Biddy,—where have you a mind to go to-night? your Aunt and Miss want to be abroad and amongst them."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why then, Papa,"</q>
said Miss Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"we'll go to Don Saltero's. Mr. Smith likes that place, so may be he'll go along with us."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, no,"</q>
said the son,
<q rend="inline">"I'm for White-Conduit House; so let's go there."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"White-Conduit House, indeed!"</q>
cried his sister,
<q rend="inline">"no, Tom, that I won't."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why then let it alone; nobody wants your company;—we shall do as well without you, I'll be sworn, and better too."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I'll tell you what, Tom, if you don't hold your tongue, I'll make you repent it,—that I as

sure you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Just then, Mr. Smith came into the shop, which he seemed to intend passing through; but when he saw me, he stopped and began a most courteous
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:1259700101:274"/>
enquiry after my health, protesting that, had he known I was there, he should have come down sooner.
<q rend="inline">"But, bless me, Ma'am,"</q>
added he,
<q rend="inline">"what is the reason you stand?"</q>
and then he flew to bring me the seat from which I had just parted.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Mr. Smith, you are come in very good time,"</q>
said Mr. Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"to end a dispute between my son and daughter, about where they shall all go to-night."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O fie, Tom,—dispute with a lady!"</q>
cried Mr. Smith,
<q rend="inline">
"Now, as for me, I'm for where you will, provided this young Lady is of the party,—one place is the same as another to me, so that it be but agreeable to the ladies,—I would go any where with you, Ma'am,"
</q>
(to me)
<q rend="inline">
"unless, indeed, it were to
<hi>church;</hi>
—ha, ha, ha,—you'll excuse me, Ma'am, but, really, I never could conquer my fear of a parson;—ha, ha, ha,—really, ladies, I beg your pardon, for being so rude, but I can't help laughing for my life!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I was just saying, Mr. Smith,"</q>
said Miss Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"that I should like to go to Don Sal

tero's;—now pray where should
<hi>you</hi>
like to go?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why really, Miss Biddy, you know I always let the ladies decide; I never fix any thing myself; but I should suppose it would be rather hot at the coffee-house,—however, pray, Ladies, settle it among yourselves,—I'm agreeable to whatever you chuse."
</q>
</p>
<p>
It was easy for me to discover, that this man, with all his parade of
<hi>conformity,</hi>
objects to every thing that is not proposed by himself: but he is so much admired, by this family, for his
<hi>gentility,</hi>
that he thinks himself a complete fine gentleman!
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Come,"</q>
said Mr. Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"the best way will be to put it to the vote, and then every body
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:1259700101:275"/>
will speak their minds. Biddy, call Poll down stairs. We'll start fair."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Lord, Papa,"</q>
said Miss Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"why can't you as well send Tom?—you're always send

ing me of the errands."
</q>
</p>
<p>
A dispute then ensued, but Miss Branghton was obliged to yield.
</p>
<p>
When Mr. Brown and Miss Polly made their appearance, the latter uttered many complaints of having been called, saying she did not want to come, and was very well where she was.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Now, Ladies, your votes;"</q>
cried Mr. Smith,
<q rend="inline">"and so, Ma'am,"</q>
(to me)
<q rend="inline">
"we'll begin with you. What place shall you like best?"
</q>
and then, in a whisper, he added,
<q rend="inline">
"I assure you, I shall say the same as you do, whether I like it or not."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I said, that as I was ignorant what choice was in my power, I must beg to hear their decisions first. This was reluctantly assented to; and then Miss Branghton voted for Saltero's Coffee-house; her sister, for a party to
<hi>Mother Red Cap's;</hi>
the bro

ther, for White-Conduit House; Mr. Brown, for Bagnigge Wells; Mr. Branghton for Sadler's Wells; and Mr. Smith for Vauxhall.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Well now, Ma'am,"</q>
said Mr. Smith,
<q rend="inline">
"we have all spoken, and so you must give the casting vote. Come, what will you fix upon?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Sir,"</q>
answered I,
<q rend="inline">
"I was to speak
<hi>last.</hi>
"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Well, so you will,"</q>
said Miss Branghton,
<q rend="inline">"for we've all spoke first."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Pardon me,"</q>
returned I,
<q rend="inline">"the voting has not yet been quite general."</q>
</p>
<p>
And I looked towards Mr. Macartney, to whom I wished extremely to shew that I was not of the same brutal nature with those by whom he was treated so grossly.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:1259700101:276"/>
<q rend="inline">"Why pray,"</q>
said Mr. Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"who have we left out? would you have the cats and dogs vote?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, Sir,"</q>
cried I, with some spirit,
<q rend="inline">
"I would have
<hi>that gentleman</hi>
vote,—if, indeed, he is not su

perior to joining our party."
</q>
</p>
<p>
They all looked at me, as if they doubted whe

ther or not they had heard me right: but, in a few moments, their surprise gave way to a rude burst of laughter.
</p>
<p>
Very much displeased, I told M. Du Bois that if he was not ready to go, I would have a coach called for myself.
</p>
<p>O yes, he said, he was always ready to attend me.</p>
<p>
Mr. Smith then advancing, attempted to take my hand, and begged me not to leave them till I had settled the evening's plan.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I have nothing, Sir,"</q>
said I,
<q rend="inline">
"to do with it, as it is my intention to stay at home; and therefore Mr. Branghton will be so good as to send Madame Duval word what place is fixed upon, when it is convenient to him."
</q>
</p>
<p>And then, making a slight courtesie, I left them.</p>
<p>
How much does my disgust for these people en

crease my pity for poor Mr. Macartney! I will not see them when I can avoid so doing; but I am de

termined to take every opportunity in my power, to shew civility to this unhappy man, whose mis

fortunes, with this family, only render him an object of scorn. I was, however, very well pleas

ed with M. Du Bois, who, far from joining in their mirth, expressed himself extremely shocked at their ill-breeding.
</p>
<p>
We had not walked ten yards, ere we were fol

lowed by Mr. Smith, who came to make excuses, and to assure me they were
<hi>only joking,</hi>
and hoped
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:1259700101:277"/>
I took nothing ill, for, if I did, he would make a quarrel of it himself with the Branghtons, rather than I should receive any offence.
</p>
<p>
I begged him not to take any trouble about so immaterial an affair, and assured him I should not myself. He was so officious, that he would not be prevailed upon to return home, till he had walk

ed with us to Mr. Dawkin's.
</p>
<p>
Madame Duval was very much displeased that I brought her so little satisfaction. White-Conduit House was, at last, fixed upon; and, notwith

standing my great dislike of such parties and such places, I was obliged to accompany them.
</p>
<p>
Very disagreeable, and much according to my expectations, the evening proved. There were many people all smart and gaudy, and so pert and low-bred, that I could hardly endure being amongst them; but the party to which, unfortunately, I belonged, seemed all
<hi>at home.</hi>
</p>

Holburn,
<date>June 17th.</date>
</dateline>
</opener>
<p>
YESTERDAY Mr. Smith carried his point, of making a party for Vauxhall, consisting of Ma

dame Duval, M. Du Bois, all the Branghtons, Mr. Brown, himself,—and me!—for I find all en

deavours vain to escape any thing which these peo

ple desire I should not.
</p>
<p>
There were twenty disputes previous to our set

ting out; first, as to the
<hi>time</hi>
of our going: Mr. Branghton, his son, and young Brown, were for
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:1259700101:278"/>
six o'clock; and all the ladies and Mr. Smith were for eight;—the latter, however, con

quered.
</p>
<p>
Then, as to the
<hi>way</hi>
we should go; some were for a boat, others for a coach, and Mr. Branghton himself was for walking: but the boat, at length, was decided upon. Indeed this was the only part of the expedition that was agreeable to me, for the Thames was delightfully pleasant.
</p>
<p>
The Garden is very pretty, but too formal; I should have been better pleased, had it consisted less of strait walks, where
<q>
<l>Grove nods at grove, each alley has its brother.</l>
</q>
the trees, the numerous lights, and the company in the circle around the orchestra make a most bril

liant and gay appearance; and, had I been with a party less disagreeable to me, I should have thought it a place formed for animation and plea

sure. There was a concert, in the course of which the hautbois concerto was so charmingly played, that I could have thought myself upon enchanted ground, had I had spirits more gentle to associate with. The hautboy in the open air is heavenly.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Smith endeavoured to attach himself to me, with such officious assiduity, and impertinent free

dom, that he quite sickened me. Indeed, M. Du Bois was the only man of the party to whom, vo

luntarily, I ever addressed myself. He is civil and respectful, and I have found nobody else so since I left Howard Grove. His English is very bad, but I prefer it to speaking French myself, which I dare not venture to do. I converse with him frequently, both to disengage myself from others, and to oblige
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:1259700101:279"/>
Madame Duval, who is always pleased when he is attended to.
</p>
<p>
As we were walking about the orchestra, I heard a bell ring, and, in a moment, Mr. Smyth, flying up to me, caught my hand, and, with a motion too quick to be resisted, ran away with me many yards before I had breath to ask his meaning, tho' I struggled as well as I could to get from him. At last, however, I insisted upon stopping;
<q rend="inline">
"Stop

ping, Ma'am!"
</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"why, we must run on, or we shall lose the cascade!
</q>
</p>
<p>
And then again, he hurried me away, mixing with a crowd of people, all running with so much ve

locity, that I could not imagine what had raised such an alarm. We were soon followed by the rest of the party; and my surprise and ignorance proved a source of diversion to them all, that was not exhausted the whole evening. Young Brangh

ton, in particular, laughed till he could hardly stand.
</p>
<p>
The scene of the cascade I thought extremely pretty, and the general effect striking and lively.
</p>
<p>
But this was not the only surprise which was to divert them at my expence; for they led me about the garden, purposely to enjoy my first sight of va

rious other deceptions.
</p>
<p>
About ten o'clock, Mr. Smith having chosen a
<hi>box</hi>
in a very conspicuous place, we all went to sup

per. Much fault was found with every thing that was ordered, though not a morsel of any thing was left; and the dearness of the provisions, with con

jectures upon what profit was made by them, sup

plied discourse during the whole meal.
</p>
<p>
When wine and cyder were brought, Mr. Smith said,
<q rend="inline">
"Now let's enjoy ourselves; now is the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:1259700101:280"/>
time, or never. Well, Ma'am, and how do you like Vauxhall?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Like it!"</q>
cried young Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"why, how can she help liking it? she has never seen such a place before, that I'll answer for."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"For my part,"</q>
said Miss Branghton,
<q rend="inline">I like it, because it is not vulgar."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"This must have been a fine treat for you, Miss,"</q>
said Mr. Branghton;
<q rend="inline">
"why, I suppose, you was never so happy in all your life before?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I endeavoured to express my satisfaction with some pleasure, yet I believe they were much ama

zed at my coldness.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Miss ought to stay in town till the last night,"</q>
said young Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"and then, it's my belief, she'd say something to it! Why, Lord, it's the best night of any; there's always a riot,—and there the folks run about,—and then there's such squealing and squalling!—and there all the lamps are broke,—and the women run skimper scamper;—I declare I would not take five guineas to miss the last night!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I was very glad when they all grew tired of sit

ting, and called for the waiter to pay the bill. The Miss Branghtons said they would walk on, while the gentlemen settled the account, and asked me to accompany them; which, however, I de

clined.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You girls may do as you please,"</q>
said Madame Duval,
<q rend="inline">
"but as to me, I promise you, I sha'n't go no where without the gentlemen."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"No more, I suppose, will my
<hi>Cousin,</hi>
"
</q>
said Miss Branghton, looking reproachfully towards Mr. Smith.
</p>
<p>
This reflection, which, I feared, would slatter his vanity, made me, most unfortunately, request
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:1259700101:281"/>
Madame Duval's permission to attend them. She granted it, and away we went, having promised to meet in the room.
</p>
<p>
To the room, therefore, I would immediately have gone; but the sisters agreed that they would first have a
<hi>little pleasure,</hi>
and they tittered, and talked so loud, that they attracted universal no

tice.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Lord, Polly,"</q>
said the eldest,
<q rend="inline">
"suppose we were to take a turn in the dark walks!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Ay, do,"</q>
answered she,
<q rend="inline">
"and then we'll hide ourselves, and then Mr. Brown will think we are lost."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I remonstrated very warmly against this plan, telling them, that it would endanger our missing the rest of the party all the evening.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O dear,"</q>
cried Miss Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"I thought how uneasy Miss would be, without a beau!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
This impertinence I did not think worth answer

ing; and, quite by compulsion, I followed them down a long alley, in which there was hardly any light.
</p>
<p>
By the time we came near the end, a large party of gentlemen, apparently very riotous, and who were hallowing, leaning on one another, and laugh

ing immoderately, seemed to rush suddenly from behind some trees, and, meeting us face to face, put their arms at their sides, and formed a kind of circle, that first stopped our proceeding, and then our retreating, for we were presently entirely in

closed. The Miss Branghtons screamed aloud, and I was frightened exceedingly: our screams were answered with bursts of laughter, and, for some minutes, we were kept prisoners, till, at last, one of them, rudely, seizing hold of me, said I was a pretty little creature.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:1259700101:282"/>
Terrified to death, I struggled with such vehe

mence to disengage myself from him, that I suc

ceeded, in spite of his efforts to detain me; and immediately, and with a swiftness which fear only could have given me, I flew rather than ran up the walk, hoping to secure my safety by return
<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>
ing to the lights and company we had so foolishly left: but, before I could possibly accomplish my purpose, I was met by another party of men, one of whom placed himself so directly in my way, calling out,
<q rend="inline">"Whither so fast, my love?"—</q>
that I could only have proceeded, by running into his arms.
</p>
<p>
In a moment both my hands, by different per

sons, were caught hold of; and one of them, in a most familiar manner, desired to accompany me in a race, when I ran next; while the rest of the party stood still and laughed.
</p>
<p>
I was almost distracted with terror, and so breathless with running, that I could not speak, till another advancing, said, I was as handsome as an angel, and desired to be of the party. I then just articulated
<q rend="inline">"For Heaven's sake, Gentlemen, let me pass!"</q>
</p>
<p>
Another then, rushing suddenly forward, ex

claimed,
<q rend="inline">"Heaven and earth! what voice is that?—"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"The voice of the prettiest little actress I have seen this age,"
</q>
answered one of my persecutors.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No,—no,—no,—"</q>
I
<hi>panted</hi>
out,
<q rend="inline">
"I am no actress,—pray let me go,—pray let me pass—."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"By all that's sacred,"</q>
cried the same voice, which I then knew for Sir Clement Willoughby's,
<q rend="inline">"'tis herself!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Sir Clement Willoughby!"</q>
cried I.
<q rend="inline">
"O Sir, assist—assist me—or I shall die with terror!—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:1259700101:283"/>
<q rend="inline">"Gentlemen,"</q>
cried he, disengaging them all from me in an instant,
<q rend="inline">"pray leave this lady to me."</q>
</p>
<p>
Loud laughs proceeded from every mouth, and two or three said,
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Willoughby has all the luck!</hi>
"
</q>
But one of them, in a passionate manner, vowed he would not give me up, for that he had the first right to me, and would support it.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You are mistaken,"</q>
said Sir Clement,
<q rend="inline">
"this lady is—I will explain myself to you another time; but, I assure you, you are all mistaken."
</q>
</p>
<p>
And then, taking my willing hand, he led me off, amidst the loud acclamations, laughter, and gross merriment of his impertinent companions.
</p>
<p>
As soon as we had escaped from them, Sir Cle

ment with a voice of surprise, exclaimed,
<q rend="inline">
"My dearest creature, what wonder, what strange revo

lution, has brought you to such a spot as this?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Ashamed of my situation, and extremely morti

fied to be thus recognized by him, I was for some time silent, and when he repeated his question, only stammered out,
<q rend="inline">
"I have,—I hardly know how,—lost myself from my party.—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
He caught my hand, and eagerly pressing it, in a passionate voice, said,
<q rend="inline">"O that I had sooner met with thee!"</q>
</p>
<p>
Surprised at a freedom so unexpected, I angrily broke from him, saying,
<q rend="inline">"Is this the protection you give me, Sir Clement?"</q>
</p>
<p>
And then I saw what the perturbation of my mind had prevented my sooner noticing, that he had led me, though I know not how, into an

other of the dark alleys, instead of the place whi

ther I meant to go.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Good God!"</q>
I cried,
<q rend="inline">"where am I?—what way are you going?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:1259700101:284"/>
<q rend="inline">"Where,"</q>
answered he,
<q rend="inline">"we shall be least observed."</q>
</p>
<p>
Astonished at this speech, I stopped short, and declared I would go no further.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"And why not, my angel?"</q>
again endeavour

ing to take my hand.
</p>
<p>
My heart beat with resentment; I pushed him away from me with all my strength, and demanded how he dared treat me with such insolence?
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Insolence!"</q>
repeated he.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Yes, Sir Clement,
<hi>insolence;</hi>
from you, who know me, I had a claim for protection,—not to such treatment as this."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"By Heaven,"</q>
cried he with warmth,
<q rend="inline">
"you distract me,—why, tell me,—why do I see you here?—Is this a place for Miss Anville?—these dark walks!—no party!—no companion!—by all that's good, I can scarce believe my senses!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Extremely offended at this speech, I turned an

grily from him, and, not deigning to make any an

swer, walked on towards that part of the garden whence I perceived the lights and company.
</p>
<p>He followed me; but we were both some time silent.</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"So you will not explain to me your situation?"</q>
said he, at length.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, Sir,"</q>
answered I, disdainfully.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Nor yet—suffer me to make my own inter

pretation—?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I could not bear this strange manner of speak

ing; it made my very soul shudder,—and I burst into tears.
</p>
<p>
He flew to me, and actually flung himself at my feet, as if regardless who might see him, saying,
<q rend="inline">
"O Miss Anville—loveliest of women—forgive my—my—I beseech you forgive me;—if I have
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:1259700101:285"/>
offended,—if I have hurt you I could kill myself at the thought!—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No matter, Sir, no matter,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">
"if I can but find my friends,—I will never speak to—never see you again!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Good God!—good Heaven!—my dearest life, what is it I have done?—What is it I have said?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"You best know, Sir,
<hi>what</hi>
and
<hi>why;</hi>
—but don't hold me here,—let me be gone, and do
<hi>you!</hi>
"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Not till you forgive me!—I cannot part with you in anger."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"For shame, for shame, Sir!"</q>
cried I indig

nantly,
<q rend="inline">
"do you suppose I am to be thus com

pelled?—do you take advantage of the absence of my friends, to affront me?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, Madam,"</q>
cried he, rising,
<q rend="inline">
"I would sooner forfeit my life than act so mean a part. But you have flung me into amazement unspeakable, and you will not condescend to listen to my request of giving me some explanation."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"The manner, Sir,"</q>
said I,
<q rend="inline">
"in which you spoke that request, made and will make me scorn to answer it."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Scorn!—I will own to you, I expected not such displeasure from Miss Anville."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Perhaps, Sir, if you had, you would less vo

luntarily have merited it."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"My dearest life, surely it must be known to you, that the man does not breathe, who adores you so passionately, so fervently, so tenderly as I do!—why then will you delight in perplexing me?—in keeping me in suspence—in torturing me with doubt?"—
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I, Sir, delight in perplexing you!—You are much mistaken.—Your suspence, your doubts, your perplexities,—are of your own creating; and,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:1259700101:286"/>
believe me, Sir, they may
<hi>offend</hi>
but they can never
<hi>delight</hi>
me:—but, as you have yourself raised, you must yourself satisfy them."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Good God!—that such haughtiness and such sweetness can inhabit the same mansion!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I made no answer, but quickening my pace, I walked on silently and sullenly; till this most im

petuous of men, snatching my hand, which he grasped with violence, besought me to forgive him, with such earnestness of supplication, that merely to escape his importunities, I was forced to speak, and, in some measure to grant the pardon he re

quested: though it was accorded with a very ill grace; but, indeed, I knew not how to resist the humility of his entreaties: yet never shall I recol

lect the occasion he gave me of displeasure, with

out feeling it renewed.
</p>
<p>
We now soon arrived in the midst of the general crowd, and my own safety being then insured, I grew extremely uneasy for the Miss Branghtons, whose danger, however imprudently incurred by their own folly, I too well knew how to tremble for. To this consideration all my pride of heart yielded, and I determined to seek my party with the utmost speed; though not without a sigh did I recollect the fruitless attempt I had made, after the opera, of concealing from this man my unfortunate connections, which I was now obliged to make known.
</p>
<p>
I hastened therefore, to the room, with a view of sending young Branghton to the aid of his sisters. In a very short time, I perceived Madame Duval, and the rest, looking at one of the paintings. I must own to you honestly, my dear Sir, that an involun

tary repugnance seized me, at presenting such a set to Sir Clement,—he, who had been used to see
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:1259700101:287"/>
me in parties so different!—My pace slackened as I approached them,—but they presently perceived me.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Ah, Mademoiselle!</hi>
"
</q>
cried M. Du Bois,
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Que je suis charme de vous voir!</hi>
"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Pray, Miss,"</q>
cried Mr. Brown,
<q rend="inline">"where's Miss Polly?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why, Miss, you've been a long while gone,"</q>
said Mr. Branghton;
<q rend="inline">
"we thought you'd been lost. But what have you done with your cousins?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I hesitated,—for Sir Clement regarded me with a look of wonder.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Pardie,</hi>
"
</q>
cried Madame Duval,
<q rend="inline">
"I sha'n't let you leave me again in a hurry. Why, here we've been in such a fright!—and all the while, I suppose you've been thinking nothing about the matter."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Well,"</q>
said young Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"as long as Miss is come back, I don't mind, for as to Bid and Poll, they can take care of themselves. But the best joke is, Mr. Smith is gone all about a looking for you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
These speeches were made almost all in a breath: but when, at last, they waited for an answer, I told them, that in walking up one of the long al

leys, we had been frightened and separated.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"The long alleys!"</q>
repeated Mr. Brangh

ton,
<q rend="inline">
"and, pray, what had you to do in the long alleys? why, to be sure, you must all of you have had a mind to be affronted!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
This speech was not more impertinent to me, than surprising to Sir Clement, who regarded all the party with evident astonishment. However, I told young Branghton that no time ought to be lost, for that his sisters might require his immediate protection.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"But how will they get it?"</q>
cried this brutal brother;
<q rend="inline">
"if they've a mind to behave in such a
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:1259700101:288"/>
manner as that, they ought to protect themselves; and so they may for me."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Well,"</q>
said the simple Mr. Brown,
<q rend="inline">
"whe

ther you go or no, I think I may as well see after Miss Polly."
</q>
</p>
<p>
The father then, interfering, insisted that his son should accompany him; and away they went.
</p>
<p>
It was now that Madame Duval first perceived Sir Clement; to whom turning with a look of great displeasure, she angrily said,
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Ma foi,</hi>
so you are comed here, of all the people in the world!—I wonder, child, you would let such a—such a
<hi>person</hi>
as that keep company with you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I am very sorry, Madam,"</q>
said Sir Clement, in a tone of surprise,
<q rend="inline">
"if I have been so unfor

tunate as to offend you; but I believe you will not regret the honour I now have of attending Miss Anville, when you hear that I have been so happy as to do her some service."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Just as Madame Duval, with her usual
<hi>Ma foi,</hi>
was beginning to reply, the attention of Sir Cle

ment was wholly drawn from her, by the appear

ance of Mr. Smith, who suddenly coming behind me, and freely putting his hands on my shoulders, cried,
<q rend="inline">
"O ho, my little runaway, have I found you at last? I have been scampering all over the gardens for you; for I was determined to find you, if you were above ground.—But how could you be so cruel as to leave us?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I turned round to him, and looked with a degree of contempt that I hoped would have quieted him; but he had not the sense to understand me; and, attempting to take my hand, he added,
<q rend="inline">
"Such a demure looking lady as you are, who'd have thought of your leading one such a dance?—Come, now,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:1259700101:289"/>
don't be so coy,—only think what a trouble I have had in running after you!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"The trouble, Sir,"</q>
said I,
<q rend="inline">"was of your own choice—not mine."</q>
And I walked round to the other side of Madame Duval.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps I was too proud,—but I could not en

dure that Sir Clement, whose eyes followed him with looks of the most surprized curiosity, should witness his unwelcome familiarity.
</p>
<p>
Upon my removal, he came up to me, and, in a low voice, said,
<q rend="inline">"You are not, then, with the Mirvans?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, Sir."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"And pray—may I ask,—have you left them long?</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, Sir,"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"How unfortunate I am!—but yesterday I sent to acquaint the Captain I should reach the Grove by to-morrow noon! However I shall get away as fast as possible. Shall you be long in town?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I believe not, Sir."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
And then, when you leave it,—which way—will you allow me to ask, which way you shall travel?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Indeed,—I don't know."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Not know!—But do you return to the Mir

vans any more?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I—I can't tell, Sir."</q>
</p>
<p>
And then, I addressed myself to Madame Duval, with such a pretended earnestness, that he was ob

liged to be silent.
</p>
<p>
As he cannot but observe the great change in my situation, which he knows not how to account for, there is something in all these questions, and this unrestrained curiosity, that I did not expect from a man, who when he pleases can be so well

bred, as Sir Clement Willoughby. He seems dis

posed
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:1259700101:290"/>
to think that the alteration in my compa

nions authorizes an alteration in his manners. It is true, he has always treated me with uncom

mon freedom, but never before with so disrespect

ful an abruptness. This observation, which he has given me cause to make, of his
<hi>changing with the tide,</hi>
has sunk him more in my opinion, than any other part of his conduct.
</p>
<p>
Yet I could almost have laughed, when I looked at Mr. Smith, who no sooner saw me addressed by Sir Clement, than, retreating aloof from the company, he seemed to lose at once all his happy self-sufficiency and conceit; looking now at the baronet, now at himself, surveying, with sorrow

ful eyes, his dress, struck with his air, his ges

tures, his easy gaiety; he gazed at him with en

vious admiration, and seemed himself, with con

scious inferiority, to shrink into nothing.
</p>
<p>
Soon after, Mr. Brown, running up to us, called out,
<q rend="inline">"La, what, i'n't Miss Polly come yet?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Come!"</q>
said Mr. Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"why, I thought you went to fetch her yourself did n't you?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Yes, but I could n't find her;—yet I dare say I've been over half the garden."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Half! but why did not you go over it all?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why, so I will: but only I thought I'd just come and see if she was here first?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"But where's Tom?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why, I don't know; for he would not stay with me, all as ever I could say; for we met some young gentlemen of his acquaintance, and so he bid me go and look by myself, for he said, says he, I can divert myself better another way, says he."
</q>
</p>
<p>
This account being given, away again went this silly young man; and Mr. Branghton, extremely
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:1259700101:291"/>
incensed, said he would go and see after them him

self.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"So now,"</q>
cried Madame Duval,
<q rend="inline">
"he's gone too! why, at this rate we shall have to wait for one or other of them all night!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Observing that Sir Clement seemed disposed to renew his enquiries, I turned towards one of the paintings, and, pretending to be very much occu

pied in looking after it, asked M. Du Bois some questions concerning the figures.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"O,
<hi>Mon Dieu!</hi>
"
</q>
cried Madame Duval,
<q rend="inline">
"don't ask him; your best way is to ask Mr. Smith, for he's been here the oftenest. Come, Mr. Smith, I dare say you can tell us all about them."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why, yes, Ma'am,"</q>
said Mr. Smith, who, brightening up at this application, advanced to

wards us, with an air of assumed importance (which, however, sat very uneasily upon him) and begged to know what he should explain first;
<q rend="inline">"For I have attended,"</q>
said he,
<q rend="inline">
"to all these paintings, and know every thing in them perfectly well; for I am rather fond of pictures, Ma'am; and, really, I must say, I think a picture is a—a very—is real

ly a very—is something very pretty—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"So do I too,"</q>
said Madame Duval,
<q rend="inline">
"but pray now, Sir, tell us who that is meant for,"
</q>
pointing to a figure of Neptune.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"That!—why that, Ma'am, is,—Lord bless me, I can't think how I come to be so stupid, but really I have forgot his name,—and yet, I know it as well as my own, too,—however, he's a
<hi>general,</hi>
Ma'am, they are all generals."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I saw Sir Clement bite his lips; and, indeed, so did I mine.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Well,"</q>
said Madame Duval,
<q rend="inline">"it's the oddest dress for a general ever I see!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:1259700101:292"/>
<q rend="inline">"He seems so capital a figure,"</q>
said Sir Cle

ment to Mr. Smith,
<q rend="inline">
"that I imagine he must be
<hi>generalissimo</hi>
of the whole army."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir, yes,"</q>
answered Mr. Smith, respect

fully bowing, and highly delighted at being thus referred to,
<q rend="inline">
"you are perfectly right,—but I can

not for my life think of his name;—perhaps, Sir, you may remember it?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No really,"</q>
replied Sir Clement,
<q rend="inline">
"my ac

quaintance among the generals is not so exten

sive."
</q>
</p>
<p>
The ironical tone of voice in which Sir Cle

ment spoke, entirely disconcerted Mr. Smith; who, again retiring to an humble distance, seemed sen

sibly mortified at the failure of his attempt to reco

ver his consequence.
</p>
<p>
Soon after, Mr. Branghton returned with his youngest daughter, whom he had rescued from a party of insolent young men; but he had not yet been able to find the eldest. Miss Polly was really frightened, and declared she would never go into the dark walks again. Her father, leaving her with us, went in quest of her sister.
</p>
<p>
While she was relating her adventures, to which nobody listened more attentively than Sir Clement, we saw Mr. Brown enter the room.
<q rend="inline">"O la!"</q>
cried Miss Polly,
<q rend="inline">"let me hide myself, and don't tell him I'm come."</q>
</p>
<p>
She then placed herself behind Madame Duval, in such a manner that she could not be seen.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"So Miss Polly is not come yet!"</q>
said the sim

ple swain;
<q rend="inline">
"well, I can't think where she can be! I've been a looking, and looking, and looking all about, and I can't find her, all I can do."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Well but, Mr. Brown,"</q>
said Mr. Smith,
<q rend="inline">"sha'n't you go and look for the lady again?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:1259700101:293"/>
<q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir,"</q>
said he, sitting down,
<q rend="inline">
"but I must rest me a little bit first. You can't think how tired I am."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O fie, Mr. Brown, fie,"</q>
cried Mr. Smith, winking at us,
<q rend="inline">"tired of looking for a lady! Go, go, for shame!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"So I will, Sir, presently; but you'd be tired too, if you'd walked so far: besides, I think she's gone out of the garden, or else I must have seen something or other of her."
</q>
</p>
<p>
A
<hi>he, he, he!</hi>
of the tittering Polly, now be

trayed her, and so ended this ingenious little arti

fice.
</p>
<p>
At last appeared Mr. Branghton and Miss Biddy, who, with a face of mixed anger and confusion, addressing herself to me, said,
<q rend="inline">
"So Miss, so you ran away from me! Well, see if I don't do as much by you, some day or other! But I thought how it would be, you'd no mind to leave the
<hi>
gen

tlemen,
</hi>
though you'd run away from
<hi>me.</hi>
"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I was so much surprised at this attack, that I could not answer her for very amazement; and she proceeded to tell us how ill she had been used, and that two young men had been making her walk up and down the dark walks by absolute force, and as fast as ever they could tear her along; and many other particulars, which I will not tire you with relating. In conclusion, looking at Mr. Smith, she said,
<q rend="inline">
"But, to be sure, thought I, at least all the company will be looking for me; so I little expected to find you all here, talking as comfortably as ever you can. However, I know I may thank my cousin for it!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"If you mean
<hi>me,</hi>
Madam,"
</q>
said I, very much shocked,
<q rend="inline">
"I am quite ignorant in what manner I can have been accessary to your distress."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:1259700101:294"/>
<q rend="inline">
"Why, by running away so. If you'd stayed with us, I'll answer for it, Mr. Smith and M. Du Bois would have come to look for us; but I suppose they could not leave your ladyship."
</q>
</p>
<p>
The folly and unreasonableness of this speech would admit of no answer. But what a scene was this for Sir Clement! his surprise was evi

dent; and, I must acknowledge, my confusion was equally great.
</p>
<p>
We had now to wait for young Branghton, who did not appear for some time; and, during this in

terval, it was with difficulty that I avoided Sir Clement, who was on the rack of curiosity, and dying to speak to me.
</p>
<p>
When, at last, the hopeful youth returned, a long and frightful quarrel ensued between him and his father, in which his sisters occasionally joined, concerning his neglect; and he defended himself only by a brutal mirth, which he indulged at their expence.
</p>
<p>
Every one, now, seemed inclined to depart,—when, as usual, a dispute arose, upon the
<hi>way</hi>
of our going, whether in a coach or a boat. After much debating, it was determined that we should make two parties, one by the water and the other by land; for Madame Duval declared she would not, upon any account, go into a boat at night.
</p>
<p>
Sir Clement then said, that if she had no car

riage in waiting, he should be happy to see her and me safe home, as his was in readiness.
</p>
<p>
Fury started into her eyes, and passion inflamed every feature, as she answered,
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Pardie,</hi>
no,—you may take care of yourself, if you please; but as to me, I promise you I sha'n't trust myself with no such person."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:1259700101:295"/>
He pretended not to comprehend her meaning, yet, to wave a discussion, acquiesced in her refu

sal. The coach party fixed upon consisted of Ma

dame Duval, M. Du Bois, Miss Branghton, and myself.
</p>
<p>
I now began to rejoice, in private, that, at least, our lodgings would be neither seen, nor known, by Sir Clement. We soon met with an hackney-coach, into which he handed me, and then took leave.
</p>
<p>
Madame Duval, having already given the coach

man her direction, he mounted the box, and we were just driving off, when Sir Clement exclaim

ed,
<q rend="inline">
"By Heaven, this is the very coach I had in waiting for myself!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"This coach, your honour!"</q>
said the man,
<q rend="inline">"no, that it i'nt."</q>
</p>
<p>
Sir Clement, however, swore that it was, and, presently, the man, begging his pardon, said he had really forgotten that he was engaged.
</p>
<p>
I have no doubt but that this scheme occurred to him at the moment, and that he made some sign to the coachman, which induced him to support it: for there is not the least probability that the acci

dent really happened, as it is most likely his own chariot was in waiting.
</p>
<p>
The man then opened the coach-door, and Sir Clement advancing to it, said,
<q rend="inline">
"I don't believe there is another carriage to be had, or I would not incommode you: but, as it may be disagreeable to you to wait here any longer, I beg you will not get out, for you shall be set down before I am car

ried home, if you will be so good as to make a lit

tle room."
</q>
</p>
<p>
And so saying, in he jumpt, and seated himself between M. Du Bois and me, while our astonish

ment
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:1259700101:296"/>
at the whole transaction was too great for speech. He then ordered the coachman to drive on, according to the directions he had already re

ceived.
</p>
<p>
For the first ten minutes, no one uttered a word; and then, Madame Duval, no longer able to con

tain herself, exclaimed,
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Ma foi,</hi>
if this is n't one of the impudentest things ever I see!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Sir Clement, regardless of this rebuke, attended only to me; however, I answered nothing he said, when I could possibly avoid so doing. Miss Brangh

ton made several attempts to attract his notice, but in vain, for he would not take the trouble of pay

ing her any regard.
</p>
<p>
Madame Duval, during the rest of the ride, ad

dressed herself to M. Du Bois in French, and in that language exclaimed with great vehemence against boldness and assurance.
</p>
<p>
I was extremely glad when I thought our jour

ney must be nearly at an end, for my situation was very uneasy to me, as Sir Clement perpetually en

deavoured to take my hand. I looked out of the coach-window, to see if we were near home; Sir Clement, stooping over me did the same, and then, in a voice of infinite wonder, called out,
<q rend="inline">
"Where the d—l is the man driving to?—why we are in Broad St. Giles's!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O, he's very right,"</q>
cried Madame Duval,
<q rend="inline">
"so never trouble your head about that, for I shan't go by no directions of yours, I promise you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
When, at last, we stopped, at
<hi>an Hosier's</hi>
in
<hi>High Holborn,</hi>
—Sir Clement said nothing, but his
<hi>eyes,</hi>
I saw, were very busily employed in view

ing the place, and the situation of the house. The coach he insisted upon settling himself, as he said it belonged to him; and then he took leave. M. Du
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:1259700101:297"/>
Bois walked home with Miss Branghton, and Ma

dame Duval and I retired to our apartments.
</p>
<p>
How disagreeable an evening's adventure! not one of the party seemed satisfied, except Sir Cle

ment, who was in high spirits: but Madame Du

val was enraged at meeting with him; Mr. Brangh

ton, angry with his children; the frolick of the Miss Branghtons had exceeded their plan, and end

ed in their own distress; their brother was provo

ked that there had been no riot; Mr. Brown was tired; and Mr. Smith mortified. As to myself, I must acknowledge, nothing could be more disagree

able to me, than being seen by Sir Clement Wil

loughby with a party at once so vulgar in them

selves, and so familiar to me.
</p>
<p>
And you, too, my dear Sir, will, I know, be sorry that I have met him; however, there is no apprehension of his visiting here, as Madame Du

val is far too angry to admit him.

<p>
MADAME Duval roſe very late this morn
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing, and at one o'clock, we had but juſt break
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
faſted, when Miſs Branghton, her brother, Mr. Smith, and Monſieur du Bois, called to enquire after our healths.
</p>
<p>
This civility in young Branghton, I much ſuſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
pect, was merely the reſult of his father's com
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
mands; but his ſiſter and Mr. Smith, I ſoon found, had motives of their own. Scarce had they ſpoken to Madame Duval, when, advancing eagerly to me,
<q rend="inline">"Pray, Ma'am,"</q>
ſaid Mr. Smith,
<q rend="inline">"who was that gentleman?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Pray, Couſin,"</q>
cried Miſs Branghton, was
<q rend="inline">
"not he the ſame gentleman you ran away with that night at the opera?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Goodneſs! that he was,"</q>
ſaid young
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1259700102:3"/>
Branghton;
<q rend="inline">
"and I declare, as ſoon as ever I ſaw him, I thought I knew his face."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I'm ſure I'll defy you to forget him,"</q>
an
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſwered his ſiſter,
<q rend="inline">
"if once you had ſeen him: he is the fineſt gentleman I ever ſaw in my life; don't you think ſo, Mr. Smith?
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why, you won't give the Lady time to ſpeak,"</q>
ſaid Mr. Smith.—
<q rend="inline">"Pray, Ma'am, what is the gentleman's name?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Willoughby, Sir."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Willoughby! I think I have heard the name. Pray, Ma'am, is he married?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Lord, no, that he is not,"</q>
cried Miſs Branghton;
<q rend="inline">
"he looks too ſmart, by a great deal, for a married man. Pray, Couſin, how did you get acquainted with him?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Pray, Miſs,"</q>
ſaid young Branghton, in the ſame breath,
<q rend="inline">"what's his buſineſs?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Indeed I don't know,"</q>
anſwered I.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Something very genteel, I dare ſay,"</q>
added Miſs Branghton,
<q rend="inline">"becauſe he dreſſes ſo fine."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"It ought to be ſomething that brings in a good income."
</q>
ſaid Mr. Smith,
<q rend="inline">
"for I'm ſure he did not get that ſuit of cloaths he had on, un
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
der thirty or forty pounds; for I know the price of Cloaths pretty well; pray, Ma'am, can you tell me what he has a year?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Don't talk no more about him;"</q>
cried Ma
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
dame Duval,
<q rend="inline">
"for I don't like to hear his name; I believe he's one of the worſt perſons in the world; for, though I never did him no manner of harm, nor ſo much as hurt a hair of his head, I know he was an accomplice with that fellow, Captain Mirvan, to take away my life."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Every body, but myſelf, now crowding around her for an explanation, a violent rapping at the ſtreet-door was unheard; and, without any pre
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
vious notice, in the midſt of her narration, Sir
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1259700102:4"/>
Clement Willoughby entered the room. They all ſtarted, and, with looks of guilty confuſion, as if they feared his reſentment for having liſtened to Madame Duval, they ſcrambled for Chairs, and, in a moment, were all formally ſeated.
</p>
<p>
Sir Clement, after a general bow, ſingling out Madame Duval, ſaid, with his uſual eaſineſs,
<q rend="inline">
"I have done myſelf the honour of waiting on you, Madam, to enquire if you have any commands to Howard Grove, whither I am going to-mor-row morning."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Then, ſeeing the ſtorm that gathered in her eyes, before he allowed her time to anſwer, he addreſſed himſelf to me;—
<q rend="inline">
"And, if you, Ma
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
dam, have any with which you will honour me, I ſhall be happy to execute them."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"None at all, Sir."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"None! not to Miſs Mirvan!—no meſſage! no letter!—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I wrote to Miſs Mirvan yeſterday by the poſt."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"My application ſhould have been earlier, had I ſooner known your addreſs."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Ma foi,</hi>
"
</q>
cried Madame Duval, recovering from her ſurprize,
<q rend="inline">"I believe never nobody ſaw the like of this!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Of what! Madam!"</q>
cried the undaunted Sir Clement, turning quick towards her,
<q rend="inline">"I hope no one has offended you!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You don't hope no ſuch a thing!"</q>
cried ſhe, half choaked with paſſion, and riſing from her chair. This motion was followed by the reſt, and, in a moment, every body ſtood up.
</p>
<p>
Still Sir Clement was not abaſhed; affecting to make a bow of
<hi>acknowledgment</hi>
to the company in general, he ſaid
<q rend="inline">
"Pary—I beg—Ladies,—pray Gentlemen,—don't let me diſturb you, pray keep your ſeats."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1259700102:5"/>
<q rend="inline">"Pray, Sir,"</q>
ſaid Miſs Branghton, moving a chair towards him,
<q rend="inline">
"won't you ſit down your
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſelf?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"You are extremely good, Ma'am: rather than make any diſturbance—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
And ſo ſaying, this ſtrange man ſeated himſelf, as did, in an inſtant, every body elſe, even Ma
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
dame Duval herſelf, who, overpowered by his boldneſs, ſeemed too full for utterance.
</p>
<p>
He then, and with as much compoſure as if he had been an expected gueſt, began to diſcourſe on the weather,—its uncertainty, the heat of the public places in ſummer, the emptineſs of the town, and other ſuch common topics.
</p>
<p>
Nobody, however, anſwered him; Mr. Smith ſeemed afraid, young Branghton aſhamed, M. Du Bois amazed, Madame Duval enraged, and myſelf determined not to interfere. All that he could obtain, was the notice of Miſs Branghton, whoſe nods, ſmiles, and attention, had ſome ap
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
pearance of entering into converſation with him.
</p>
<p>
At length, growing tired, I ſuppoſe of engag
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing every body's eyes, and nobody's tongue, ad
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
dreſſing himſelf to Madame Duval and to me, he ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"I regard myſelf as peculiarly unfortunate, Ladies, in having fixed upon a time for my viſit to Howard Grove, when you are abſent from it."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"So I ſuppoſe, Sir, ſo I ſuppoſe,"</q>
cried Madame Duval, haſtily riſing, and the next mo
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ment as haſtily ſeating herſelf,
<q rend="inline">
"you'll be a want
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing of ſomebody to make your game of, and ſo you may think to get
<hi>me</hi>
there again;—but I pro
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
miſe you, Sir, you won't find it ſo eaſy a matter to make me a fool: and beſides that,"
</q>
raiſing her voice,
<q rend="inline">
"I've found you out, I aſſure you; ſo if ever you go to play your tricks upon me again, I'll make no more ado, but go directly to a juſtice of peace; ſo, Sir, if you can't think of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1259700102:6"/>
nothing but making people ride about the Coun
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
try, at all hours of the night, juſt for your di
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
verſion, why you'll find I know ſome juſtices, as well as Juſtice Tyrrel."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Sir Clement was evidently embarraſſed at this attack; yet he affected a look of ſurprize, and proteſted he did not underſtand her meaning.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Well"</q>
cried ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
"if I don't wonder where people can get ſuch impudence! if you'll ſay that, you'll ſay any thing; however, if you ſwear till you're black in the face, I ſhan't be
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
lieve you; for nobody ſhan't perſuade me out of my ſenſes, that I'll promiſe you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Doubtleſs not, Madam,"</q>
anſwered he, with ſome heſitation,
<q rend="inline">
"and I hope you do not ſuſpect I ever had ſuch an intention; my reſpect for you—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"O Sir, you're vaſtly polite, all of a ſud
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
den! but I know what it's all for;—it's only for what you can get!—you cou'd treat me like no
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
body at Howard Grove—but now you ſee I've a houſe of my own, you've a mind to wheedle yourſelf into it; but I ſees your deſign, ſo you need n't trouble yourſelf to take no more trouble about that, for you ſhall never get nothing at my houſe,—not ſo much as a diſh of tea:—ſo now, Sir, you ſee I can play you trick for trick."
</q>
</p>
<p>
There was ſomething ſo extremely groſs in this ſpeech, that it even diſconcerted Sir Clement, who was too much confounded to make any an
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſwer.
</p>
<p>
It was curious to obſerve the effect which his embarraſſment added to the freedom with which Madame Duval addreſſed him, had upon the reſt of the company: every one, who, before, ſeem
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed at a loſs how, or if at all, to occupy a chair, now filled it with the moſt eaſy compoſure: and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1259700102:7"/>
Mr. Smith, whoſe countenance had exhibited the moſt ſtriking picture of mortified envy, now be
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
gan to recover his uſual expreſſion of ſatisfied con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ceit.
</p>
<p>
Young Branghton, too, who had been appa
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
rently awed by the preſence of ſo fine a gentle
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<p>

<p>
O Sir Clement! thought I, is it thus you prize your honour!
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"

</q>
cried Madame Duval,
<q rend="inline">
"this is the moſt provokingeſt part of all! why you might as well tell me I don't know my own name."

</p>
<p>

<q rend="inline">
"Here is certainly ſome miſtake; for I aſſure you, Ma'am—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Don't aſſure me nothing,"</q>
cried Madame Duval, raiſing her voice,
<q rend="inline">
"I know what I'm ſaying, and ſo do you too; for did not you tell me all that about the Tower; and about M. Du Bois?—why M. Du Bois was n't never there, nor nigh it, and ſo it was all your own invention."

</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"May there not be two perſons of the ſame name? the miſtake was but natural—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Don't tell me of no miſtake, for it was all on purpoſe; beſides, did not you come, all in a maſk, to the chariot door, and help to get me put in that ditch?—I'll promiſe you, I've had the greateſt mind in the world to take the law of you, and if ever you do as much again, ſo I will, I aſſure you!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Here Miſs Branghton tittered; Mr. Smith ſmiled contemptuouſly, and young Branghton thruſt his handkerchief into his mouth to ſtop his laughter.
</p>
<p>
The ſituation of Sir Clement, who ſaw all that paſſed, became now very awkward, even to him
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſelf, and he ſtammered very much in ſaying,
<q rend="inline">
"ſurely, Madam—ſurely you—you cannot do me the—the injuſtice to think—that I had any ſhare in the—the—the misfortune which—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Ma foi,</hi>
Sir,"
</q>
cried Madame Duval, with encreaſing paſſion,
<q rend="inline">
"you'd beſt not ſtand talking to me at that rate; I know it
<hi>was</hi>
you,—and if you ſtay there, provoking me in ſuch a manner, I'll ſend for a Conſtable this minute."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Young Branghton, at theſe words, in ſpite of all his efforts, burſt into a loud laugh; nor could either his ſiſter, or Mr. Smith, though with more moderation, forbear joining in his mirth.
</p>
<p>
Sir Clement darted his eyes towards them, with looks of the moſt angry contempt, and then
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1259700102:9"/>
told Madame Duval, that he would not now detain her, to make his vindication, but would wait on her ſome time when ſhe was alone.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"O
<hi>pardie,</hi>
Sir,"
</q>
cried ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
"I don't deſire none of your company; and if you was n't the moſt impudenteſt perſon in the world, you would not dare look me in the face."
</q>
</p>
<p>
The ha, ha, ha's, and he, he, he's, grew more and more uncontroulable, as if the reſtraint from which they had burſt, had added to their vi

ing the object who excited them, and, having no anſwer ready for Madame Duval, he haſtily ſtalked towards Mr. Smith and young Branghton, and ſternly demanded what they laughed at?
</p>
<p>
Struck by the air of Importance which he aſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſumed, and alarmed at the angry tone of his voice, their merriment ceaſed, as inſtantaneouſly as if it had been directed by clock-work, and they ſtared fooliſhly, now at him, now at each other, without making any anſwer but a ſimple

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">

</q>
cried Madame Duval,
<q rend="inline">
"this is too much! pray, Sir, what buſineſs have you to come here a ordering people that comes to ſee me? I ſuppoſe, next, nobody muſt laugh but yourſelf!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"With me, Madam,"</q>
ſaid Sir Clement, bowing,
<q rend="inline">
"a

"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Then, advancing to me, who had ſat very qui

<q rend="inline">
Miſs Anville, I may at leaſt acquaint our friends at Howard Grove, that I had the honour of leav

</q>
and then, lowering his voice, he added,
<q rend="inline">
"For Heaven's ſake, my

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I beg my reſpects to all the family, Sir,"</q>
anſwered I, aloud,
<q rend="inline">"and I hope you will find them well."</q>
</p>
<p>
He looked at me reproachfully, but kiſſed my hand; and then, bowing to Madame Duval and Miſs Branghton, paſſed haſtily by the men, and made his exit.
</p>
<p>
I fancy he will not be very eager to repeat his viſits, for I ſhould imagine he has rarely, if ever, been before in a ſituation ſo awkward and diſa

<p>
THE laſt three evenings have paſſed tolerably quiet, for the Vauxhall adventures had given Madame Duval a ſurfeit of public places: home
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1259700102:11"/>
however, ſoon growing tireſome, ſhe determined to
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
night, ſhe ſaid, to relieve her
<hi>ennui,</hi>
by ſome amuſement; and it was therefore ſettled that we ſhould call upon the Branghtons, at their houſe, and thence proceed to Marybone Gardens.
</p>
<p>
But, before we reached Snow-Hill, we were caught in a ſhower of rain: we hurried into the ſhop, where the firſt object I ſaw was Mr. Ma
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cartney, with a book in his hand, ſeated in the ſame corner where I ſaw him laſt; but his looks were ſtill more wretched than before, his face yet thinner, and his eyes ſunk almoſt hollow into his head. He lifted them up as we entered, and I even thought that they emitted a gleam of joy: involuntarily, I made to him my firſt courteſy; he roſe and bowed, with a precipitation that ma
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nifeſted ſurprize and confuſion.
</p>
<p>
In a few minutes, we were joined by all the family, except Mr. Smith, who, fortunately, was engaged.
</p>
<p>
Had all the future proſperity of our lives de
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
pended upon the good or bad weather of this evening, it could not have been treated as a ſub
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ject of greater importance.
<q rend="inline">"Sure never any thing was ſo unlucky!—"</q>
<q rend="inline">
"Lord, how provok
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing!—"
</q>
<q rend="inline">
"It might rain for ever, if it would hold up now!—"
</q>
Theſe, and ſuch expreſſions, with many anxious obſervations upon the kennels, filled up all the converſation till the ſhower was over.
</p>
<p>
And then a very warm debate aroſe, whether we ſhould purſue our plan, or defer it to ſome finer evening; Miſs Branghtons were for the for
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
mer; their father was ſure it would rain again; Madame Duval, though ſhe deteſted returning home, yet dreaded the dampneſs of the gardens.
</p>
<p>
M. Du Bois then propoſed going to the top of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1259700102:12"/>
the houſe, to examine whether the clouds looked threatening or peaceable; Miſs Branghton ſtarting at this propoſal, ſaid they might go to Mr. Ma
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cartney's room, if they would, but not to her's.
</p>
<p>
This was enough for the brother; who, with a loud laugh, declared he would have ſome
<hi>fun,</hi>
and immediately led the way, calling to us all to follow. His ſiſters both ran after him, but no one elſe moved.
</p>
<p>
In a few minutes, young Branghton, coming half way down ſtairs, called out,
<q rend="inline">
"Lord, why don't you all come? why here's Poll's things all about the room!
</q>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Branghton then went, and Madame Du
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
val, who cannot bear to be excluded from whate
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ver is going forward, was handed up ſtairs by M. Du Bois.
</p>
<p>
I heſitated a few moments whether or not to join them; but, ſoon perceiving that Mr. Ma
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cartney had dropped his book, and that I en
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
groſſed his whole attention, I prepared, from mere embarraſſment, to follow them.
</p>
<p>
As I went, I heard him move from his chair, and walk ſlowly after me. Believing that he wiſhed to ſpeak to me, and earneſtly deſiring my
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſelf to know if, by your means, I could poſſibly be of any ſervice to him, I firſt ſlackened my pace, and then turned back. But, though I thus met him half-way, he ſeemed to want courage or reſolution to addreſs me; for, when he ſaw me returning, with a look extremely diſordered, he retreated haſtily from me.
</p>
<p>
Not knowing what I ought to do, I went to the ſtreet-door, where I ſtood ſome time, hoping he would be able to recover himſelf: but, on the con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
trary, his agitation encreaſed every moment; he walked up and down the room; in a quick, but
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1259700102:13"/>
unſteady pace, ſeeming equally diſtreſſed and irreſolute: and, at length, with a deep ſigh, he flung himſelf into a chair.
</p>
<p>
I was ſo much affected by the appearance of ſuch extreme anguiſh, that I could remain no lon
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ger in the room; I therefore glided by him, and went up ſtairs; but, ere I had gone five ſteps, he precipitately followed me, and, in a broken voice, called out,
<q rend="inline">"Madam!—for Heaven's ſake—"</q>
</p>
<p>
He ſtopped, but I inſtantly deſcended, reſtrain
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing, as well as I was able, the fullneſs of my own concern. I waited ſome time in painful expectati
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
on, for his ſpeaking: all that I had heard of his poverty, occurring to me, I was upon the point of preſenting him my purſe, but the fear of miſtak
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing or offending him, deterred me. Finding, however, that he continued ſilent, I ventured to ſay,
<q rend="inline">"Did you—Sir, wiſh to ſpeak to me?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I did!"</q>
cried he, with quickneſs,
<q rend="inline">"but now—I cannot!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Perhaps, Sir, another time,—perhaps if you recollect yourſelf—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Another time!"</q>
repeated he mournfully,
<q rend="inline">
"alas! I look not forward but to miſery and de
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſpair!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O Sir,"</q>
cried I, extremely ſhocked,
<q rend="inline">
"you muſt not talk thus!—if you forſake
<hi>yourſelf,</hi>
how can you expect—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I ſtopped.
<q rend="inline">"Tell me, tell me,</q>
"cried he, with eagerneſs,
<q rend="inline">
"who you are?—whence you come?—and by what ſtrange means you ſeem to be arbitreſs and ruler of the deſtiny of ſuch a wretch as I am?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Would to Heaven,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">"I could ſerve you!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You can!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1259700102:14"/>
<q rend="inline">"And how? pray tell me how?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"To tell you—is death to me! yet I
<hi>will</hi>
tell you,—I have a
<hi>right</hi>
to your aſſiſtance,—you have deprived me of the only reſource to which I could apply,—and therefore—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Pray, pray, ſpeak;"</q>
cried I, putting my hand into my pocket,
<q rend="inline">"they will be down ſtairs in a moment!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I will, Madam.—Can you—will you—I think you will!—may I then—"
</q>
he ſtopped and pauſed,
<q rend="inline">"ſay, will you—"</q>
then ſuddenly turning from me,
<q rend="inline">"Great Heaven! I cannot ſpeak!"</q>
and he went back to the ſhop.
</p>
<p>
I now put my purſe in my hand, and following him, ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"If indeed, Sir, I can aſſiſt you, why ſhould you deny me ſo great a ſatisfaction? Will you permit me to—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I dared not go on; but with a countenance ve
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ry much ſoftened, he approached me, and ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"Your voice, Madam, is the voice of Com
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
paſſion!—ſuch a voice as theſe ears have long been ſtrangers to!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Juſt then, young Branghton called out vehe
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
mently to me, to come up ſtairs; I ſeized the op
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
portunity of haſtening away: and therefore ſay
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing,
<q rend="inline">"Heaven, Sir, protect and comfort you!—"</q>
I let fall my purſe upon the ground, not daring to preſent it to him, and ran up ſtairs with the utmoſt ſwiftneſs.
</p>
<p>
Too well do I know you, my ever honoured Sir, to fear your diſpleaſure for this action: I muſt, however, aſſure you I ſhall need no freſh ſupply during my ſtay in town, as I am at little expence, and hope ſoon to return to Howard Grove.
</p>
<p>
Soon, did I ſay! when not a fortnight is yet
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1259700102:15"/>
expired, of the long and tedious month I muſt linger out here!
</p>
<p>
I had many witticiſms to endure from the Branghtons, upon account of my ſtaying ſo long with the
<hi>Scotch mope,</hi>
as they call him; but I at
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tend to them very little, for my whole heart was filled with pity and concern. I was very glad to find the Marybone ſcheme was deferred, another ſhower of rain having put a ſtop to the diſſention upon this ſubject; the reſt of the evening was employed in moſt violent quarrelling between Miſs Polly and her brother, on account of the diſcovery made by the latter, of the ſtate of her apartment.
</p>
<p>
We came home early; and I have ſtolen from Madame Duval and M. Du Bois, who is here for ever, to write to my beſt friend.
</p>
<p>
I am moſt ſincerely rejoiced that this opportu

lief was in my power, to this unhappy man; and I hope it will be ſufficient to enable him to pay his debts to this pitileſs family.

<p>
DISPLEASURE? my Evelina!—you have but done your duty; you have but ſhewn that humanity without which I ſhould bluſh to own my child. It is mine, however, to ſee that your generoſity be not repreſſed by your ſuffering from indulging it; I remit to you, therefore, not merely a token of my approbation, but an ac
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
knowledgment of my deſire to participate in your charity.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1259700102:16"/>
O my child, were my fortune equal to my con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
fidence in thy benevolence, with what tranſport ſhould I, through thy means, devote it to the re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
lief of indigent virtue! yet let us not repine at the limitation of our power, for, while our boun
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ty is proportioned to our ability, the difference of the greater or leſs donation, can weigh but little in the ſcale of Juſtice.
</p>
<p>
In reading your account of the miſguided man, whoſe miſery has ſo largely excited your compaſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſion, I am led to apprehend, that his unhappy ſi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tuation is leſs the effect of misfortune, than of miſconduct. If he is reduced to that ſtate of poverty repreſented by the Branghtons, he ſhould endeavour by activity and induſtry to retrieve his affairs; and not paſs his time in idle reading in the very ſhop of his creditor.
</p>
<p>
The piſtol ſcene made me ſhudder: the cou
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
rage with which you purſued this deſperate man, at once delighted and terrified me. Be ever thus, my deareſt Evelina, dauntleſs in the cauſe of diſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
treſs! let no weak fears, no timid doubts, deter you from the exertion of your duty, according to the fulleſt ſenſe of it that Nature has implanted in your mind. Though gentleneſs and Modeſty are the peculiar attributes of your ſex, yet fortitude and firmneſs, when occaſion demands them, are vir
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tues as noble and as becoming in women as in men: the right line of conduct is the ſame for both ſex
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
es, though the manner in which it is purſued, may ſomewhat vary, and be accommodated to the ſtrength or weakneſs of the different travellers.
</p>
<p>
There is, however, ſomething ſo myſterious in all you have yet ſeen or heard of this wretched man, that I am unwilling to ſtamp a bad impreſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſion of his character, upon ſo ſlight and partial a knowledge of it. Where any thing is doubtful, the ties of ſociety, and the laws of humanity,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1259700102:17"/>
claim a favourable interpretation; but remember, my dear child, that thoſe of diſcretion have an equal claim to your regard.
</p>
<p>
As to Sir Clement Willoughby, I know not how to expreſs my indignation at his conduct. Inſolence ſo unſufferable, and the implication of ſuſpicions ſo ſhocking, irritate me to a degree of wrath, which I hardly thought my almoſt worn
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
out paſſions were capable of again experiencing. You muſt converſe with him no more; he ima
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
gines, from the pliability of your temper, that he may offend you with impunity; but his beha
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
viour juſtifies, nay, calls for, your avowed re

ſentment: do not, therefore, heſitate in forbid
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ding him your ſight.
</p>
<p>
The Branghtons, Mr. Smith, and young Brown, however ill-bred and diſagreeable, are objects too contemptible for ſerious diſpleaſure: yet I grieve much that my Evelina ſhould be ex

poſed to their rudeneſs and impertinence.
</p>
<p>
The very day that this tedious month expires, I ſhall ſend Mrs. Clinton to town, who will ac

<p>
Your doubts concerning Mr. Macartney give me ſome uneaſineſs. Indeed, Sir, he has not the appearance of a man whoſe ſorrows are the effect of guilt. But I hope, ere I leave town, to be better acquainted with his ſituation, and enabled with more certainty of his worth, to recommend him to your favour.

Miſs Mirvan, in her laſt letter, informs me that he is now at Howard Grove, where he continues in high favour with the Captain, and is the life and ſpirit of the houſe. My time, ſince I wrote laſt, has paſſed very quietly; Madame Duval having been kept at home by a bad cold, and the Branghtons by bad weather. The young man, indeed, has called two or three times, and his behaviour, though equally abſurd, is more unaccountable than ever: he ſpeaks very little, takes hardly any notice of Madame Duval, and never looks at me, without a broad grin. Some
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
times he approaches me, as if with intention to

<q rend="inline">"If you were determined, Sir,"</q>
ſaid I,
<q rend="inline">
"in making me this offer, to allow me no choice of re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
fuſal or acceptance, I muſt think myſelf leſs oblig
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed to your intention, than I was willing to do.
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Dear Ma'am,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"you're ſo ſmart, there is no ſpeaking to you;—indeed, you are monſtrous ſmart, Ma'am! but come, your Grandmama ſhall aſk you, and then I know you'll not be ſo cruel."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Madame Duval was very ready to interfere; ſhe deſired me to make no further oppoſition, ſaid ſhe ſhould go herſelf, and inſiſted upon my accompanying her. It was in vain that I remon
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſtrated; I only incurred her anger, and Mr. Smith, having given both the tickets to Madame Duval, with an air of triumph, ſaid he ſhould call early in the evening, and took leave.
</p>
<p>
I was much chagrined at being thus compelled to owe even the ſhadow of an obligation to ſo for
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ward
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1259700102:20"/>
a young man; but I determined that nothing ſhould prevail upon me to dance with him, how
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ever my refuſal might give offence.
</p>
<p>
In the afternoon, when he returned, it was evident that he purpoſed to both charm and aſto
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
niſh me by his appearance; he was dreſſed in a very ſhewy manner, but without any taſte, and the inelegant ſmartneſs of his air and deport
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ment, his viſible ſtruggle, againſt education, to put on the fine gentleman, added to his frequent conſcious glances at a dreſs to which he was but little accuſtomed, very effectually deſtroyed his aim of
<hi>figuring,</hi>
and rendered all his efforts uſe
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
leſs.
</p>
<p>
During tea, entered Miſs Branghton and her brother. I was ſorry to obſerve the conſternation of the former, when ſhe perceived Mr. Smith. I had intended applying to her for advice upon this occaſion, but been always deterred by her diſa
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
greeable abruptneſs. Having caſt her eyes ſeve
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ral times from Mr. Smith to me, with manifeſt diſpleaſure, ſhe ſeated herſelf ſullenly in the win
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
dow, ſcarce anſwering Madame Duval's enqui
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ries, and, when I ſpoke to her, turning abſo
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
lutely away from me.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Smith, delighted at this mark of his im
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
portance, ſat indolently quiet on his chair, endea
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
vouring by his looks rather to diſplay, than to conceal, his inward ſatisfaction.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Good gracious!"</q>
cried young Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"why, you're all as fine as five-pence! Why, where are you going?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"To the Hampſtead Ball,"</q>
anſwered Mr. Smith.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"To a ball!"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">"Why, what, is Aunt going to a ball? Ha, ha, ha!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1259700102:21"/>
<q rend="inline">"Yes, to be ſure,"</q>
cried Madame Duval;
<q rend="inline">"I don't know nothing need hinder me."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"And pray, Aunt, will you dance too?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Perhaps I may; but I ſuppoſe, Sir, that's none of your buſineſs, whether I do or not."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Lord! well, I ſhould like to go! I ſhould like to ſee Aunt dance, of all things! But the joke is, I don't believe ſhe'll get ever a partner.
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You're the moſt rudeſt boy ever I ſee,"</q>
cried Madame Duval, angrily:
<q rend="inline">
"but, I promiſe you, I'll tell your father what you ſay, for I've no notion of ſuch rudeneſs."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why, Lord, Aunt, what are you ſo angry for? there's no ſpeaking a word, but you fly in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
to a paſſion: you're as bad as Biddy or Poll for that, for you're always a ſcolding."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I deſire, Tom,"</q>
cried Miſs Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"you'd ſpeak for yourſelf, and not make ſo free with my name."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"There, now, ſhe's up! there's nothing but quarrelling with the women: it's my belief they like it better than victuals and drink."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Fie, Tom,"</q>
cried Mr. Smith,
<q rend="inline">
"you ne
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ver remember your manners before the ladies: I'm ſure you never heard me ſpeak ſo rude to them."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why, Lord,
<hi>you</hi>
are a beau; but that's nothing to me. So, if you've a mind, you may be ſo polite as to dance with Aunt yourſelf."
</q>
Then with a loud laugh, he declared it would be
<hi>good fun</hi>
to ſee them.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Let it be never ſo good, or never ſo bad,"</q>
cried Madame Duval,
<q rend="inline">
"you won't ſee nothing of it, I promiſe you; ſo pray don't let me hear no more of ſuch vulgar pieces of fun; for, I aſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſure you, I don't like it. And as to my dancing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1259700102:22"/>
with Mr. Smith, you may ſee wonderfuller things than that any day in the week."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why, as to that, Ma'am,"</q>
ſaid Mr. Smith, looking much ſurpriſed,
<q rend="inline">
"I always thought you intended to play at cards, and ſo I thought to dance with the young lady."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I gladly ſeized this opportunity to make my declaration, that I ſhould not dance at all.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Not dance at all!"</q>
repeated Miſs Brangh
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ton;
<q rend="inline">
"yes, that's a likely matter truly, when peo
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ple go to balls."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I wiſh ſhe mayn't,"</q>
ſaid the brother;
<q rend="inline">
"cauſe then Mr. Smith will have nobody but Aunt for a partner. Lord, how mad he'll be!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O, as to that,"</q>
ſaid Mr. Smith,
<q rend="inline">
"I do'nt at all fear prevailing with the young lady, if once I get her to the room."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Indeed, Sir,"</q>
cried I, much offended by his conceit,
<q rend="inline">
"you are miſtaken; and therefore I beg leave to undeceive you, as you may be aſſur
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed my reſolution will not alter."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Then pray, Miſs, if it is not impertinent,"</q>
cried Miſs Branghton, ſneeringly,
<q rend="inline">"What do you go for?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Merely and ſolely,"</q>
anſwered I,
<q rend="inline">
"to com
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ply with the requeſt of Madame Duval."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Miſs,</q>
cried young Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"Bid only wiſhes it was ſhe, for ſhe has caſt a ſheep's-eye at Mr. Smith this long while."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Tom,"</q>
cried the ſiſter, riſing,
<q rend="inline">
"I've the greateſt mind in the world to box your ears! How dare you ſay ſuch a thing of me?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, hang it, Tom, no, that's wrong,"</q>
ſaid Mr. Smith, ſimpering,
<q rend="inline">
"it is indeed, to tell the lady's ſecrets.—But never mind him, Miſs Biddy, for I won't believe him."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why, I know Bid would give her ears to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1259700102:23"/>
go,"
</q>
returned the brother;
<q rend="inline">
"but only Mr. Smith likes Miſs beſt,—ſo does every body elſe."
</q>
</p>
<p>
While the ſiſter gave him a very angry anſwer, Mr. Smith ſaid to me, in a low voice,
<q rend="inline">
"Why now, Ma'am, how can you be ſo cruel as to be ſo much handſomer than your couſins? Nobody can look at them when you are by."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Miſs,"</q>
cried young Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"what
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ever he ſays to you, don't mind him, for he means no good; I'll give you my word for it, he'll never marry you, for he has told me again and again, he'll never marry as long as he lives; beſides, if he'd any mind to be married, there's Bid would have had him long ago, and thanked him too."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Come, come, Tom, don't tell ſecrets; you'll make the ladies afraid of me: but I aſſure you,"
</q>
lowering his voice,
<q rend="inline">
"if I
<hi>did</hi>
marry, it ſhould be your couſin."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<hi>Should</hi>
be!—did you ever, my dear Sir, hear ſuch unauthoriſed freedom? I looked at him with a contempt I did not wiſh to expreſs, and walked to the other end of the room.
</p>
<p>
Very ſoon after, Mr. Smith ſent for a hackney
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
coach. When I would have taken leave of Miſs Branghton, ſhe turned angrily from me, without making any anſwer. She ſuppoſes, perhaps, that I have rather ſought, than endeavoured to a
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
void, the notice and civilities of this conceited young man.
</p>
<p>
The ball was at the
<hi>long room</hi>
at Hampſtead.
</p>
<p>
This room ſeems very well named, for I be
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
lieve it would be difficult to find any other epi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
thet which might, with propriety, diſtinguiſh it, as it is without ornament, elegance, or any ſort of ſingularity, and merely to be marked by its length.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1259700102:24"/>
I was ſaved from the importunities of Mr. Smith, the beginning of the evening, by Madame Duval's declaring her intention to dance the two firſt dances with him herſelf. Mr. Smith's chagrin was very evident, but as ſhe paid no regard to it, he was neceſſitated to lead her out.
</p>
<p>
I was, however, by no means pleaſed, when ſhe ſaid ſhe was determined to dance a minuet. Indeed I was quite aſtoniſhed, not having had the leaſt idea ſhe would have conſented to, much leſs propoſed, ſuch an exhibition of her perſon.
</p>
<p>
She had ſome trouble to make her intentions known, as Mr. Smith was rather averſe to ſpeak
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing to the Maſter of the ceremonies.
</p>
<p>
During this minuet, how much did I rejoice in being ſurrounded only with ſtrangers! She danced in a ſtyle ſo uncommon; her age, her ſhowy dreſs, and an unuſual quantity of
<hi>rouge,</hi>
drew upon her the eyes, and, I fear, the deriſion of the whole company. Who ſhe danced with, I know not; but Smith was ſo ill-bred as to laugh at her very openly, and to ſpeak of her with as much ridi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cule as was in his power. But I would neither look at, nor liſten to him; nor would I ſuffer him to proceed with a ſpeech which he began, expreſſive of his vexation at being forced to dance with her. I told him, very gravely, that complaints upon ſuch a ſubject might, with leſs impropriety, be made to every perſon in the room, than to me.
</p>
<p>
When ſhe returned to us, ſhe diſtreſſed me ve
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ry much, by aſking what I thought of her minu
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
et. I ſpoke as civilly as I could, but the coldneſs of my compliment evidently diſappointed reh. She then called upon Mr. Smith to ſecure a good
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1259700102:25"/>
place among the country-dancers; and away they went, though not before he had taken the liberty to ſay to me in a low voice,
<q rend="inline">
"I proteſt to you, Ma'am, I ſhall be quite out of counte
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nance, if any of my acquaintance ſhould ſee me dancing with the old lady!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
For a few moments I very much rejoiced at be
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing relieved from this troubleſome man; but ſcarce had I time to congratulate myſelf, ere I was accoſted by another, who
<hi>begged the favour of hopping a dance</hi>
with me.
</p>
<p>
I told him that I ſhould not dance at all; but he thought proper to importune me, very freely, not to be ſo cruel; and I was obliged to aſſume no little haughtineſs ere I could ſatisfy him I was ſerious.
</p>
<p>
After this, I was addreſſed, much in the ſame manner, by ſeveral other young men, of whom the appearance and language were equally inele
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
gant and low-bred: ſo that I ſoon found my ſitu
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ation was both diſagreeable and improper; ſince, as I was quite alone, I fear I muſt ſeem rather to invite, than to forbid, the offers and notice I re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ceived. And yet, ſo great was my apprehenſion of this interpretation, that I am ſure, my dear Sir, you would have laughed had you ſeen how proud
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ly grave I appeared.
</p>
<p>
I knew not whether to be glad or ſorry, when Madame Duval and Mr. Smith returned. The latter inſtantly renewed his tireſome entreaties, and Madame Duval ſaid ſhe would go to the card
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
table: and, as ſoon as ſhe was accommodated, ſhe deſired us to join the dancers.
</p>
<p>
I will not trouble you with the arguments that followed. Mr. Smith teazed me till I was weary of reſiſtance; and I ſhould at laſt have been ob
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
liged to ſubmit, had I not fortunately recollected
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1259700102:26"/>
the affair of Mr. Lovel, and told my perſecutor, that it was impoſſible I ſhould dance with him, even if I wiſhed it, as I had refuſed ſeveral perſons in his abſence.
</p>
<p>
He was not contented with being extremely chagrined, but took the liberty, openly and warm
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ly, to expoſtulate with me upon not having ſaid I was engaged.
</p>
<p>
The total diſregard with which, involuntarily, I heard him, made him ſoon change the ſubject. In truth, I had no power to attend to him, for all my thoughts were occupied in re-tracing the tranſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
actions of the two former balls at which I had been preſent. The party—the converſation—the com
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
pany—O how great the contraſt!
</p>
<p>
In a ſhort time, however, he contrived to draw my attention to himſelf, by his extreme imperti
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nence; for he choſe to expreſs what he called his
<hi>admiration</hi>
of me, in terms ſo open and familiar, that he forced me to expreſs my diſpleaſure with equal plainneſs.
</p>
<p>
But how was I ſurpriſed, when I found he had the temerity—what elſe can I call it?—to impute my reſentment to doubts of his honour; for he ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"My dear Ma'am, you muſt be a little pa
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tient; I aſſure you I have no bad deſigns, I have not, upon my word; but, really, there is no re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſolving upon ſuch a thing as matrimony all at once; what with the loſs of one's liberty, and what with the ridicule of all one's acquaintance,—I aſſure you, Ma'am, you are the firſt lady who ever made me even demur upon this ſubject; for, after all, my dear Ma'am, marriage is the devil!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Your opinion, Sir,"</q>
anſwered I,
<q rend="inline">
"of either the married or the ſingle life, can be of no man
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ner of conſequence to me, and therefore I would
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1259700102:27"/>
by no means trouble you to diſcuſs their different merits."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why, really, Ma'am, as to your being a lit
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tle out of ſorts, I muſt own I can't wonder at it, for, to be ſure, marriage is all in all with the la
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
dies; but with us gentlemen it's quite another thing! Now only put yourſelf in my place,—ſup
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
poſe you had ſuch a large acquaintance of gentle
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
men as I have,—and that you had always been uſed to appear a little—a little ſmart among them,—why now, how ſhould you like to let yourſelf down all at once into a married man?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I could not tell what to anſwer; ſo much con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ceit, and ſo much ignorance, both aſtoniſhed and ſilenced me.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I aſſure you, Ma'am,"</q>
added he,
<q rend="inline">
"there is not only Miſs Biddy,—though I ſhould have ſcorned to mention her, if her brother had not blab'd, for I'm quite particular in keeping ladies ſecrets,—but there are a great many other ladies that have been propoſed to me,—but I never thought twice of any of them,—that is, not in a
<hi>ſerious</hi>
way,—ſo you may very well be proud,"
</q>
offering to take my hand,
<q rend="inline">
"for I aſſure you, there is nobody ſo likely to catch me at laſt as yourſelf."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Sir,"</q>
cried I, drawing myſelf back as haugh
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tily as I could,
<q rend="inline">
"you are totally miſtaken, if you imagine you have given me any pride I felt not be
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
fore, by this converſation; on the contrary, you muſt allow me to tell you, I find it too humilia
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ting to bear with it any longer."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I then placed myſelf behind the chair of Madame Duval; who, when ſhe heard of the partners I had refuſed, pitied my ignorance of the world, but no longer inſiſted upon my dancing.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1259700102:28"/>
Indeed, the extreme vanity of this man makes me exert a ſpirit which I did not, till now know that I poſſeſſed: but I cannot endure that he ſhould think me at his diſpoſal.
</p>
<p>
The reſt of the evening paſſed very quietly, as Mr. Smith did not attempt again to ſpeak to me; except, indeed, after we had left the room, and while Madame Duval was ſeating herſelf in the coach, he ſaid, in a voice of
<hi>pique,</hi>
<q rend="inline">
"Next time I take the trouble to get any tickets for a young lady, I'll make a bargain beforehand that ſhe ſha'n't turn me over to her grandmother."
</q>
</p>
<p>
We came home very ſafe; and thus ended this ſo long projected, and moſt diſagreeable affair.

<p>
IMPRESSED with the deepeſt, the moſt heart-felt ſenſe of the exalted humanity with which you have reſcued from deſtruction an un
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
happy ſtranger, allow me, with the humbleſt gra
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
titude, to offer you my fervent acknowledgments, and to implore your pardon for the terror I have cauſed you.
</p>
<p>
You bid me, Madam, live: I have now, in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
deed, a motive for life, ſince I ſhould not willing

ly
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1259700102:29"/>
quit the world, while I withhold from the needy and diſtreſſed any ſhare of that charity which a diſpoſition ſo noble would, otherwiſe, beſtow up
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
on them.
</p>
<p>
The benevolence with which you have intereſt
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed yourſelf in my concerns, induces me to ſuppoſe you would wiſh to be acquainted with the cauſe of that deſperation from which you ſnatched me, and the particulars of that miſery of which you have, ſo wonderfully, been a witneſs. Yet, as this ex
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
planation will require that I ſhould divulge ſecrets of a nature the moſt delicate, I muſt entreat you to regard them as ſacred, even though I forbear to mention the names of the parties concerned.
</p>
<p>
I was brought up in Scotland, though my mo
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ther, who had the ſole care of me, was an Eng
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
liſhman, and had not one relation in that country. She devoted to me her whole time. The retirement in which we lived, and the diſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tance from our natural friends, ſhe often told me were the effect of an unconquerable melancholy with which ſhe was ſeized, upon the ſudden loſs of my father, ſome time before I was born.
</p>
<p>
At Aberdeen, where I finiſhed my education, I formed a friendſhip with a young man of fortune, which I conſidered as the chief happineſs of my life;—but, when he quitted his ſtudies, I conſider
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed it as my chief misfortune, for he immediately prepared, by direction of his friends, to make the tour of Europe. For my part, deſigned for the church, and with no proſpect even of maintenance but from my own induſtry, I ſcarce dared permit even a wiſh of accompanying him. It is true, he would joyfully have borne my expences; but my affection was as free from meanneſs as his own, and I made a determination the moſt ſolemn never
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1259700102:30"/>
to leſſen its dignity, by ſubmitting to pecuniary obligations.
</p>
<p>
We correſponded with great regularity, and the moſt unbounded confidence, for the ſpace of two years, when he arrived at Lyons in his way home. He wrote me, thence, the moſt preſſing invitation to meet him at Paris, where he intended to remain for ſome time. My deſire to comply with his re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
queſt, and ſhorten our abſence, was ſo earneſt, that my mother, too indulgent to controul me, lent me what aſſiſtance was in her power, and, in an ill-fated moment I ſet out for that capital.
</p>
<p>
My meeting with this dear friend was the hap
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
pieſt event of my life: he introduced me to all his acquaintance; and ſo quickly did time ſeem to paſs at that delightful period, that the ſix weeks I had allotted for my ſtay were gone, ere I was ſen
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſible I had miſſed ſo many days. But I muſt now own, that the company of my friend was not the ſole ſubject of my felicity: I became acquainted with a young lady, daughter of an Engliſhman of diſtinction, with whom I formed an attachment which I have a thouſand times vowed, a thouſand times ſincerely thought would be laſting as my life. She had but juſt quitted a convent, in which ſhe had been placed when a child, and though Engliſh by birth, ſhe could ſcarcely ſpeak her na
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tive language. Her perſon and diſpoſition were equally engaging; but chiefly I adored her for the greatneſs of the expectations which, for my ſake, ſhe was willing to reſign.
</p>
<p>
When the time for my reſidence in Paris expir
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed, I was almoſt diſtracted at the idea of quitting it; yet I had not the courage to make our attach
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ment known to her father, who might reaſonably form for her ſuch views as would make him re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ject, with a contempt which I could not bear to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1259700102:31"/>
think of, ſuch an offer as mine. Yet I had free acceſs to the houſe, where ſhe ſeemed to be left almoſt wholly to the guidance of an old ſervant, who was my faſt friend.
</p>
<p>
But, to be brief, the ſudden and unexpected re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
turn of her father, one fatal afternoon, proved the beginning of the miſery which has ever ſince de
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
voured me. I doubt not but he had liſtened to our converſation, for he darted into the room with the rage of a madman. Heavens! what a ſcene followed!—what abuſive language did the ſhame of a clandeſtine affair, and the conſciouſneſs of acting ill, induce me to brook! At length, how
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ever, his fury exceeded my patience,—he called me a beggarly, cowardly Scotchman. Fired at the words, I drew my ſword; he, with equal alertneſs, drew his; for he was not an old man, but, on the contrary, ſtrong and able as myſelf. In vain his daughter pleaded;—in vain did I, re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
pentant of my anger, retreat;—his reproaches continued; myſelf, my country, were loaded with infamy,—till, no longer conſtraining my rage,—we fought,—and he fell!
</p>
<p>
At that moment I could almoſt have deſtroyed myſelf! The young lady fainted with terror; the old ſervant, drawn to us by the noiſe of the ſcuf
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
fle, entreated me to eſcape, and promiſed to bring intelligence of what ſhould paſs to my apartment. The diſturbance which I heard raiſed in the houſe obliged me to comply, and, in a ſtate of mind in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
conceivably wretched, I tore myſelf away.
</p>
<p>
My friend, who I found at home, ſoon diſcover
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed the whole affair. It was near midnight ere the woman came. She told me that her maſter was living, and her young miſtreſs reſtored to her ſen
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſes. The abſolute neceſſity for my leaving Paris, while any danger remained, was forcibly urged by
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1259700102:32"/>
my friend: the ſervant promiſed to acquaint him of whatever paſſed, and he, to tranſmit to me her information. Thus circumſtanced, with the aſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſiſtance of this dear friend, I effected my depar
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ture from Paris, and, not long after, I returned to Scotland. I would fain have ſtopped by the way, that I might have been nearer the ſcene of all my concerns, but the low ſtate of my finances denied me that ſatisfaction.
</p>
<p>
The miſerable ſituation of my mind was ſoon diſcovered by my mother; nor would ſhe reſt till I communicated the cauſe. She heard my whole ſtory with an agitation which aſtoniſhed me;—the
<hi>name</hi>
of the parties concerned, ſeemed to ſtrike her with horror;—but when I ſaid,
<hi>We fought, and he fell;</hi>
—
<q rend="inline">"My ſon,"</q>
cried ſhe,
<q rend="inline">"you have then murdered your father!"</q>
and ſhe ſunk breathleſs at my feet. Comments, Madam, upon ſuch a ſcene as this, would to you be ſuper
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
fluous, and to me agonizing: I cannot, for both our ſakes, be too conciſe. When ſhe recovered, ſhe confeſſed all the particulars of a tale which ſhe had hoped never to have revealed.—Alas! the loſs ſhe had ſuſtained of my father was not by death!—bound to her by no ties but thoſe of ho
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nour, he had voluntarily deſerted her!—Her ſet
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tling in Scotland was not the effect of choice,—ſhe was baniſhed thither by a family but too juſtly in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cenſed;—pardon, Madam, that I cannot be more explicit!
</p>
<p>
My ſenſes, in the greatneſs of my miſery, actu
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ally forſook me, and for more than a week I was wholly delirious. My unfortunate mother was yet more to be pitied, for ſhe pined with unmitigated ſorrow, eternally reproaching herſelf for the dan
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ger to which her too ſtrict ſilence had expoſed me. When I recovered my reaſon, my impatience to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1259700102:33"/>
hear from Paris almoſt deprived me of it again; and though the length of time I waited for letters might juſtly be attributed to contrary winds, I could not bear the delay, and was twenty times upon the point of returning thither at all hazards. At length, however, ſeveral letters arrived at once, and from the moſt inſupportable of my af
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
flictions I was then relieved, for they acquainted me that the horrors of parricide were not in reſerve for me. They informed me alſo, that as ſoon as the wound was healed, a journey would be made to England, where my unhappy
<hi>ſiſter</hi>
was to be received by an aunt with whom ſhe was to live.
</p>
<p>
This intelligence ſomewhat quieted the violence of my ſorrows. I inſtantly formed a plan of meet
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing them in London, and, by revealing the whole dreadful ſtory, convincing this irritated parent that he had nothing more to apprehend from his daugh
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ter's unfortunate choice. My mother conſented, and gave me a letter to prove the truth of my aſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſertions. As I could but ill afford to make this journey, I travelled in the cheapeſt way that was poſſible. I took an obſcure lodging, I need not, Madam, tell you where,—and boarded with the people of the houſe.
</p>
<p>
Here I languiſhed, week after week, vainly hoping for the arrival of my
<hi>family;</hi>
but my im
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
petuoſity had blinded me to the imprudence of which I was guilty in quitting Scotland ſo haſtily. My wounded father, after his recovery, relapſed; and when I had waited in the moſt comfortleſs ſi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tuation for ſix weeks, my friend wrote me word, that the journey was yet deferred for ſome time longer.
</p>
<p>
My finances were then nearly exhauſted, and I was obliged, though moſt unwillingly, to beg fur
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ther aſſiſtance from my mother, that I might re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
turn
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1259700102:34"/>
to Scotland. Oh! Madam!—my anſwer was not from herſelf,—it was written by a lady who had long been her companion, and acquainted me that ſhe had been taken ſuddenly ill of a fever,—and was no more!
</p>
<p>
The compaſſionate nature of which you have given ſuch noble proofs, aſſures me I need not, if I could, paint to you the anguiſh of a mind over
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
whelmed with ſuch accumulated ſorrows.
</p>
<p>
Incloſed was a letter to a near relation which ſhe had, during her illneſs, with much difficulty, written, and in which, with the ſtrongeſt mater
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nal tenderneſs, ſhe deſcribed my deplorable ſituati
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
on, and entreated his intereſt to procure me ſome preferment. Yet ſo ſunk was I by misfortune, that a fortnight elapſed ere I had the courage or ſpirit to attempt delivering this letter. I was then compelled to it by want. To make my appear
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ance with ſome decency, I was neceſſitated, my
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſelf, to the melancholy taſk of changing my co
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
loured cloaths for a ſuit of mourning;—and then I proceeded to ſeek my relation.
</p>
<p>I was informed that he was not in town.</p>
<p>
In this deſperate ſituation, the pride of my heart, which hitherto had not bowed to adverſity, gave way, and I determined to entreat the aſſiſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tance of my friend, whoſe offered ſervices I had a thouſand times rejected. Yet, Madam, ſo hard is it to root from the mind its favourite princi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ples, or prejudices, call them which you pleaſe, that I lingered another week ere I had the reſolu
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tion to ſend away a letter which I regarded as the death of my independence.
</p>
<p>
At length, reduced to my laſt ſhilling, dunned inſolently by the people of the houſe, and almoſt famiſhed, I ſealed this fatal letter, and, with a heavy heart, determined to take it to the poſt-office.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1259700102:35"/>
But Mr. Branghton and his ſon ſuffered me not to paſs through their ſhop with impunity; they inſulted me groſsly, and threatened me with im
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
priſonment, if I did not immediately ſatisfy their demands. Stung to the ſoul, I bid them have but a day's patience, and flung from them, in a ſtate of mind too terrible for deſcription.
</p>
<p>
My letter, which I now found would be receiv
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed too late to ſave me from diſgrace, I tore into a thouſand pieces, and ſcarce could I refrain from put
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ting an inſtantaneous, an unlicenſed period to my exiſtence.
</p>
<p>
In this diſorder of my ſenſes, I formed the hor
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
rible plan of turning foot-pad; for which purpoſe I returned to my lodging, and collected whatever of my apparel I could part with, which I immediately ſold, and with the profits purchaſed a brace of piſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tols, powder and ſhot. I hope, however, you will believe me, when I moſt ſolemnly aſſure you, my ſole intention was to
<hi>frighten</hi>
the paſſengers I ſhould aſſault, with theſe dangerous weapons, which I had not loaded, but from a reſolution,—a dreadful one, I own,—to ſave
<hi>myſelf</hi>
from an ig
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nominious death if ſeized. And, indeed, I thought if I could but procure money ſufficient to pay Mr. Branghton, and make a journey to Scotland, I ſhould ſoon be able, by the public papers, to diſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cover whom I had injured, and to make private retribution.
</p>
<p>
But, Madam, new to every ſpecies of villany, my perturbation was ſo great that I could with dif
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ficulty ſupport myſelf: yet the Branghtons obſerv
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed it not as I paſſed through the ſhop.
</p>
<p>
Here I ſtop: what followed is better known to yourſelf. But no time can ever efface from my memory that moment, when in the very action of preparing for my own deſtruction, or the lawleſs
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1259700102:36"/>
ſeizure of the property of others, you ruſhed in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
to the room, and arreſted my arm!—It was, in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
deed, an awful moment!—the hand of Providence ſeemed to intervene between me and eternity; I beheld you as an angel!—I thought you dropt from the clouds;—the earth, indeed, had never before preſented to my view a form ſo celeſtial!—What wonder, then, that a ſpectacle ſo aſtoniſh
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing ſhould, to a man diſordered as I was, appear too beautiful to be human?
</p>
<p>
And now, Madam, that I have performed this painful taſk, the more grateful one remains of re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
warding, as far as is in my power, your generous goodneſs, by aſſuring you it ſhall not be thrown away. You have awakened me to a ſenſe of the falſe pride by which I have been actuated,—a pride which, while it ſcorned aſſiſtance from a friend, ſcrupled not to compel it from a ſtranger, though at the hazard of reducing that ſtranger to a ſituation as deſtitute as my own. Yet, Oh! how violent was the ſtruggle which tore my con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
flicting ſoul, ere I could perſuade myſelf to profit by the benevolence which you were ſo evidently diſpoſed to exert in my favour!
</p>
<p>
By means of a ring, the gift of my much-re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
gretted mother, I have for the preſent ſatisfied Mr. Branghton; and by means of your compaſſion, I hope to ſupport myſelf, either till I hear from my friend, to whom, at length, I have written, or till the relation of my mother returns to town.
</p>
<p>
To talk to you, Madam, of paying my debt, would be vain; I never can! the ſervice you have done me exceeds all power of return; you have reſtored me to my ſenſes, you have taught me to curb thoſe paſſions which bereft me of them, and, ſince I cannot avoid calamity, to bear it as a man! An interpoſition ſo wonderfully circumſtanced can
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1259700102:37"/>
never be recollected without benefit. Yet allow me to ſay, the pecuniary part of my obligation muſt be ſettled by my firſt ability.

I am, Madam, with the moſt profound reſpect, and heart-felt gratitude,

<p>
O SIR, what an adventure have I to write!—all night it has occupied my thoughts, and I am now riſen thus early, to write it to you.
</p>
<p>
Yeſterday it was ſettled that we ſhould ſpend the evening in Marybone-gardens, where M. Torre, a celebrated foreigner, was to exhibit ſome fireworks. The party conſiſted of Madame Du
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
val, all the Branghtons, M. Du Bois, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Brown.
</p>
<p>
We were almoſt the firſt perſons who entered the Gardens, Mr. Branghton having declared he would have
<hi>all he could get for his money,</hi>
which, at beſt, was only fooled away, at ſuch ſilly and idle places.
</p>
<p>
We walked in parties, and very much detached from one another; Mr. Brown and Miſs Polly led the way by themſelves; Miſs Branghton and Mr. Smith followed, and the latter ſeemed determined to be revenged for my behaviour at the ball, by transferring all his former attention for me, to Miſs Branghton, who received it with an air of exulta
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tion:
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1259700102:38"/>
and very frequently they each of them, though from different motives, looked back, to diſcover whether I obſerved their good intelligence. Madame Duval walked with M. Du Bois; and Mr. Branghton by himſelf; but his ſon would wil
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
lingly have attached himſelf wholly to me, ſaying frequently,
<q rend="inline">
"Come, Miſs, let's you and I have a little fun together; you ſee they have all left us, ſo now let us leave them."
</q>
But I begged to be excuſed, and went to the other ſide of Madame Duval.
</p>
<p>
This Garden, as it is called, is neither ſtriking for magnificence nor for beauty; and we were all ſo dull and languid, that I was extremely glad when we were ſummoned to the orcheſtra, upon the opening of a concert; in the courſe of which, I had the pleaſure of hearing a concerto on the violin by Mr. Barthelemon, who, to me, ſeems a player of exquiſite fancy, feeling, and variety.
</p>
<p>
When notice was given us, that the fire-works were preparing, we hurried along to ſecure good places for the ſight: but, very ſoon, we were ſo encircled and incommoded by the crowd, that Mr. Smith propoſed the
<hi>ladies</hi>
ſhould make intereſt for a form to ſtand upon; this was ſoon effected, and the men then left us, to accommodate themſelves better, ſaying they would return the moment the exhibition was over.
</p>
<p>
The firework was really beautiful, and told, with wonderful ingenuity, the ſtory of Orpheus and Eurydice: but, at the moment of the fatal look, which ſeparated them for ever, there was ſuch an exploſion of fire, and ſo horrible a noiſe, that we all, as of one accord, jumpt haſtily from the form, and ran away ſome paces, fearing that we were in danger of miſchief, from the innume
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
rable ſparks of fire which glittered in the air.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1259700102:39"/>
For a moment or two, I neither knew nor con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſidered whither I had run; but my recollection was ſoon awakened by a ſtranger's addreſſing me with,
<q rend="inline">
"Come along with me, my dear, and I'll take care of you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I ſtarted, and then, to my great terror, per
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ceived that I had out-run all my companions, and ſaw not one human being I knew! with all the ſpeed in my power, and forgetful of my firſt fright, I haſtened back to the place I had left;—but found the form occupied by a new ſet of people.
</p>
<p>
In vain, from ſide to ſide, I looked for ſome face I knew; I found myſelf in the midſt of a crowd, yet without party, friend, or acquain
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tance. I walked, in diſordered haſte, from place to place, without knowing which way to turn, or whither I went. Every other moment, I was ſpoken to, by ſome bold and unfeeling man, to whom my diſtreſs, which, I think, muſt be very apparent, only furniſhed a pretence for impertinent witticiſms, or free gallantry.
</p>
<p>
At laſt, a young officer, marching fiercely up to me, ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"You are a ſweet pretty creature, and I enliſt you in my ſervice;"
</q>
and then, with great violence, he ſeized my hand. I ſcreamed aloud with fear, and, forcibly ſnatching it away, I ran haſtily up to two ladies, and cried,
<q rend="inline">
"For Heaven's ſake, dear ladies, afford me ſome pro
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tection!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
They heard me with a loud laugh, but very readily ſaid,
<q rend="inline">"Ay, let her walk between us;"</q>
and each of them took hold of an arm.
</p>
<p>
Then, in a drawling, ironical tone of voice, they aſked
<hi>what had frightened my little Ladyſhip?</hi>
I told them my adventure very ſimply, and en
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
treated
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1259700102:40"/>
they would have the goodneſs to aſſiſt me in finding my friends.
</p>
<p>
O yes, to be ſure, they ſaid, I ſhould not want for friends, whilſt I was with them. Mine, I ſaid, would be very grateful for any civilities with which they might favour me. But imagine, my dear Sir, how I muſt be confounded, when I obſerved, that every other word I ſpoke produced a loud laugh! However, I will not dwell upon a converſation, which ſoon, to my inexpreſſible horror, convinced me I had ſought protection from inſult, of thoſe who were themſelves moſt likely to offer it! You, my deareſt Sir, I well know, will both feel for, and pity my terror, which I have no words to deſcribe.
</p>
<p>
Had I been at liberty, I ſhould have inſtantly run away from them, when I made the ſhocking diſcovery; but, as they held me faſt, that was utterly impoſſible: and ſuch was my dread of their reſentment or abuſe, that I did not dare to make any open attempt to eſcape.
</p>
<p>
They aſked me a thouſand queſtions, accom
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
panied by as many hallows, of who I was, what I was, and whence I came. My anſwers were very incoherent,—but what, good Heaven! were my emotions, when a few moments afterwards, I perceived advancing our way, Lord Orville!
</p>
<p>
Never ſhall I forget what I felt at that inſtant: had I, indeed, been ſunk to the guilty ſtate, which ſuch companions might lead him to ſuſpect, I could ſcarce have had feelings more cruelly de
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
preſſing.
</p>
<p>
However, to my infinite joy, he paſſed us without diſtinguiſhing me; though I ſaw that, in a careleſs manner, his eyes ſurveyed the party,
</p>
<p>
As ſoon as he was gone, one of theſe unhappy women ſaid,
<q rend="inline">"Do you know that young fellow?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1259700102:41"/>
Not thinking it poſſible ſhe ſhould mean Lord Orville by ſuch a term, I readily anſwered,
<q rend="inline">""No, Madam."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why then,"</q>
anſwered ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
"you have a monſtrous good ſtare, for a little country Miſs."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I now found I had miſtaken her, but was glad to avoid an explanation.
</p>
<p>
A few minutes after, what was my delight, to hear the voice of Mr. Brown, who called out,
<q rend="inline">"Lord, i'n't that Miſs what's her name?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Thank God,"</q>
cried I, ſuddenly ſpringing from them both,
<q rend="inline">"thank God, I have found my party!</q>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Brown, was, however, alone, and, with
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
out knowing what I did, I took hold of his arm.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Lord, Miſs, cried he, we've had ſuch a hunt you can't think! ſome of them thought you was gone home; but I ſays, ſays I, I don't think ſays I, that ſhe'll like to go home all alone, ſays I."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"So that gentleman belongs to you, Miſs, does he?"</q>
ſaid one of the women.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">Yes, Madam,"</q>
anſwered I,
<q rend="inline">
"and I now thank you for your civility; but as I am ſafe, will not give you any further trouble."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I courtſied ſlightly, and would have walked away; but, moſt unfortunately, Madame Du
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
val and the two Miſs Branghtons juſt then joined us.
</p>
<p>
They all began to make a thouſand enquiries, to which I briefly anſwered, that I had been obliged to theſe two ladies for walking with me, and would tell them more another time: for, though I felt great
<hi>comparative</hi>
courage, I was yet too much intimidated by their preſence, to dare be explicit.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1259700102:42"/>
Nevertheleſs, I ventured, once more, to wiſh them good night, and propoſed ſeeking Mr. Branghton. Theſe unhappy women liſtened to all that was ſaid with a kind of callous curioſity, and ſeemed determined not to take any hint. But my vexation was terribly augmented, when, after having whiſpered ſomething to each other, they very cavalierly declared, that they intended join
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing our party! and then, one of them, very bold
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ly took hold of my arm, while the other, going round, ſeized that of Mr. Brown; and thus, al
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
moſt forcibly, we were moved on between them, and followed by Madame Duval and the Miſs Branghtons.
</p>
<p>
It would be very difficult to ſay which was greateſt, my fright, or Mr. Brown's conſternati
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
on; who ventured not to make the leaſt reſiſt
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ance, though his uneaſineſs made him tremble al
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
moſt as much as myſelf. I would inſtantly have withdrawn my arm; but it was held ſo tight, I could not move it; and poor Mr. Brown was cir
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cumſtanced in the ſame manner on the other ſide; for I heard him ſay,
<q rend="inline">
"Lord, Ma'am, there's no need to ſqueeze one's arm ſo!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
And this was our ſituation,—for we had not taken three ſteps, when,—O Sir,—we again met Lord Orville!—but not again did he paſs quietly by us,—unhappily I caught his eye;—both mine, immediately, were bent to the ground; but he approached me, and we all ſtopped.
</p>
<p>
I then looked up. He bowed. Good God, with what expreſſive eyes did he regard me! Ne
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ver were ſurpriſe and concern ſo ſtrongly marked,—yes, my dear Sir, he looked
<hi>greatly</hi>
concerned; and that, the remembrance of that, is the only conſolation I feel, for an evening the moſt pain
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ful of my life.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1259700102:43"/>
What he firſt ſaid, I know not; for, indeed, I ſeemed to have neither ears nor underſtanding; but I recollect that I only courtſied in ſilence. He pauſed for an inſtant, as if—I believe ſo,—as if unwilling to paſs on; but then, finding the whole party detained, he again bowed, and took leave.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, my dear Sir, I thought I ſhould have fainted, ſo great was my emotion from ſhame, vexation, and a thouſand other feelings, for which I have no expreſſions. I abſolutely tore myſelf from the woman's arm, and then, diſengaging myſelf from that of Mr. Brown, I went to Ma
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
dame Duval, and beſought that ſhe would not ſuf
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
fer me to be again parted from her.
</p>
<p>
I fancy—that Lord Orville ſaw what paſſed; for ſcarcely was I at liberty, ere he returned. Methought, my dear Sir, the pleaſure, the ſur
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
priſe of that moment, recompenſed me for all the chagrin I had before felt: for do you not think, that this return, manifeſts, from a character ſo quiet, ſo reſerved as Lord Orville's, ſomething like ſolicitude in my concerns?—ſuch at leaſt, was the interpretation I involuntarily made upon again ſeeing him.
</p>
<p>
With a politeneſs to which I have been ſome time very little uſed, he apologiſed for returning, and then enquired after the health of Mrs. Mirvan, and the reſt of the Howard Grove family. The flattering conjecture which I have juſt acknow
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ledged, had ſo wonderfully reſtored my ſpirits, that I believe I never anſwered him ſo readily, and with ſo little conſtraint. Very ſhort, however, was the duration of this converſation: for we were ſoon moſt diſagreeably interrupted.
</p>
<p>
The Miſs Branghtons, though they ſaw almoſt immediately the characters of the women to whom I had ſo unfortunately applied, were, never
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
theleſs,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1259700102:44"/>
ſo weak and fooliſh, as merely to
<hi>titter</hi>
at their behaviour. As to Madame Duval, ſhe was really for ſome time ſo ſtrangely impoſed upon, that ſhe thought they were two real fine ladies. Indeed it is wonderful to ſee how eaſily and how frequently ſhe is deceived: our diſturb
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ance, however, aroſe from young Brown, who was now between the two women, by whom his arms were abſolutely pinioned to his ſides: for a few minutes, his complaints had been only mur
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
mured; but he now called out aloud,
<q rend="inline">
"Good
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
neſs, Ladies, you hurt me like any thing! why I can't walk at all, if you keep pinching my arms ſo!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
This ſpeech raiſed a loud laugh in the women, and redoubled the tittering of the Miſs Brangh
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ton's. For my own part, I was moſt cruelly con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
fuſed; while the countenance of Lord Orville manifeſted a ſort of indignant aſtoniſhment; and, from that moment, he ſpoke to me no more, till he took leave.
</p>
<p>
Madame Duval who now began to ſuſpect her company, propoſed our taking the firſt box we ſaw empty, beſpeaking a ſupper, and waiting till Mr. Branghton ſhould find us.
</p>
<p>
Miſs Polly mentioned one ſhe had remarked, to which we all turned; Madame Duval inſtantly ſeated herſelf; and the two bold women, forcing the frightened Mr. Brown to go between them, fol
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
lowed her example.
</p>
<p>
Lord Orville, with an air of gravity that wound
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed my very ſoul, then wiſhed me good night. I ſaid not a word; but my face, if it had any con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nection with my heart, muſt have looked melan
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
choly indeed: and ſo, I have ſome reaſon to be

</q>
</p>
<p>
O how I changed colour at this unexpected re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
queſt!—yet what was the mortification I ſuffered, in anſwering,
<q rend="inline">"My Lord, I am—in Holborn!"</q>
</p>
<p>He then bowed and left us.</p>
<p>
What, what can he think of this adventure! how ſtrangely, how cruelly have all appearances turned againſt me! Had I been bleſſed with any preſence of mind, I ſhould inſtantly have explain
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed to him the accident which occaſioned my being in ſuch terrible company;—but I have none!
</p>
<p>
As to the reſt of the evening, I cannot relate the particulars of what paſſed; for, to you, I only write of what I think, and I can think of nothing but this unfortunate, this diſgraceful meeting. Theſe two poor women continued to torment us all, but eſpecially poor Mr. Brown, who ſeemed to afford them uncommon diverſion, till we were diſcovered by Mr. Branghton, who very ſoon found means to releaſe us from their perſecutions, by frightening them away. We ſtayed but a ſhort time after they left us, which was all employed in explanations.
</p>
<p>
Whatever may be the conſtruction which Lord Orville may put upon this affair, to me it cannot fail of being unfavourable; to be ſeen—gracious Heaven!—to be ſeen in company with two women of ſuch character!—How vainly, how proudly have I wiſhed to avoid meeting him when only with the Branghtons and Madame Duval,—but now, how joyful ſhould I be had he ſeen me to no greater diſadvantage!—Holborn, too! what a di
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
rection!—he who had always—but I will not tor
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ment you, my deareſt Sir, with any more of my mortifying conjectures and apprehenſions: perhaps he may call,—and then I ſhall have an opportunity
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1259700102:46"/>
of explaining to him all the moſt ſhocking part of the adventure. And yet, as I did not tell him at whoſe houſe I lived, he may not be able to diſco
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ver me; I merely ſaid
<hi>in Holborn,</hi>
and he, who I ſuppoſe ſaw my embarraſſment, forbore to aſk any other direction.
</p>
<p>Well, I muſt take my chance!</p>
<p>
Yet let me, in juſtice to Lord Orville, and in juſtice to the high opinion I have always enter
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tained of his honour and delicacy,—let me obſerve the difference of his behaviour, when nearly in the ſame ſituation to that of Sir Clement Wil
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
loughby. He had at leaſt equal cauſe to depreci
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ate me in his opinion, and to mortify and ſink me in my own: but far different was his conduct;—perplexed, indeed, he looked, and much ſurpriſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed,—but it was benevolently, not with inſolence. I am even inclined to think, that he could not ſee a young creature whom he had ſo lately known in a higher ſphere, appear ſo ſuddenly, ſo ſtrangely, ſo diſgracefully altered in her ſituation, without ſome pity and concern. But, whatever might be his doubts and ſuſpicions, far from ſuffering them to influence his behaviour, he ſpoke, he looked, with the ſame politeneſs and attention with which he had always honoured me when countenanced by Mrs. Mirvan.
</p>
<p>Once again, let me drop this ſubject.</p>

In every mortification, every diſturbance, how grateful to my heart, how ſweet to my recollecti

Holborn,

</opener>
<p>
LISTLESS, uneaſy, and without either ſpirit or courage to employ myſelf, from the time I had finiſhed my laſt letter, I indolently ſeated myſelf at the window, where, while I waited Madame Duval's ſummons to breakfaſt, I perceived, among the carriages which paſſed by, a coronet coach, and, in a few minutes, from the window of it, Lord Orville! I inſtantly retreated, but not, I believe, unſeen; for the coach immediately drove up to our door.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, my dear Sir, I muſt own I was greatly agitated; the idea of receiving Lord Orville by myſelf,—the knowledge that his viſit was entirely to
<hi>me,</hi>
—the wiſh of explaining the unfortunate adventure of yeſterday,—and the mortification of my preſent circumſtances,—all theſe thoughts, oc
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
curring to me nearly at the ſame time, occaſioned me more anxiety, confuſion, and perplexity, than I can poſſibly expreſs.
</p>
<p>
I believe he meant to ſend up his name; but the maid, unuſed to ſuch a ceremony, forgot it by the way, and only told me, that a great Lord was below, and deſired to ſee me: and, the next moment he appeared himſelf.
</p>
<p>
If formerly when in the circle of high life, and accuſtomed to its manners, I ſo much admired and diſtinguiſhed the grace, the elegance of Lord Orville, think, Sir, how they muſt ſtrike me now,—now, when, far removed from that ſplendid circle, I live with thoſe to whom even civility is unknown, and decorum a ſtranger!
</p>
<p>
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1259700102:48"/>
I am ſure I received him very awkwardly; de
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
preſſed by a ſituation ſo diſagreeable, could I do otherwiſe? When his firſt enquiries were made,
<q rend="inline">"I think myſelf very fortunate,"</q>
he ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"in meeting with Miſs Anville at home, and ſtill more ſo, in finding her diſengaged."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I only courtſied. He then talked of Mrs. Mir
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
van; aſked how long I had been in town, and other ſuch general queſtions, which, happily, gave me time to recover from my embarraſſment. After which, he ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"If Miſs Anville will al
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
low me the honour of ſitting by her a few minutes "(for we were both ſtanding)" I will venture to tell her the motive which, next to enquiring after her health, has prompted me to wait on her thus early."
</q>
</p>
<p>
We were then both ſeated, and, after a ſhort pauſe, he ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"How to apologize for ſo great a liberty as I am upon the point of taking, I know not; ſhall I, therefore, rely wholly upon your goodneſs, and not apologize at all?"
</q>
</p>
<p>I only bowed.</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I ſhould be extremely ſorry to appear imper
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tinent,—yet hardly know how to avoid it.
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Impertinent! O my Lord,"</q>
cried I, eagerly,
<q rend="inline">"that, I am ſure, is impoſſible!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You are very good,"</q>
anſwered he,
<q rend="inline">"and encourage me to be ingenuous—"</q>
</p>
<p>
Again he ſtopped; but my expectation was too great for ſpeech: at laſt, without looking at me, in a low voice and heſitating manner, he ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"Were thoſe Ladies with whom I ſaw you laſt night, ever in your company before?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, my Lord,"</q>
cried I, riſing, and colour
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing violently,
<q rend="inline">"nor will they ever be again."</q>
</p>
<p>
He roſe too, and, with an air of the moſt con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
deſcending concern, ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"Pardon, Madam, the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1259700102:49"/>
abruptneſs of a queſtion which I knew not how to introduce as I ought, and for which I have no excuſe to offer, but my reſpect for Mrs. Mirvan, joined to the ſincereſt wiſhes for your happineſs: yet I fear I have gone too far!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I am very ſenſible of the honour of your Lordſhip's attention,"
</q>
ſaid I,
<q rend="inline">"but—"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Permit me to aſſure you,"</q>
cried he, finding I heſitated,
<q rend="inline">
"that officiouſneſs is not my charac
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
teriſtic, and that I would by no means have riſked your diſpleaſure, had I not been fully ſatisfied you were too generous to be offended, without a real cauſe of offence."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Offended!"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">
no, my Lord, I am on
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ly grieved,—grieved, indeed! to find myſelf in a ſituation ſo unfortunate, as to be obliged to make explanations which cannot but mortify and ſhock me."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"It is I alone,"</q>
cried he, with ſome eagerneſs,
<q rend="inline">
"who am ſhocked, as it is I who deſerve to be mortified; I ſeek no explanation, for I have no doubt; but, in miſtaking me, Miſs Anville in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
jures herſelf: allow me, therefore, frankly and openly to tell you the intention of my viſit."
</q>
</p>
<p>I bowed, and we both returned to our ſeats.</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I will own myſelf to have been greatly ſur
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
priſed,"
</q>
continued he,
<q rend="inline">
"when I met you yeſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
terday evening, in company with two perſons who I was ſenſible merited not the honour of your notice; nor was it eaſy for me to conjec
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ture the cauſe of your being ſo ſituated; yet, be
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
lieve me, my incertitude did not for a moment do you injury; I was ſatisfied that their characters muſt be unknown to you, and I thought with con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cern of the ſhock you would ſuſtain, when you diſcovered their unworthineſs. I ſhould not, however, upon ſo ſhort an acquaintance, have
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1259700102:50"/>
uſurped the privilege of intimacy, in giving my unaſked ſentiments upon ſo delicate a ſubject, had I not known that credulity is the ſiſter of in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nocence, and therefore feared you might be de
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ceived. A ſomething, which I could not reſiſt, urged me to the freedom I have taken to caution you; but I ſhall not eaſily forgive myſelf, if I have been ſo unfortunate as to give you pain."
</q>
</p>
<p>
The pride which his firſt queſtion had excited, now ſubſided into delight and gratitude, and I in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſtantly related to him, as well as I could, the accident which had occaſioned my joining the un
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
happy women with whom he had met me. He liſtened with an attention ſo flattering, ſeemed ſo much intereſted during the recital, and, when I had done, thanked me, in terms ſo polite, for what he was pleaſed to call my condeſcenſion, that I was almoſt aſhamed either to look at, or hear him.
</p>
<p>
Soon after, the maid came to tell me, that Madame Duval deſired to have breakfaſt made in her own room.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I fear,"</q>
cried Lord Orville, inſtantly riſing,
<q rend="inline">
"that I have intruded upon your time,—yet who, ſo ſituated, could do otherwiſe?"
</q>
Then, taking my hand,
<q rend="inline">
"Will Miſs Anville allow me thus to ſeal my peace?"
</q>
He preſſed it to his lips, and took leave.
</p>
<p>
Generous, noble Lord Orville! how diſinte
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
reſted his conduct! how delicate his whole beha
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
viour! willing to adviſe, yet afraid to wound me!—Can I ever, in future, regret the adventure I met with at Marybone, ſince it has been product
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ive of a viſit ſo flattering? Had my mortificati
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ons been ſtill more humiliating, my terrors ſtill more alarming, ſuch a mark of eſteem—may I
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1259700102:51"/>
not call it ſo?—from Lord Orville, would have made me ample amends.
</p>
<p>
And indeed, my dear Sir, I require ſome con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſolation in my preſent very diſagreeable ſituation; for, ſince he went, two incidents have happened, that, had not my ſpirits been particularly elated, would greatly have diſconcerted me.
</p>
<p>
During breakfaſt, Madame Duval, very abrupt
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ly, aſked if I ſhould like to be married? and ad
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ded, that Mr. Branghton had been propoſing a match for me with his ſon. Surpriſed, and, I muſt own, provoked, I aſſured her that, in think
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing of me, Mr. Branghton would very vainly loſe his time.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why,"</q>
cried ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
"I have had grander views for you, myſelf, if once I could get you to Paris, and make you be owned; but, if I can't do that, and you can do no better, why, as you are both my relations, I think to leave my fortune between you, and then, if you marry, you never need want for nothing."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I begged her not to purſue the ſubject, as, I aſſured her, Mr. Branghton was totally diſagree
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
able to me: but ſhe continued her admonitions and reflections, with her uſual diſregard of what
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ever I could anſwer. She charged me, very pe
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
remptorily, neither wholly to diſcourage, nor yet to accept Mr. Branghton's offer, till ſhe ſaw what could be done for me: the young man, ſhe ad
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ded, had often intended to ſpeak to me himſelf, but, not well knowing how to introduce the ſub
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ject, he had deſired her to pave the way for him.
</p>
<p>
I ſcrupled not, warmly and freely to declare my averſion to this propoſal; but it was to no effect, as ſhe concluded, juſt as ſhe had begun, by ſaying, that I ſhould not
<hi>have him, if I could do better.</hi>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1259700102:52"/>
Nothing, however, ſhall perſuade me to liſten to any other perſon concerning this odious affair.
</p>
<p>
My ſecond cauſe of uneaſineſs ariſes, very un
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
expectedly, from M. Du Bois, who, to my infi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nite ſurpriſe, upon Madame Duval's quitting the room after dinner, put into my hand a note, and immediately left the houſe.
</p>
<p>
This note contains an open declaration of an attachment to me, which, he ſays, he ſhould ne
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ver have preſumed to have acknowledged, had he not been informed that Madame Duval deſtined my hand to young Branghton,—a match which he cannot endure to think of. He beſeeches me, earneſtly, to pardon his temerity, profeſſes the moſt inviolable reſpect, and commits his fate to time, patience, and pity.
</p>
<p>
This conduct in M. Du Bois gives me real con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cern, as I was diſpoſed to think very well of him. It will not, however, be difficult to diſcourage him, and therefore I ſhall not acquaint Madame Duval of his letter, as I have reaſon to believe it would greatly diſpleaſe her.

<p>
O SIR, how much uneaſineſs muſt I ſuffer, to counterbalance one ſhort morning of happineſs!
</p>
<p>
Yeſterday, the Branghtons propoſed a party to Kenſington-gardens, and, as uſual, Madame Du
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
val inſiſted upon my attendance.
</p>
<p>
We went in a hackney-coach to Piccadilly, and then had a walk through Hyde Park, which in any other company, would have been delightful. I
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1259700102:53"/>
was much pleaſed with Kenſington-gardens, and think them infinitely preferable to thoſe of Vauxhall.
</p>
<p>
Young Branghton was extremely troubleſome; he inſiſted upon walking by my ſide, and talked with me almoſt by compulſion: however, my re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſerve and coldneſs prevented his entering upon the hateful ſubject which Madame Duval had prepa
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
red me to apprehend. Once, indeed, when I was, accidentally, a few yards before the reſt, he ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"I ſuppoſe, Miſs, aunt has told you about you know what?—ha'n't ſhe, Miſs?"
</q>
—But I turned from him without making any anſwer. Neither Mr. Smith nor Mr. Brown were of the party; and poor M. Du Bois, when he found that I avoided him, looked ſo melancholy, that I was really ſorry for him.
</p>
<p>
While we were ſtrolling round the garden, I perceived, walking with a party of ladies at ſome diſtance, Lord Orville! I inſtantly retreated be
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
hind Miſs Branghton, and kept out of ſight till we had paſſed him: for I dreaded being ſeen by him again, in a public walk, with a party of which I was aſhamed.
</p>
<p>
Happily I ſucceeded in my deſign, and ſaw no more of him; for a ſudden and violent ſhower of rain made us all haſten out of the gardens. We ran till we came to a ſmall green-ſhop, where we begged ſhelter. Here we found ourſelves in com
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
pany with two footmen, whom the rain had dri
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ven into the ſhop. Their livery, I thought, I had before ſeen; and upon looking from the window, I perceived the ſame upon a coachman belonging to a carriage, which I immediately recollected to be Lord Orville's.
</p>
<p>
Fearing to be known, I whiſpered Miſs Brangh
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ton not to ſpeak my name. Had I conſidered but
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1259700102:54"/>
a moment, I ſhould have been ſenſible of the in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
utility of ſuch a caution, ſince not one of the party call me by any other appellation than that of
<hi>Couſin,</hi>
or of
<hi>Miſs;</hi>
but I am perpetually in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
volved in ſome diſtreſs or dilemma from my own heedleſſneſs.
</p>
<p>
This requeſt excited very ſtrongly her curioſi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ty; and ſhe attacked me with ſuch eagerneſs and bluntneſs of enquiry, that I could not avoid telling her the reaſon of my making it, and, conſequent
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ly, that I was known to Lord Orville: an acknow
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ledgment which proved the moſt unfortunate in the world; for ſhe would not reſt till ſhe had drawn from me the circumſtances attending my firſt making the acquaintance. Then, calling to her ſiſter, ſhe ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"Lord, Polly only think! Miſs has danced with a Lord!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Well,"</q>
cried Polly,
<q rend="inline">
"that's a thing I ſhould never have thought of! And pray, Miſs, what did he ſay to you?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
This queſtion was much ſooner aſked than an
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſwered; and they both became ſo very inquiſitive and earneſt, that they ſoon drew the attention of Madame Duval and the reſt of the party, to whom, in a very ſhort time, they repeated all they had gathered from me.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Goodneſs, then,"</q>
cried young Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"if I was Miſs, if I would not make free with his Lordſhip's coach to take me to town."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why ay,"</q>
ſaid the father,
<q rend="inline">
"there would be ſome ſenſe in that; that would be making ſome uſe of a Lord's acquaintance, for it would ſave us coach-hire."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Lord, Miſs,"</q>
cried Polly,
<q rend="inline">
"I wiſh you would, for I ſhould like of all things to ride in a coronet coach!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1259700102:55"/>
<q rend="inline">"I promiſe you,"</q>
ſaid Madame Duval,
<q rend="inline">
"I'm glad you've thought of it, for I don't ſee no ob
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
jection;—ſo let's have the coach-man called."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Not for the world,"</q>
cried I, very much alarmed,
<q rend="inline">"indeed it is utterly impoſſible."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why ſo?"</q>
demanded Mr. Branghton;
<q rend="inline">
"pray where's the good of your knowing a Lord, if you're never the better for him?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Ma foi,</hi>
child,"
</q>
ſaid Madame Duval,
<q rend="inline">
"you don't know no more of the world than if you was a baby. Pray, Sir, (to one of the footmen,) tell that coachman to draw up, for I wants to ſpeak to him."
</q>
</p>
<p>
The man ſtared, but did not move.
<q rend="inline">"Pray, pray, Madam,"</q>
ſaid I,
<q rend="inline">
"pray, Mr. Branghton, have the goodneſs to give up this plan; I know but very little of his Lordſhip, and cannot, upon any account, take ſo great a liberty."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Don't ſay nothing about it,"</q>
ſaid Madame Duval,
<q rend="inline">
"for I ſhall have it my own way: ſo if
<hi>you</hi>
won't call the coachman, Sir, I'll promiſe you I'll call him myſelf."
</q>
</p>
<p>
The footman, very impertinently, laughed and turned upon his heel. Madame Duval, extremely irritated, ran out in the rain, and beckoned the coachman, who inſtantly obeyed her ſummons. Shocked beyond all expreſſion, I flew after her, and entreated her with the utmoſt earneſtneſs, to let us return in a hackney-coach:—but oh!—ſhe is impenetrable to perſuaſion! She told the man ſhe wanted him to carry her directly to town, and that ſhe would anſwer for him to Lord Orville. The man, with a ſneer, thanked her, but ſaid he ſhould anſwer for himſelf; and was driving off, when another footman came up to him, with informati
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
on that his Lord was gone into Kenſington palace, and would not want him for an hour or two.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1259700102:56"/>
<q rend="inline">"Why then, friend,</q>
"ſaid Mr. Branghton, (for we were followed by all the party)
<q rend="inline">
"where will be the great harm of your taking us to town?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Beſides,"</q>
ſaid the ſon,
<q rend="inline">"I'll promiſe you a pot of beer for my own ſhare."</q>
</p>
<p>
Theſe ſpeeches had no other anſwer from the coachman than a loud laugh, which was echoed by the inſolent footmen. I rejoiced at their re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſiſtance, though I was certain, that if their Lord had witneſſed their impertinence, they would have been inſtantly diſmiſſed his ſervice.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Pardie,</hi>
"
</q>
cried Madame Duval,
<q rend="inline">
"if I don't think all the footmen are the moſt impu
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
denteſt fellows in the kingdom! But I'll promiſe you I'll have your maſter told of your airs, ſo you'll get no good by 'em."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why pray,"</q>
ſaid the coachman, rather alarmed,
<q rend="inline">"did my Lord give you leave to uſe the coach?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"It's no matter for that,"</q>
anſwered ſhe;
<q rend="inline">
"I'm ſure if he's a gentleman he'd let us have it ſooner than we ſhould be wet to the ſkin: but I'll promiſe you he ſhall know how ſaucy you've been, for this young lady knows him very well."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Ay, that ſhe does,"</q>
ſaid Miſs Polly;
<q rend="inline">"and ſhe's danced with him too.</q>
</p>
<p>
"Oh how I repented my fooliſh miſma
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nagement! The men bit their lips, and looked at one another in ſome confuſion. This was per
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ceived by our party, who, taking advantage of it, proteſted they would write Lord Orville word of their ill behaviour without delay. This quite ſtartled them, and one of the footmen offered to run to the palace, and aſk his Lord's permiſſion for our having the carriage.
</p>
<p>
This propoſal really made me tremble; and the Branghtons all hung back upon it: but Madame
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1259700102:57"/>
Duval is never to be diſſuaded from a ſcheme ſhe has once formed.
<q rend="inline">"Do ſo,"</q>
cried ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
"and give this child's compliments to your Maſter, and tell him, as we ha'n't no coach here, we ſhould be glad to go juſt as far as Holborn in his."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, no, no,!"</q>
cried I;
<q rend="inline">
"don't go,—I know nothing of his Lordſhip,—I ſend no meſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſage,—I have nothing to ſay to him!"

The men, very much perplexed, could with difficulty reſtrain themſelves from reſuming their impertinent mirth. Madame Duval ſcolded me very angrily, and then deſired them to go direct
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ly,
<q rend="inline">"Pray, then,"</q>
ſaid the coachman,
<q rend="inline">"what name is to be given to my Lord?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Anville,"</q>
anſwered Madame Duval,
<q rend="inline">
"tell him Miſs Anville wants the coach; the young la

dy he danced with once."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I was really in an agony: but the winds could not have been more deaf to me, than thoſe to whom I pleaded! and therefore the footman, urg
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed by the repeated threats of Madame Duval, and perhaps recollecting the name himſelf, actu
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ally went to the palace with this ſtrange meſſage!
</p>
<p>
He returned in a few minutes, and bowing to me with the greateſt reſpect, ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"My Lord deſires his compliments, and his carriage will be always at Miſs Anville's ſervice."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I was ſo much affected by this politeneſs, and chagrined at the whole affair, that I could ſcarce refrain from tears. Madame Duval and the Miſs Branghtons eagerly jumped into the coach, and deſired me to follow. I would rather have ſub
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
mitted to the ſevereſt puniſhment;—but all reſiſt
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ance was vain.
</p>
<p>
During the whole ride, I ſaid not a word; how
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1259700102:58"/>
at our lodgings; but when Madame Duval and I alighted, the Branghtons aſked if they could not be carried on to Snow-Hill? The ſervants, now all civility, made no objection. Remonſtrances from me, would, I too well kn

</p>
<p>
Seldom have I paſſed a night in greater uneaſi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
neſs:—ſo lately to have cleared myſelf in the good opinion of Lord Orville,—ſo ſoon to forfeit it!—to give him reaſon to ſuppoſe I preſumed to boaſt of his acquaintance,—to publiſh his having danced with me!—to take with him a liberty I ſhould have bluſhed to have taken with the moſt intimate of my friends!—to treat with ſuch im
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
pertinent freedom one who has honoured
<hi>me</hi>
with ſuch diſtinguiſhed reſpect!—indeed, Sir, I could have met with no accident that would ſo cruelly have tormented me!
</p>
<p>
If ſuch were, then, my feelings, imagine,—for I cannot deſcribe, what I ſuffered during the ſcene I am now going to write.
</p>
<p>
This morning, while I was alone in the dining
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
room, young Branghton called. He entered with a moſt important air, and ſtrutting up to me, ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"Miſs,
<hi>Lord Orville</hi>
ſends his compliments to you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Lord Orville!"</q>
—repeated I, much amazed.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Yes, Miſs, Lord Orville; for
<hi>I</hi>
know his Lordſhip now, as well as you,—And a very civil gentleman he is, for all he's a Lord."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"For Heaven's ſake,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">"explain yourſelf."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why you muſt know, Miſs, after we leſt you, we met with a little misfortune; but I don't mind it now, for it's all turned out for the beſt: but, juſt as we were a going up Snow-Hill, plump
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1259700102:59"/>
we comes againſt a cart, with ſuch a jog it almoſt pulled the coach-wheel off; however, that i'n't the worſt, for as I went to open the door in a hurry, a thinking the coach would be broke down, as ill-luck would have it, I never minded that the glaſs was up, and ſo I poked my head fairly through it. Only ſee, Miſs, how I've cut my forehead!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
A much worſe accident to himſelf, would not I believe, at that moment, have given me any concern for him: however, he proceeded with his account, for I was too much confounded to in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
terrupt him.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Goodneſs, Miſs, we were in ſuch a ſtew, us, and the ſervants, and all, as you can't think, for beſides the glaſs being broke, the coachman ſaid how the coach would'n't be ſafe to go back to Kenſington. So we did n't know what to do; however, the footmen ſaid they'd go and tell his Lordſhip what had happened. So then father grew quite uneaſy, like, for fear of his Lord
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſhip's taking offence, and prejudicing us in our buſineſs: ſo he ſaid I ſhould go this morning and aſk his pardon, 'cauſe of having broke the glaſs. So then I aſked the footman the direction, and they told me he lived in Berkley-ſquare; ſo this morning I went, and I ſoon found out the houſe."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You did!"</q>
cried I, quite out of breath with apprehenſion.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Yes, Miſs, and a very fine houſe it is. Did you ever ſee it?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"No!—why then, Miſs, I know more of his Lordſhip than you do, for all you knew him firſt. So, when I came to the door, I was in a peck of troubles, a thinking what I ſhould ſay to him; however, the ſervants had no mind I ſhould ſee
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1259700102:60"/>
him, for they told me he was buſy, but I might leave my meſſage. So I was juſt coming away, when I bethought myſelf to ſay I come from you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"From
<hi>me!</hi>
—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Yes, Miſs,—for you know why ſhould I have ſuch a long walk as that for nothing? So I ſays to the porter, ſays I, tell his Lordſhip, ſays I, one wants to ſpeak to him as comes from one Miſs Anville, ſays I."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Good God,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">
"and by what au

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Goodneſs, Miſs, don't be in ſuch a hurry, for you'll be as glad as me when you hear how well it all turned out. So then they made way for me, and ſaid his Lordſhip would ſee me di

rectly; and there I was led through ſuch a heap of ſervants, and ſo many rooms, that my heart quite miſgave me; for I thought, thinks I, he'll be ſo proud he'll hardly let me ſpeak; but he's no more proud than I am, and he was as civil at if I'd been a lord myſelf. So then I ſaid, I ho

ped he would n't take it amiſs about the glaſs, for it was quite an accident: but he bid me not men

tion it, for it did n't ſignify. And then he ſaid he hoped you got ſafe home, and was n't frightened; and ſo I ſaid yes, and I gave your duty to him."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My duty to him!"</q>
exclaimed I,—
<q rend="inline">"and who gave you leave?—who deſired you?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"O, I did it of my own head, juſt to make him think I came from you. But I ſhould have told you before how the footman ſaid he was go

ing out of town to-morrow evening, and that his ſiſter was ſoon to be married, and that he was a ordering a heap of things for that; ſo it come into my head, as he was ſo affable, that I'd aſk him for his cuſtom. So I ſays, ſays I, my Lord, ſays I, if your Lordſhip i'n't engaged particular

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You'll drive me wild,"</q>
(cried I, ſtarting from my ſeat)
<q rend="inline">
"you have done me an irrepara
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ble injury;—but I will hear no more!"
</q>
—and then I ran into my own room.
</p>
<p>
I was half frantic, I really raved; the good opinion of Lord Orville ſeemed now irretrievably loſt: a faint hope, which in the morning I had vainly encouraged, that I might ſee him again, and explain the tranſaction, wholly vaniſhed, now I found he was ſo ſoon to leave town: and I could not but conclude that, for the reſt of my life, he would regard me as an object of utter contempt.
</p>
<p>
The very idea was a dagger to my heart!—I could not ſupport it, and—but I bluſh to proceed—I fear your diſapprobation, yet I ſhould not be conſcious of having merited it, but that the repug
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nance I feel to relate to you what I have done, makes me ſuſpect I muſt have erred. Will you forgive me, if I own that I have
<hi>firſt</hi>
written an account of this tranſaction to Miſs Mirvan?—and that I even thought of
<hi>concealing</hi>
it from you?—Short-lived, however, was the ungrateful idea, and ſooner will I riſk the juſtice of your diſplea

ſure, than unworthily betray your generous confi

dence.

I applied to the maid of the houſe to get this note conveyed to Berkeley-ſquare; but ſcarce had I parted with it, ere I regretted having writ

YOU may now, my dear Sir, ſend Mrs. Clin

<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ther oppoſition will be made to her leaving this town; happy had it perhaps been for her had ſhe never entered it!
</p>
<p>
This morning Madame Duval deſired me to go to Snow-hill, with an invitation to the Branghtons and Mr. Smith, to ſpend the evening with her: and ſhe deſired M. Du Bois, who breakfaſted with us, to accompany me. I was very unwil
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ling to obey her, as I neither wiſhed to walk with M. Du Bois, nor yet to meet young Branghton. And, indeed, another, a yet more powerful rea
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſon, added to my reluctance,—for I thought it poſſible that Lord Orville might ſend ſome an

ſwer, or perhaps might call, during my ab
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſence; however, I did not dare diſpute her com
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
mands.
</p>
<p>
Poor M. Du Bois ſpoke not a word during our walk, which was, I believe, equally unpleaſant to us both. We found all the family aſſembled in the ſhop. Mr. Smith, the moment he per

ceived
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1259700102:64"/>
me, addreſſed himſelf to Miſs Branghton, whom he entertained with all the gallantry in his power. I rejoice to find that my conduct at the Hampſtead ball has had ſo good an effect. But young Branghton was extremely troubleſome, he repeatedly laughed in my face, and looked ſo im
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
pertinently ſignificant, that I was obliged to give up my reſerve to M. Du Bois, and enter into converſation with him, merely to avoid ſuch bold

neſs.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Miſs,"</q>
ſaid Mr. Branghton,
<q rend="inline">
"I'm ſorry to hear from my ſon that you was n't pleaſed with what we did about that Lord Orville; but I ſhould like to know what it was you found fault with, for we did all for the beſt."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Goodneſs!"</q>
cried the ſon,
<q rend="inline">
"why if you'd ſeen Miſs, you'd have been ſurpriſed,—ſhe went out of the room quite in a huff, like."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"It is too late, now,"</q>
ſaid I,
<q rend="inline">
"to reaſon up
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"As to me, Ma'am,"</q>
ſaid Mr. Smith,
<q rend="inline">
"I am much obliged to the old lady, but I've no mind to be taken in by her again; you'll excuſe me, Ma'am."
</q>
</p>
<p>
All the reſt promiſed to come, and I then took leave: but as I left the ſhop, I heard Mr. Branghton ſay,
<q rend="inline">"Take courage, Tom, ſhe's only coy."</q>
And, before I had walked ten yards, the youth followed.
</p>
<p>
I was ſo much offended that I would not look at him, but began to converſe with M. Du Bois, who was now more lively than I had ever before
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1259700102:65"/>
ſeen him; for, moſt unfortunately, he miſinter
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
preted the reaſon of my attention to him.
</p>
<p>
The firſt intelligence I received when I came home, was that two gentlemen had called, and left cards. I eagerly enquired for them, and read the names of Lord Orville and Sir Clement Wil
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
loughby. I by no means regretted that I miſſed ſeeing the latter, but perhaps I may all my life regret that I miſſed ſeeing the former, for proba
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
bly he has now left town,—and I may ſee him no more!
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My goodneſs!"</q>
cried young Branghton, rudely looking over me,
<q rend="inline">
"only think of that Lord's coming all this way! It's my belief he'd got ſome order ready for father, and ſo he'd a mind to call and aſk you if I'd told him the truth."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Pray, Betty,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">"how long has he been gone?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Not two minutes, Ma'am."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why then I'll lay you any wager,"</q>
ſaid young Branghton,
<q rend="inline">"he ſaw you and I a-walking up Holborn Hill!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"God forbid!"</q>
cried I, impatiently; and too much chagrined to bear with any more of his remarks, I ran up ſtairs: but I heard him ſay to M. Du Bois,
<q rend="inline">
"Miſs is ſo
<hi>uppiſh</hi>
this morning, that I think I had better not ſpeak to her again."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I wiſh M. Du Bois had taken the ſame reſolu

<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
room, which we found empty.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>
Vous ne l'aimez donc pas ce garcon, Made

"
</q>
cried he.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Me!"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">"no, I deteſt him!"</q>
for I was quite ſick at heart.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Ah, tu me rends la vie!</hi>
"
</q>
cried he, and ſlinging himſelf at my feet, he had juſt caught
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1259700102:66"/>
my hand, as the door was opened by Madame Duval.
</p>
<p>
Haſtily, and with marks of guilty confuſion in his face, he aroſe; but the rage of that lady quite amazed me! advancing to the retreating M. Du Bois, ſhe began, in French, an attack which her extreme wrath and wonderful volubili
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ty almoſt rendered unintelligible; yet I under
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſtood but too much, ſince her reproaches convin
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ced me ſhe had herſelf propoſed being the object of his affection.
</p>
<p>
He defended himſelf in a weak and evaſive manner, and upon her commanding him from her ſight, very readily withdrew: and then, with yet greater violence, ſhe upbraided me with having
<hi>ſeduced</hi>
his heart, called me an ungrateful, deſign
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing girl, and proteſted ſhe would neither take me to Paris, nor any more intereſt herſelf in my con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cerns, unleſs I would inſtantly agree to marry young Branghton.
</p>
<p>
Frightened as I had been at her vehemence, this propoſal reſtored all my courage; and I frank
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ly told her that in this point I never could obey her. More irritated than ever, ſhe ordered me to quit the room.
</p>
<p>
Such is the preſent ſituation of affairs. I ſhall excuſe myſelf from ſeeing the Branghtons this af
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ternoon: indeed, I never wiſh to ſee them again. I am ſorry, however innocently, that I have diſ

pleaſed Madame Duval, yet I ſhall be very glad to quit this town, for I believe it does not, now, contain one perſon I ever wiſh to again meet. Had I but ſeen Lord Orville, I ſhould regret no

MY ſweet Maria will be much ſurpriſed, and, I am willing to flatter myſelf, concerned, when, inſtead of her friend, ſhe receives this letter;—this cold, this inanimate letter, which will but ill expreſs the feelings of the heart which in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

</p>
<p>
When I wrote to you laſt Friday, I was in hourly expectation of ſeeing Mrs. Clinton, with whom I intended to have ſet out for Howard Grove; Mrs. Clinton came, but my plan was neceſſarily altered, for ſhe brought me a letter,—the ſweeteſt that ever was penned, from the beſt and kindeſt friend that ever orphan was bleſt with, requiring my immediate attendance at Ber
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ry Hill.
</p>
<p>
I obeyed,—and pardon me if I own I obeyed without reluctance; after ſo long a ſeparation, ſhould I not elſe have been the moſt ungrateful of mortals?—And yet,—oh Maria! though I
<hi>wiſhed</hi>
to leave London, the gratification of my wiſh afforded me no happineſs! and though I felt an impatience inexpreſſible to return hither, no words, no language can explain the heavineſs
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1259700102:69"/>

<hi>you,</hi>
in your kind and ſympathiſing boſom I might have ventured to have repoſed every ſecret of my ſoul; and then—but let me purſue my journal.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Clinton delivered Madame Duval a let
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ter from Mr. Villars, which requeſted her leave for my return, and indeed it was very readily accorded: yet, when ſhe found, by my wil
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
lingneſs to quit town, that M. Du Bois was re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ally indifferent to me, ſhe ſomewhat ſoftened in my favour, and declared that, but for puniſhing his folly in thinking of ſuch a child, ſhe would not have conſented to my being again buried in the country.
</p>
<p>
All the Branghtons called to take leave of me: but I will not write a word more about them; indeed I cannot with any patience think of that family, to whoſe forwardneſs and impertinence is owing all the uneaſineſs I at this moment ſuf
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

</p>
<p>
So great was the depreſſion of my ſpirits up
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
on the road, that it was with difficulty I could perſuade the worthy Mrs. Clinton I was not ill: but alas, the ſituation of my mind was ſuch as would have rendered any mere bodily pain, by compariſon, even enviable!
</p>
<p>
And yet, when we arrived at Berry Hill,—when the chaiſe ſtopped at this place,—how did my heart throb with joy! and when, through the window, I beheld the deareſt, the moſt ve

nearble of men, with uplifted hands, returning, as I doubt not, thanks for my ſafe arrival,—good God! I thought it would have burſt my boſom!—I opened the chaiſe-door myſelf, I

I ſprung forward, and with a pleaſure that bordered upon agony, I embraced his knees, I kiſſed his hands, I wept over them, but could not ſpeak: while he, now raiſing his eyes in thankfulneſs towards heaven, now bowing down his reverend head, and folding me in his arms, could ſcarce articulate the bleſſings with which his kind and benevolent heart overflowed.

I bluſh for what I have written: Can you, Maria, forgive my gravity? but I reſtrain it ſo much, and ſo painfully, in the preſence of Mr. Villars, that I know not how to deny myſelf the conſolation of indulging it to you.

<p>
What a letter! how has my proud heart ſwelled every line I have copied! What I wrote to him you know; tell me then, my dear friend, do you think it merited ſuch an anſwer?—and that I have deſervedly incurred the liberty he has taken? I meant nothing but a ſimple apology, which I thought as much due to my own character, as to his; yet, by the conſtruction he ſeems to have put upon it, ſhould you not have imagined it con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tained the avowal of ſentiments which might, in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
deed, have provoked his contempt?
</p>
<p>
The moment the letter was delivered to me, I retired to my own room to read it, and ſo eager was my firſt peruſal, that,—I am aſhamed to own it gave me no ſenſation but of delight. Unſuſpi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cious of any impropriety from Lord Orville, I perceived not immediately the impertinence it im
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
plied,—I only marked the expreſſions of his own regard; and I was ſo much ſurpriſed, that I was unable, for ſome time, to compoſe myſelf, or read it again,—I could only walk up and down the room, repeating to myſelf,
<q rend="inline">
"Good God, is it poſſible?—am I, then, loved by Lord Orville?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
But this dream was ſoon over, and I awoke to far different feelings; upon a ſecond reading I thought every word changed,—it did not ſeem the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1259700102:74"/>
ſame letter,—I could not find one ſentence that I could look at without bluſhing: my aſtoniſhment was extreme, and it was ſucceeded by the utmoſt indignation.
</p>
<p>
If, as I am very ready to acknowledge, I erred in writing to Lord Orville, was it for
<hi>him</hi>
to pu
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
niſh the error? If he was offended, could he not have been ſilent? If he thought my letter ill
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
judged, ſhould he not have pitied my ignorance? have conſidered my youth, and allowed for my inexperience.
</p>
<p>
Oh Maria, how have I been deceived in this man! Words have no power to tell the high opi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nion I had of him; to that was owing the unfor
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tunate ſolicitude which prompted my writing,—a ſolicitude I muſt for ever repent!
</p>
<p>
Yet perhaps I have rather reaſon to rejoice than to grieve, ſince this affair has ſhewn me his real diſpoſition, and removed that partiality, which, covering his every imperfection, left only his vir
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tues and good qualities expoſed to view. Had the deception continued much longer, had my mind re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ceived any additional prejudice in his favour, who knows whither my miſtaken ideas might have led me? Indeed I fear I was in greater danger than I apprehended, or can now think of without trembling,—for oh, if this weak heart of mine had been penetrated with too deep an impreſſion of his merit,—my peace and happineſs had been loſt for ever!
</p>
<p>
I would fain encourage more chearful thoughts, fain drive from my mind the melancholy that has taken poſſeſſion of it,—but I cannot ſucceed; for, added to the humiliating feelings which ſo power
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
fully oppreſs me, I have yet another cauſe of con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cern;—alas, my dear Maria, I have broken the tranquility of the beſt of men!
</p>
<p>
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1259700102:75"/>
I have never had the courage to ſhew him this cruel letter: I could not bear ſo greatly to depre
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ciate in his opinion, one whom I had, with infinite anxiety, raiſed in it myſelf. Indeed, my firſt determination was to confine my chagrin totally to my own boſom; but your friendly enquiries have drawn it from me; and now I wiſh I had made no concealment from the beginning, ſince I know not how to account for a gravity which not all my endeavours can entirely hide or re

preſs.
</p>
<p>
My greateſt apprehenſions is, leſt he ſhould imagine that my reſidence in London has given me a diſtaſte to the country. Every body I ſee takes notice of my being altered, and looking pale and ill. I ſhould be very indifferent to all ſuch obſervations, did I not perceive that they draw upon me the eyes of Mr. Villars, which gliſten with affectionate concern.
</p>
<p>
This morning, in ſpeaking of my London ex
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
pedition, he mentioned Lord Orville. I felt ſo much diſturbed, that I would inſtantly have changed the ſubject; but he would not allow me, and, very unexpectedly, he began his panegyric, extolling, in ſtrong terms, his manly and honou
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
rable behaviour in regard to the Marybone ad

venture. My cheeks glowed with indignation every word he ſpoke;—ſo lately as I had myſelf fancied him the nobleſt of his ſex, now that I was ſo well convinced of my miſtake, I could not bear to hear his undeſerved praiſes uttered by one ſo really good, ſo unſuſpecting, ſo pure of heart!
</p>
<p>
What he thought of my ſilence and uneaſineſs I fear to know, but I hope he will mention the ſubject no more. I will not, however, with un
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
grateful indolence, give way to a ſadneſs which

I find infectious to him who merits the moſt chearful exertion of my ſpirits. I am thankful that he has forborne to probe my wound, and I will endeavour to heal it by the conſciouſneſs that I have not deſerved the indignity I have received. Yet I cannot but lament to find myſelf in a world ſo deceitful, where we muſt ſuſpect what we ſee, diſtruſt what we hear, and doubt even what we feel!

<p>
I MUST own myſelf ſomewhat diſtreſſed how to anſwer your raillery: yet believe me, my dear Maria, your ſuggeſtions are thoſe of
<hi>fancy,</hi>
not of
<hi>truth.</hi>
I am unconſcious of the weakneſs you ſuſpect; yet, to diſpel your doubts, I will animate myſelf more than ever to conquer my chagrin, and to recover my ſpirits.
</p>
<p>
You wonder, you ſay, ſince my
<hi>heart</hi>
takes no part in this affair, why it ſhould make me ſo unhappy? And can you, acquainted as you are with the high opinion I entertained of Lord Or
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ville, can you wonder that ſo great a diſappoint
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ment in his character ſhould affect me? indeed, had ſo ſtrange a letter been ſent to me from
<hi>any</hi>
body, it could not have failed ſhocking me; how much more ſenſibly, then, muſt I feel ſuch an affront, when received from the man in the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:1259700102:77"/>
world I had imagined leaſt capable of giving it?
</p>
<p>
You are glad I made no reply; aſſure yourſelf, my dear friend, had this letter been the moſt re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſpectful that could be written, the clandeſtine air given to it, by his propoſal of ſending his ſer
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
vant for my anſwer, inſtead of having it directed to his houſe, would effectually have prevented my writing. Indeed, I have an averſion the moſt ſincere to all myſteries, all private actions; however fooliſhly and blameably, in regard to this letter, I have deviated from the open path which, from my earlieſt infancy, I was taught to tread.
</p>
<p>
He talks of my having
<hi>
commenced a correſpon
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
dence
</hi>
with him; and could Lord Orville indeed believe I had ſuch a deſign? believe me ſo for
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ward, ſo bold, ſo ſtrangely ridiculous? I know not if his man called or not, but I rejoice that I quitted London before he came, and without leaving any meſſage for him. What indeed, could I have ſaid? it would have been a conde
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſcenſion very unmerited, to have taken any, the leaſt notice of ſuch a letter.
</p>
<p>
Never ſhall I ceaſe to wonder how he could write it. Oh, Maria, what, what could induce him ſo cauſeleſsly to wound and affront one who would ſooner have died than wilfully offend
<hi>him?</hi>
—How mortifying a freedom of ſtyle! how cruel an implication conveyed by his
<hi>thanks,</hi>
and expreſſions of gratitude! Is it not aſtoniſhing, that any man can
<hi>appear</hi>
ſo modeſt, who is ſo vain?
</p>
<p>
Every hour I regret the ſecrecy I have obſerv
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed with my beloved Mr. Villars; I know not what bewitched me, but I felt, at firſt, a repug
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nance to publiſhing this affair that I could not ſur
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
mount,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:1259700102:78"/>
—and now, I am aſhamed of confeſſing that I have any thing to confeſs! Yet I deſerve to be puniſhed for the falſe delicacy which occaſi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
oned my ſilence; ſince, if Lord Orville him
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſelf was contented to forfeit his character, was it for me, almoſt at the expence of my own, to ſupport it?
</p>
<p>
Yet I believe I ſhould be very eaſy, now the firſt ſhock is over, and now that I ſee the whole affair with the reſentment it merits, did not all my good friends in this neighbourhood, who think me extremely altered, teaze me about my gravity, and torment Mr. Villars with obſervations upon my dejection, and falling away. The ſubject is no ſooner ſtarted, than a deep gloom overſpreads his venerable countenance, and he looks at me with a tenderneſs ſo melancholy, that I know not how to endure the conſciouſneſs of exci
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ting it.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Selwyn, a lady of large fortune, who lives about three miles from Berry Hill, and who has always honoured me with very diſtinguiſhing marks of regard, is going, in a ſhort time, to Briſtol, and has propoſed to Mr. Villars to take me with her, for the recovery of my health. He ſeemed very much diſtreſſed whether to conſent or refuſe; but I, without any heſitation, warmly oppoſed the ſcheme, proteſting my health could no where be better than in this pure air. He had the goodneſs to thank me for this readineſs to ſtay with him: but he is all goodneſs! Oh that it were in my power to be, indeed, what in the kindneſs of his heart he has called me, the comfort of his age, and ſolace of his infir
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
mities!
</p>
<p>
Never do I wiſh to be again ſeparated from him. If here I am grave, elſewhere I ſhould be
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1259700102:79"/>
unhappy. In his preſence, with a very little ex
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ertion, all the chearfulneſs of my diſpoſition ſeems ready to return; the benevolence of his counte
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nance reanimates, the harmony of his temper com
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
poſes, the purity of his character edifies me! I owe to him every thing; and, far from finding my debt of gratitude a weight, the firſt pride, firſt pleaſure of my life is the recollection of the obligations conferred upon me by a goodneſs ſo unequalled.
</p>
<p>
Once, indeed, I thought there exiſted another,—who, when
<hi>time had wintered o'er his locks,</hi>
would have ſhone forth among his fellow-crea
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tures, with the ſame brightneſs of worth which dignifies my honoured Mr. Villars; a brightneſs, how ſuperior in value to that which reſults from mere quickneſs of parts, wit, or imagination! a brightneſs, which, not contented with merely diffuſing ſmiles, and gaining admiration from the ſallies of the ſpirits, reflects a real and a glorious luſtre upon all mankind! Oh how great was my error! how ill did I judge! how cruelly have I been deceived!
</p>
<p>
I will not go to Briſtol, though Mrs. Selwyn is very urgent with me;—but I deſire not to ſee any more of the world; the few months I have already paſſed in it, have ſufficed to give me a diſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
guſt even to its name.
</p>
<p>
I hope, too, I ſhall ſee Lord Orville no more; accuſtomed, from my firſt knowledge of him, to regard him as a
<hi>being ſuperior to his race,</hi>
his pre
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſence, perhaps, might baniſh my reſentment, and I might forget his ill conduct,—for oh, Maria!—I ſhould not know how to ſee
<hi>Lord Orville</hi>
—and to think of diſpleaſure!
</p>
<p>
As a ſiſter I loved him,—I could have entruſt

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1259700102:80"/>

his delicacy, and ſo amiable his nature! I have a thouſand times ima

<p>
YOU complain of my ſilence, my dear Miſs Mirvan,—but what have I to write? Narrative does not offer, nor does a lively imagination ſup
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ply the deficiency. I have, however, at preſent, ſufficient matter for a letter, in relating a conver
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſation I had yeſterday with Mr. Villars.
</p>
<p>
Our breakfaſt had been the moſt chearful we have had ſince my return hither; and, when it was over, he did not, as uſual, retire to his ſtudy, but continued to converſe with me while I work
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed. We might, probably, have paſſed all the morning thus ſociably, but for the entrance of a farmer, who came to ſolicit advice concerning ſome domeſtic affairs. They withdrew together into the ſtudy.
</p>
<p>
The moment I was alone, my ſpirits failed me; the exertion with which I had ſupported them, had fatigued my mind: I flung away my work,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:1259700102:81"/>
and, leaning my arms on the table, gave way to a train of diſagreeable reflections, which, burſt
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing from the reſtraint that had ſmothered them, filled me with unuſual ſadneſs.
</p>
<p>
This was my ſituation, when, looking towards the door, which was open, I perceived Mr. Vil
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
lars, who was earneſtly regarding me,
<q rend="inline">
"Is Far
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
mer Smith gone, Sir?"
</q>
cried I, haſtily riſing, and ſnatching up my work.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Don't let me diſturb you,"</q>
ſaid he, grave
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ly;
<q rend="inline">"I will go again to my ſtudy."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Will you, Sir?—I was in hopes you were coming to ſit here."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"In hopes!—and why, Evelina, ſhould you hope it?"</q>
</p>
<p>
This queſtion was ſo unexpected, that I knew not how to anſwer it; but, as I ſaw he was mov
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing away, I followed, and begged him to re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
turn.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, my dear, no,"</q>
ſaid he, with a forced ſmile,
<q rend="inline">"I only interrupt your meditations."</q>
</p>
<p>
Again I knew not what to ſay; and while I he
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſitated, he retired. My heart was with him, but I had not the courage to follow. The idea of an explanation, brought on in ſo ſeri
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ous a manner, frightened me. I recollected the ſuſpicion
<hi>you</hi>
had drawn from my uneaſineſs, and I feared that he might make a ſimilar interpre
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tation.
</p>
<p>
Solitary and thoughtful, I paſſed the reſt of the morning in my own room. At dinner I a
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
gain attempted to be chearful; but Mr. Villars himſelf was grave, and I had not ſufficient ſpirits to ſupport a converſation merely by my own efforts. As ſoon as dinner was over, he took a book, and I walked to the window. I believe I remained near an hour in this ſituation. All
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1259700102:82"/>
my thoughts were directed to conſidering how I might diſpel the doubts which I apprehended Mr. Villars had formed, without acknowledging a circumſtance which I had ſuffered ſo much pain merely to conceal. But while I was thus planning for the future, I forgot the preſent; and ſo in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tent was I upon the ſubject which occupied me, that the ſtrange appearance of my unuſual in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
activity, and extreme thoughtfulneſs, never oc
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
curred to me. But when, at laſt, I recollected myſelf, and turned round, I ſaw that Mr. Vil
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
lars had parted with his book, and was wholly engroſſed in attending to me. I ſtarted from my reverie, and, hardly knowing what I ſaid, aſked if he had been reading?
</p>
<p>
He pauſed a moment, and then ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"Yes, my child;—a book that both afflicts and perplex
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
es me!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
He means
<hi>me,</hi>
thought I; and therefore I made no anſwer.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"What if we read it together?"</q>
continu
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed he,
<q rend="inline">
"will you aſſiſt me to clear its obſcur

</q>
</p>
<p>
I knew not what to ſay, but I ſighed, invo
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
luntarily, from the bottom of my heart. He roſe, and, approaching me, ſaid, with emotion,
<q rend="inline">
"My child, I can no longer be a ſilent wit

cried I, greatly alarmed,—

for which I will not make allowance. Tell me, therefore, what it is that thus afflicts us both, and who knows but I may ſuggeſt ſome means of relief?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You are too, too good,"</q>
cried I, greatly embarraſſed;
<q rend="inline">"but indeed I know not what you mean."</q>
</p>

</p>

"No, indeed!" I love it more than ever, and more than ever do I wiſh I had never, never quitted it!"

<q rend="inline">"I bluſh, indeed,"</q>
cried I,

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"It is too late, now,"</q>
anſwered he,
<q rend="inline">
"to re

Then ſeating himſelf, and making me ſit by him, he continued:
<q rend="inline">
"I muſt now gueſs again; perhaps you regret the loſs of thoſe friends you knew in town,—perhaps you miſs their ſo

ciety, and fear you may ſee them no more?—perhaps Lord Orville—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I could not keep my ſeat, but riſing haſtily, ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"Dear Sir, aſk me nothing more!—for I have nothing to own,—nothing to ſay;—my gravity has been merely accidental, and I can give no reaſon for it at all. Shall I fetch you ano
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ther book?—or will you have this again?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
For ſome minutes he was totally ſilent, and I pretended to employ myſelf in looking for a book. At laſt, with a deep ſigh,
<q rend="inline">"I ſee,"</q>
ſaid he,
<q rend="inline">
"I ſee, but too plainly, that though Evelina is returned,—I have loſt my child!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, Sir, no,"</q>
cried I, inexpreſſibly ſhock

ed,
<q rend="inline">
"ſhe is more yours than ever! Without you, the world would be a deſart to her, and life a burthen;—forgive her then, and—if you can,—condeſcend to be, once more, the confident of all her thoughts."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"How highly I value, how greatly I wiſh for her confidence,"
</q>
returned he,
<q rend="inline">
"ſhe cannot but know;—yet to extort, to tear it from her,—my juſtice, my affection, both revolt at the idea. I am ſorry that I was ſo earneſt with you;—leave me, my dear, leave me and compoſe yourſelf;—we will meet again at tea."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Do you then refuſe to hear me?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"No, but I abhor to compel you. I have long ſeen that your mind has been ill at eaſe, and mine has largely partaken of your concern: I forbore to queſtion you, for I hoped that time, and abſence from whatever excited your uneaſi

poſure, and we will talk of this matter ſome other time."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Oh Sir,"</q>
cried I, penetrated to the ſoul,
<q rend="inline">
"bid me not leave you!—think me not ſo loſt to feeling, to gratitude—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Not a word of that,"</q>
interrupted he;
<q rend="inline">
"it pains me you ſhould think upon that ſubject; pains me you ſhould ever remember that you have not a natural, an hereditary right to every thing within my power. I meant not to affect you thus,—I hoped to have ſoothed you!—but my anxiety betrayed me to an urgency that has diſtreſſed you. Comfort yourſelf, my love, and doubt not but that time will ſtand your friend, and all will end well."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I burſt into tears: with difficulty had I ſo long reſtrained them; for my heart, while it glowed with tenderneſs and gratitude, was oppreſſed with a ſenſe of its own unworthineſs.
<q rend="inline">"You are all, all goodneſs!"</q>
cried I, in a voice ſcarce audi

<q rend="inline">
"little as I deſerve,—unable as I am to re

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My deareſt child,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"I cannot bear to ſee thy tears;—for
<hi>my</hi>
ſake dry them,—ſuch a ſight is too much for me: think of that, Evelina, and take comfort, I charge thee!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:1259700102:86"/>
<q rend="inline">"Say then,"</q>
cried I, kneeling at his feet,
<q rend="inline">
"ſay then that you forgive me! that you par

</q>
</p>
<p>
He raiſed, he embraced me; he called me his ſole joy, his only earthly hope, and the child of his boſom! He folded me to his heart, and, while I wept from the fulneſs of mine, with words of ſweeteſt kindneſs and conſolation, he ſoothed and tranquiliſed me.
</p>
<p>
Dear to my remembrance will ever be that moment, when, baniſhing the reſerve I had ſo fooliſhly planned, and ſo painfully ſupported, I was reſtored to the confidence of the beſt of men!
</p>
<p>
When, at length, we were again quietly and compoſedly ſeated by each other, and Mr. Vil
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
lars waited for the explanation I had begged him to hear, I found myſelf extremely embarraſſed how to introduce the ſubject which muſt lead to it. He ſaw my diſtreſs, and, with a kind of benevolent pleaſantry, aſked me if I would let him
<hi>gueſs</hi>
any more? I aſſented in ſilence.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Shall I, then, go back to where I left off?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"If—if you pleaſe;—I believe ſo,—"</q>
ſaid I, ſtammering.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Well then, my love, I think, I was ſpeak

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:1259700102:87"/>
their good offices? Theſe are circumſtances that afford but melancholy reflections to young minds; and the affectionate diſpoſition of my Evelina, open to all ſocial feelings, muſt be hurt more than uſual by ſuch conſiderations.—You are ſilent, my dear?—Shall I name thoſe whom I think moſt worthy the regret I ſpeak of? We ſhall then ſee if our opinions coincide."
</q>
</p>
<p>Still I ſaid nothing, and he continued.</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"In your London journal, nobody appears in a more amiable, a more reſpectable light, than Lord Orville, and perhaps—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I knew what you would ſay,"</q>
cried I, haſt
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ily,
<q rend="inline">
"and I have long feared where your ſuſpi

</q>
</p>
<p>
I ſtopped; for Mr. Villars looked at me with ſuch infinite ſurpriſe, that my own warmth made me bluſh.
<q rend="inline">
"You

</q>
re

peated he.
</p>
<p>
I could make no anſwer, but took from my pocket-book the letter, and, giving it to him,
<q rend="inline">"See, Sir,"</q>
ſaid I,
<q rend="inline">
"how differently the ſame man can
<hi>talk,</hi>
and
<hi>write!</hi>
"
</q>
</p>
<p>
He read it three times ere he ſpoke; and then ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"I am ſo much aſtoniſhed, that I know not what I read. When had you this let

</q>
</p>
<p>
I told him. Again he read it; and, after con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſidering its contents ſome time, ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"I can form but one conjecture concerning this moſt ex
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
traordinary performance: he muſt certainly have been intoxicated when he wrote it."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Lord Orville intoxicated!"</q>
repeated I;
<q rend="inline">
"once I thought him a ſtranger to all intempe

rance,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:1259700102:88"/>
—but it is very poſſible, for I can believe any thing now."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"That a man who had behaved with ſo ſtrict a regard to delicacy,"
</q>
continued Mr. Villars,
<q rend="inline">
"and who, as far as occaſion had allowed, manifeſted ſentiments the moſt honourable, ſhould thus inſolently, thus wantonly, inſult a modeſt young woman, in his perfect ſenſes, I cannot think poſſible. But, my dear, you ſhould have incloſed this letter in an empty cover, and have returned it to him again: ſuch a reſentment would at once have become
<hi>your</hi>
character, and have given him an opportunity, in ſome mea
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſure, of clearing his own. He could not well have read this letter the next morning, without being ſenſible of the impropriety of having writ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ten it."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Oh Maria! why had not I this thought? I might then have received ſome apology; the mortification would then have been
<hi>his,</hi>
not
<hi>mine.</hi>
It is true, he could not have reinſtated himſelf ſo highly in my opinion as I had once ignorantly placed him, ſince the conviction of ſuch intem

perance would have levelled him with the reſt of his imperfect race; yet, my humbled pride might have been conſoled by his acknowledg

</p>
<p>
But why ſhould I allow myſelf to be humbled by a man who can ſuffer his reaſon to be thus ab
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
jectly debaſed, when I am exalted by one who knows no vice, and ſcarcely a failing,—but by hearſay? To think of his kindneſs, and reflect upon his praiſes, might animate and comfort me even in the midſt of affliction.

</q>
</p>
<p>
I will bid theſe words dwell ever in my memo

ry, and they ſhall chear, comfort, and enliven me! This converſation, though extremely af

</p>
<p>
And yet, though I am more at eaſe, I am far from well: I have been ſome time writing this letter; but I hope I ſhall ſend you, ſoon, a more chearful one.

YOU will be again ſurpriſed, my dear Maria, at ſeeing whence I date my letter: but I have been very ill, and Mr. Villars was ſo much alarmed, that he not only inſiſted upon my accompanying
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:1259700102:90"/>
Mrs. Selwyn hither, but earneſtly deſired ſhe would haſten her intended journey.
</p>
<p>
We travelled very ſlowly, and I did not find myſelf ſo much fatigued as I expected. We are ſituated upon a moſt delightful ſpot; the proſpect is beautiful, the air pure, and the weather very favourable to invalids. I am already better, and I doubt not but I ſhall ſoon be well; as well, in regard to mere health, as I wiſh to be.
</p>
<p>
I cannot expreſs the reluctance with which I parted from my reverend Mr. Villars: it was not like that parting which, laſt April, preceded my journey to Howard Grove, when, all expectati
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
on and hope, tho' I wept, I rejoiced, and though I ſincerely grieved to leave him, I yet wiſhed to be gone: the ſorrow I now felt was unmixed with any livelier ſenſation; expectation was vaniſhed, and hope I had none! All that I held moſt dear upon earth, I quitted, and that upon an errand to the ſucceſs of which I was totally indifferent, the re-eſtabliſhment of my health. Had it been to have ſeen my ſweet Maria, or her dear mo
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ther, I ſhould not have repined.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Selwyn is very kind and attentive to me. She is extremely clever; her underſtanding, in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
deed, may be called
<hi>maſculine;</hi>
but, unfortu
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nately, her manners deſerve the ſame epithet; for, in ſtudying to acquire the knowledge of the other ſex, ſhe has loſt all the ſoftneſs of her own. In regard to myſelf, however, as I have neither courage nor inclination to argue with her, I have never been perſonally hurt at her want of gentle
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
neſs; a virtue which, nevertheleſs, ſeems ſo eſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſential a part of the female character, that I find myſelf more awkward, and leſs at eaſe, with a woman who wants it, than I do with a man. She is not a favourite with Mr. Villars, who has often
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:1259700102:91"/>
been diſguſted at her unmerciful propenſity to ſa

</p>
<p>
I will continue to write to you, my dear Miſs Mirvan, with as much conſtancy as if I had no other correſpondent; tho', during my abſence from Berry Hill, my letters may, perhaps, be ſhortened on account of the minuteneſs of the journal which I muſt write to my beloved Mr. Villars: but you, who know his expectations, and how many ties bind me to fulfil them, will, I am ſure, rather excuſe any omiſſion to yourſelf, than any negligence to him.

<p>
THE firſt fortnight that I paſſed here, was ſo quiet, ſo ſerene, that it gave me reaſon to expect a ſettled calm during my ſtay; but if I may now judge of the time to come, by the preſent ſtate of my mind, the calm will be ſucceeded by a ſtorm, of which I dread the violence!
</p>
<p>
This morning, in my way to the pump-room, with Mrs. Selwyn, we were both very much in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
commoded by three gentlemen, who were ſaun
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tering by the ſide of the Avon, laughing and talking very loud, and lounging ſo diſagreeably that we knew not how to paſs them. They all three fixed their eyes very boldly upon me, al
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ternately
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1259700102:92"/>
looking under my hat, and whiſpering one another. Mrs. Selwyn aſſumed an air of un
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
common ſternneſs, and ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"You will pleaſe, gentlemen, either to proceed yourſelves, or to ſuffer us."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Oh! Ma'am,"</q>
cried one of them,
<q rend="inline">
"we will ſuffer
<hi>you,</hi>
with the greateſt pleaſure in life."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"You will ſuffer us
<hi>both,</hi>
"
</q>
anſwered ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
"or I am much miſtaken; you had better, therefore, make way quietly, for I ſhould be ſor
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ry to give my ſervant the trouble of teaching you better manners."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Her commanding air ſtruck them, yet they all choſe to laugh, and one of them wiſhed the fellow would begin his leſſon, that he might have the pleaſure of rolling him into the Avon; while ano
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ther, advancing to me with a freedom that made me ſtart, ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"By my ſoul, I did not know you!—but I am ſure I cannot be miſtaken;—had not I the honour of ſeeing you, once, at the Pantheon?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I then recollected the nobleman who, at that place, had ſo much embarraſſed me. I courtſied without ſpeaking. They all bowed, and making, though in a very eaſy manner, an apology to Mrs. Selwyn, they ſuffered us to paſs on, but choſe to accompany us.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"And where,"</q>
continued this Lord,
<q rend="inline">
"can you ſo long have hid yourſelf? do you know I have been in ſearch of you this age? I could nei
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ther find you out, nor hear of you; not a crea
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ture could inform me what was become of you. I cannot imagine where you could be immured. I went to two or three public places every night, in hopes of meeting you. Pray did you leave town?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Yes, my Lord."</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:1259700102:93"/>
<q rend="inline">
"So early in the ſeaſon!—what could poſſibly induce you to go before the birth-day?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I had nothing, my Lord, to do with the birth-day."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"By my ſoul, all the women who
<hi>had,</hi>
may rejoice you were away. Have you been here any time?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Not above a fortnight, my Lord."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"A fortnight!—how unlucky that I did not meet you ſooner! but I have had a run of ill luck ever ſince I came. How long ſhall you ſtay?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Indeed, my Lord, I don't know."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Six weeks, I hope; for I ſhall wiſh the place at the devil when you go."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Do you, then, flatter yourſelf, my Lord,"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Selwin, who had hitherto liſtened in ſi

</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Not at all,"</q>
anſwered Mrs. Selwyn;

"turn to Jack Coverley; he's the very man for you;—he'd be a wit himſelf if he was n't too modeſt."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Prithee, my Lord, be quiet,"</q>
returned the other;
<q rend="inline">
if the Lady is contented to beſtow all her favours upon
<hi>you,</hi>
why ſhould you make ſuch a point of my going ſnacks?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Don't be apprehenſive, Gentlemen,"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Selwyn, drily,
<q rend="inline">
"I am not romantic,—I have not the leaſt deſign of doing good to either of you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Have not you been ill ſince I ſaw you?"</q>
ſaid his Lordſhip, again addreſſing himſelf to me.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Yes, my Lord."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I thought ſo; you are paler than you was, and I ſuppoſe that's the reaſon I did not recollect you ſooner."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Has not your Lordſhip too much gallantry,"</q>
cried Mrs. Selwyn,
<q rend="inline">to diſcover a young lady's illneſs by her looks?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"The devil a word can I ſpeak for that wo
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
man,"
</q>
ſaid he, in a low voice;
<q rend="inline">"do, prithee, Jack, take her in hand."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Excuſe me, my Lord!"</q>
anſwered Mr. Coverley.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"When ſhall I ſee you again?"</q>
continued his Lordſhip;
<q rend="inline">"do you go to the pump-room every morning?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:1259700102:96"/>
<q rend="inline">"No, my Lord."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Do you ride out?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, my Lord."</q>
</p>
<p>
Juſt then we arrived at the pump-room, and an end was put to our converſation, if it is not an abuſe of words to give ſuch a term to a ſtring of rude queſtions and free compliments.
</p>
<p>
He had not opportunity to ſay much more to me, as Mrs. Selwyn joined a large party, and I walked home between two ladies. He had how
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ever, the curioſity to ſee us to the door.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Selwyn was very eager to know how I had made acquaintance with this nobleman, whoſe manners ſo evidently announced the character of a confirmed libertine: I could give her very lit
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tle ſatisfaction, as I was ignorant even of his name. But, in the afternoon, Mr. Ridgeway, the apo
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
thecary, gave us very ample information.
</p>
<p>
As his perſon was eaſily deſcribed, for he is remarkably tall, Mr. Ridgeway told us he was Lord Merton, a nobleman but lately come to his title, though he had already diſſipated more than half his fortune: a profeſſed admirer of beauty, but a man of moſt licentious character: that among men, his companions conſiſted chiefly of gamblers and jockies, and among women, he was rarely admitted.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Well, Miſs Anville,"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Selwyn,
<q rend="inline">
"I am glad I was not more civil to him. You may depend upon
<hi>me</hi>
for keeping him at a diſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tance."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O, Madam,"</q>
ſaid Mr. Ridgeway,
<q rend="inline">
"he may now be admitted any where, for he is going to
<hi>reform.</hi>
"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Has he, under that notion, perſuaded any fool to marry him?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1259700102:97"/>
<q rend="inline">
"Not yet, Madam, but a marriage is expect
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed to take place ſhortly: it has been ſome time in agitation, but the friends of the Lady have ob
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
liged her to wait till ſhe is of age: however, her brother, who has chiefly oppoſed the match, now that ſhe is near being at her own diſpoſal, is tolerably quiet. She is very pretty, and will have a large fortune. We expect her at the Wells every day."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"What is her name?"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Selwyn.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Larpent,"</q>
anſwered he,
<q rend="inline">"Lady Louiſa Larpent, ſiſter of Lord Orville."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Lord Orville!"</q>
repeated I, all amazement.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
Yes, Ma'am; his Lordſhip is coming with her. I have had certain information. They are to be at the honourable Mrs. Beaumont's. She is a re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
lation of my Lord's, and has a very fine houſe upon Clifton Hill."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<hi>His Lordſhip is coming with her!</hi>
—Good God, what an emotion did thoſe words give me! How ſtrange, my dear Sir, that, juſt at this time, he ſhould viſit Briſtol! It will be impoſſible for me to avoid ſeeing him, as Mrs. Selwyn is very well acquainted with Mrs. Beaumont. Indeed, I have had an eſcape in not being under the ſame roof with him, for Mrs. Beaumont invited us to her houſe immediately upon our arrival; but the in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
conveniency of being ſo diſtant from the pump
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
room made Mrs. Selwyn decline her civility.
</p>
<p>
Oh that the firſt meeting was over!—or that I could quit Briſtol without ſeeing him!—inexpreſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſibly do I dread an interview: ſhould the ſame impertinent freedom be expreſſed by his looks, which dictated his cruel letter, I ſhall not know how to endure either him or myſelf. Had I but returned it, I ſhould be eaſier, becauſe my ſenti
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ments of it would then be known to him; but
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:1259700102:98"/>
now, he can only gather them from my behavi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
our, and I tremble leſt he ſhould miſtake my in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
dignation for confuſion!—leſt he ſhould miſcon
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſtrue my reſerve into embarraſſment!—for how, my deareſt Sir, how ſhall I be able totally to di
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
veſt myſelf of the reſpect with which I have been uſed to think of him?—the pleaſure with which I have been uſed to ſee him?
</p>
<p>
Surely he, as well as I, muſt think of the letter at the moment of our meeting, and he will, pro
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
bably, mean to gather my thoughts of it from my looks;—oh that they could but convey to him my real deteſtation of impertinence and vanity! then would he ſee how much he had miſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
taken my diſpoſition when he imagined them my due.
</p>
<p>
There was a time, when the very idea that ſuch a man as Lord Merton would ever be con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nected with Lord Orville, would have both ſurpriſed and ſhocked me, and even yet I am pleaſed to hear of his repugnance to the mar
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
riage.
</p>
<p>
But how ſtrange, that a man of ſo abandoned a character ſhould be the choice of a ſiſter of Lord Orville! and how ſtrange that, almoſt at the moment of the union, he ſhould be ſo im
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
portunate in gallantry to another woman! What a world is this we live in! how corrupt, how de
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
generate! well might I be contented to ſee no more of it! If I find that the
<hi>eyes</hi>
of Lord Orville agree with his
<hi>pen,</hi>
—I ſhall then think, that of all mankind, the only virtuous individual reſides at Berry Hill!

<p>
OH Sir, Lord Orville is ſtill himſelf! ſtill, what from the moment I beheld, I believed him to be, all that was amiable in man! and your hap
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
py Evelina, reſtored at once to ſpirits and tran
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
quility, is no longer ſunk in her own opinion, nor diſcontented with the world;—no longer, with dejected eyes, ſees the proſpect of paſſing her fu
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ture days in ſadneſs, doubt, and ſuſpicion!—with revived courage ſhe now looks forward, and ex
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
pects to meet with goodneſs, even among man
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
kind;—though ſtill ſhe feels, as ſtrongly as ever, the folly of hoping, in any
<hi>ſecond</hi>
inſtance, to meet with
<hi>perfection.</hi>
</p>
<p>
Your conjecture was certainly right; Lord Orville, when he wrote that letter, could not be in his ſenſes. Oh that intemperance ſhould have power to degrade ſo low, a man ſo noble!
</p>
<p>
This morning I accompanied Mrs. Selwyn to Clifton Hill, where, beautifully ſituated, is the houſe of Mrs. Beaumont. Moſt uncomfortable were my feelings during our walk, which was very ſlow, for the agitation of my mind made me more than uſually ſenſible how weak I ſtill conti
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nue. As we entered the houſe, I ſummoned all my reſolution to my aid, determined rather to die than give Lord Orville reaſon to attribute my weakneſs to a wrong cauſe. I was happily reliev
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed from my perturbation, when I ſaw Mrs. Beau
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
mont was alone. We ſat with her for, I believe,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1259700102:100"/>
an hour without interruption, and then we ſaw a phaeton drive up to the gate, and a lady and gen
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tleman alight from it.
</p>
<p>
They entered the parlour with the eaſe of peo
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ple who were at home. The gentleman, I ſoon ſaw, was Lord Merton; he came ſhuffling into the room with his boots on, and his whip in his hand; and, having made ſomething like a bow to Mrs. Beaumont, he turned towards me. His ſur
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
priſe was very evident, but he took no manner of notice of me. He waited, I believe, to diſcover, firſt, what chance had brought me to that houſe, where he did not look much rejoiced at meeting me. He ſeated himſelf very quietly at the win
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
dow, without ſpeaking to any body.
</p>
<p>
Mean time, the lady, who ſeemed very young, hobbling rather than walking into the room, made a paſſing courtſie to Mrs. Beaumont, ſaying,
<q rend="inline">"How are you, Ma'am?"</q>
and then, without noticing any body elſe, with an air of languor, ſhe flung herſelf upon a ſofa, proteſting, in a moſt affected voice, and ſpeaking ſo ſoftly ſhe could hardly be heard, that ſhe was fatigued to death.
<q rend="inline">
"Really, Ma'am, the roads are ſo monſtrous duſty,—you can't imagine how troubleſome the duſt is to one's eyes!—and the ſun, too, is mon
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſtrous diſagreeable!—I dare ſay I ſhall be ſo tanned I ſha'n't be fit to be ſeen this age. Indeed, my Lord, I won't go out with you any more, for you don't care where you take one."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Upon my honour,"</q>
ſaid Lord Merton,
<q rend="inline">
"I took you the pleaſanteſt ride in England; the fault was in the ſun not me."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Your Lordſhip is in the right,"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Selwyn,
<q rend="inline">
"to transfer the fault to the
<hi>ſun,</hi>
becauſe it has ſo many excellencies to counterbalance par
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tial
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1259700102:101"/>
inconveniencies, that a
<hi>little</hi>
blame will not in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
jure
<hi>that</hi>
in our eſtimation."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Lord Merton looked by no means delighted at this attack; which I believe ſhe would not ſo readily have made, but to revenge his neglect of us.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Did you meet your brother, Lady Louiſa?"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Beaumont.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"No, Ma'am. Is he rode out this morn
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I then found, what I had before ſuſpected, that this Lady was Lord Orville's ſiſter: how ſtrange, that ſuch near relations ſhould be ſo different to each other! There is, indeed, ſome reſemblance in their features, but in their manners, not the leaſt.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Yes,"</q>
anſwered Mrs. Beaumont,
<q rend="inline">"and I believe he wiſhed to ſee you."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My Lord drove ſo monſtrous faſt,"</q>
ſaid Lady Louiſa,
<q rend="inline">
"that perhaps we paſſed him. He frighted me out of my ſenſes; I declare my head is quite giddy. Do you know, Ma'am, we have done nothing but quarrel all the morning?—You can't think how I've ſcolded;—have not I, my Lord?"
</q>
and ſhe ſmiled expreſſively at Lord Merton.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You have been, as you always are,"</q>
ſaid he, twiſting his whip with his fingers,
<q rend="inline">"all ſweetneſs."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O fie, my Lord,"</q>
cried ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
"I know you don't think ſo; I know you think me very ill
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
natured;—don't you, my Lord?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"No, upon my honour;—how can your Ladyſhip aſk ſuch a queſtion? Pray how goes time? my watch ſtands."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"It is almoſt three,"</q>
anſwered Mrs. Beau
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
mont.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1259700102:102"/>
<q rend="inline">"Lord, Ma'am, you frighten me!"</q>
cried Lady Louiſa; and then turning to Lord Merton,
<q rend="inline">
"why now, you wicked creature, you, did not you tell me it was but one?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Selwyn then roſe to take leave; but Mrs. Beaumont aſked if ſhe would look at the ſhrubbery.
<q rend="inline">"I ſhould like it much,"</q>
anſwered ſhe,
<q rend="inline">"but that I fear to fatigue Miſs Anville."</q>
</p>
<p>
Lady Louiſa then, raiſing her head from her hand, on which it had leant, turned round to look at me, and, having fully ſatisfied her curioſity, without any regard to the confuſion it gave me, turned about, and, again leaning on her hand, took no further notice of me.
</p>
<p>
I declared myſelf very able to walk, and begged that I might accompany them.
<q rend="inline">
"What ſay
<hi>you,</hi>
Lady Louiſa,"
</q>
cried Mrs. Beaumont,
<q rend="inline">"to a ſtrole in the garden?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Me, Ma'am!—I declare I can't ſtir a ſtep; the heat is ſo exceſſive, it would kill me. I'm half dead with it already; beſides, I ſhall have no time to dreſs. Will any body be here to day, Ma'am?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I believe not, unleſs Lord Merton will fa
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
vour us with his company."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"With great pleaſure, Madam."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Well, I declare you don't deſerve to be aſk
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed,"
</q>
cried Lady Louiſa,
<q rend="inline">
"you wicked creature, you!—I
<hi>muſt</hi>
tell you one thing, Ma'am,—you can't think how abominable he was! do you know we met Mr. Lovel in his new phaeton, and my Lord was ſo cruel as to drive againſt it?—we real
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ly flew. I declare I could not breathe. Upon my word, my Lord, I'll never truſt myſelf with you again,—I won't indeed!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
We then went into the garden, leaving them to diſcuſs the point at their leiſure.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:1259700102:103"/>
Do you remember a
<hi>
pretty but affected young la
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
dy
</hi>
I mentioned to have ſeen, in Lord Orville's party, at the Pantheon? How little did I then imagine her to be his ſiſter! yet Lady Louiſa Lar
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
pent is the very perſon. I can now account for the piqued manner of her ſpeaking to Lord Mer
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ton that evening, and I can now account for the air of diſpleaſure with which Lord Orville mark
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed the undue attention of his future brother-in-law to me.
</p>
<p>
We had not walked long, ere, at a diſtance, I perceived Lord Orville, who ſeemed juſt diſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
mounted from his horſe, enter the garden, All my perturbation returned at the ſight of him!—yet I endeavoured to repreſs every feel
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing but reſentment. As he approached us, he bowed to the whole party; but I turned away my head, to avoid taking any ſhare in his civi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
lity. Addreſſing himſelf immediately to Mrs. Beaumont, he was beginning to enquire after his ſiſter, but upon ſeeing my face, he ſudden
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ly exclaimed
<q rend="inline">"Miſs Anville!—"</q>
and then he advanced, and made his compliments to me,—not with an air of vanity or impertinence, nor yet with a look of conſciouſneſs or ſhame,—but with a countenance open, manly, and charm
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing!—with a ſmile that indicated pleaſure, and eyes that ſparkled with delight! on
<hi>my</hi>
ſide was all the conſciouſneſs, for by him, I really believe, the letter was, at that moment, entirely forgot
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ten.
</p>
<p>
With what politeneſs did he addreſs me! with what ſweetneſs did he look at me! the very tone of his voice ſeemed flattering! he congra
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tulated himſelf upon his good fortune in meet
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing with me,—hoped I ſhould ſpend ſome time at Briſtol, and enquired, even with anxiety en
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
quired,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1259700102:104"/>
if my health was the cauſe of my journey, in which caſe his ſatisfaction would be converted into apprehenſion.
</p>
<p>
Yet, ſtruck as I was with his manner, and charmed to find him ſuch as he was wont to be, imagine not, my dear Sir, that I forgot the reſentment I owe him, or the cauſe he has given me of diſpleaſure; no, my behaviour was ſuch as, I hope, had you ſeen, you would not have diſapproved: I was grave and diſtant, I ſcarce looked at him when he ſpoke, or anſwered him when he was ſilent.
</p>
<p>
As he muſt certainly obſerve this alteration in my conduct, I think it could not fail making him both recollect and repent the provocation he had ſo cauſeleſsly given me: for ſurely he was not ſo wholly loſt to reaſon, as to be now ignorant he had ever offended me.
</p>
<p>
The moment that, without abſolute rudeneſs, I was able, I turned entirely from him, and aſked Mrs. Selwyn if we ſhould not be late home. How Lord Orville looked I know not, for I avoided meeting his eyes, but he did not ſpeak another word as we proceeded to the garden-gate. Indeed I believe my abruptneſs ſurpriſed him, for he did not ſeem to expect I had ſo much ſpirit. And, to own the truth, convinced as I was of the propriety, nay, ne
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ceſſity of ſhewing my diſpleaſure, I yet almoſt hated myſelf for receiving his politeneſs ſo un
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
graciouſly.
</p>
<p>
When we were taking leave, my eyes accident
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ally meeting his, I could not but obſerve that his gravity equalled my own, for it had entirely tak
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
en place of the ſmiles and good-humour with which he had met me.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1259700102:105"/>
<q rend="inline">"I am afraid this young Lady,"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Beaumont,
<q rend="inline">
"is too weak for another long walk till ſhe is again reſted."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"If the Ladies will truſt to my driving,"</q>
ſaid Lord Orville,
<q rend="inline">
"and are not afraid of a phaeton, mine ſhall be ready in a moment."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You are very good, my Lord,"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Selwyn,
<q rend="inline">
"but my will is yet unſigned, and I don't chuſe to venture in a phaeton with a young man while that is the caſe."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O,"</q>
cried Mrs. Beaumont,
<q rend="inline">
"you need not be afraid of my Lord Orville, for he is remark
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ably careful."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Well, Miſs Anville,"</q>
anſwered ſhe,
<q rend="inline">"what ſay you?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Indeed,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">"I had much rather walk.—"</q>
But then, looking at Lord Orville, I perceived in his face a ſurpriſe ſo ſerious at my abrupt refuſal, that I could not forbear adding,
<q rend="inline">
"for I ſhould be ſorry to occaſion ſo much trou
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ble."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Lord Orville brightening at theſe words, came forward, and preſſed his offer in a manner not to be denied;—ſo the phaeton was ordered! And in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
deed, my dear Sir,—I know not how it was,—but, from that moment, my coldneſs and reſerve inſenſibly wore away! You muſt not be angry;—it was my intention, nay, my endeavour, to ſup
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
port them with firmneſs; but, when I formed the plan, I thought only of the letter,—not of Lord Orville;—and how is it poſſible for reſentment to ſubſiſt without provocation? yet, believe me, my deareſt Sir, had he ſuſtained the part he began to act when he wrote the ever-to-be regretted letter, your Evelina would not have forfeited her title to your eſteem, by contentedly ſubmitting to be treat
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed with indignity.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1259700102:106"/>
We continued in the garden till the phaeton was ready. When we parted from Mrs. Beau
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
mont, ſhe repeated her invitation to Mrs. Selwyn to accept an apartment in her houſe, but the ſame reaſons made it be again declined.
</p>
<p>
Lord Orville drove very ſlow, and ſo cautiouſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ly, that, notwithſtanding the height of the phae
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ton, fear would have been ridiculous. I ſupport
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed no part in the converſation, but Mrs. Selwyn extremely well ſupplied the place of two. Lord Orville himſelf did not ſpeak much, but the ex
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cellent ſenſe and refined good-breeding which ac
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
company every word he utters, give a
<hi>zeſt</hi>
to whatever he ſays.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I ſuppoſe, my Lord,"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Selwyn,
<q rend="inline">
"when we ſtopped at our lodgings, you would have been extremely confuſed had we met any gentlemen who have the honour of knowing you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"If I had,"</q>
anſwered he, gallantly,
<q rend="inline">
"it would have been from mere compaſſion at their envy."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, my Lord,"</q>
anſwered ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
"it would have been from mere ſhame, that, in an age ſo daring, you alone ſhould be ſuch a coward as to forbear to frighten women."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O,"</q>
cried he, laughing,
<q rend="inline">
"when a man is in a fright for himſelf, the ladies cannot but be in ſecurity; for you have not had half the appre
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
henſion for the ſafety of your perſons, that I have for that of my heart."
</q>
</p>
<p>
He then alighted, handed us out, took leave, and again mounting the phaeton, was out of ſight in a minute.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Certainly,"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Selwyn, when he was gone,
<q rend="inline">
"there muſt have been ſome miſtake in the birth of that young man; he was, undoubt
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
edly,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1259700102:107"/>
deſigned for the laſt age; for, if you ob
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſerved, he is really polite."
</q>
</p>
<p>
And now, my dear Sir, do not you think, ac
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cording to the preſent ſituation of affairs, I may give up my reſentment, without imprudence or impropriety? I hope you will not blame me. In
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
deed, had you, like me, ſeen his reſpectful beha
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
viour, you would have been convinced of the im

YESTERDAY morning, Mrs. Selwyn receiv
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed a card from Mrs. Beaumont, to aſk her to din
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ner to-day; and another, to the ſame purpoſe, came to me. The invitation was accepted, and we are but juſt arrived from Clifton-Hill.
</p>
<p>
We found Mrs. Beaumont alone in the parlour. I will write you that lady's character, as I heard it from our ſatirical friend Mrs. Selwyn, and in her own words.
<q rend="inline">
"She is an abſolute
<hi>Court Calendar bigot;</hi>
for, chancing herſelf to be born of a no
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ble and ancient family, ſhe thinks proper to be of opinion, that
<hi>birth</hi>
and
<hi>virtue</hi>
are one and the ſame thing. She has ſome good qualities, but they rather originate from pride than principle, as ſhe piques herſelf upon being too high born to be capable of an unworthy action, and thinks it incumbent upon her to ſupport the dignity of her anceſtry. Fortunately for the world in general,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:1259700102:108"/>
ſhe has taken it into her head, that condeſcenſion is the moſt diſtinguiſhing virtue of high life; ſo that the ſame pride of family which renders others imperious, is with her the motive of affability. But her civility is too formal to be comfortable, and too mechanical to be flattering. That ſhe does
<hi>me</hi>
the honour of ſo much notice, is merely owing to an accident which, I am ſure, is very painful to her remembrance; for it ſo happened that I once did her ſome ſervice, in regard to an apartment, at Southampton; and I have ſince been informed, that, at the time ſhe accepted my aſſiſtance, ſhe thought I was a woman of quality: and I make no doubt but ſhe was miſerable when ſhe diſcovered me to be a mere country gentlewo
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
man: however, her nice notions of decorum have made her load me with favours ever ſince. But I am not much flattered by her civilities, as I am convinced I owe them neither to attachment nor gratitude, but ſolely to a deſire of cancelling an obligation which ſhe cannot brook being under, to one whoſe name is no where to be found in the Court Calendar."
</q>
</p>
<p>
You well know, my dear Sir, the delight this lady takes in giving way to her ſatirical humour.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Beaumont received us very graciouſly, though ſhe ſomewhat diſtreſſed me by the queſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tions ſhe aſked concerning my family,—ſuch as, whether I was related to the Anvilles in the North?—Whether ſome of my name did not live in Lincolnſhire? and many other enquiries, which much embarraſſed me.
</p>
<p>
The converſation, next, turned upon the in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tended marriage in her family. She treated the ſubject with reſerve, but it was evident ſhe diſap
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
proved Lady Louiſa's choice. She ſpoke in terms of the higheſt eſteem of Lord Orville, calling
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:1259700102:109"/>
him, in Marmontel's words,
<hi>Un jeune homme comme il y en a peu.</hi>
</p>
<p>
I did not think this converſation very agreeably interrupted by the entrance of Mr. Lovel. Indeed I am heartily ſorry he is now at the Hot-wells. He made his compliments with the moſt obſequi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ous reſpect to Mrs. Beaumont, but took no ſort of notice of any other perſon.
</p>
<p>
In a few minutes Lady Louiſa Larpent made her appearance. The ſame manners prevailed; for courtſying,
<q rend="inline">"I hope you are well, Ma'am,"</q>
to Mrs. Beaumont, ſhe paſſed ſtraight forward to her ſeat on the ſofa, where leaning her head on her hand, ſhe caſt her languiſhing eyes round the room, with a vacant ſtare, as if determined, though ſhe looked, not to ſee who was in it.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Lovel, preſently approaching her with re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
verence the moſt profound, hoped her Ladyſhip was not indiſpoſed.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Mr. Lovel,"</q>
cried ſhe, raiſing her head,
<q rend="inline">
"I declare I did not ſee you: Have you been here long?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"By my
<hi>watch,</hi>
Madam,"
</q>
ſaid he,
<q rend="inline">
"only five minutes,—but by your ladyſhip's abſence, as many hours."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O! now I think of it,"</q>
cried ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
"I am very angry with you,—ſo go along, do, for I ſhan't ſpeak to you all day."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Heaven forbid your La'ſhip's diſpleaſure ſhould laſt ſo long! in ſuch cruel circumſtances, a day would ſeem an age. But in what have I been ſo unfortunate as to offend?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"O, you half-killed me, the other morning, with terror! I have not yet recovered from my fright. How could you be ſo cruel as to drive your phaeton againſt my Lord Merton's?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:1259700102:110"/>
<q rend="inline">
"'Pon honour, Ma'am, your La'ſhip does me wrong; it was all owing to the horſes,—there was no curbing them. I proteſt I ſuffered more than your Ladyſhip from the terror of alarming you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Juſt then entered Lord Merton; ſtalking up to Mrs. Beaumont, to whom alone he bowed; he hoped he had not made her wait; and then ad
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
vancing to Lady Louiſa, ſaid, in a careleſs man
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ner,
<q rend="inline">"How is your Ladyſhip this morning?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Not well at all,"</q>
anſwered ſhe;
<q rend="inline">
"I have been dying with the head-ach ever ſince I got up."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Indeed!"</q>
cried he, with a countenance wholly unmoved,
<q rend="inline">
"I am very unhappy to hear it. But ſhould not your Ladyſhip have ſome advice?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I am quite ſick of advice,"</q>
anſwered ſhe;
<q rend="inline">
"Mr. Ridgeway has but juſt left me,—but he has done me no good. Nobody here knows what is the matter with me, yet they all ſee how indif
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ferent I am."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Your Ladyſhip's conſtitution,"</q>
ſaid Mr. Lo
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
vel,
<q rend="inline">"is infinitely delicate."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Indeed it is,"</q>
cried ſhe, in a low voice,
<q rend="inline">
I am
<hi>nerve</hi>
all over!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I am glad, however,"</q>
ſaid Lord Merton,
<q rend="inline">
"that you did not take the air this morning, for Coverly has been driving againſt me as if he was mad: he has got two of the fineſt ſpirited horſes I ever ſaw."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Pray, My Lord,"</q>
cried ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
"why did not you bring Mr. Coverly with you? he's a droll creature; I like him monſtrouſly."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why, he promiſed to be here as ſoon as me. I ſuppoſe he'll come before dinner's over."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:1259700102:111"/>
In the midſt of this trifling converſation, Lord Orville made his appearance. O how dif
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ferent was his addreſs! how ſuperior did he look, and move, to all about him! Having paid his reſpects to Mrs. Beaumont, and then to Mrs. Selwyn, he came up to me, and ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"I hope Miſs Anville has not ſuffered from the fatigue of Monday morning!"
</q>
Then turning to Lady Louiſa, who ſeemed rather ſurpriſed at his ſpeak
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing to me, he added,
<q rend="inline">
"give me leave, ſiſter, to introduce Miſs Anville to you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Lady Louiſa, half-riſing, ſaid, very coldly, that ſhe ſhould be glad of the honour of know
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing me; and then, very abruptly turning to Lord Merton and Mr. Lovel, continued, in a half-whiſper, her converſation.
</p>
<p>
For my part, I had riſen and courtſied, and now, feeling very fooliſh, I ſeated myſelf again; firſt I had bluſhed at the unexpected politeneſs of Lord Orville, and immediately afterwards, at the contemptuous failure of it in his ſiſter. How can that young Lady ſee her brother ſo univerſally admired for his manners and deport
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ment, and yet be ſo unamiably oppoſite to him in her's!
</p>
<p>
Lord Orville, I am ſure, was hurt, and diſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
pleaſed: he bit his lips, and turning from her, addreſſed himſelf wholly to me, till we were ſummoned to dinner. Do you think I was not grateful for his attention? yes, indeed, and every angry idea I had entertained, was totally obli
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
terated.
</p>
<p>
As we were ſeating ourſelves at the table, Mr. Coverly came into the room: he made a thouſand apologies in a breath for being ſo late, but ſaid he had been retarded by a little accident, for that he had overturned his phaeton, and broke
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:1259700102:112"/>
it all to pieces. Lady Louiſa ſcreamed at this intelligence, and looking at Lord Merton, declar
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed ſhe would never go into a phaeton again.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"never mind Jack Coverly, for he does not know how to drive."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q>
cried Mr. Coverly,
<q rend="inline">
"I'll drive againſt
<hi>you</hi>
for a thouſand pounds."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Done!"</q>
returned the other;
<q rend="inline">"Name your day, and we'll each chuſe a judge."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"The ſooner the better,"</q>
cried Mr. Coverly;
<q rend="inline">"to-morrow, if the carriage can be repaired."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Theſe enterpriſes,"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Selwyn,
<q rend="inline">
"are very proper for men of rank, ſince 'tis a million to one but both parties will be incapacitated for any better employment."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"For Heaven's ſake,"</q>
cried Lady Louiſa, changing colour,
<q rend="inline">
"don't talk ſo ſhockingly! Pray, my Lord, pray, Mr. Coverly, don't alarm me in this manner."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Compoſe yourſelf, Lady Louiſa,"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Beaumont,
<q rend="inline">
"the gentlemen will think bet
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ter of the ſcheme; they are neither of them in earneſt."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"The very mention of ſuch a ſcheme,"</q>
ſaid Lady Louiſa, taking out her ſalts,
<q rend="inline">
"makes me tremble all over! Indeed, my Lord, you have frightened me to death! I ſhan't eat a morſel of dinner."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Permit me,"</q>
ſaid Lord Orville,
<q rend="inline">
"to pro
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
poſe ſome other ſubject for the preſent, and we will diſcuſs this matter ſome other time."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Pray, Brother, excuſe me; my Lord muſt give me his word to drop this project,—for, I declare it has made me ſick as death."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"To compromiſe the matter,"</q>
ſaid Lord Orville,
<q rend="inline">
"ſuppoſe, if both parties are unwil
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ling to give up the bet, that, to make the ladies
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:1259700102:113"/>
eaſy, we change its object to ſomething leſs dan
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
gerous?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
This propoſal was ſo ſtrongly ſeconded by all the party, that both Lord Merton, and Mr. Co
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
verly, were obliged to comply with it: and it was then agreed that the affair ſhould be finally ſet
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tled in the afternoon.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I ſhall now be entirely out of conceit with phaetons again,"
</q>
ſaid Mrs. Selwyn,
<q rend="inline">
"though Lord Orville had almoſt reconciled me to them."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My Lord Orville,</q>
"cried the witty Mr. Coverly,
<q rend="inline">
"why, my Lord Orville is as careful,—egad, as careful as an old woman! Why, I'd drive a one-horſe cart againſt my Lord's phaeton for a hundred guineas!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
This ſally occaſioned much laughter; for Mr. Coverly, I find, is regarded as a man of infinite humour.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Perhaps, Sir,"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Selwyn,
<q rend="inline">
"you have not diſcovered the
<hi>reaſon</hi>
my Lord Orville is ſo careful?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why, no, Ma'am; I muſt own, I never heard any particular reaſon for it."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why then, Sir, I'll tell you; and I believe you will confeſs it to be
<hi>very</hi>
particular; his Lordſhip's friends are not yet tired of him."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Lord Orville laughed and bowed. Mr. Cover
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ly, a little confuſed, turned to Lord Merton, and ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"No foul play, my Lord! I remember your Lordſhip recommended me to the notice of this Lady the other morning, and, egad, I be
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
lieve you have been doing me the ſame office to-day."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Give you joy, Jack!"</q>
cried Lord Merton, with a loud laugh.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:1259700102:114"/>
After this, the converſation turned wholly up
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
on eating, a ſubject which was diſcuſſed with the utmoſt delight; and, had I not known they were men of rank and faſhion, I ſhould have imagined that Lord Merton, Mr. Lovel, and Mr. Coverly, had all been profeſſed cooks; for they diſplayed ſo much knowledge of ſauces and made diſhes, and of the various methods of dreſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſing the ſame things, that I am perſuaded they muſt have given much time, and much ſtudy, to make themſelves ſuch adepts in this
<hi>art.</hi>
It would be very difficult to determine, whether they were moſt to be diſtinguiſhed as
<hi>gluttons</hi>
or
<hi>epicures;</hi>
for they were, at once, dainty and vo
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
racious, underſtood the right and the wrong of every diſh, and alike emptied the one and the other. I ſhould have been quite ſick of their remarks, had I not been entertained by ſeeing that Lord Orville, who, I am ſure, was equally diſguſted, not only read my ſentiments, but, by his countenance, communicated to me his own.
</p>
<p>
When dinner was over, Mrs. Beaumont re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
commended the gentlemen to the care of Lord Orville, and then attended the ladies to the draw
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing-room.
</p>
<p>
The converſation, till tea-time, was extreme
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ly inſipid; Mrs. Selwyn reſerved herſelf for the gentlemen, Mrs. Beaumont was grave, and Lady Louiſa languid.
</p>
<p>
But, at tea, every body revived; we were joined by the gentlemen, and gaiety took place of dulneſs.
</p>
<p>
Since I, as Mr. Lovel ſays, am
<hi>Nobody</hi>
<note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. I. p. 37.</note>
, I ſeated myſelf quietly on a window, and not very
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:1259700102:115"/>
near to any body: Lord Merton, Mr. Coverly, and Mr. Lovel, ſeverally paſſed me without no
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tice, and ſurrounded the chair of Lady Louiſa Larpent. I muſt own, I was rather piqued at the behaviour of Mr. Lovel, as he had formerly known me. It is true, I moſt ſincerely deſpiſed his foppery, yet I ſhould be grieved to meet with
<hi>contempt</hi>
from any body. But I was by no means ſorry to find that Lord Merton was determined not to know me before Lady Louiſa, as his ne
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
glect relieved me from much embarraſſment. As to Mr. Coverly, his attention or diſregard were equally indifferent to me. Yet, altogether, I felt extremely uncomfortable, in finding myſelf conſidered in a light very inferior to the reſt of the company.
</p>
<p>
But, when Lord Orville appeared, the ſcene changed: he came up ſtairs laſt, and ſeeing me ſit alone, not only ſpoke to me directly, but drew a chair next mine, and honoured me with his entire attention.
</p>
<p>
He enquired very particularly after my health, and hoped I had already found benefit from the Briſtol air.
<q rend="inline">"How little did I imagine,"</q>
ad
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ded he,
<q rend="inline">
"when I had laſt the pleaſure of ſeeing you in town, that ill health would, in ſo ſhort a time, have brought you hither! I am aſhamed of myſelf for the ſatisfaction I feel at ſeeing you,—yet how can I help it!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
He then enquired after the Mirvan family, and ſpoke of Mrs. Mirvan in terms of the moſt juſt praiſe.
<q rend="inline">"She is gentle and amiable,"</q>
ſaid he,
<q rend="inline">"a true feminine character."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Yes, indeed,"</q>
anſwered I,
<q rend="inline">
"and her ſweet daughter, to ſay every thing of her at once, is juſt the daughter ſuch a mother deſerves."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:1259700102:116"/>
<q rend="inline">"I am glad of it,"</q>
ſaid he,
<q rend="inline">
"for both their ſakes, as ſuch near relations muſt always reflect credit or diſgrace on each other."
</q>
</p>
<p>
After this, he began to ſpeak of the beauties of Clifton; but, in a few moments, was interrupt
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed by a call from the company, to diſcuſs the af
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
fair of the wager. Lord Merton and Mr. Co
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
verley, though they had been diſcourſing upon the ſubject ſome time, could not fix upon any thing that ſatisfied them both.
</p>
<p>
When they aſked the aſſiſtance of Lord Orville, he propoſed that every body preſent ſhould vote ſomething, and that the two gentlemen ſhould draw lots which, from the ſeveral votes, ſhould decide the bet.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"We muſt then begin with the ladies,"</q>
ſaid Lord Orville; and applied to Mrs. Selwyn.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"With all my heart,"</q>
anſwered ſhe, with her uſual readineſs;
<q rend="inline">
"and, ſince the gentlemen are not allowed to riſk their
<hi>necks,</hi>
ſuppoſe we decide the bet by their
<hi>heads?</hi>
"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"By our heads?"</q>
cried Mr. Coverly; Egad,
<q rend="inline">"I dont underſtand you."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I will then explain myſelf more fully. As I doubt not but you are both excellent claſſics, ſup
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
poſe, for the good of your own memories, and the entertainment and ſurpriſe of the company, the thouſand pounds ſhould fall to the ſhare of him who can repeat by heart the longeſt ode of Horace?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Nobody could help laughing, the two gentle
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
men applied to, excepted; who ſeemed, each of them, rather at a loſs in what manner to receive this unexpected propoſal. At length Mr. Lovel, bowing low, ſaid,
<q rend="inline">"Will your Lordſhip pleaſe to begin?</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:1259700102:117"/>
<q rend="inline">"Devil take me if I do!"</q>
anſwered he, turn
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing on his heel, and ſtalking to the window.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Come, Gentlemen,"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Selwyn,
<q rend="inline">
"why do you heſitate? I am ſure you cannot be afraid of a weak
<hi>woman?</hi>
Beſides, if you ſhould chance to be out, Mr. Lovel, I dare ſay, will have the goodneſs to aſſiſt you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
The laugh, now, turned againſt Mr. Lovel, whoſe change of countenance manifeſted no great pleaſure at the tranſition.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Me, Madam!"</q>
ſaid he, colouring,
<q rend="inline">"no, "really I muſt beg to be excuſed."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why ſo, Sir?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why ſo, Ma'am?—Why, really,—as to that,—'pon honour, Ma'am, you are rather—a little ſevere;—for how is it poſſible for a man who is in the Houſe, to ſtudy the claſſics? I aſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſure you, Ma'am,"
</q>
(with an affected ſhrug)
<q rend="inline">
"I find quite buſineſs enough for
<hi>my</hi>
poor head, in ſtudying politics."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"But, did you ſtudy politics at ſchool, and at the univerſity?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"At the univerſity!"</q>
repeated he with an embarraſſed look;
<q rend="inline">
"why, as to that, Ma'am,—no, I can't ſay I did; but then, what with riding,—and—and—and ſo forth,—really, one has not much time, even at the univerſity, for mere reading."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"But to be ſure, Sir, you
<hi>have</hi>
read the claſſics?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"O dear, yes, Ma'am!—very often,—but not very—not very lately."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Which of the odes do you recommend to theſe gentlemen to begin with?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Which of the odes!—Really, Ma'am, as to that, I have no very particular choice,—for,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:1259700102:118"/>
to own the truth, that Horace was never a very great favourite with me."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"In truth I believe you!"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Selwyn, very drily.
</p>
<p>
Lord Merton, again advancing into the circle, with a nod and a laugh, ſaid,
<q rend="inline">"Give you joy, Lovel!"</q>
</p>
<p>
Lord Orville next applied to Mrs. Beaumont for her vote.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"It would very agreeably remind me of paſt times,"</q>
ſaid ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
when
<hi>bowing</hi>
was in faſhion, if the bet was to depend upon the beſt-made bow."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Egad, my Lord!"</q>
cried Mr. Coverley,
<q rend="inline">
"there I ſhould beat you hollow, for your Lord
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſhip never bows at all.
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"And, pray Sir, do
<hi>you?</hi>
</q>
ſaid Mrs. Selwyn.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
Do
<hi>I,</hi>
Ma'am?"
</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">"Why, only ſee!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I proteſt,"</q>
cried ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
"I ſhould have taken
<hi>that</hi>
for a
<hi>ſhrug,</hi>
if you had not told me 'twas a bow."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q>
cried Mr. Coverly,
<q rend="inline">
"let's prac
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tiſe;"
</q>
and then, moſt ridiculouſly, they pranced about the room, making bows.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"We muſt now,"</q>
ſaid Lord Orville, turning to me,
<q rend="inline">"call upon Miſs Anville."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O no, my Lord,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">"indeed I have nothing to propoſe."</q>
He would not, however, be refuſed, but urged me ſo much to ſay
<hi>ſomething,</hi>
that at laſt, not to make him wait any longer, I ventured to propoſe an extempore couplet upon ſome given ſubject.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Coverley inſtantly made me a bow, or, ac

crying,
<q rend="inline">
"Thank you, Ma'am; egad, that's my

—Why, my Lord, the Fates ſeem againſt you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:1259700102:119"/>
Lady Louiſa was then applied to; and every body ſeemed eager to hear her opinion.
<q rend="inline">"I don't know what to ſay, I declare,"</q>
cried ſhe, affected
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ly;
<q rend="inline">"can't you paſs me?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"By no means!"</q>
ſaid Lord Merton.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Is it poſſible your Ladyſhip can make ſo cruel a requeſt?"
</q>
ſaid Mr. Lovel.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Egad,"</q>
cried Mr. Coverley,
<q rend="inline">
"if your La
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
dyſhip does not help us in this dilemma, we ſhall be forced to return to our phaetons."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Oh,"</q>
cried Lady Louiſa, ſcreaming,
<q rend="inline">
"you frightful creature, you, how can you be ſo abo
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
minable!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I believe this trifling laſted near half an hour; when at length, every body being tired, it was given up, and ſhe ſaid ſhe would conſider againſt another time.
</p>
<p>
Lord Orville now called upon Mr. Lovel, who, after about ten minutes deliberation, propoſed, with a moſt important face, to determine the wager by who ſhould draw the longeſt ſtraw!
</p>
<p>
I had much difficulty to refrain laughing at this unmeaning ſcheme; but ſaw, to my great ſur
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
priſe, not the leaſt change of countenance in any other perſon: and, ſince we came home, Mrs. Selwyn has informed me, that to
<hi>draw ſtraws</hi>
is a faſhion of betting by no means uncommon! Good God! my dear Sir, does it not ſeem as if money were of no value or ſervice, ſince thoſe who poſſeſs ſquander it away in a manner ſo infi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nitely abſurd!
</p>
<p>
It now only remained for Lord Orville to ſpeak; and the attention of the company ſhewed the ex
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
pectations he had raiſed; yet, I believe, they by no means prevented his propoſal from being heard with amazement; for it was no other, than that
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:1259700102:120"/>
the money ſhould be his due, who, according to the opinion of two judges, ſhould bring the wor
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
thieſt object with whom to ſhare it!
</p>
<p>
They all ſtared, without ſpeaking. Indeed, I believe every one, for a moment at leaſt, expe
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
rienced ſomething like ſhame, from having either propoſed or countenanced an extravagance ſo uſe
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
leſs and frivolous. For my part, I was ſo much ſtruck and affected by a rebuke ſo noble to theſe ſpendthrifts, that I felt my eyes filled with tears.
</p>
<p>
The ſhort ſilence, and momentary reflection into which the company was ſurpriſed, Mr. Co
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
verly was the firſt to diſpel, by ſaying,
<q rend="inline">
"Egad, my Lord, your Lordſhip has a moſt remarkable odd way of taking things."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Faith,"</q>
ſaid the incorrigible Lord Merton,
<q rend="inline">
"if this ſcheme takes, I ſhall fix upon my Swiſs to ſhare with me; for I dont know a worthier fel
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
low breathing."
</q>
</p>
<p>
After a few more of theſe attempts at wit, the two gentlemen agreed that they would ſettle the affair the next morning.
</p>
<p>
The converſation then took a different turn, but I did not give it ſufficient attention to write any account of it. Not long after, Lord Orville reſuming his ſeat next mine, ſaid,
<q rend="inline">"Why is Miſs Anville ſo thoughtful?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I am ſorry, my Lord,"</q>
ſaid I,
<q rend="inline">
"to conſi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
der myſelf one among thoſe who have ſo juſtly in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
curred your cenſure."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My cenſure!—you amaze me!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Indeed, my Lord, you have made me quite aſhamed of myſelf, for having given my vote ſo fooliſhly; when an opportunity offered, had I but, like your Lordſhip, had the ſenſe to uſe it, of ſhewing ſome humanity."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:1259700102:121"/>
<q rend="inline">"You treat this too ſeriouſly,"</q>
ſaid he, ſmil
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing;
<q rend="inline">
"and I hardly know if you do not now mean a rebuke to
<hi>me.</hi>
"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"To you, my Lord!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Nay, which deſerves it moſt, the one who adapts the converſation to the company, or the one who chooſes to be above it?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"O, my Lord, who elſe would do you ſo little juſtice?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I flatter myſelf,"</q>
anſwered he,
<q rend="inline">
"that in fact, your opinion and mine, in this point, were the ſame, though you condeſcended to comply with the humour of the company. It is for me, therefore, to apologize for ſo unſeaſonable a gra
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
vity, which but for a particular intereſt which I now take in the affairs of Lord Merton, I ſhould not have been ſo officious to diſplay."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Such a compliment as this could not fail to re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
concile me to myſelf; and with revived ſpirits, I entered into a converſation, which he ſupported with me till Mrs. Selwyn's carriage was announc
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed, and we returned home.
</p>
<p>
During our ride, Mrs. Selwyn very much ſur
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
priſed me, by aſking if I thought my health would now permit me to give up my morning walks to the pump-room, for the purpoſe of ſpend
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing a week at Clifton?
<q rend="inline">
"for this poor Mrs. Beau
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
mont,"
</q>
added ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
"is ſo eager to have a diſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
charge in full of her debt to me, that, out of mere compaſſion, I am induced to liſten to her. Be
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſides, ſhe has always a houſe full of people, and though they are chiefly fools and coxcombs, yet there is ſome pleaſure in cutting them up."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I begged I might not, by any means, prevent her following her inclination, as my health was now very well eſtabliſhed. And ſo, my dear Sir, to
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
morrow
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:1259700102:122"/>
we are to be, actually, the gueſts of Mrs. Beaumont.
</p>
<p>
I am not much delighted at this ſcheme; for, flattered as I am by the attention of Lord Orville, it is not very comfortable to be neglected by every body elſe. Beſides, as I am ſure I owe the parti
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cularity of his civility to a generous feeling for my ſituation, I cannot expect him to ſupport it ſo long as a week.
</p>
<p>
How often do I wiſh, ſince I am abſent from you, that I was under the protection of Mrs. Mirvan! It is true, Mrs. Selwyn is very obliging, and, in every reſpect, treats me as an equal; but ſhe is contented with behaving well herſelf, and does not, with a diſtinguiſhing politeneſs, raiſe and ſupport me with others. Yet I mean not to blame her, for I know ſhe is ſincerely my friend; but the fact is, ſhe is herſelf ſo much occupied in converſation, when in company, that ſhe has neither leiſure nor thought to attend to the ſilent.
</p>
<p>
Well, I muſt take my chance! But I knew not, till now, how requiſite are birth and fortune to the attainment of reſpect and civility.

HERE I am, my dear Sir, under the ſame roof, and inmate of the ſame houſe, as Lord Or

would be very diſagreeable, as you will eaſi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ly believe, when I tell you the light in which I am generally conſidered.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My dear,"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Selwyn,
<q rend="inline">
"did you ever before meet with that egregious fop, Lovel?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I very readily ſatisfied her as to my acquain
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tance with him.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O then,"</q>
ſaid ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
"I am the leſs ſur
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
priſed at his ill-nature, ſince he has already inju
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
red you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I begged her to explain herſelf; and then ſhe told me, that while Lord Orville was ſpeaking to me, Lady Louiſa ſaid to Mr. Lovel,
<q rend="inline">"Do you know who that is?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why, Ma'am, no, 'pon honour,"</q>
anſwer
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed he,
<q rend="inline">
"I can't abſolutely ſay I do; I only know ſhe is a kind of a toad-eater. She made her firſt appearance in that capacity laſt Spring, when ſhe attended Miſs Mirvan, a young lady of Kent."
</q>
</p>
<p>
How cruel is it, my dear Sir, to be thus expoſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed to the impertinent ſuggeſtions of a man who is determined to do me ill offices! Lady Louiſa may well deſpiſe a
<hi>tood-eater;</hi>
but, thank Heaven, her brother had not heard, or does not credit, the mortifying appellation. Mrs. Selwyn ſaid, ſhe would adviſe me to
<hi>pay my court</hi>
to this Mr. Lo

vel;
<q rend="inline">"for,"</q>
ſaid ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
"though he is malicious, he is faſhionable, and may do you ſome harm in the great world."
</q>
But I ſhould diſdain myſelf as much as I do him, were I capable of ſuch du
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
plicity, as to flatter a man whom I ſcorn and deſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
piſe.
</p>
<p>
We were received by Mrs. Beaumont with great civility, and by Lord Orville with ſomething more. As to Lady Louiſa, ſhe ſcarcely perceived that we were in the room.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:1259700102:124"/>
There has been company here all day; part of which I have ſpent moſt happily; for after tea, when the ladies played at cards, Lord Orville, who does not, and I who cannot, play, were con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſequently at our own diſpoſal; and then his Lord
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſhip entered into a converſation with me, which laſted till ſupper-time.
</p>
<p>
Almoſt inſenſibly, I find the conſtraint, the re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſerve, I have been wont to feel in his preſence, wear away; the politeneſs, the ſweetneſs, with which he ſpeaks to me, reſtore all my natural chearfulneſs, and make me almoſt as eaſy as he is himſelf; and the more ſo, as, if I may judge by his looks, I am rather raiſed, than ſunk, of late in his opinion.
</p>
<p>
I aſked him, how the bet was, at laſt, to be decided? He told me, that, to his great ſatiſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
faction, the parties had been prevailed upon to lower the ſum from one thouſand to one hundred pounds; and that they had determined it ſhould be ſettled by a race between two old women, one choſe by each ſide, and both of them to be proved more than eighty, though, in other reſpects, ſtrong and healthy as poſſible.
</p>
<p>
When I expreſſed my ſurpriſe at this extraordi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nary method of ſpending ſo much money,
<q rend="inline">"I am charmed,"</q>
ſaid he,
<q rend="inline">
"at the novelty of meeting with one ſo unhackneyed in the world, as not to be yet influenced by cuſtom to forget the uſe of reaſon: for certain it is, that the prevalence of fa
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſhion makes the greateſt abſurdities paſs uncenſur
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed, and the mind naturally accommodates itſelf even to the moſt ridiculous improprieties, if they occur frequently."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I ſhould have hoped,"</q>
ſaid I,
<q rend="inline">
"that the humane propoſal made yeſterday by your Lord
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſhip, would have had more effect."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:1259700102:125"/>
<q rend="inline">"O,"</q>
cried he, laughing,
<q rend="inline">
"I was ſo far from expecting any ſucceſs, that I ſhall think my
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſelf very fortunate if I eſcape the wit of Mr. Co
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
verley in a lampoon! yet I ſpoke openly, becauſe I do not wiſh to conceal that I am no friend to ga

ming."
</q>
</p>
<p>
After this, he took up the New Bath Guide, and read it with me till ſupper time. In our way down ſtairs, Lady Louiſa ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"I thought, Brother, you were engaged this evening?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Yes, Siſter,"</q>
anſwered he,
<q rend="inline">
"and I

been engaged."
</q>
And he bowed to me with an air of gallantry that rather confuſed me.

Almoſt inſenſibly have three days glided on ſince I wrote laſt, and ſo ſerenely, that, but for your abſence, I could not have formed a wiſh. My reſidence here is much happier than I had dared expect. The attention with which Lord Orville honours me is as uniform as it is flatter
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing, and ſeems to reſult from a benevolence of heart that proves him as much a ſtranger to ca
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
price as to pride; for, as his particular civilities aroſe from a generous reſentment at ſeeing me ne
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
glected, ſo will they, I truſt, continue as long as I ſhall, in any degree, deſerve them. I am now not merely eaſy, but even gay in his preſence: ſuch is the effect of true politeneſs, that it baniſh
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
es all reſtraint and embarraſſment. When we walk out, he condeſcends to be my companion, and keeps by my ſide all the way we go. When we read, he marks the paſſages moſt worthy to be noticed, draws out my ſentiments, and favours me with his own. At table, where he always ſits next to me, he obliges me by a thouſand nameleſs attentions, while the diſtinguiſhing good-breeding
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:1259700102:126"/>
with which he treats me, prevents my repining at the viſibly-felt ſuperiority of the reſt of the com

pany. A thouſand occaſional meetings could not have brought us to that degree of ſocial freedom, which four days ſpent under the ſame roof have, inſenſibly, been productive of: and, as my only friend in this houſe, Mrs. Selwyn, is too much engroſſed in perpetual converſation to attend much to me, Lord Orville ſeems to regard me as a help
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
leſs ſtranger, and, as ſuch, to think me entitled to his good offices and protection. Indeed, my dear Sir, I have reaſon to hope, that the depreciating opinion he formerly entertained of me is ſuc
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ceeded by one infinitely more partial.—It may be that I flatter myſelf, but yet his looks, his atten
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tions, his deſire of drawing me into converſation, and his ſolicitude to oblige me, all conſpire to make me hope I do not. In ſhort, my deareſt Sir, theſe laſt four happy days would repay me for months of ſorrow and pain!

<p>
THIS morning I came down ſtairs very early, and, ſuppoſing that the family would not aſſemble for ſome time, I ſtrolled out, purpoſing to take a long walk, in the manner I was wont to do at Ber
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ry Hill, before breakfaſt. But I had ſcarce ſhut the garden gate, ere I was met by a gentleman, who, immediately bowing to me, I recollected
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:1259700102:127"/>
to be the unhappy Mr. Macartney. Very much ſurpriſed, I courtſied, and ſtopped till he came up to me. He was ſtill in mourning, but looked bet
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ter than when I ſaw him laſt, though he had the ſame air of melancholy which ſo much ſtruck me at firſt ſight of him.
</p>
<p>
Addreſſing me with the utmoſt reſpect,
<q rend="inline">"I am happy, Madam,"</q>
ſaid he,
<q rend="inline">
"to have met with you ſo ſoon. I came to Briſtol but yeſterday, and have had no ſmall difficulty in tracing you to Clifton."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Did you know, then, of my being here?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I did, Madam; the ſole motive of my jour
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ney was to ſee you. I have been to Berry Hill, and there I had my intelligence, and, at the ſame time, the unwelcome information of your ill health."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Good God! Sir,—and can you poſſibly have taken ſo much trouble?
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Trouble! Oh, Madam, could there be any, to return you, the moment I had the pow
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
er, my perſonal acknowledgments for your good
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
neſs?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I then enquired after Madame Duval, and the Snow-Hill family. He told me they were all well, and that Madame Duval propoſed ſoon re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
turning to Paris. When I congratulated him up
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
on looking better,
<q rend="inline">
"It is
<hi>yourſelf,</hi>
Madam,"
</q>
ſaid he,
<q rend="inline">
"you ſhould congratulate, for to your hu
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
manity alone it may now be owing that I exiſt at all."
</q>
He then told me, that his affairs were now in a leſs deſperate ſituation, and that he hoped, by the aſſiſtance of time and reaſon, to accommo
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
date his mind to a more chearful ſubmiſſion to his fate.
<q rend="inline">
"The intereſt you ſo generouſly took in my affliction,"
</q>
added he,
<q rend="inline">
"aſſures me you will not be diſpleaſed to hear of my better fortune: I
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:1259700102:128"/>
was therefore eager to acquaint you with it."
</q>
He then told me, that his friend, the moment he had received his letter, quitted Paris, and flew to give him his perſonal aſſiſtance and conſolation. With a heavy heart, he acknowledged, he ac
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cepted it;
<q rend="inline">"but yet,"</q>
he added,
<q rend="inline">
"I
<hi>have</hi>
ac
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cepted it, and therefore, as bound equally by du
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ty and honour, my firſt ſtep was to haſten to the benefactreſs of my diſtreſs, and to return"
</q>
(pre
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſenting me ſomething in a paper)
<q rend="inline">
"the only part of my obligations that
<hi>can</hi>
be returned; for the reſt, I have nothing but my gratitude to offer, and muſt always be contented to conſider myſelf her debtor."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I congratulated him moſt ſincerely upon his dawning proſperity, but begged he would not de
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
prive me of the pleaſure of being his friend, and declined receiving the money, till his affairs were more ſettled.
</p>
<p>
While this point was in agitation, I heard Lord Orville's voice, enquiring of the gardener if he had ſeen me? I immediately opened the garden
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
gate, and his Lordſhip, advancing to me with quickneſs, ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"Good God, Miſs Anville, have you been out alone? Breakfaſt has been ready ſome time, and I have been round the garden in ſearch of you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Your Lordſhip has been very good,"</q>
ſaid I;
<q rend="inline">"but I hope you have not waited."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Not waited!"</q>
repeated he ſmiling,
<q rend="inline">
"Do you think we could ſit down quietly to breakfaſt, with the idea that you had run away from us? But come,"
</q>
(offering to hand me)
<q rend="inline">
"if we do not return, they will ſuppoſe
<hi>I</hi>
am run away too; and they very naturally may, as they know the attrac
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tion of the magnet that draws me."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:1259700102:129"/>
<q rend="inline">"I will come, my Lord,"</q>
ſaid I, rather em
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
barraſſed,
<q rend="inline">"in two minutes."</q>
Then, turning to Mr. Macartney, with yet more embarraſſment, I wiſhed him good morning.
</p>
<p>
He advanced towards the garden, with the pa
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
per ſtill in his hand.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, no,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">"ſome other time."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"May I then, Madam, have the honour of ſeeing you again?
</q>
</p>
<p>
I did not dare take the liberty of inviting any body to the houſe of Mrs. Beaumont, nor yet had I the preſence of mind to make an excuſe; and therefore, not knowing how to refuſe him, I ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"Perhaps you may be this way again to-morrow morning,—and I believe I ſhall walk out before breakfaſt."
</q>
</p>
<p>
He bowed, and went away; while I, turning again to Lord Orville, ſaw his countenance ſo much altered, that I was ſrightened at what I had ſo haſtily ſaid. He did not again offer me his hand, but walked, ſilent and ſlow, by my ſide. Good Heaven! thought I, what may he not ſup
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
poſe from this adventure? May he not, by my deſire of meeting Mr. Macartney to-morrow, imagine it was by deſign I walked out to meet him to-day? Tormented by this apprehenſion, I de
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
termined to avail myſelf of the freedom which his behaviour ſince I came hither has encouraged; and, ſince he would not aſk any queſtions, begin an explanation myſelf. I therefore ſlackened my peace, to gain time, and then ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"Was not your Lordſhip ſurpriſed to ſee me ſpeaking with a ſtranger?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"A ſtranger!'</q>
repeated he;
<q rend="inline">
"is it poſſible that gentleman can be a ſtranger to you?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, my Lord,"</q>
—ſaid I, ſtammering,
<q rend="inline">
"not to
<hi>me,</hi>
—but only it might look—he might ſeem—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:1259700102:130"/>
<q rend="inline">"No, believe me,"</q>
ſaid he, with a forced ſmile,
<q rend="inline">
"I could never believe Miſs Anville would make an appointment with a ſtranger."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"An appointment, my Lord!"</q>
repeated I, colouring violently.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Pardon me, Madam,"</q>
anſwered he,
<q rend="inline">"but I thought I heard one."</q>
</p>
<p>
I was ſo much confounded, that I could not ſpeak; yet, finding he walked quietly on, I could not endure he ſhould make his own interpretation of my ſilence; and therefore, as ſoon as I reco
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
vered from my ſurpriſe, I ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"Indeed, my Lord, you are much miſtaken,—Mr. Macartney had particular buſineſs with me,—and I could not,—I knew not how to refuſe ſeeing him,—but indeed, my Lord,—I had not,—he had not,—"
</q>
I ſtammered ſo terribly that I could not go on.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I am very ſorry,"</q>
ſaid he, gravely,
<q rend="inline">
"that I have been ſo unfortunate as to diſtreſs you; but I ſhould not have followed you, had I not imagined you were merely walked out for the air."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"And ſo I was!"</q>
cried I, eagerly,
<q rend="inline">
"indeed, my Lord, I was! My meeting with Mr. Ma

<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"If
<hi>I</hi>
think!"
</q>
ſaid he, in a tone of ſurpriſe;
<q rend="inline">
"ſurely Miſs Anville muſt beſt judge for herſelf! ſurely ſhe cannot leave the arbitration of a point ſo delicate, to one who is ignorant of all the cir

</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"If,"</q>
ſaid I,
<q rend="inline">
"it was worth your Lordſhip's time to hear them,—you ſhould

<q rend="inline">
"The ſweetneſs of Miſs Anville's diſpoſiti

</q>
ſaid he, in a ſoftened voice,
<q rend="inline">
"I have long admired, and the offer of a communication which does me ſo much honour, is too grateful to me not to be eagerly caught at."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Juſt then, Mrs. Selwyn opened the parlour-win
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
dow, and our converſation ended. I was rallied upon my paſſion for ſolitary walking, but no queſtions were aſked me.
</p>
<p>
When breakfaſt was over, I hoped to have had ſome opportunity of ſpeaking with Lord Orville: but Lord Merton and Mr. Coverly came in, and inſiſted upon his opinion of the ſpot they had fixed upon for the old women's race. The ladies de
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
clared they would be of the party, and, accord
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ingly, we all went.
</p>
<p>
The race is to be run in Mrs. Beaumont's gar
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
den; the two gentlemen are as anxious as if their joint lives depended upon it. They have, at length fixed upon objects, but have found great difficulty in perſuading them to practiſe running, in order to try their ſtrength. This grand affair is to be decided next Thurſday.
</p>
<p>
When we returned to the houſe, the entrance of more company ſtill prevented my having any converſation with Lord Orville. I was very much chagrined, as I knew he was engaged at the Hotwells in the afternoon. Seeing, therefore, no probability of ſpeaking to him before the time of my meeting Mr. Macartney arrived, I determin
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed that, rather than riſk his ill opinion, I would leave Mr. Macartney to his own ſuggeſtions.
</p>
<p>
Yet, when I reflected upon his peculiar ſituati
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
on, his misfortunes, his ſadneſs, and, more than all the reſt, the idea I knew he entertained of what he calls his obligations to me, I could not re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſolve upon a breach of promiſe, which might be
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:1259700102:132"/>
attributed to cauſes of all others the moſt offenſive to one whom ſorrow has made extremely ſuſpici
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ous of ſlights and contempt.
</p>
<p>
After the moſt uneaſy conſideration, I at length determined upon writing an excuſe, which would, at once, ſave me from either meeting or affront
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing him. I therefore begged Mrs. Selwyn's leave to ſend her man to the Hotwells, which ſhe in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſtantly granted; and then I wrote the following note.
</p>
<floatingText type="letter">
<body>
<head>To Mr. Macartney.</head>
<opener>
<salute>Sir,</salute>
</opener>
<p>
AS it will not be in my power to walk out to
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
morrow morning, I would by no means give you the trouble of coming to Clifton. I hope, how
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ever, to have the pleaſure of ſeeing you before you quit Briſtol. I am,
</p>

<salute>Sir,</salute>
<signed>Your obedient ſervant, EVELINA ANVILLE.</signed>
</closer>
</body>
</floatingText>
<p>
I deſired the ſervant to enquire at the pump
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
room where Mr. Macartney lived, and returned to the parlour.
</p>
<p>
As ſoon as the company diſperſed, the ladies retired to dreſs. I then, unexpectedly, found myſelf alone with Lord Orville; who, the mo
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ment I roſe to follow Mrs. Selwyn, advanced to me, and ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"Will Miſs Anville pardon my impatience, if I remind her of the promiſe ſhe was ſo good as to make me this morning?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I ſtopped, and would have returned to my ſeat, but, before I had time, the ſervants came to lay the cloth. He retreated, and went towards the window; and while I was conſidering in what
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:1259700102:133"/>
manner to begin, I could not help aſking myſelf what
<hi>right</hi>
I had to communicate the affairs of Mr. Macartney; and I doubted whether, to clear myſelf from one act of imprudence, I had not commited another.
</p>
<p>
Diſtreſſed by this reflection, I thought it beſt to quit the room, and give myſelf ſome time for conſideration before I ſpoke; and therefore, only ſaying I muſt haſten to dreſs, I ran up ſtairs: ra
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ther abruptly, I own, and ſo, I fear, Lord Or
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ville muſt think, yet what could I do? unuſed to the ſituations in which I find myſelf, and embar
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
raſſed by the ſlighteſt difficulties, I ſeldom, till too late, diſcover how I ought to act
</p>
<p>
Juſt as we were all aſſembled to dinner, Mrs. Selwyn's man, coming into the parlour, preſented to me a letter, and ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"I can't find out Mr. Macartney, Madam; but the poſt-office people will let you know if they hear of him."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I was extremely aſhamed of this public meſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſage; and meeting the eyes of Lord Orville, which were earneſtly fixed on me, my confuſion redoubled, and I knew not which way to look. All dinner-time, he was as ſilent as myſelf, and, the moment it was in my power, I left the table, and went to my own room. Mrs. Selwyn preſently followed me, and her queſtions obliged me to own almoſt all the particulars of my acquaintance with Mr. Macartney, in order to excuſe my writing to him. She ſaid it was a moſt romantic affair, and ſpoke her ſentiments with great ſeverity, declaring that ſhe had no doubt but he was an adventurer and an impoſtor.
</p>
<p>
And now, my dear Sir, I am totally at a loſs what I ought to do: the more I reflect, the more ſenſible I am of the utter impropriety, nay, treachery, of revealing the ſtory, and publiſhing
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:1259700102:134"/>
the misfortunes and poverty of Mr. Macartney; who has an undoubted right to my ſecrecy and diſcretion, and whoſe letter charges me to regard his communication as ſacred.—And yet, the ap
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
pearance of myſtery,—perhaps ſomething worſe, which this affair muſt have to Lord Orville,—his ſeriouſneſs,—and the promiſe I have made him, are inducements ſcarce to be reſiſted, for truſting him, with the openneſs he has reaſon to expect from me.
</p>
<p>
I am equally diſtreſſed, too, whether or not I ſhould ſee Mr. Macartney to-morrow morning.
</p>
<p>
Oh Sir, could I now be enlightened by your counſel, from what anxiety and perplexity ſhould I be relieved!
</p>
<p>
But no,—I ought not to betray Mr. Macartney, and I will not forfeit a confidence which would never have been repoſed in me, but from a reli
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ance upon my honour which I ſhould bluſh to find myſelf unworthy of. Deſirous as I am of the good opinion of Lord Orville, I will endeavour to act as if I was guided by your advice, and, making it my ſole aim to
<hi>deſerve</hi>
it, leave to time and to fate my ſucceſs or diſappointment.
</p>
<p>
Since I have formed this reſolution, my mind is more at eaſe, but I will not finiſh my letter till the affair is decided.

<p>
I roſe very early this morning, and, after a thouſand different plans, not being able to reſolve upon giving poor Mr. Macartney leave to ſuppoſe I neglected him, I thought it incumbent upon me to keep my word, ſince he had not received my letter; I therefore determined to make my own
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:1259700102:135"/>
apologies, not to ſtay with him two minutes, and to excuſe myſelf from meeting him any more.
</p>
<p>
Yet, uncertain whether I was wrong or right, it was with fear and trembling that I opened the garden-gate,—judge, then, of my feelings, when the firſt object I ſaw was Lord Orville!—he, too, looked extremely diſconcerted, and ſaid, in a he ſitating manner,
<q rend="inline">
"Pardon me, Madam,—I did not imagine you would have been here ſo ſoon,—or,—or I would not have come."
</q>
—And then, with a haſty bow, he paſſed me, and proceeded to the garden.
</p>
<p>
I was ſcarce able to ſtand, ſo greatly did I feel myſelf ſhocked; but, upon my ſaying, almoſt involuntarily,
<q rend="inline">"Oh my Lord!"</q>
—he turned back, and, after a ſhort pauſe, ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"Did you ſpeak to
<hi>me,</hi>
Madam?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I could not immediately anſwer; I ſeemed
<hi>choaked,</hi>
and was even forced to ſupport myſelf by the garden-gate.
</p>
<p>
Lord Orville, ſoon recovering his dignity, ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"I know not how to apologiſe for being, juſt now, at this place;—and I cannot immediately,—if
<hi>ever,</hi>
—clear myſelf from the imputation of im
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
pertinent curioſity, to which I fear you will attri
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
bute it: however, I will, at preſent, only entreat your pardon, without detaining you any longer."
</q>
Again he bowed, and left me.
</p>
<p>
For ſome moments, I remained fixed to the ſame ſpot, and in the ſame poſition, immovably, as if I had been transformed to ſtone.
</p>
<p>
My firſt impulſe was to call him back, and in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſtantly tell him the whole affair; but I checked this deſire, though I would have given the world to have indulged it; ſomething like pride aided what I thought due to Mr. Macartney, and I de
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
termined not only to keep his ſecret, but to delay
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:1259700102:136"/>
any ſort of explanation, till Lord Orville ſhould condeſcend to requeſt it.
</p>
<p>
Slowly he walked, and before he entered the houſe, he looked back, but haſtily withdrew his eyes, upon finding I obſerved him.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, my dear Sir, you cannot eaſily ima
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
gine a ſituation more uncomfortable than mine was at that time; to be ſuſpected by Lord Or
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ville of any clandeſtine actions, wounded my ſoul; I was too much diſcompoſed to wait for Mr. Macartney, nor, in truth, could I endure to have the deſign of my ſtaying ſo well known. Yet, ſo extremely was I agitated, that I could hardly move, and, I have reaſon to believe, Lord Orville, from the parlour window, ſaw me totter
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing along, for, before I had taken five ſteps, he came out, and haſtening to me, ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"I fear you are not well; pray allow me, (offering his arm) to aſſiſt you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, my Lord,"</q>
ſaid I, with all the reſolu
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tion I could aſſume; yet I was affected by an attention, at that time, ſo little expected, and forced to turn away my head to conceal my emotion.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"You
<hi>muſt,</hi>
"
</q>
ſaid he, with earneſtneſs,
<q rend="inline">
"in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
deed you muſt,—I am ſure you are not well;—refuſe me not the honour of aſſiſting you;
</q>
and, almoſt forcibly he took my hand, and drawing it under his arm, obliged me to lean upon him. That I ſubmitted, was partly the effect of ſur
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
priſe at an earneſtneſs ſo uncommon in Lord Orville, and partly, that I did not juſt then, dare truſt my voice to make any objection.
</p>
<p>
When we came to the houſe, he led me into the parlour, and to a chair, and begged to know if I would not have a glaſs of water.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:1259700102:137"/>
<q rend="inline">"No, my Lord, I thank you,"</q>
ſaid I,
<q rend="inline">"I am perfectly recovered;"</q>
and, riſing, I walked to the window, where, for ſome time, I pretend
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed to be occupied in looking at the garden.
</p>
<p>
Determined as I was to act honourably by Mr. Macartney, I yet moſt anxiouſly wiſhed to be reſtored to the good opinion of Lord Orville; but his ſilence, and the thoughtfulneſs of his air, diſcouraged me from ſpeaking.
</p>
<p>
My ſituation ſoon grew diſagreeable and em
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
barraſſing, and I reſolved to return to my cham
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ber till breakfaſt was ready. To remain longer, I feared, might ſeem
<hi>aſking</hi>
for his enquiries; and I was ſure it would ill become me to be more ea
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ger to ſpeak, than he was to hear.
</p>
<p>
Juſt as I reached the door, turning to me, haſtily, he ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"Are you going, Miſs An
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ville?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I am, my Lord,"</q>
anſwered I, yet I ſtop
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ped.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Perhaps to return to—but I beg your par
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
don!"
</q>
he ſpoke with a degree of agitation that made me readily comprehend he meant to
<hi>the garden,</hi>
and I inſtantly ſaid,
<q rend="inline">"To my own room, my Lord."</q>
And again I would have gone; but, convinced by my anſwer that I un
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
derſtood him, I believe he was ſorry for the inſi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nuation; he approached me with a very ſerious air, though, at the ſame time, he forced a ſmile, and ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"I know not what evil genius purſues me this morning, but I ſeem deſtined to do or ſay ſomething I ought not: I am ſo much aſham
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed of myſelf, that I can ſcarce ſolicit your for

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My forgiveneſs! my Lord?"</q>
cried I, abaſh
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed, rather than elated by his condeſcenſion,
<q rend="inline">
"ſure
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ly you cannot,—you are not ſerious?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1259700102:138"/>
<q rend="inline">
"Indeed never more ſo; yet, if I may be my own interpreter, Miſs Anville's countenance pro
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nounces my pardon."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I know not, my Lord, how any one can pardon, who has never been offended."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"You are very good; yet I could expect no leſs from a ſweetneſs of diſpoſition which baffles all compariſon: will you not think I am an en

croacher, and that I take advantage of your good
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
neſs, ſhould I once more remind you of the pro
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
miſe you vouchſafed me yeſterday?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"No, indeed; on the contrary, I ſhall be very happy to acquit myſelf in your Lordſhip's opinion."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Acquittal you need not,"</q>
ſaid he, leading me again to the window,
<q rend="inline">
"yet I own my curio
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſity is ſtrongly excited."
</q>
</p>
<p>
When I was ſeated, I found myſelf much at a loſ what to ſay; yet, after a ſhort ſilence, aſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſuming all the courage in my power,
<q rend="inline">"Will you not, my Lord,"</q>
ſaid I,
<q rend="inline">
"think me trifling and capricious, ſhould I own I have repented the promiſe I made, and ſhould I entreat your Lord

ſhip not to inſiſt upon my ſtrict performance of it?—I ſpoke ſo haſtily, that I did not, at the time, conſider the impropriety of what I ſaid"
</q>
</p>
<p>
As he was entirely ſilent, and profoundly at
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tentive, I continued to ſpeak without interrup
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tion.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"If your Lordſhip, by any other means, knew the circumſtances attending my acquain

tance with Mr. Macartney, I am moſt ſure you would yourſelf diſapprove my relating them. He is a gentleman, and has been very unfortu

<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſhip
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:1259700102:139"/>
wiſhed to hear any particulars of his affairs, he would readily conſent to my acknowledging them;—ſhall, my Lord, aſk his permiſſion?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>His</hi>
affairs,"
</q>
repeated Lord Orville;
<q rend="inline">
"by no means, I have not the leaſt curioſity about them."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I beg your Lordſhip's pardon,—but indeed I had underſtood the contrary."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Is it poſſible, Madam, you could ſuppoſe the affairs of an utter ſtranger can excite my cu
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
rioſity."
</q>
</p>
<p>
The gravity and coldneſs with which he aſked this queſtion, very much abaſhed me; but Lord Orville is the moſt delicate of men, and preſently recollecting himſelf, he added,
<q rend="inline">
"I mean not to ſpeak with indifference of any friend of yours,—far from it; any ſuch will always command my good wiſhes: yet I own I am rather diſappoint
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed; and though I doubt not the juſtice of your reaſons, to which I implicitly ſubmit, you muſt not wonder, that when, upon the point of being honoured with your confidence, I ſhould feel the greateſt regret at finding it withdrawn."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Do you think, my dear Sir, I did not, at that moment, require all my reſolution to guard me from frankly telling him whatever he wiſhed to hear? yet I rejoice that I did not; for, added to the actual wrong I ſhould have done, Lord Or
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ville himſelf, when he had heard, would, I am ſure, have blamed me. Fortunately, this thought occurred to me, and I ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"Your Lordſhip ſhall yourſelf be my judge; the pro

miſe I made, though voluntary, was raſh and inconſiderate; yet, had it concerned myſelf, I would not have heſitated in fulfilling it; but the gentleman whoſe affairs I ſhould be obliged to re

</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:1259700102:140"/>
<q rend="inline">"Pardon me,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"for interrupting you; yet allow me to aſſure you, I have not the ſlighteſt deſire to be acquainted with his affairs, further than what belongs to the motives which induced you yeſterday morning—"
</q>
He ſtopped; but there was no occaſion to ſay more.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"That, my Lord,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">
"I will tell you honeſty. Mr. Macartney had ſome particular buſineſs with me,—and I could not take the liber

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"And why not?—Mrs. Beaumont, I am ſure,—"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I could not, my Lord, think of intruding upon Mrs. Beaumont's complaiſance; and ſo, with the ſame haſty folly I promiſed your Lord

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"And did you?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, my Lord,"</q>
ſaid I, colouring,
<q rend="inline">
"I re

</q>
</p>
<p>
Again, for ſome time, we were both ſilent; yet, unwilling to leave him to reflections which could not but be to my diſadvantage, I ſummoned ſufficient courage to ſay,
<q rend="inline">
"There is no young creature, my Lord, who ſo greatly wants, or ſo earneſtly wiſhes for, the advice and aſſiſtance of her friends, as I do; I am new to the world, and unuſed to acting for myſelf,—my intentions are never wilfully blameable, yet I err perpetually!—I have hitherto, been bleſt with the moſt affecti

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Would to Heaven,"</q>
cried he, with a coun

<q rend="inline">
"that

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You do me but too much honour,"</q>
ſaid I;
<q rend="inline">
"yet I hope your Lordſhip's candour,—perhaps I ought to ſay indulgence,—will make ſome al

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"May

</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"hope that you will pardon the ill-grace with which I have ſubmitted to my diſappointment? and that you will permit me,"
</q>
(kiſſing my hand)
<q rend="inline">"thus to ſeal my peace?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"

</q>
ſaid I, with revived ſpirits.

<p>
<q rend="inline">"This, then,"</q>
ſaid he, again preſſing it to his lips,
<q rend="inline">
"for

</q>
</p>
<p>
Juſt then, the door opened, and I had only time to withdraw my hand, ere the ladies came in to breakfaſt.
</p>
<p>
I have been, all day, the happieſt of human beings!—to be thus reconciled to Lord Orville, and yet to adhere to my reſolution,—what could I wiſh for more?—he too, has been very chear

DEAD to the world, and equally inſenſible to its pleaſures or its pains, I long ſince bid adieu to all joy, and defiance to all ſorrow, but what ſhould ſpring from my Evelina,—ſole ſource, to me, of all earthly felicity. How ſtrange, then, is it, that the letter in which ſhe tells me ſhe is the

Alas, my child!—that innocence, the firſt, beſt gift of Heaven, ſhould, of all others, be the blindeſt to its own danger,—the moſt expoſed to treachery,—and the leaſt able to defend itſelf, in a world where it is little known, leſs valued, and perpe
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tually deceived.
</p>
<p>
Would to Heaven you were here!—then, by degrees, and with gentleneſs, I might enter upon a ſubject too delicate for diſtant diſcuſſion. Yet it is too intereſting, and the ſituation too critical, to allow of delay.—Oh my Evelina, your ſitu
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ation is critical indeed!—your peace of mind is at ſtake, and every chance for your future happineſs may depend upon the conduct of the preſent mo
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ment.
</p>
<p>
Hitherto I have forborne to ſpeak with you upon the moſt important of all concerns, the ſtate of your heart:—alas, I needed no information! I have been ſilent, indeed, but I have not been blind.
</p>
<p>
Long, and with the deepeſt regret, have I per
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ceived
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:1259700102:143"/>
the aſcendency which Lord Orville has gained upon your mind.—You will ſtart at the mention of his name,—you will tremble every word you read;—I grieve to give pain to my gen
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tle Evelina, but I dare not any longer ſpare her.
</p>
<p>
Your firſt meeting with Lord Orville was de
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ciſive. Lively, fearleſs, free from all other impreſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſions, ſuch a man as you deſcribe him could not fail exciting your admiration, and the more dange
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
rouſly, becauſe he ſeemed as unconſcious of his power as you of your weakneſs; and therefore you had no alarm, either from
<hi>his</hi>
vanity, or
<hi>your own</hi>
prudence.
</p>
<p>
Young, animated, entirely off your guard, and thoughtleſs of conſequences,
<hi>imagination</hi>
took the reins, and
<hi>reaſon,</hi>
ſlow-paced, though ſure-foot
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed, was unequal to a race with ſo eccentric and flighty a companion. How rapid was then my Eve
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
lina's progreſs through thoſe regions of fancy and paſſion whither her new guide conducted her!—She ſaw Lord Orville at a ball,—and he was
<hi>the moſt amiable of men!</hi>
—She met him again at ano
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ther,—and
<hi>he had every virtue under Heaven!</hi>
</p>
<p>
I mean not to depreciate the merit of Lord Or
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ville, who, one myſterious inſtance alone ex
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cepted, ſeems to have deſerved the idea you form
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed of his character; but it was not time, it was not the knowledge of his worth, obtained your regard; your new comrade had not patience to wait any trial; her glowing pencil, dipt in the vivid colours of her creative ideas, painted to you, at the moment of your firſt acquaintance, all the excellencies, all the good and rare qualities, which a great length of time, and intimacy, could alone have really diſcovered.
</p>
<p>
You flattered yourſelf, that your partiality was the effect of eſteem, founded upon a general love
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:1259700102:144"/>
of merit, and a principle of juſtice; and your heart, which fell the ſacrifice of your error, was totally gone ere you ſuſpected it was in danger.
</p>
<p>
A thouſand times have I been upon the point of ſhewing you the perils of your ſituation; but the ſame inexperience which occaſioned your miſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
take, I hoped, with the aſſiſtance of time and ab
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſence, would effect a cure: I was, indeed, moſt unwilling to deſtroy your illuſion, while I dared hope it might itſelf contribute to the reſtoration of your tranquillity; ſince your ignorance of the danger and force of your attachment, might poſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſibly prevent that deſpondency with which young people, in ſimilar circumſtances, are apt to per
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſuade themſelves that what is only difficult, is ab
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſolutely impoſſible.
</p>
<p>
But now, ſince you have again met, and are become more intimate than ever, all my hope from ſilence and ſeeming ignorance is at an end.
</p>
<p>
Awake, then, my dear, my deluded child, awake to the ſenſe of your danger, and exert your
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſelf to avoid the evils with which it threatens you,—evils which, to a mind like yours, are moſt to be dreaded, ſecret repining, and concealed, yet conſuming regret! Make a noble effort for the re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
covery of your peace, which now, with ſorrow I ſee it, depends wholly upon the preſence of Lord Orville. This effort, may, indeed, be pain
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ful, but truſt to my experience, when I aſſure you it is requiſite.
</p>
<p>
You muſt quit him!—his ſight is baneful to your repoſe, his ſociety is death to your future tranquillity! Believe me, my beloved child, my heart aches for your ſuffering, while it dictates its neceſſity.
</p>
<p>
Could I flatter myſelf that Lord Orville would, indeed, be ſenſible of your worth, and act with a
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:1259700102:145"/>
nobleneſs of mind, which ſhould prove it reci
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
procal, then would I leave my Evelina to the un
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
moleſted enjoyment of the chearful ſociety and in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
creaſing regard of a man ſhe ſo greatly admires; but this is not an age in which we may truſt to appearances, and imprudence is much ſooner re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
gretted than repaired. Your health, you tell me, is much mended,—can you then conſent to leave Briſtol?—not abruptly, that I do not deſire, but in a few days from the time you receive this? I will write to Mrs. Selwyn, and tell her how much I wiſh your return; and Mrs. Clinton can take ſufficient care of you.
</p>
<p>
I have meditated upon every poſſible expedient that might tend to your happineſs, ere I fixed upon exacting from you a compliance which I am con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
vinced will be moſt painful to you; but I can ſa
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tisfy myſelf in none. This will at leaſt be ſafe, and as to ſucceſs,—we muſt leave it to time.
</p>
<p>
I am very glad to hear of Mr. Macartney's wel
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
fare.

<p>
Adieu, my deareſt child; Heaven preſerve and ſtrengthen you!

<p>
SWEETLY, moſt ſweetly, have two days more paſſed ſince I wrote; but I have been too much engaged to be exact in my journal.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:1259700102:146"/>
To-day has been leſs tranquil. It was deſtined for the deciſion of the important bet, and has been productive of general confuſion throughout the houſe. It was ſettled that the race ſhould be run at five o'clock in the afternoon. Lord Mer
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ton breakfaſted here, and ſtayed till noon. He wanted to engage the ladies to
<hi>bet on his ſide,</hi>
in the true ſpirit of gaming, without ſeeing the ra
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cers. But he could only prevail on Lady Louiſa, as Mrs. Selwyn ſaid ſhe never laid a wager againſt her own wiſhes, and Mrs. Beaumont would not
<hi>take ſides.</hi>
As for
<hi>me,</hi>
I was not applied to. It is impoſſible for negligence to be more pointed, than that of Lord Merton to me, in the preſence of Lady Louiſa.
</p>
<p>
But, juſt before dinner, I happened to be alone in the drawing-room, when his Lordſhip ſuddenly returned, and coming in with his uſual familiarity, he was beginning,
<q rend="inline">"You ſee, Lady Louiſa,—"</q>
but ſtopping ſhort,
<q rend="inline">"Pray, where's every body gone?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Indeed I don't know, my Lord."</q>
</p>
<p>
He then ſhut the door, and, with a great alter
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ation in his face and manner, advanced eagerly towards me, and ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"How glad I am, my ſweet girl, to meet you, at laſt, alone! By my ſoul, I began to think there was a plot againſt me, for I've never been able to have you a minute to myſelf."
</q>
And, very freely, he ſeized my hand.
</p>
<p>
I was ſo much ſurpriſed at this addreſs, after having been ſo long totally neglected, that I could make no other anſwer than ſtaring at him with un
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
feigned aſtoniſhment.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why now,"</q>
continued he,
<q rend="inline">
"if you was not the cruelleſt little angel in the world, you would have helped me to ſome expedient: for you ſee how I am watched here; Lady Louiſa's
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:1259700102:147"/>
eyes are never off me. She gives me a charming foretaſte of the pleaſures of a wife! however, it won't laſt long."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Diſguſted to the greateſt degree, I attempted to draw away my hand, but I believe I ſhould not have ſucceeded, had not Mrs. Beaumont made her appearance. He turned from me with the greateſt aſſurance, and ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"How are you, Ma'am?—how is Lady Louiſa?—you ſee I can't live a moment out of the houſe."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Could you, my deareſt Sir, have believed it poſſible for ſuch effrontery to be in man?
</p>
<p>
Before dinner, came Mr. Coverley, and before five o'clock, Mr. Lovel and ſome other company. The place marked out for the race, was a gravel
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
walk in Mrs. Beaumont's garden, and the length of the ground twenty yards. When we were ſummoned to the
<hi>courſe,</hi>
the two poor old women made their appearance. Though they ſeemed very healthy for their time of life, they yet looked ſo weak, ſo infirm, ſo feeble, that I could feel no ſenſation but that of pity at the ſight. However, this was not the general ſenſe of the company, for they no ſooner came forward, than they were greeted with a laugh from every beholder, Lord Orville excepted, who looked very grave during the whole tranſaction. Doubtleſs he muſt be greatly diſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
contented at the diſſipated conduct and extrava
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
gance, of a man with whom he is, ſoon, to be ſo nearly connected.
</p>
<p>
For ſome time, the ſcene was truly ridiculous; the agitation of the parties concerned, and the bets that were laid upon the old women, were abſurd beyond meaſure.
<hi>Who are you for?</hi>
and
<hi>whoſe ſide are you of?</hi>
was echoed from mouth to mouth by the whole company. Lord Merton and Mr. Coverley were both ſo exceſſively gay and noiſy,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:1259700102:148"/>
that I ſoon found they had been too free in drink
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing to their ſucceſs. They handed, with loud ſhouts, the old women to the race-ground, and encouraged them, by liberal promiſes, to exert themſelves.
</p>
<p>
When the ſignal was given them to ſet off, the poor creatures, ſeeble and frightened, ran againſt each other, and, neither of them able to ſupport the ſhock, they both fell on the ground.
</p>
<p>
Lord Merton and Mr. Coverley flew to their aſſiſtance. Seats were brought for them, and they each drank a glaſs of wine. They complained of being much bruiſed, for, heavy and helpleſs, they had not been able to ſave themſelves, but fell with their whole weight upon the gravel. However, as they ſeemed equal ſufferers, both parties were too eager to have the affair deferred.
</p>
<p>
Again, therefore, they ſet off, and hobbled along, nearly even with each other, for ſome time, yet frequently, and to the inexpreſſible di
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
verſion of the company, they ſtumbled and tot
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tered; and the confuſed hallowing of
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>
Now Co
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
verley!
</hi>
"
</q>
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Now Merton!</hi>
"
</q>
rung from ſide to ſide during the whole affair.
</p>
<p>
Not long after, a foot of one of the poor wo
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
men ſlipt, and, with great force, ſhe came again to the ground. Involuntarily, I ſprung forward to aſſiſt her, but Lord Merton, to whom ſhe did not belong, ſtopped me, calling out
<q rend="inline">"No foul play! no foul play!"</q>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Coverley, then, repeating the ſame words, went himſelf to help her, and inſiſted that the other ſhould ſtop. A debate enſued; but the poor creature was too much hurt to move, and declared her utter inability to make another at
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tempt. Mr. Coverley was quite brutal; he ſwore
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:1259700102:149"/>
at her with unmanly rage, and ſeemed ſcarce able to refrain even from ſtriking her.
</p>
<p>
Lord Merton then, in great rapture, ſaid it was a
<hi>hollow thing;</hi>
but Mr. Coverley contended that the fall was accidental, and time ſhould be allow
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed for the woman to recover. However, all the company being againſt him, he was pronounced the loſer.
</p>
<p>
We then went to the drawing-room, to tea. After which, the evening being delightful, we all walked in the garden. Lord Merton was quite riotous, and Lady Louiſa in high ſpirits; but Mr. Coverley endeavoured in vain to conceal his cha
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
grin.
</p>
<p>
As Lord Orville was thoughtful, and walked by himſelf, I expected that, as uſual,
<hi>I</hi>
ſhould paſs unnoticed, and be left to my own medita
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tions; but this was not the caſe, for Lord Mer
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ton, entirely off his guard, giddy equally from wine and ſucceſs, was very troubleſome to me; and, regardleſs of the preſence of Lady Louiſa, which, hitherto, has reſtrained him even from common civility, he attached himſelf to me, du
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ring the walk, with a freedom of gallantry that put me extremely out of countenance. He paid me the moſt high-flown compliments, and fre
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
quently and forcibly ſeized my hand, though I repeatedly, and with undiſſembled anger, drew it back. Lord Orville, I ſaw, watched us with earneſtneſs, and Lady Louiſa's ſmiles were con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
verted into looks of diſdain.
</p>
<p>
I could not bear to be thus ſituated, and com
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
plaining I was tired, I quickened my pace, with intention to return to the houſe; but Lord Mer
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ton haſtily following, caught my hand, and ſay
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing the
<hi>day was his own,</hi>
vowed he would not let me go.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:1259700102:150"/>
<q rend="inline">
"You
<hi>muſt,</hi>
my Lord,"
</q>
cried I, extremely flurried.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You are the moſt charming girl in the world,"</q>
ſaid he,
<q rend="inline">"and never looked better than at this moment."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q>
cried Mrs. Selwyn, advancing to us,
<q rend="inline">
"you don't conſider, that the better Miſs Anville looks, the more ſtriking is the contraſt with your Lordſhip; therefore, for your own ſake, I would adviſe you not to hold her."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Egad, my Lord,"</q>
cried Mr. Coverley,
<q rend="inline">
"I don't ſee what right you have to the beſt
<hi>old,</hi>
and the beſt
<hi>young</hi>
woman too, in the ſame day."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Beſt young woman!</hi>
"
</q>
repeated Mr. Lovel;
<q rend="inline">
"'pon honour, Jack, you have made a moſt unfortunate ſpeech; however, if Lady Louiſa can pardon you,—and her Ladyſhip is all good

ners."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"And pray, Sir,"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Selwyn,
<q rend="inline">
"un
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
der what denomination may your own ſpeech paſs?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Lovel, turning another way, affected not to hear her: and Mr. Coverley, bowing to Lady Louiſa, ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"Her Ladyſhip is well acquainted with my devotion,—but egad, I don't know how it is,—I had always an unlucky turn at an epigram, and never could reſiſt a ſmart play upon words in my life."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Pray, my Lord,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">"let go my hand! pray, Mrs. Selwyn, ſpeak for me."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Selwyn,
<q rend="inline">
"in detain

<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
lour
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:1259700102:151"/>
and your ſtrength as if you were to hold her an age."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Beaumont,
<q rend="inline">
"I muſt beg leave to interfere; I know not if Lady Lou
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
iſa can pardon you, but, as this young Lady is at my houſe, I do not chuſe to have her made uneaſy."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>I</hi>
pardon him!"
</q>
cried Lady Louiſa,
<q rend="inline">"I declare I am monſtrous glad to get rid of him."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Egad, my Lord,"</q>
cried Mr. Coverley,
<q rend="inline">
"while you are graſping at a ſhadow, you'll loſe a ſubſtance; you'd beſt make your peace while you can."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Pray, Mr. Coverley, be quiet,"</q>
ſaid Lady Louiſa, peeviſhly,
<q rend="inline">"for I declare I won't ſpeak to him. Brother,"</q>
(taking hold of Lord Orville's arm)
<q rend="inline">"will you walk in with me?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Would to Heaven,"</q>
cried I, frightened to ſee how much Lord Merton was in liquor,
<q rend="inline">
"that I, too, had a brother!—and then I ſhould not be expoſed to ſuch treatment!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Lord Orville, inſtantly quitting Lady Louiſa, ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"Will Miſs Anville allow
<hi>me</hi>
the honour of taking that title?"
</q>
and then, without waiting for any anſwer, he diſengaged me from Lord Merton, and, handing me to Lady Louiſa,
<q rend="inline">"Let me,"</q>
added he,
<q rend="inline">
"take equal care of
<hi>both</hi>
my ſiſters;"
</q>
and then, deſiring her to take hold of one arm, and begging me to make uſe of the other, we reached the houſe in a moment. Lord Mer
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ton, diſordered as he was, attempted not to ſtop us.
</p>
<p>
As ſoon as we entered the houſe, I withdrew my arm, and courtſied my thanks, for my heart was too full for ſpeech. Lady Louiſa, evidently hurt at her brother's condeſcenſion, and piqued extremely by Lord Merton's behaviour, ſilent
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ly
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:1259700102:152"/>
drew away her's, and biting her lips, with a look of infinite vexation, walked ſullenly up the hall.
</p>
<p>
Lord Orville aſked her if ſhe would not go into the parlour.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No,"</q>
anſwered ſhe, haughtily;
<q rend="inline">"I leave you and your new ſiſter together,"</q>
and then ſhe walked up ſtairs.
</p>
<p>
I was quite confounded at the pride and rude
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
neſs of this ſpeech. Lord Orville himſelf ſeemed thunderſtruck; I turned from him, and went into the parlour; he followed me, ſaying,
<q rend="inline">
"Muſt I, now, apologiſe to Miſs Anville for the liberty of my interference?—or ought I to apologiſe that I did not, as I wiſhed, interfere ſooner?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O my Lord,"</q>
cried I, with an emotion I could not repreſs,
<q rend="inline">
"it is from you alone I meet with any reſpect,—all others treat me with imper
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tinence or contempt!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I am ſorry I had not more command of myſelf, as he had reaſon, juſt then, to ſuppoſe I particu
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
larly meant his ſiſter, which, I am ſure, muſt very much hurt him.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Good Heaven,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"that ſo much ſweetneſs and merit can fail to excite the love and admiration ſo juſtly their due! I cannot,—I dare not expreſs to you half the indignation I feel at this moment!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I am ſorry, my Lord,"</q>
ſaid I, more calmly,
<q rend="inline">
"to have raiſed it; but yet,—in a ſituation that calls for protection, to meet only with mortifi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cations,—indeed I am but ill formed to bear them!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"My
<hi>dear</hi>
Miſs Anville,"
</q>
cried he, warmly,
<q rend="inline">
"allow
<hi>me</hi>
to be your friend; think of me as if I were indeed your brother, and let me entreat you to accept my beſt ſervices, if there is any thing in
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:1259700102:153"/>
which I can be ſo happy as to ſhew my regard,—my reſpect for you!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Before I had time to ſpeak, the reſt of the party entered the parlour, and, as I did not wiſh to ſee any thing more of Lord Merton, at leaſt before he had ſlept, I determined to leave it. Lord Orville, ſeeing my deſign, ſaid, as I paſſed him,
<q rend="inline">"Will you go?"</q>
<q rend="inline">"Had not I beſt, my Lord?"</q>
ſaid I.
<q rend="inline">"I am afraid,"</q>
ſaid he, ſmiling,
<q rend="inline">
"ſince I muſt now ſpeak as your

I am afraid you
<hi>had;</hi>
—you ſee you may truſt me, ſince I can adviſe againſt my own intereſt."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I then left the room, and have been writing ever ſince. And methinks I can never lament the rudeneſs of Lord Merton, as it has more than ever confirmed to me the eſteem of Lord Orville.

<p>
OH Sir, what a ſtrange incident have I to re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cite! what a field of conjecture to open!
</p>
<p>
Yeſterday evening, we all went to an aſſembly. Lord Orville preſented tickets to the whole fami
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ly, and did me the honour, to the no ſmall ſur
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
priſe of all here, I believe, to dance with me. But every day abounds in freſh inſtances of his condeſcending politeneſs, and he now takes every opportunity of calling me his
<hi>friend,</hi>
and his
<hi>ſiſter.</hi>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:1259700102:154"/>
Lord Merton offered a ticket to Lady Louiſa; but ſhe was ſo much incenſed againſt him, that ſhe refuſed it with the utmoſt diſdain; neither could he prevail upon her to dance with him; ſhe ſat ſtill the whole evening, and deigned not to look at, or ſpeak to him. To me, her behaviour is almoſt the ſame, for ſhe is cold, diſtant, and haughty, and her eyes expreſs the greateſt con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tempt. But for Lord Orville, how miſerable would my reſidence here make me!
</p>
<p>
We were joined, in the ball-room, by Mr. Co
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
verley, Mr. Lovel, and Lord Merton, who look
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed as if he was doing penance, and ſat all the evening next to Lady Louiſa, vainly endeavouring to appeaſe her anger.
</p>
<p>
Lord Orville began the minuets; he danced with a young Lady who ſeemed to engage the ge
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
neral attention, as ſhe had not been ſeen here before. She is pretty, and looks mild and good
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
humoured.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Pray, Mr. Lovel,"</q>
ſaid Lady Louiſa,
<q rend="inline">"who is that?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Miſs Belmont,"</q>
anſwered he,
<q rend="inline">
"the young heireſs; ſhe came to the Wells yeſterday."

<p>
Struck with the name, I involuntarily repeated it, but nobody heard me.

</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Have you not heard of her, Ma'am?"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"ſhe is only daughter and heireſs of Sir John Belmont."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Good Heaven, how did I ſtart! the name ſtruck my ear like a thunder-bolt. Mrs. Sel
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
wyn, who immediately looked at me, ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"Be calm, my dear, and we will learn the truth of all this."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:1259700102:155"/>
Till then, I had never imagined her to be ac
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
quainted with my ſtory; but ſhe has ſince told me, that ſhe knew my unhappy mother, and was well informed of the whole affair.
</p>
<p>
She aſked Mr. Lovel a multitude of queſtions, and I gathered from his anſwers, that this young Lady was juſt come from abroad, with Sir John Belmont, who was now in London; that ſhe was under the care of his ſiſter, Mrs. Paterſon; and that ſhe would inherit a conſiderable eſtate.
</p>
<p>
I cannot expreſs the ſtrange feelings with which I was agitated during this recital. What, my dear
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
eſt Sir, can it poſſibly mean? Did you ever hear of any after-marriage?—or muſt I ſuppoſe, that, while the lawful child is rejected, another is adopt
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed?—I know not what to think! I am bewildered with a contrariety of ideas!
</p>
<p>
When we came home, Mrs. Selwyn paſſed more than an hour in my room, converſing upon this ſubject. She ſays that I ought inſtantly to go to town, find out my father, and have the affair cleared up. She aſſures me I have too ſtrong a reſemblance to my dear, though unknown mother, to allow of the leaſt heſitation in my being owned, when once I am ſeen. For my part, I have no wiſh but to act by your direction.
</p>
<p>
I can give no account of the evening; ſo diſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
turbed, ſo occupied am I by this ſubject, that I can think of no other. I have entreated Mrs. Sel
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
wyn to obſerve the ſtricteſt ſecrecy, and ſhe has promiſed that ſhe will. Indeed, ſhe has too much ſenſe to be idly communicative.
</p>
<p>
Lord Orville took notice of my being abſent and ſilent, but I ventured not to entruſt him with the cauſe. Fortunately, he was not of the party at the time Mr. Lovel made the diſcovery.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:1259700102:156"/>
Mrs. Selwyn ſays that if you approve my going to town, ſhe will herſelf accompany me. I had a thouſand times rather aſk the protection of Mrs. Mirvan, but, after this offer, that will not be poſſible.
</p>
<p>
Adieu, my deareſt Sir. I am ſure you will write immediately, and I ſhall be all impatience till your letter arrives.

<p>
GOOD God, my dear Sir, what a wonderful tale have I again to relate! even yet, I am not recovered from my extreme ſurpriſe.
</p>
<p>
Yeſterday morning, as ſoon as I had finiſhed my haſty letter, I was ſummoned to attend a walk
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing party to the Hotwells. It conſiſted only of Mrs. Selwyn and Lord Orville. The latter walk
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed by my ſide all the way, and his converſation diſſipated my uneaſineſs, and inſenſibly reſtored my ſerenity.
</p>
<p>
At the pump-room, I ſaw Mr. Macartney; I courtſied to him twice ere he would ſpeak to me. When he did, I began to apologiſe for having diſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
appointed him; but I did not find it very eaſy to excuſe myſelf, as Lord Orville's eyes, with an ex
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
preſſion of anxiety that diſtreſſed me, turned from him to me, and me to him, every word I ſpoke. Convinced, however, that I had really trifled with
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:1259700102:157"/>
Mr. Macartney, I ſcrupled not to beg his pardon. He was, then, not merely appeaſed, but even grateful.
</p>
<p>
He requeſted me to ſee him to-morrow: but I had not the folly to be again guilty of an indiſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cretion which had, already, cauſed me ſo much uneaſineſs; and therefore, I told him, frankly, that it was not in my power, at preſent, to ſee him, but by accident: and, to prevent his being offended, I hinted to him the reaſon I could not receive him as I wiſhed to do.
</p>
<p>
When I had ſatisfied both him and myſelf upon this ſubject, I turned to Lord Orville, and ſaw, with concern, the gravity of his countenance. I would have ſpoken to him, but knew not how; I believe, however, he read my thoughts, for in a little time, with a ſort of ſerious ſmile, he ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"Does not Mr. Macartney complain of his diſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
appointment?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Not much, my Lord."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"And how have you appeaſed him?"</q>
Finding I heſitated what to anſwer,
<q rend="inline">"Am I not your brother?"</q>
continued he,
<q rend="inline">"and muſt I not enquire into your affairs?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Certainly, my Lord,"</q>
ſaid I, laughing,
<q rend="inline">
"I only wiſh it were better worth your Lord
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſhip's while."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Let me, then, make immediate uſe of my privilege. When ſhall you ſee Mr. Macartney again?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Indeed, my Lord, I can't tell."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"But,—do you know that I ſhall not ſuffer
<hi>my ſiſter</hi>
to make a private appointment?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Pray, my Lord,"</q>
cried I, earneſtly,
<q rend="inline">
"uſe that word no more! indeed you ſhock me extre
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
mely."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:1259700102:158"/>
<q rend="inline">"That would I not do for the world,"</q>
cried he;
<q rend="inline">
"yet you know not how warmly, how deeply I am intereſted, not only in all your concerns, but in all your actions."
</q>
</p>
<p>
This ſpeech,—the moſt particular one Lord Orville had ever made to me, ended our conver
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſation for that time, for I was too much ſtruck by it to make any anſwer.
</p>
<p>
Soon after, Mr. Macartney, in a low voice, entreated me not to deny him the gratificati
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
on of returning the money. While he was ſpeaking, the young Lady I ſaw yeſterday at the aſſembly, with a large party, entered the pump-room. Mr. Macartney turned as pale as death, his voice faltered, and he ſeemed not to know what he ſaid. I was myſelf almoſt equally diſturbed, by the croud of confuſed ideas that occured to me. Good Heaven, thought I, why ſhould he be thus agi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tated?—is it poſſible this can be the young Lady he loved?
</p>
<p>
In a few minutes, we quitted the pump
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
room, and though I twice wiſhed Mr. Macartney good morning, he was ſo abſent he did not hear me.
</p>
<p>
We did not immediately return to Clifton, as Mrs. Selwyn had buſineſs at a pamphlet-ſhop. While ſhe was looking at ſome new poems, Lord Orville again aſked me when I ſhould ſee Mr. Macartney?
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Indeed, my Lord,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">
"I know not; but I would give the univerſe for a few moments converſation with him!"
</q>
I ſpoke this with a ſim
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ple ſincerity, and was not aware of the force of my own words.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"The univerſe!"</q>
repeated he,
<q rend="inline">
"Good God, Miſs Anville, do you ſay this to
<hi>me?</hi>
"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:1259700102:159"/>
<q rend="inline">"I would ſay it,"</q>
returned I,
<q rend="inline">"to any body, my Lord."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I beg your pardon,"</q>
ſaid he, in a voice that ſhewed him ill pleaſed,
<q rend="inline">"I am anſwered!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q>
cried, I,
<q rend="inline">
"you muſt not judge hardly of me. I ſpoke inadvertently; but if you knew the painful ſuſpence I ſuffer at this moment, you would not be ſurpriſed at what I have ſaid."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"And would a meeting with Mr. Macartney relieve you from that ſuſpence?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Yes, my Lord, two words might be ſuffici
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ent."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Would to Heaven,"</q>
cried he, after a ſhort pauſe,
<q rend="inline">
"that I were worthy to know their im
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
port!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Worthy, my Lord!—O, if that were all, your Lordſhip could aſk nothing I ſhould not be ready to anſwer! if I were but at liberty to ſpeak, I ſhould be
<hi>proud</hi>
of your Lordſhip's enquiries; but indeed I am not, I have no right to commu
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nicate the affairs of Mr. Macartney,—your Lord
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſhip cannot ſuppoſe I have."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I will own to you,"</q>
anſwered he,
<q rend="inline">
"I know not
<hi>what</hi>
to ſuppoſe; yet there ſeems a frankneſs even in your myſtery,—and ſuch an air of open
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
neſs in your countenance, that I am willing to hope,—"
</q>
He ſtopped a moment, and then added,
<q rend="inline">
"This meeting you ſay, is eſſential to your re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
poſe?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I did not ſay
<hi>that,</hi>
my Lord; but yet I have the moſt important reaſons for wiſhing to ſpeak to him."
</q>
</p>
<p>
He pauſed a few minutes, and then ſaid, with warmth,
<q rend="inline">
"Yes, you
<hi>ſhall</hi>
ſpeak to him!—I will myſelf aſſiſt you!—Miſs Anville, I am ſure can
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
not form a wiſh againſt propriety, I will aſk no queſtions, I will rely upon her own purity; and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:1259700102:160"/>
uninformed, blindfold as I am, I will ſerve her with all my power!"
</q>
and then he went into the ſhop, leaving me ſo ſtrangely affected by his ge
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nerous behaviour, that I almoſt wiſhed to follow him with my thanks.
</p>
<p>
When Mrs. Selwyn had tranſacted her affairs, we returned home.
</p>
<p>
The moment dinner was over, Lord Orville went out, and did not come back till juſt as we were ſummoned to ſupper. This is the longeſt time he has ſpent from the houſe ſince I have been at Clifton, and you cannot imagine, my dear Sir, how much I miſſed him. I ſcarce knew before how infinitely I am indebted to him alone for the happineſs I have enjoyed ſince I have been at Mrs. Beaumont's.
</p>
<p>
As I generally go down ſtairs laſt, he came to me the moment the ladies had paſſed by, and ſaid,
<q rend="inline">"Shall you be at home to-morrow morning?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I believe ſo, my Lord."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"And will you, then, receive a viſitor for me?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"For you, my Lord!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Yes;—I have made acquaintance with Mr. Macartney, and he has promiſed to call upon me to-morrow about three o'clock."
</q>
</p>
<p>And then, taking my hand, he led me down ſtairs.</p>
<p>
O Sir,—was there ever ſuch another man as Lord Orville?—Yes,
<hi>one</hi>
other now reſides at Berry-Hill!
</p>
<p>
This morning there has been a great deal of company here, but at the time appointed by Lord Orville, doubtleſs with that conſideration, the parlour is almoſt always empty, as every body is dreſſing.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:1259700102:161"/>
Mrs. Beaumont, however, was not gone up ſtairs, when Mr. Macartney ſent in his name.
</p>
<p>
Lord Orville immediately ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"Beg the fa
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
vour of him to walk in. You ſee, Madam, that I conſider myſelf as at home.
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I hope ſo,"</q>
anſwered Mrs. Beaumont,
<q rend="inline">"or I ſhould be very uneaſy."</q>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Macartney then entered. I believe we both felt very conſcious to whom the viſit was paid: but Lord Orville received him as his own gueſt, and not merely entertained him as ſuch while Mrs. Beaumont remained in the room, but for ſome time after ſhe went; a delicacy that ſav
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed me from the embarraſſment I ſhould have felt, had he immediately quitted us.
</p>
<p>
In a few minutes, however, he gave Mr. Ma
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cartney a book,—for I, too, by way of pretence for continuing in the room, pretended to be read
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing,—and begged he would be ſo good as to look it over, while he anſwered a note, which he would diſpatch in a few minutes, and return to him.
</p>
<p>
When he was gone, we both parted with our books, and Mr. Macartney, again producing the paper with the money, beſought me to accept it.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Pray,</q>
"ſaid I, ſtill declining it,
<q rend="inline">
"did you know the young lady who came into the pump
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
room yeſterday morning?
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Know her!"</q>
repeated he, changing colour,
<q rend="inline">"Oh, but too well!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Indeed!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">Why, Madam, do you aſk?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I muſt beſeech you to ſatisfy me further upon this ſubject; pray tell me who ſhe is."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Inviolably as I meant to keep my ſecret, I can refuſe you, Madam, nothing;—that lady
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:1259700102:162"/>
—is the daughter of Sir John Belmont!—of my father!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Gracious Heaven!"</q>
cried I, involuntarily laying my hand on his arm,
<q rend="inline">"you are then—",</q>
<hi>my brother,</hi>
I would have ſaid, but my voice fail
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed me, and I burſt into tears.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Oh, Madam,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">"what can this mean?—What can thus diſtreſs you?"</q>
</p>
<p>
I could not anſwer him, but held out my hand to him. He ſeemed greatly ſurpriſed, and talked in high terms of my condeſcenſion.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Spare yourſelf,"</q>
cried I, wiping my eyes,
<q rend="inline">
"ſpare yourſelf this miſtake,—you have a
<hi>right</hi>
to all I can do for you; the ſimilarity of our cir
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cumſtances—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
We were then interrupted by the entrance of Mrs. Selwyn; and Mr. Macartney, finding no probability of our being left alone, was obliged to take leave, tho', I believe, very reluctantly, while in ſuch ſuſpence.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Selwyn then, by dint of interrogatories, drew from me the ſtate of this affair. She is ſo penetrating, that there is no poſſibility of evading to give her ſatisfaction.
</p>
<p>
Is not this a ſtrange event? Good Heaven, how little did I think that the viſits I ſo unwilling
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ly paid at Mr. Branghton's would have introduc
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed me to ſo near a relation! I will never again re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
gret the time I ſpent in town this ſummer: a cir
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cumſtance ſo fortunate will always make me think of it with pleaſure.
</p>
</div>
<div type="section">

</p>
<p>
<hi>
His ſight is baneful to my repoſe,—his ſociety is death to my future tranquility!

Oh, Lord Or

</p>
<p>
Yes, Sir, I
<hi>will</hi>
quit him;—would to Hea

<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tention, I was moſt to be pitied,—and, when moſt exalted by your notice, you were moſt my enemy!
</p>
<p>
You, Sir, relied upon my ignorance;—I, alas, upon your experience; and, whenever I doubted the weakneſs of my heart, the idea that
<hi>you</hi>
did not ſuſpect it, reaſſured me,—reſ

ſtored my courage, and confirmed my error!—Yet am I moſt ſenſible of the kindneſs of your ſilence?

Oh, Sir! why have I ever quitted you!—why been expoſed to dangers to which I am ſo unequal?
</p>
<p>
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:1259700102:164"/>
But I will leave this place,—leave Lord Or

</p>
<p>
The more I conſider of parting with Lord Or

<p>
No, I cannot tell him I am going,—I dare not truſt myſelf to take leave of him,—I will run away without ſeeing him:—implicitly will I follow your advice, avoid his ſight, and ſhun his ſociety!
</p>
<p>
To-morrow morning I will ſet off for Berry Hill. Mrs. Selwyn and Mrs. Beaumont ſhall alone know my intention. And to-day,—I will ſpend in my own room. The readineſs of my obedience is the only atonement I can offer for the weakneſs which calls for its exertion.

<p>
Can you, will you, moſt honoured, moſt dear Sir!—ſole prop by which the poor Evelina is ſupported,—can you, without reproach, without diſpleaſure, receive the child you have ſo care

I HAVE only time, my deareſt Sir, for three words, to overtake my laſt letter, and prevent your expecting me immediately; for, when I communicated my intention to Mrs. Sel
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
wyn, ſhe would not hear of it, and declared, it would be highly ridiculous for me to go be

fore I received an anſwer to my intelligence, concerning the journey from Paris. She has, therefore, inſiſted upon my waiting till your next letter arrives. I hope you will not be diſpleaſed at my compliance, though it is rather againſt my own judgment; but Mrs. Selwyn quite overpowered me with the force of her argu

I will, however, ſee very little of Lord Orville; I will never come down ſtairs before breakfaſt; give up all my walks in the garden,—ſeat myſelf next to Mrs. Selwyn, and not merely avoid his converſation, but ſhun his preſence. I will exert all the prudence, and all the reſolution in my power,—to prevent this ſhort delay from giving you any further uneaſineſs.

<p>
YESTERDAY, from the time I received your kind, though heart-piercing letter, I kept my room,—for I was equally unable and unwilling to ſee Lord Orville: but this morning, finding I ſeemed deſtined to paſs a few days longer here, I endeavoured to calm my ſpirits, and to appear as uſual; though I determined to avoid him as much as ſhould be in my power. Indeed, as I entered the parlour, when called to breakfaſt, my thoughts were ſo much occupied with your letter, that I felt as much confuſion at his ſight, as if he had himſelf been informed of its con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tents.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Beaumont made me a ſlight compliment upon my recovery, for I had pleaded illneſs to excuſe keeping my room: Lady Louiſa ſpoke not a word: but Lord Orville, little imagining himſelf the cauſe of my indiſpoſition, enquired concerning my health with the moſt diſtinguiſh
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing politeneſs. I hardly made any anſwer, and, for the firſt time ſince I have been here, contriv
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed to ſit at ſome diſtance from him.
</p>
<p>
I could not help obſerving that my reſerve ſurpriſed him; yet he perſiſted in his civilities, and ſeemed to wiſh to remove it. But I paid him but very little attention; and the moment breakfaſt was over, inſtead of taking a book, or walking in the garden, I retired to my own room.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:1259700102:167"/>
Soon after, Mrs. Selwyn came to tell me that Lord Orville had been propoſing I ſhould take an airing, and perſuading her to let him drive us both in his phaeton. She delivered the meſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſage with an archneſs that made me bluſh, and added, that an airing, in
<hi>
my Lord Orville's car
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
riage,
</hi>
could not fail to revive my ſpirits. There is no poſſibility of eſcaping her diſcernment; ſhe has frequently rallied me upon his Lordſhip's at
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tention,—and, alas!—upon the pleaſure with which I have received it! However, I abſolute
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ly refuſed the offer.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Well,"</q>
ſaid ſhe, laughing,
<q rend="inline">
"I cannot juſt now indulge you with any ſolicitation; for, to tell you the truth, I have buſineſs to tranſact at the Wells, and am glad to be excuſed myſelf. I would aſk you to walk with

—but, ſince
<hi>Lord Orville</hi>

<hi>I</hi>
have not the preſumption to hope for ſucceſs."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Indeed,"</q>
cried I,

"you are miſtaken; I will attend

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O rare coquetry!"</q>

<p>
I had not ſpirits to anſwer her, and therefore put on my hat and cloak in ſilence.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I preſume,"</q>
continued ſhe, drily,
<q rend="inline">"his Lordſhip may walk with us?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"If ſo, Madam,"</q>
ſaid I,
<q rend="inline">
"you will have a companion, and I will ſtay at home."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My dear child,"</q>
cried ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
"did you bring the certificate of your birth with you?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Dear Madam, no!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why then, we ſhall never be known again at Berry Hill."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I felt too conſcious to enjoy her pleaſantry; but I believe ſhe was determined to torment me;
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:1259700102:168"/>
for ſhe aſked if ſhe ſhould inform Lord Orville that I deſired him not to be of the party?
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"By no means, Madam;—but, indeed, I had rather not walk myſelf."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My dear,"</q>
cried ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
"I really do not know you this morning,—you have certainly been taking a leſſon of Lady Louiſa."
</q>
</p>
<p>
She then went down ſtairs; but preſently re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
turning, told me ſhe had acquainted Lord Orville that I did not chooſe to go out in the phaeton, but preferred a walk,
<hi>tete-a-tete</hi>
with her, by way of
<hi>variety.</hi>
</p>
<p>
I ſaid nothing, but was really vexed. She bid me go down ſtairs, and ſaid ſhe would follow im
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
mediately.
</p>
<p>
Lord Orville met me in the hall.
<q rend="inline">"I fear,"</q>
ſaid he,
<q rend="inline">"Miſs Anville is not yet quite well?"</q>
and he would have taken my hand, but I turned from him, and courtſying ſlightly, went into the parlour.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Beaumont and Lady Louiſa were at work: Lord Merton was talking with the latter; for he has now made his peace, and been again received into favour.
</p>
<p>
I ſeated myſelf, as uſual, by the window. Lord Orville, in a few minutes, came to me, and ſaid,
<q rend="inline">"Why is Miſs Anville ſo grave?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Not grave, my Lord,"</q>
ſaid I,
<q rend="inline">
"only ſtu
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
pid;"
</q>
and I took up a book.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You will go,"</q>
ſaid he, after a ſhort pauſe,
<q rend="inline">"to the aſſembly to-night?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, my Lord, certainly not."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Neither, then, will I; for I ſhould be ſorry to ſully the remembrance I have of the happineſs I enjoyed at the laſt."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Selwyn then coming in, general enquiries were made, to all but me, of who would go to
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:1259700102:169"/>
the aſſembly. Lord Orville inſtantly declared he had letters to write at home; but every one elſe
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
<desc>•</desc>
</gap>
ettled to go.
</p>
<p>
I then haſtened Mrs. Selwyn away, tho' not be
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
fore ſhe had ſaid to Lord Orville,
<q rend="inline">
"Pray has your Lordſhip obtained Miſs Anville's leave to favour us with your company?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I have not, Madam,"</q>
anſwered he,
<q rend="inline">"had the vanity to aſk it."</q>
</p>
<p>
During our walk, Mrs. Selwyn tormented me unmercifully. She told me, that ſince I declined any addition to our party, I muſt, doubtleſs, be conſcious of my own powers of entertainment; and begged me, therefore, to exert them freely. I repented a thouſand times having conſented to walk alone with her; for though I made the moſt painful efforts to appear in ſpirits, her raillery quite overpowered me.
</p>
<p>
The firſt place we went to was the pump-room. It was full of company; and the moment we en
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tered, I heard a murmuring of,
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>That's ſhe!</hi>
"
</q>
and, to my great confuſion, I ſaw every eye turn
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed towards me. I pulled my hat over my face, and, by the aſſiſtance of Mrs. Selwyn, endeavour
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed to ſcreen myſelf from obſervation: neverthe
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
leſs, I found I was ſo much the object of general attention, that I entreated her to haſten away. But, unfortunately, ſhe had entered into conver
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſation, very earneſtly, with a gentleman of her acquaintance, and would not liſten to me, but ſaid, that if I was tired of waiting, I might walk on to the milliner's with the Miſs Watkins, two young ladies I had ſeen at Mrs. Beaumont's who were going thither.
</p>
<p>
I accepted the offer very readily, and away we went. But we had not gone three yards, ere we were followed by a party of young men, who
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:1259700102:170"/>
took every poſſible opportunity of looking at us, and, as they walked behind, talked aloud, in a manner at once unintelligible and abſurd.
<q rend="inline">"Yes,"</q>
cried one,
<q rend="inline">"'tis certainly ſhe!"</q>
—mark but her
<hi>bluſhing cheek!</hi>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"And then her
<hi>eye,</hi>
—her
<hi>downcaſt eye!</hi>
"
</q>
cried another.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"True, oh moſt true,"</q>
ſaid a third,
<q rend="inline">
<hi>every beauty is her own!</hi>
"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"But then,"</q>
ſaid the firſt,
<q rend="inline">
"her
<hi>mind,</hi>
—now the difficulty is, to find out the truth of
<hi>that,</hi>
—for ſhe will not ſay a word."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"She is
<hi>timid,</hi>
"
</q>
anſwered another;
<q rend="inline">
"mark but her
<hi>timid air.</hi>
"
</q>
</p>
<p>
During this converſation, we all walked on, ſi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
lent and quick; as we knew not to whom it was particularly addreſſed, we were all equally aſham
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed, and equally deſirous to avoid ſuch unaccoun
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
table obſervations.
</p>
<p>
Soon after, we were caught in a violent ſhower of rain. We hurried on, and the care of our cloaths occupying our hands, we were ſeparated from one another. Theſe gentlemen offered their ſervices in the moſt preſſing manner, begging us to make uſe of their arms; and two of them were ſo particularly troubleſome to me, that, in my haſte to avoid them, I unfortunately ſtumbled, and fell down. They both aſſiſted in helping me up; and that very inſtant, while I was yet between them, upon raiſing my eyes, the firſt object they met was Sir Clement Willough
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
by!
</p>
<p>
He ſtarted; ſo, I am ſure, did I.
<q rend="inline">"Good God!"</q>
exclaimed he, with his uſual quickneſs,
<q rend="inline">"Miſs Anville!—I hope to Heaven you are not hurt?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:1259700102:171"/>
<q rend="inline">"No,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">
"not at all; but I am ter
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ribly dirtied."
</q>
I then, without much difficulty, diſengaged myſelf from my tormentors, who im
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
mediately gave way to Sir Clement, and entirely quitted us.
</p>
<p>
He teized me to make uſe of his arm; and, when I declined it, aſked, very ſignificantly, if I was much acquainted with thoſe gentlemen who had juſt left me?
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No,"</q>
anſwered I,
<q rend="inline">
"they are quite un
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
known to me."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"And yet,"</q>
ſaid he,
<q rend="inline">
"you allowed
<hi>them</hi>
the honour of aſſiſting you. Oh, Miſs Anville, to me alone will you ever be thus cruel?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Indeed, Sir Clement, their aſſiſtance was
<hi>forced</hi>
upon me, for I would have given the world to have avoided them."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Good God!"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"why did I not ſooner know your ſituation?—But I only arrived here this morning, and I had not even learnt where you lodged."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Did you know, then, that I was at Briſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tol?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Would to Heaven,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"that I
<hi>could</hi>
remain in ignorance of your proceedings with the ſame contentment you do of mine! then ſhould I not for ever journey upon the wings of hope, to meet my own deſpair!
<hi>You</hi>
cannot even judge of the cruelty of my fate, for the eaſe and ſerenity of your mind, incapacitates you from feel
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing for the agitation of mine."
</q>
</p>
<p>
The eaſe and ſerenity of
<hi>my</hi>
mind! alas, how little do I merit thoſe words!
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"But;"</q>
added he,
<q rend="inline">
"had
<hi>accident</hi>
brought me hither, had I not known of your journey, the voice of fame would have proclaimed it to me in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſtantly upon my arrival."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"The voice of fame!"</q>
repeated I.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:1259700102:172"/>
<q rend="inline">
"Yes, for your's was the firſt name I heard at the pump-room. But, had I
<hi>not</hi>
heard your name, ſuch a deſcription could have painted no one elſe."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Indeed,"</q>
ſaid I,
<q rend="inline">"I do not underſtand you."</q>
But, juſt then arriving at the milliner's, our con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
verſation ended; for I ran up ſtairs to wipe the dirt off my gown. I ſhould have been glad to have remained there till Mrs. Selwyn came, but the Miſs Watkins called me into the ſhop, to look at caps and ribbons.
</p>
<p>
I found Sir Clement buſily engaged in looking at lace ruffles. Inſtantly, however, approaching me,
<q rend="inline">"How charmed I am,"</q>
ſaid he,
<q rend="inline">
"to ſee you look ſo well! I was told you were ill,—but I never ſaw you in better health,—never more infi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nitely lovely!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I turned away to examine the ribbons, and ſoon after Mrs. Selwyn made her appearance. I found that ſhe was acquainted with Sir Clement, and her manner of ſpeaking to him, convinced me that he was a favourite with her.
</p>
<p>
When their mutual compliments were over, ſhe turned to me, and ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"Pray, Miſs An
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ville, how long can you live without nouriſh
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ment?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Indeed, Ma'am,"</q>
ſaid I, laughing,
<q rend="inline">"I have never tried."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Becauſe ſo long, and no longer,"</q>
anſwered ſhe,
<q rend="inline">"you may remain at Briſtol."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why, what is the matter, Ma'am?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"The matter!—why, all the ladies are at open war with you,—the whole pump-room is in con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
fuſion; and you, innocent as you pretend to look, are the cauſe. However if you take my advice, you will be very careful how you eat and drink during your ſtay."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:1259700102:173"/>
I begged her to explain herſelf: and ſhe then told me, that a copy of verſes had been dropt in the pump-room, and read there aloud:
<q rend="inline">"The beauties of the well,"</q>
ſaid ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
"are all menti
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
oned, but
<hi>you</hi>
are the Venus to whom the prize is given."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Is it then poſſible,"</q>
cried Sir Clement,
<q rend="inline">"that you have not ſeen theſe verſes?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I hardly know,"</q>
anſwered I,
<q rend="inline">
"whether
<hi>any</hi>
body has."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I aſſure you,"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Selwyn,
<q rend="inline">
"if you give
<hi>me</hi>
the invention of them, you do me an ho
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nour I by no means deſerve."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I wrote down in my tablets,"</q>
ſaid Sir Cle
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ment,
<q rend="inline">
"the ſtanzas which concern Miſs Anville, this morning at the pump-room; and I will do myſelf the honour of copying them for her this evening."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"But why the part that concerned
<hi>
Miſs Anvil
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
le?
</hi>
"
</q>
ſaid Mrs. Selwyn;
<q rend="inline">"Did you ever ſee her before this morning?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Oh yes,"</q>
anſwered he,
<q rend="inline">
"I have had that happineſs frequently at Captain Mirvan's. Too, too frequently!"
</q>
added he, in a low voice, as Mrs. Selwyn turned to the milliner: and, as ſoon as ſhe was occupied in examining ſome trimmings, he came to me, and, almoſt whe
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ther I would or not, entered into converſation with me.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I have a thouſand things,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">"to ſay to you. Pray where are you?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"With Mrs. Selwyn, Sir."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Indeed!—then, for once, Chance is my friend. And how long have you been here?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"About three weeks."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Good Heaven! what an anxious ſearch have I had, to diſcover your abode, ſince you ſo ſud
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
denly
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:1259700102:174"/>
left town! The termagant Madame Duval refuſed me all intelligence. Oh, Miſs Anville, did you know what I have endured! the ſleep
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
leſs, reſtleſs ſtate of ſuſpence I have been tortur
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed with, you could not, all cruel as you are, you could not have received me with ſuch frigid indif

ference!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Received</hi>
you, Sir!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why, is not my viſit to
<hi>you?</hi>
Do you think I ſhould have made this journey, but for the hap
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
pineſs of again ſeeing you?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Indeed it is poſſible I might,—ſince ſo many others do."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Cruel, cruel girl! you
<hi>know</hi>
that I adore you!—you
<hi>know</hi>
you are the miſtreſs of my ſoul, and arbitreſs of my fate!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Selwyn then advancing to us, he aſſumed a more diſengaged air, and aſked if he ſhould not have the pleaſure of ſeeing her, in the evening, at the aſſembly?
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Oh yes,"</q>
cried ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
"we ſhall certainly be there; ſo you may bring the verſes with you, if Miſs Anville can wait for them ſo long."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I hope, then,"</q>
returned he,
<q rend="inline">"that you will do me the honour to dance with me?"</q>
</p>
<p>
I thanked him, but ſaid I ſhould not be at the aſſembly.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Not be at the aſſembly!"</q>
cried Mrs. Selwyn,
<q rend="inline">
"Why, have
<hi>you,</hi>
too, letters to write?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
She looked at me with a ſignificant archneſs that made me colour; and I haſtily anſwered,
<q rend="inline">"No, indeed, Ma'am!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You have not!"</q>
cried ſhe, yet more drily,
<q rend="inline">
"then pray, my dear, do you ſtay at home to
<hi>help,</hi>
—or to
<hi>hinder</hi>
others?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:1259700102:175"/>
<q rend="inline">"To do neither, Ma'am,"</q>
anſwered I, in much confuſion;
<q rend="inline">
"ſo, if you pleaſe, I will
<hi>not</hi>
ſtay at home."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You allow me, then,"</q>
ſaid Sir Clement,
<q rend="inline">"to hope for the honour of your hand?"</q>
</p>
<p>
I only bowed,—for the dread of Mrs. Selwyn's raillery made me not dare to refuſe him.
</p>
<p>
Soon after this, we walked home; Sir Cle
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ment accompanied us, and the converſation that paſſed between Mrs. Selwyn and him was ſup
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ported in ſo lively a manner, that I ſhould have been much entertained, had my mind been more at eaſe: but alas! I could think of nothing but the capricious, the unmeaning appearance which the alteration in my conduct muſt make in the eyes of Lord Orville! And, much as I wiſh to avoid him, greatly as I deſire to ſave myſelf from having my weakneſs known to him,—yet I can
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
not endure to incur his ill opinion,—and, unac
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
quainted as he is with the reaſons by which I am actuated, how can he fail contemning a change, to him ſo unaccountable?
</p>
<p>
As we entered the garden, he was the firſt ob
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ject we ſaw. He advanced to meet us, and I could not help obſerving, that at ſight of each other, both he and Sir Clement changed colour.
</p>
<p>
We went into the parlour, where we found the ſame party we had left. Mrs. Selwyn preſented Sir Clement to Mrs. Beaumont; Lady Louiſa and Lord Merton he ſeemed well acquainted with already.
</p>
<p>
The converſation was upon the general ſubjects, of the weather, the company at the Wells, and the news of the day. But Sir Clement, drawing his chair next to mine, took every opportunity of addreſſing himſelf to me in particular.
</p>
<p>
I could not but remark the ſtriking difference of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1259700102:176"/>
<hi>his</hi>
attention, and that of Lord Orville: the lat
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ter has ſuch gentleneſs of manners, ſuch delicacy of conduct, and an air ſo reſpectful, that, when he flatters moſt, he never diſtreſſes, and when he moſt confers honour, appears to receive it! The former
<hi>obtrudes</hi>
his attention, and
<hi>forces</hi>
mine; it is ſo pointed, that it always confuſes me, and ſo public, that it attracts general notice. Indeed I have ſometimes thought that he would rather
<hi>wiſh,</hi>
than diſlike to have his partiality for me known, as he takes great care to prevent my be
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing ſpoken to by any body but himſelf.
</p>
<p>
When, at length, he went away, Lord Or
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ville took his ſeat, and ſaid with a half-ſmile,
<q rend="inline">
"Shall
<hi>I</hi>
call Sir Clement,—or will
<hi>you</hi>
call me an uſurper, for taking this place?—You make me no anſwer?—Muſt I then ſuppoſe that Sir Clement—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"It is little worth your Lordſhip's while,"</q>
ſaid I,
<q rend="inline">
"to ſuppoſe any thing upon ſo inſignificant an occaſion."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Pardon me,"</q>
cried he,—
<q rend="inline">
"to
<hi>me</hi>
nothing is inſignificant in which you are concerned."
</q>
</p>
<p>
To this I made no anſwer, neither did he ſay any thing more, till the ladies retired to dreſs; and then, when I would have followed them, he ſtopped me, ſaying,
<q rend="inline">"One moment, I entreat you!"</q>
</p>
<p>
I turned back, and he went on.
<q rend="inline">
"I greatly fear that I have been ſo unfortunate as to offend you; yet ſo repugnant to my very ſoul is the idea, that I know not how to ſuppoſe it poſſible I can un
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
wittingly have done the thing in the world that, deſignedly, I would moſt wiſh to avoid."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, indeed, my Lord, you have not!"</q>
ſaid I.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You ſigh,"</q>
cried he, taking my hand,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:1259700102:177"/>
<q rend="inline">
"would to Heaven I were the ſharer of your un
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
eaſineſs whenceſoever it ſprings! with what earn
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
eſtneſs would I not ſtruggle to alleviate it!—Tell me, my dear Miſs Anville,—my new-adopted ſiſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ter, my ſweet and moſt amiable friend!—tell me, I beſeech you, if I can afford you any aſſiſtance?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"None, none, my Lord!"</q>
cried I, with
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
drawing my hand, and moving towards the door.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Is it then impoſſible I can ſerve you?—per
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
haps you wiſh to ſee Mr. Macartney again?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, my Lord."</q>
And I held the door open.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I am not, I own, ſorry for that. Yet, oh, Miſs Anville, there
<hi>is</hi>
a queſtion,—there is a con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
jecture,—I know not how to mention, becauſe I dread the reſult!—But I ſee you are in haſte;—perhaps in the evening I may have the honour of a longer converſation.—Yet one thing will you have the goodneſs to allow me to aſk?—Did you, this morning when you went to the Wells,—did you
<hi>know</hi>
who you ſhould meet there?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Who, my Lord?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I beg your pardon a thonſand times for a curioſity ſo unlicenſed,—but I will ſay no more at preſent."
</q>
</p>
<p>
He bowed, expecting me to go,—and then, with quick ſteps, but a heavy heart, I came to my own room. His queſtion, I am ſure, meant Sir Clement Willoughby; and, had I not impoſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed upon upon myſelf the ſevere taſk of avoiding, flying Lord Orville with all my power, I would inſtantly have ſatisfied him of my ignorance of Sir Clement's journey. And yet more did I long to ſay ſomething of the aſſembly, ſince I found he depended upon my ſpending the evening at home.
</p>
<p>
I did not go down ſtairs again till the family was aſſembled to dinner. My dreſs, I ſaw, ſtruck Lord Orville with aſtoniſhment; and I was my
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſelf
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:1259700102:178"/>
ſo much aſhamed of appearing whimſical and unſteady, that I could not look up.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I underſtood,"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Beaumont,
<q rend="inline">"that Miſs Anville did not go out this evening?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Her intention in the morning,"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Selwyn,

<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

which upon ſecond thoughts, is not to be reſiſted."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"The aſſembly!"</q>
cried Lord Orville,
<q rend="inline">"are you then going to the aſſembly?"</q>
</p>
<p>
I made no anſwer; and we all took our places at table.
</p>
<p>
It was not without difficulty that I contrived to give up my uſual ſeat; but I was determined to adhere to the promiſe in my yeſterday's letter, though I ſaw that Lord Orville ſeemed quite con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
founded at my viſible endeavours to avoid him.
</p>
<p>
After dinner, we all went into the drawing
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
room together, as there were no gentlemen to de
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tain his Lordſhip; and then, before I could place myſelf out of his way, he ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"You are then really going to the aſſembly?—May I aſk if you ſhall dance?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I believe not,—my Lord."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"If I did not fear,"</q>
continued he,
<q rend="inline">
"that you would be tired of the ſame partner at two follow
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing aſſemblies, I would give up my letter-writing till to-morrow, and ſolicit the honour of your hand."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"If I
<hi>do</hi>
dance,"
</q>
ſaid I, in great confuſion,
<q rend="inline">"I believe I am engaged."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Engaged!"</q>
cried he, with earneſtneſs,
<q rend="inline">"May I aſk to whom?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"To—Sir Clement Willoughby, my Lord?"</q>
</p>
<p>
He ſaid nothing, but looked very little pleaſed, and did not addreſs himſelf to me any more all the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:1259700102:179"/>
afternoon. Oh, Sir!—thus ſituated, how com
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
fortleſs were the feelings of your Evelina!
</p>
<p>
Early in the evening, with his accuſtomed aſſiduity, Sir Clement came to conduct us to the aſſembly. He ſoon contrived to ſeat himſelf next me, and, in a low voice, paid me ſo many compliments, that I knew not which way to look.
</p>
<p>
Lord Orville hardly ſpoke a word, and his countenance was grave and thoughtful; yet when
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ever I raiſed my eyes, his, I perceived, were di
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
rected towards me, though inſtantly, upon meet
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing mine, he looked another way.
</p>
<p>
In a ſhort time, Sir Clement, taking from his pocket a folded paper, ſaid, almoſt in a whiſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
per,
<q rend="inline">
"Here, lovelieſt of women, you will ſee a faint, a ſucceſsleſs attempt, to paint the ob
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ject of all my adoration! yet, weak as are the lines for the purpoſe, I envy beyond expreſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſion the happy mortal who has dared make the effort."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I will look at them,"</q>
ſaid I,
<q rend="inline">"ſome other time."</q>
For, conſcious that I was obſerved by Lord Orville, I could not bear he ſhould ſee me take a written paper, ſo privately offered, from Sir Clement. But Sir Clement is an im
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
practicable man, and I never yet ſucceeded in any attempt to fruſtrate whatever he had plan
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ned.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No,"</q>
ſaid he, ſtill in a whiſper,
<q rend="inline">"you muſt take it now, while Lady Louiſa is away,"</q>
(for ſhe and Mrs. Selwyn were gone up ſtairs to finiſh their dreſs,)
<q rend="inline">"as ſhe muſt by no means ſee them."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Indeed,"</q>
ſaid I,
<q rend="inline">"I have no intention to ſhew them."</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:1259700102:180"/>
<q rend="inline">"But the only way,"</q>
anſwered he,
<q rend="inline">
"to avoid ſuſpicion, is to take them in her ab
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſence. I would have read them aloud myſelf, but that they are not proper to be ſeen by any body in this houſe, yourſelf and Mrs. Selwyn excepted."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Then again he preſented me the paper, which I now was obliged to take, as I found declin
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing it was vain. But I was ſorry that this action ſhould be ſeen, and the whiſpering remarked, though the purport of the converſation was left to conjecture.
</p>
<p>
As I held it in my hand, Sir Clement teaz
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed me to look at it immediately; and told me, that the reaſon he could not produce the lines publicly, was, that, among the ladies who were mentioned, and ſuppoſed to be rejected, was Lady Louiſa Larpent. I am much concerned at this circumſtance, as I cannot doubt but that it will render me more diſagreeable to her than ever, if ſhe ſhould hear of it.
</p>
<p>
I will now copy the verſes, which Sir Clement would not let me reſt till I had read.
</p>
<q>
<lg>
<l>SEE, laſt advance, with baſhful grace,</l>
<l>Downcaſt eye, and bluſhing cheek,</l>
<l>Timid air, and beauteous face,</l>
<l>Anville,—whom the Graces ſeek.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Though ev'ry beauty is her own,</l>
<l>And though her mind each virtue fills,</l>
<l>Anville,—to her power unknown,</l>
<l>Artleſs, ſtrikes,—unconſcious kills!</l>
</lg>
</q>
<p>
I am ſure, my dear Sir, you will not won
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
der that a panegyric ſuch as this, ſhould, in
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:1259700102:181"/>
reading, give me the greateſt confuſion; and, un
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
fortunately, before I had finiſhed it, the ladies re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
turned
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"What have you there, my dear?"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Selwyn.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Nothing, Ma'am,"</q>
ſaid I, haſtily ſolding, and putting it in my pocket.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"And has
<hi>nothing,</hi>
"
</q>
cried ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
"the power of
<hi>rouge?</hi>
"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I made no anſwer; a deep ſigh which eſcap
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed Lord Orville, at that moment, reached my ears, and gave me ſenſations—which I dare not mention!
</p>
<p>
Lord Merton then handed Lady Louiſa, and Mrs. Beaumont, to the latter's carriage. Mrs. Selwyn led the way to Sir Clement's, who handed me in after her.
</p>
<p>
During the ride, I did not once ſpeak; but when I came to the aſſembly-room, Sir Clement took care that I ſhould not preſerve my ſilence. He aſked me immediately to dance; I begged him to excuſe me, and ſeek ſome other partner. But on the contrary, he told me he was very glad I would ſit ſtill, as he had a million of things to ſay to me.
</p>
<p>
He then began to tell me how much he had ſuf
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
fered from abſence; how greatly he was alarmed when he heard I had left town, and how cruelly difficult he had found it to trace me; which, at laſt, he could only do by ſacrificing another week to Captain Mirvan.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"And Howard Grove,"</q>
ſtill continued he,
<q rend="inline">
"which, at my firſt viſit, I thought the moſt delightful ſpot upon earth, now appeared to be the moſt diſmal; the face of the country ſeemed al
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tered: the walks, which I had thought moſt pleaſant, were now moſt ſtupid: Lady Howard,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:1259700102:182"/>
who had appeared a chearful and reſpectable old lady, now ſeemed in the common John Trot ſtyle of other aged dames: Mrs. Mirvan, whom I had eſteemed as an amiable piece of ſtill-life, now became ſo inſipid, that I could hardly keep awake in her company: the daughter too, whom I had regarded as a good-humoured, pretty ſort of girl, now ſeemed too inſignificant for no
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tice: and as to the Captain, I had always thought him a booby,—but now, he appeared a ſa
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
vage!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Indeed, Sir Clement,"</q>
cried I, angrily,
<q rend="inline">
"I will not hear you talk thus of my beſt friends."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I beg your pardon,"</q>
ſaid he,
<q rend="inline">
"but the con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
traſt of my two viſits was too ſtriking, not to be mentioned."
</q>
</p>
<p>He then aſked me what I thought of the verſes?</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Either,"</q>
ſaid I,
<q rend="inline">
"that they are written iron
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ically, or by ſome madman."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Such a profuſion of compliments enſued, that I was obliged to propoſe dancing, in my own de
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
fence. When we ſtood up,
<q rend="inline">"I intended,"</q>
ſaid he,
<q rend="inline">
"to have diſcovered the author by his looks; but I find you ſo much the general load
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſtone of attention, that my ſuſpicions change their object every moment. Surely you muſt your
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſelf have ſome knowledge who he is?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I told him, No. But, my dear Sir, I muſt own to you, I have no doubt but that Mr. Macartney, muſt be the author; no one elſe would ſpeak of me ſo partially; and, indeed, his poetical turn puts it, with me, beyond diſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
pute.
</p>
<p>
He aſked me a thouſand queſtions concerning Lord Orville; how long he had been at Briſtol?
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:1259700102:183"/>
—what time I had ſpent at Clifton?—whether he rode out every morning?—whether I ever truſted myſelf in a phaeton?—and a multitude of other enquiries, all made with his uſual freedom and impetuoſity.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, as I much wiſhed to retire early, Lady Louiſa makes a point of being among the firſt who quit the rooms, and therefore we got home in very tolerable time.
</p>
<p>
Lord Orville's reception of us was grave and cold: far from diſtinguiſhing me, as uſual, by particular civilities, Lady Louiſa herſelf could not have ſeen me enter the room with more fri
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
gid unconcern, nor have more ſcrupulouſly a
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
voided honouring me with any notice. But, chiefly I was ſtruck to ſee, that he ſuffered Sir Clement, who ſtayed ſupper, to ſit between us, without any effort to prevent him, though, till then, he had ſeemed to be even tenacious of a ſeat next mine.
</p>
<p>
This little circumſtance affected me more than I can expreſs: yet I endeavoured to
<hi>
re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
joice
</hi>
at it, ſince neglect and indifference from him may be my beſt friends.—But, alas!—ſo ſuddenly, ſo abruptly to forfeit his attention!—to loſe his friendſhip!—Oh, Sir, theſe thoughts pierced my ſoul!—ſcarce could I keep my ſeat; for not all my efforts could reſtrain the tears from trickling down my cheeks: however, as Lord Orville ſaw them not, (for Sir Clement's head was conſtantly between us,) I tried to col
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
lect my ſpirits, and ſucceeded ſo far as to keep my ſeat with decency, till Sir Clement took leave: and then, not daring to truſt my eyes to meet thoſe of Lord Orville, I retired.
</p>
<p>
I have been writing ever ſince; for, certain that I could not ſleep, I would not go to bed.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:1259700102:184"/>
Tell me, my deareſt Sir, if you poſſibly can, tell me that you approve my change of con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
duct,—tell me that my altered behaviour to Lord Orville is right,—that my flying his ſoci
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ety, and avoiding his civilities, are actions which
<hi>you</hi>
would have dictated.—Tell me this, and the ſacrifices I have made will comfort me in the midſt of my regret,—for never, never can I ceaſe to regret that I have loſt the friendſhip of Lord Orville!—Oh, Sir, I have ſlighted,—have rejected,—have thrown it away!—No matter; it was an honour I merited not to pre
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſerve, and I now ſee,—that my mind was une
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
qual to ſuſtaining it without danger.
</p>
<p>
Yet, ſo ſtrong is the deſire you have implant
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed in me, to act with uprightneſs and propriety, that, however the weakneſs of my heart may diſtreſs and afflict me, it will never, I humbly truſt, render me wilfully culpable. The wiſh of doing well governs every other, as far as concerns my conduct,—for am I not
<hi>your</hi>
child?—the creature of your own forming?—Yet, oh Sir, friend, parent of my heart!—my feel
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ings are all at war with my duties; and, while I moſt ſtruggle to acquire ſelf-approbation, my peace, my hopes, my happineſs,—are loſt!
</p>
<p>
'Tis you alone can compoſe a mind ſo cruelly agitated; you, I well know, can feel pity for the weakneſs to which you are a ſtranger; and, though you blame the affliction, ſoothe and com

<head type="sub">Mr. Villars to Evelina.</head>
<opener>
<dateline>
Berry Hill,
<date>Oct. 3.</date>
</dateline>
</opener>
<p>
YOUR laſt communication, my deareſt child, is indeed aſtoniſhing; that an acknowledged daughter, and heireſs of Sir John Belmont ſhould be at Briſtol, and ſtill my Evelina bear the name of Anville, is to me inexplicable; yet the myſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tery of the letter to Lady Howard prepared me to expect ſomething extraordinary upon Sir John Belmont's return to England.
</p>
<p>
Whoever this young lady may be, it is cer
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tain ſhe now takes a place to which you have a right indiſputable. An
<hi>after-marriage</hi>
I never heard of; yet, ſuppoſing ſuch a one to have hap
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
pened, Miſs Evelyn was certainly the firſt wife, and therefore her daughter muſt, at leaſt, be en
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
titled to the name of Belmont.
</p>
<p>
Either there are circumſtances in this affair at preſent utterly incomprehenſible, or elſe ſome ſtrange and moſt atrocious fraud has been prac
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tiſed; which of theſe two is the caſe, it now be
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
hoves us to enquire.
</p>
<p>
My reluctance to this ſtep, gives way to my conviction of its propriety, ſince the reputation of your dear, and much-injured mother muſt now either be fully cleared from blemiſh, or receive its final and indelible wound.
</p>
<p>
The public appearance of a daughter of Sir John Belmont will revive the remembrance of Miſs Evelyn's ſtory to all who have heard it,—who the
<hi>mother</hi>
was, will be univerſally demanded,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:1259700102:186"/>
—and if any other Lady Belmont ſhall be named,—the birth of my Evelina will receive a ſtigma, againſt which, honour, truth, and in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nocence, may appeal in vain! a ſtigma which will eternally blaſt the fair fame of her vir
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tuous mother, and caſt upon her blameleſs ſelf, the odium of a title, which not all her purity can reſcue from eſtabliſhed ſhame and diſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
honour.
</p>
<p>
No, my dear child, no; I will not quietly ſuffer the aſhes of your mother to be treated with ignominy. Her ſpotleſs character ſhall be juſti
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
fied to the world,—her marriage ſhall be ac
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
knowledged, and her child ſhall bear the name to which ſhe is lawfully entitled.
</p>
<p>
It is true, that Mrs. Mirvan would conduct this affair with more delicacy than Mrs. Sel
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
wyn;—yet, perhaps, to ſave time, is of all conſiderations, the moſt important, ſince the longer this myſtery is ſuffered to continue, the more difficult my be rendered its expla
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nation. The ſooner, therefore, my dear, you can ſet out for town, the leſs formidable will be your taſk.
</p>
<p>
Let not your timidity, my dear love, depreſs your ſpirits: I ſhall, indeed, tremble for you, at a meeting ſo ſingular, and ſo affecting, yet there can be no doubt of the ſucceſs of your application:—I encloſe a letter from your un
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
happy mother, written, and reſerved purpoſe
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ly, for this occaſion: Mrs. Clinton, too, who attended her in her laſt illneſs, muſt accom
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
pany you to town.—But, without any other certificate of your birth, that which you carry in your countenance, as it could not be effected by artifice, ſo it cannot admit of the ſmalleſt doubt.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:1259700102:187"/>
And now, my Evelina, committed, at length, to the care of your real parent, receive the fer
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
vent prayers, wiſhes, and bleſſings, of him who ſo fondly adopted you!
</p>
<p>
May'ſt thou, oh child of my boſom! may'ſt thou, in this change of ſituation, experience no change of diſpoſition! but receive with humility, and ſupport with meekneſs, the elevation to which thou art riſing! May thy manners, language, and deportment, all evince that modeſt equanimi

</p>
<p>
Hopeleſs, and almoſt deſperate, twenty times have I flung away my pen;—but the feelings of a mother, a mother agonizing for the fate of her child, again animating my courage, as often I have reſumed it.

Perhaps when I am no more, when the meaſure of my woes is compleated, and the ſtill, ſilent, un

ſentment ſoftens into pity at the thought! what will become of thee, good Heaven, when with the eye of penitence, thou revieweſt thy paſt con

Should'ſt thou, in the features of this deſerted innocent, trace the reſemblance of the wretched Caroline,—ſhould its face bear the marks of its birth, and revive in thy memory the image of its mother, wilt thou not, Belmont, wilt thou not therefore renounce it?—Oh babe of my fondeſt affection! for whom already I experience all the tenderneſs of maternal pity!—look not like thy unfortunate mother,—left the parent whom the

<p>
THIS morning I ſaw from my window, that Lord Orville was walking in the garden; but I would not go down ſtairs till breakfaſt was ready: and then, he paid me his compliments almoſt as coldly as Lady Louiſa paid her's.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:1259700102:191"/>
I took my uſual place, and Mrs. Beaumont, Lady Louiſa, and Mrs. Selwyn, entered into their uſual converſation.—Not ſo your Evelina: diſre
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
garded, ſilent, and melancholy, ſhe ſat like a cy
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
pher, whom to nobody belonging, by nobody was noticed.
</p>
<p>
Ill brooking ſuch a ſituation, and unable to ſup
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
port the neglect of Lord Orville, the moment breakfaſt was over, I left the room; and was going up ſtairs, when, very unpleaſantly, I was ſtopped by Sir Clement Willoughby, who, flying into the hall, prevented my proceeding.
</p>
<p>
He enquired very particularly after my health, and entreated me to return into the parlour. Un
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
willingly I conſented, but thought any thing pre
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ferable to continuing alone with him; and he would neither leave me, nor ſuffer me to paſs on. Yet, in returning, I felt not a little aſhamed of appearing thus to take the viſit of Sir Cle

ment to myſelf. And, indeed, he took pains, by his manner of addreſſing me, to give it that air.

He ſtayed, I believe, two hours; nor would he, perhaps, even then have gone, had not Mrs. Beaumont broken up the party, by propoſing an airing in her coach. Lady Louiſa conſented to accompany her: but Mrs. Selwyn, when applied to, ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"If my Lord, or Sir Clement, will join us, I ſhall be happy to make one;—but really, a trio of females will be nervous to the laſt degree."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Sir Clement readily agreed to attend them; indeed, he makes it his evident ſtudy to court the favour of Mrs. Beaumont. Lord Orville excuſed himſelf from going out; and I retired to my own room. What he did with himſelf I know not, for I would not go down ſtairs till din
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ner
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:1259700102:192"/>
was ready: his coldneſs, though my own change of behaviour has occaſioned it, ſo cruelly depreſſes my ſpirits, that I know not how to ſup
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
port myſelf in his preſence.
</p>
<p>
At dinner, I found Sir Clement again of the party. Indeed he manages every thing his own way; for Mrs. Beaumont, though by no means eaſy to pleaſe, ſeems quite at his diſpoſal.
</p>
<p>
The dinner, the afternoon, and the evening, were to me the moſt irkſome imaginable: I was tormented by the aſſiduity of Sir Clement, who not only
<hi>took,</hi>
but
<hi>made</hi>
opportunities of ſpeaking to me,—and I was hurt,—oh how inexpreſſibly hurt!—that Lord Orville not only forbore, as hi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
therto,
<hi>ſeeking,</hi>
he even
<hi>neglected</hi>
all occaſions of talking with me!
</p>
<p>
I begin to think, my dear Sir, that the ſudden alteration in my behaviour was ill judged and im
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
proper; for, as I had received no offence, as the cauſe of the change was upon
<hi>my</hi>
account, not
<hi>his,</hi>
I ſhould not have aſſumed, ſo abruptly, a reſerve for which I dared aſſign no reaſon,—nor have ſhun
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ned his preſence ſo obviouſly, without conſidering the ſtrange appearance of ſuch a conduct.
</p>
<p>
Alas, my deareſt Sir, that my reflections ſhould always be too late to ſerve me! dearly, indeed, do I purchaſe experience! and much I fear I ſhall ſuffer yet more ſeverely, from the heedleſs indiſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cretion of my temper, ere I attain that prudence and conſideration, which, by foreſeeing diſtant conſequences, may rule and direct in preſent ex
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
igencies.

Yeſterday morning, every body rode out, ex
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cept Mrs. Selwyn and myſelf: and we two ſat for ſome time together in her room; but as ſoon as I
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:1259700102:193"/>
could, I quitted her, to ſaunter in the garden; for ſhe diverts herſelf ſo unmercifully with rally
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing me, either upon my gravity,—or concerning Lord Orville,—that I dread having any converſa
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tion with her.
</p>
<p>
Here I believe I ſpent an hour by myſelf; when, hearing the garden-gate open, I went into an arbour at the end of a long walk, where ruminating, very unpleaſantly, upon my future proſpects, I remained quietly ſeated but a few minutes, ere I was interrupted by the appearance of Sir Clement Willoughby.
</p>
<p>
I ſtarted; and would have left the arbour, but he prevented me. Indeed I am almoſt certain he had heard in the houſe where I was, as it is not, otherwiſe, probable he would have ſtrolled down the garden alone.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Stop, ſtop,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"lovelieſt and moſt beloved of women, ſtop and hear me!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Then, making me keep my place, he ſat down by me, and would have taken my hand; but I drew it back, and ſaid I could not ſtay.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Can you, then,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"refuſe me even the ſmalleſt gratification, though, but yeſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
terday, I almoſt ſuffered martyrdom for the plea

ſure of ſeeing you?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Martyrdom! Sir Clement."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Yes, beauteous Inſenſible!

</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Upon my word, the Ladies are extremely obliged to you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O,"</q>
returned he,
<q rend="inline">
they have, every one of them, ſo copious a ſhare of their own perſonal eſteem, that they have no right to repine at the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:1259700102:194"/>

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"How little,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">
"are thoſe Ladies aware of ſuch ſeverity from
<hi>you!</hi>
"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"They are guarded,"</q>
anſwered he,

—is there a human being, except your cruel ſelf, could forbear to pity me?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I believe, Sir Clement, however hardly you may chooſe to judge of them, your ſituation, by the world in general would rather have been envi

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"The world in general,"</q>
anſwered he,
<q rend="inline">
"has the ſame opinion of them that I have myſelf: Mrs. Beaumont is every where laughed at, Lady Louiſa ridiculed, and Mrs Selwyn hated."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Good God, Sir Clement, what cruel ſtrength of words do you uſe!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"It is you, my angel, are to blame, ſince your perfections have rendered their faults ſo glaring. I proteſt to you, during our whole ride, I thought the carriage drawn by ſnails. The abſurd pride of Mrs. Beaumont, and the reſpect ſhe ex

acts, are at once inſufferable and ſtupifying; had I never before been in her company, I ſhould have concluded that this had been her firſt airing from the herald's-office,—and wiſhed her nothing worſe than that it might alſo be the laſt. I aſſure you, that but for gaining the freedom of her houſe, I would fly her as I would plague, peſtilence, and famine. Mrs. Selwyn, indeed, afforded ſome relief from this formality, but the un

<p>
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:1259700102:195"/>
<q rend="inline">
"O Sir Clement, do

object to that?"

</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Yes, my ſweet reproacher, in a
<hi>woman</hi>
I do; in a

I think it intolerable. She has wit, I acknowledge, and more underſtanding than half her ſex put together; but ſhe keeps alive a per
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
petual expectation of ſatire, that ſpreads a gene
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ral uneaſineſs among all who are in her preſence; and ſhe talks ſo much, that even the beſt things ſhe ſays, weary the attention. As to the little Louiſa, 'tis ſuch a pretty piece of languor, that 'tis almoſt cruel to ſpeak rationally about her,—elſe I ſhould ſay, ſhe is a mere compound of af
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
fectation, impertinence, and airs."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I am quite amazed,"</q>
ſaid I,
<q rend="inline">
"that, with ſuch opinions, you can behave to them all with ſo much attention and civility."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Civility! my angel,—why, I could worſhip, could adore them, only to procure myſelf a mo

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Sir Clement,"</q>
ſaid I,
<q rend="inline">
"you are greatly miſtaken if you ſuppoſe ſuch duplicity of charac

</p>
<p>
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:1259700102:196"/>
<q rend="inline">
"Oh Miſs Anville, your reproofs, your cold

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Suffer me, Sir,"</q>
ſaid I, very gravely,
<q rend="inline">
"to make uſe of this occaſion to put a final concluſion to ſuch expreſſions. I entreat you never again to addreſs me in a language ſo flighty, and ſo unwel

neſs; and I muſt frankly aſſure you, that if you do not deſire to baniſh me from wherever you are, you will adopt a very different ſtyle and conduct in future."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I then roſe, and was going, but he flung him
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſelf at my feet to prevent me, exclaiming, in a moſt paſſionate manner,
<q rend="inline">
"Good God! Miſs An

ference, you can tear from me even the remoteſt hope?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I know not, Sir, ſaid I,"</q>
endeavouring to diſengage myſelf from him,
<q rend="inline">
"what hope you mean, but I am ſure I never intended to give you any."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You diſtract me!"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"I cannot endure ſuch ſcorn;—I beſeech you to have ſome moderation in your cruelty, leſt you make me deſ

perate:—ſay, then, that you pity me,—O faireſt inexorable! lovelieſt tyrant!—ſay, tell me, at leaſt, that you pity me!
</q>
</p>
<p>
Juſt then, who ſhould come in ſight, as if in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tending to paſs by the arbour, but Lord Orville! Good Heaven, how did I ſtart! and he, the mo

ment
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:1259700102:197"/>
he ſaw me, turned pale, and was haſtily retir

<q rend="inline">
"Lord Orville!—Sir Clement releaſe me,—let go my hand!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Sir Clement, in ſome confuſion, ſuddenly roſe, but ſtill graſped my hand. Lord Orville, who had turned back, was again walking away; but, ſtill ſtruggling to diſengage myſelf, I called out,
<q rend="inline">
"Pray, pray, my Lord, don't go!—Sir Clement, I
<hi>inſiſt</hi>
upon your releaſing me!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Lord Orville then, haſtily approaching us, ſaid, with great ſpirit,
<q rend="inline">
"Sir Clement, you cannot wiſh to detain Miſs Anville by force!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Neither, my Lord,"</q>
cried Sir Clement, proudly,
<q rend="inline">
"do I requeſt the honour of your Lord
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſhip's interference."
</q>
</p>
<p>
However, he let go my hand, and I immedi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ately ran into the houſe.
</p>
<p>
I was now frightened to death, leſt Sir Cle
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ment's mortified pride ſhould provoke him to af

front Lord Orville: I therefore ran haſtily to Mrs. Selwyn, and entreated her, in a manner hardly to be underſtood, to walk towards the ar
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
bour. She aſked no queſtions, for ſhe is quick as lightening in taking a hint, but inſtantly haſtened into the garden.
</p>
<p>
Imagine, my dear Sir, how wretched I muſt be till I ſaw her return! ſcarce could I reſtrain myſelf from running back; however, I checked my impatience, and waited, though in agonies, till ſhe came.
</p>
<p>
And, now, my dear Sir, I have a converſation to write, the moſt intereſting to me that I ever heard. The comments and queſtions with which Mrs. Selwyn interrupted her account, I ſhall not mention; for they are ſuch as you may very eaſily ſuppoſe.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:1259700102:198"/>
Lord Orville and Sir Clement were both ſeated very quietly in the arbour; and Mrs. Selwyn, ſtanding ſtill, as ſoon as ſhe was within a few yards of them, heard Sir Clement ſay,
<q rend="inline">
"Your queſtion, my Lord, alarms me, and I can by no means anſwer it, unleſs you will allow me to pro

poſe another."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Undoubtedly, Sir."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"You aſk me, my Lord, what are my inten

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I have never, Sir, profeſſed
<hi>any.</hi>

</q>
</p>
<p>
Here they were both, for a few moments, ſi

<q rend="inline">
"To what, my Lord, muſt I, then, impute your deſire of knowing mine?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"To an unaffected intereſt in Miſs Anville's welfare."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Such an intereſt,"</q>
ſaid Sir Clement, drily,
<q rend="inline">
"is, indeed, very generous; but, except in a father,—a brother,—or a lover—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Sir Clement,</q>
interrupted his Lordſhip,

"I know your inferrence; and I acknowledge I have not the right of enquiry which any of thoſe three titles beſtow; and yet I confeſs the warmeſt wiſh

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Yes, if your Lordſhip will excuſe my re

peating, that I think it a rather extraordinary one."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"It may be ſo,"</q>
ſaid Lord Orville;
<q rend="inline">
"but this young lady ſeems to be peculiarly ſituated; ſhe is very young, very inexperienced, yet ap

pears to be left totally to her own direction. She does not, I believe, ſee the dangers to which ſhe

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I don't rightly underſtand your Lordſhip,—but I think you cannot mean to prejudice her a

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Her ſentiments of

ciouſneſs would be at an end: but I preſume not to aſk upon what terms—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Here he ſtopped; and Sir Clement ſaid,

"You know, my Lord, I am not given to deſpair; I am by no means ſuch a puppy as to tell you I am upon

however, perſeverance—"

<q rend="inline">
"Pardon me, then, Sir Clement, if I ſpeak to you with freedom. This young lady, though ſhe ſeems alone, and, in ſome meaſure, unpro

</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"As to that, my Lord, let Miſs Anville look to herſelf; ſhe has an excellent underſtanding, and needs no counſellor."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Her underſtanding is, indeed, excellent;—but ſhe is too young for ſuſpicion, and has an artleſſneſs of diſpoſition, that I never ſaw equalled."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q>
cried Sir Clement, warmly,
<q rend="inline">
"your praiſes make me doubt your diſintereſt

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"How ſo, Sir?"</q>
cried Lord Orville, with equal warmth.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You were pleaſed, my Lord,"</q>
anſwered Sir Clement,
<q rend="inline">
"upon our firſt converſation con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cerning this young lady, to ſpeak of her in terms by no means ſuited to your preſent encomiums; you ſaid, ſhe was a
<hi>poor, weak, ignorant girl;</hi>
and I had great reaſon to believe, you had a moſt contemptuous opinion of her."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"It is very true,"</q>
ſaid Lord Orville,
<q rend="inline">
"that "I did not, at our firſt acquaintance, do juſtice to the merit of Miſs Anville; but I knew not, then, how new ſhe was to the world; at preſent however, I am convinced, that whatever might ap
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
pear ſtrange in her behaviour, was ſimply the ef
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
fect of inexperience, timidity, and a retired edu
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cation; for I find her informed, ſenſible, and intelligent. She is not, indeed, like moſt modern young ladies, to be known in half an hour; her modeſt worth, and fearful excellence, require both time and encouragement to ſhew themſelves. She does not, beautiful as ſhe is, ſeize the ſoul by ſurprize, but, with more dangerous faſcination, ſhe ſteals it almoſt imperceptibly."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Enough, my Lord,"</q>
cried Sir Clement,
<q rend="inline">
"your ſolicitude for her welfare is now ſuffici

ently explained."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My friendſhip and eſteem,"</q>
returned Lord Orville,
<q rend="inline">
"I do not wiſh to diſguiſe; but, aſſure yourſelf, Sir Clement, I ſhould not have troubled
<hi>you</hi>
upon this ſubject, had Miſs Anville and I ever converſed but as friends. However, ſince you do not chuſe to avow your intentions, we muſt drop the ſubject."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:1259700102:201"/>
<q rend="inline">"My intentions,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"I will frankly own, are hardly known to myſelf. I think Miſs Anville the lovelieſt of her ſex, and were I a
<hi>marrying man,</hi>
ſhe, of all the women I have ſeen, I would fix upon for a wife: but, I believe, that not even the philoſophy of your Lordſhip, would recommend to me a connection of that ſort, with a girl of obſcure birth, whoſe only dowry is her beauty; and who is evidently in a ſtate of de

pendency."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Sir Clement,"</q>
cried Lord Orville, with ſome heat,
<q rend="inline">
"we will diſcuſs this point no further; we are both free agents, and muſt act for our

ſelves."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Here Mrs. Selwyn, fearing a ſurpriſe, and, finding my apprehenſions of danger were ground
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
leſs, retired haſtily into another walk, and ſoon after came to give me this account.
</p>
<p>
Good Heaven, what a man is this Sir Clement! ſo deſigning, though ſo eaſy; ſo deliberately art
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ful, though ſo flighty! Greatly, however, is he miſtaken, all confident as he ſeems, for the girl, obſcure, poor, dependent as ſhe is, far from wiſh
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing the honour of his alliance, would, not only
<hi>now,</hi>
but
<hi>always</hi>
have rejected it.
</p>
<p>
As to Lord Orville,—but I will not truſt my pen to mention him,—tell me, my dear Sir, what
<hi>you</hi>
think of him?—tell me if he is not the no
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
bleſt of men?—and if you can either wonder at, or blame my admiration?
</p>
<p>
The idea of being ſeen by either party, im
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
mediately after ſo ſingular a converſation, was both awkward and diſtreſſing to me; but I was obliged to appear at dinner. Sir Clement, I ſaw was abſent and uneaſy; he watched me, he watch
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed Lord Orville, and was evidently diſturbed in his mind. Whenever he ſpoke to me, I turned
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:1259700102:202"/>
from him with undiſguiſed diſdain, for I am too much irritated againſt him, to bear with his ill

meant aſſiduities any longer.
</p>
<p>
But, not once,—not a moment did I dare meet the eyes of Lord Orville! All conſciouſneſs my
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſelf, I dreaded his penetration, and directed mine every way—but towards his. The reſt of the day, I never quitted Mrs. Selwyn.

This morning, though I did not go down ſtairs early, I was the only perſon in the parlour when Lord Orville entered it. I felt no ſmall confuſion at ſeeing him alone, after having ſo long and ſucceſsfully avoided ſuch a meeting. As ſoon as the uſual compliments were over, I would have left the room, but he ſtopped me by ſaying,

Again he pauſed; but I ſaid nothing, ſo he went on.

<p>
<q rend="inline">
"You allowed me, Madam, a few days ſince, you allowed me to lay claim to your friendſhip,—to intereſt myſelf in your concerns,—to call you by the affectionate title of ſiſter,—and the ho

</q>
</p>
<p>
I was extremely diſconcerted at this grave, and but too juſt accuſation, and I am ſure I muſt look very ſimple;—but I made no anſwer.

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You are all ſweetneſs and condeſcenſion!"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"and I flatter myſelf, you will again allow me to claim thoſe titles, which I find my

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Indeed, my Lord,"</q>

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Certainly, my Lord."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Tell me, then,"</q>
—and pardon a queſtion moſt eſſentially important to me;—Had, or had not, Sir Clement Willoughby, any ſhare in cauſ

</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, my Lord,"</q>
anſwered I, with firmneſs,
<q rend="inline">"none in the world."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"A thouſand, thouſand thanks!"</q>
cried he:
<q rend="inline">
"you have relieved me from a weight of con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
jecture which I ſupported very painfully. But one thing more; is it, in any meaſure, to Sir Clement that I may attribute the alteration in your behaviour to myſelf, which, I could not but obſerve, began the very day of his arrival at the Hotwells?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"To Sir Clement, my Lord,"</q>
ſaid I,
<q rend="inline">
"at

tribute nothing. He is the laſt man in the world who would have any influence over my conduct."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"And will you, then, reſtore to me that ſhare of confidence and favour with which you honour
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

</q>
</p>
<p>
Juſt then, to my great relief,—for I knew not what to ſay,—Mrs. Beaumont opened the door,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:1259700102:205"/>
and, in a few minutes, we went to breakfaſt.
</p>
<p>
Lord Orville was all gaiety; never did I ſee him more lively or more agreeable. Very ſoon after, Sir Clement Willoughby called to pay his reſpects, he ſaid, to Mrs. Beaumont. I then came to my own roon, where, indulging my re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
flections, which now ſoothed, and now alarmed me, I remained very quietly, till I received your moſt kind letter.
</p>
<p>
Oh, Sir, how ſweet are the prayers you offer for your Evelina! how grateful to her are the bleſſings you pour upon her head!—You
<hi>commit me to my real parent.</hi>
—Ah, Guardian, Friend, Protector of my youth!—by whom my helpleſs infancy was cheriſhed, my mind formed, my ve
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ry life preſerved,—
<hi>you</hi>
are the parent my heart acknowledges, and to you do I vow eternal duty, gratitude, and affection.
</p>
<p>
I look forward to the approaching interview with more fear than hope; but important as is this ſubject, I am, juſt now, wholly engroſſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed with another, which I muſt haſten to com
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
municate.
</p>
<p>
I immediately acquainted Mrs. Selwyn with the purport of your letter. She was charmed to find your opinion agreed with her own, and ſettled that we ſhould go to town to-morrow morning. And a chaiſe i

actually ordered to be here by one o'clock.
</p>
<p>
She then deſired me to pack up my cloaths; and ſaid ſhe muſt go, herſelf, to
<hi>make ſpeeches,</hi>
and
<hi>tell lies</hi>
to Mrs. Beaumont.
</p>
<p>
When I went down ſtairs to dinner, Lord Or
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ville, who was ſtill in excellent ſpirits, reproached me for ſecluding myſelf ſo much from the com
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
pany. He ſat next me,—he
<hi>would</hi>
ſit next me,—at table; and he might, I am ſure, repeat what
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:1259700102:206"/>
heonce ſaid of me before,
<hi>
that he almoſt exhauſted himſelf in fruitleſs endeavours to entertain me;
</hi>
—for, indeed, I was not to be entertained: I was totally ſpiritleſs and dejected; the idea of the approaching meeting,—and oh Sir, the idea of the approaching parting,—gave a heavineſs to my heart, that I could neither conquer nor repreſs. I even regretted the half explanation that had paſſed, and wiſhed Lord Orville had ſupport
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed his own reſerve, and ſuffered me to ſupport mine.
</p>
<p>
However, when, during dinner, Mrs. Beau
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
mont ſpoke of our journey, my gravity was no longer ſingular; a cloud inſtantly overſpread the countenance of Lord Orville, and he became near
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ly as thoughtful and as ſilent as myſelf.
</p>
<p>
We all went together to the drawing-room. After a ſhort and unentertaining converſation, Mrs. Selwyn ſaid ſhe muſt prepare for her jour
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ney, and begged me to ſee for ſome books ſhe had left in the parlour.
</p>
<p>
And here, while I was looking for them, I was followed by Lord Orville. He ſhut the door after he came in, and approaching me with a look of great anxiety, ſaid,
<q rend="inline">"Is this true, Miſs Anville, are you going?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I believe ſo, my Lord,"</q>
ſaid I, ſtill looking for the books.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"So ſuddenly, ſo unexpectedly muſt I loſe you?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No great loſs, my Lord,"</q>
cried I, endea
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
vouring to ſpeak chearfully.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Is it poſſible,"</q>
ſaid he, gravely,
<q rend="inline">
"Miſs An
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ville can doubt my ſincerity?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I can't imagine,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">
"what Mrs. Sel
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
wyn has done with theſe books."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:1259700102:207"/>
<q rend="inline">"Would to Heaven,"</q>
continued he,
<q rend="inline">
"I might flatter myſelf you would allow me to prove it?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I muſt run up ſtairs,"</q>
cried I, greatly confuſed,
<q rend="inline">"and aſk what ſhe has done with them."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You are going, then,"</q>
cried he, taking my hand,
<q rend="inline">
"and you give me not the ſmalleſt hope of your return!—will you not, then, my too lovely friend!—will you not, at leaſt, teach me, with fortitude like your own, to ſupport your ab
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſence?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q>
cried I, endeavouring to diſen
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
gage my hand,
<q rend="inline">"pray let me go!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I will,"</q>
cried he, to my inexpreſſible con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
fuſion, dropping on one knee,
<q rend="inline">"if you wiſh to leave me!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Oh, my Lord,"</q>
exclaimed I,
<q rend="inline">
"riſe, I beſeech you, riſe!—ſuch a poſture to me!—ſurely your Lordſhip is not ſo cruel as to mock me!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Mock you!"</q>
repeated he earneſtly,
<q rend="inline">
"no, I revere you! I eſteem and I admire you above all human beings!—you are the friend to whom my ſoul is attached as to its better half! you are the moſt amiable, the moſt perfect of women! and you are dearer to me than language has the power of telling!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I attempt not to deſcribe my ſenſations at that moment; I ſcarce breathed; I doubted if I ex
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
iſted,—the blood forſook my cheeks, and my feet refuſed to ſuſtain me: Lord Orville, haſtily riſing, ſupported me to a chair, upon which I ſunk, almoſt lifeleſs.
</p>
<p>
For a few minutes, we neither of us ſpoke; and then, ſeeing me recover, Lord Orville, though in terms hardly articulate, entreated my pardon
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:1259700102:208"/>
for his abruptneſs. The moment my ſtrength re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
turned, I attempted to riſe, but he would not per
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
mit me.
</p>
<p>
I cannot write the ſcene that followed, though every word is engraven on my heart: but his proteſtations, his expreſſions, were too flattering for repetition: nor would he, in ſpite of my re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
peated efforts to leave him, ſuffer me to eſcape;—in ſhort, my dear Sir, I was not proof againſt his ſolicitations—and he drew from me the moſt ſacred ſecret of my heart!
</p>
<p>
I know not how long we were together, but Lord Orville was upon his knees, when the door was opened by Mrs. Selwyn! To tell you, Sir, the ſhame with which I was overwhelmed, would be impoſſible;—I ſnatched my hand from Lord Orville,—he, too, ſtarted and roſe, and Mrs. Selwyn, for ſome inſtants, ſtood facing us both in ſilence.
</p>
<p>
At laſt,
<q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q>
ſaid ſhe, ſarcaſtically,
<q rend="inline">
"have you been ſo good as to help Miſs Anville to look for my books?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Yes, Madam,"</q>
ſaid he, attempting to ral
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ly,
<q rend="inline">"and I hope we ſhall ſoon be able to find them."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Your Lordſhip is extremely kind,"</q>
ſaid ſhe, drily,
<q rend="inline">
"but I can by no means conſent to take up any more of your time."
</q>
Then looking on the window-ſeat, ſhe preſently found the books, and added,
<q rend="inline">
"Come, here are juſt three, and ſo, like the ſervants in the Drummer, this important affair may give employment to us all."
</q>
She then preſented one to Lord Orville, another to me, and taking a third herſelf, with a moſt provoking look, ſhe left the room.
</p>
<p>
I would inſtantly have followed her; but Lord Orville, who could not help laughing, begged me
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:1259700102:209"/>
to ſtay a minute, as he had many important mat
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ters to diſcuſs.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"No, indeed, my Lord, I cannot,—perhaps I have already ſtayed too long."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Does Miſs Anville ſo ſoon repent her good
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
neſs?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I ſcarce know what I do, my Lord,—I am quite bewildered!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"One hour's converſation,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"will I hope compoſe your ſpirits, and confirm my hap
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
pineſs. When, then, may I hope to ſee you alone?—ſhall you walk in the garden to-morrow before breakfaſt?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"No, no, my Lord; you muſt not, a ſe

cond time, reproach me with making an

ment.
</hi>
"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Do you, then,"</q>
ſaid he, laughing,
<q rend="inline">
"re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſerve that honour only for Mr. Macartney?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Mr. Macartney,"</q>
ſaid I,
<q rend="inline">
"is poor, and thinks himſelf obliged to me; otherwiſe—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Poverty,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"I will not plead; but if being
<hi>obliged</hi>
to you has any weight, who ſhall diſpute
<hi>my</hi>
title to an appointment?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"My Lord, I can ſtay no longer,—Mrs. Sel
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
wyn will loſe all patience."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Deprive her not of the pleaſure of her
<hi>
con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
jectures;
</hi>
—but, tell me, are you under Mrs. Sel
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
wyn's care?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Only for the preſent, my Lord."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Not a few are the queſtions I have to aſk Miſs Anville: among them, the moſt important is, whether ſhe depends wholly on herſelf, or whether there is any other perſon for whoſe inte
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
reſt I muſt ſolicit?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I hardly know, my Lord, I hardly know my
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſelf to whom I moſt belong!
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:1259700102:210"/>
<q rend="inline">"Suffer, ſuffer me then,"</q>
cried he, with warmth,
<q rend="inline">
"to haſten the time when that ſhall no longer admit a doubt!—when your grateful Orville may call you all his own!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
At length, but with difficulty, I broke from him. I went, however, to my own room, for I was too much agitated to follow Mrs. Selwyn. Good God, my dear Sir, what a ſcene! ſurely the meeting for which I ſhall prepare to-morrow, cannot ſo greatly affect me! To be loved by Lord Orville,—to be the honoured choice of his noble heart,—my happineſs ſeemed too infinite to be borne, and I wept, even bitterly I wept, from the exceſs of joy which over-powered me.
</p>
<p>
In this ſtate of almoſt painful felicity, I conti
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nued, till I was ſummoned to tea. When I re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
entered the drawing-room, I rejoiced much to find it full of company, as the confuſion with which I met Lord Orville was rendered the leſs obſerv
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
able.
</p>
<p>
Immediately after tea, moſt of the company played at cards, and then,—and till ſupper
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
time, Lord Orville devoted himſelf wholly to me.
</p>
<p>
He ſaw that my eyes were red, and would not let me reſt till he had made me confeſs the cauſe; and when, though moſt reluctantly, I had acknowledged my weakneſs, I could with difficul
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ty refrain from weeping again at the gratitude he expreſſed.
</p>
<p>
He earneſtly deſired to know if my journey could not be poſtponed; and when I ſaid no, en
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
treated permiſſion to attend me to town.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Oh, my Lord,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">
"what a re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
queſt!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"The ſooner,"</q>
anſwered he,
<q rend="inline">
"I make my devotion to you public, the ſooner I may expect,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:1259700102:211"/>
from your delicacy, you will convince the world you encourage no mere
<hi>danglers.</hi>
"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"You teach me, then, my Lord, the inference I might expect, if I complied."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"And can you wonder I ſhould ſeek to haſten

<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

</q>
</p>
<p>
To this I was ſilent, and he re-urged his re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
queſt.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q>
ſaid I,
<q rend="inline">
"you aſk what I have no power to grant. This journey will deprive me of all right to act for myſelf."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"What does Miſs Anville mean?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I cannot now explain myſelf; indeed, if I could, the taſk would be both painful and te

dious."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O Miſs Anville,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"when may I hope to date the period of this myſtery? when flatter myſelf that my promiſed friend will indeed honour me with her confidence?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">
"I mean not to affect any myſtery,—but my affairs are ſo circum
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſtanced, that a long and moſt unhappy ſtory, can alone explain them. However, if a ſhort ſuſpence will give your Lordſhip any uneaſi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
neſs,—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My beloved Miſs Anville,"</q>
cried he eagerly,
<q rend="inline">
"pardon my impatience!—You ſhall tell me no
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
thing you would wiſh to conceal,—I will wait your own time for information, and truſt to your good
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
neſs for its ſpeed."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"There is
<hi>nothing,</hi>
my Lord, I wiſh to conceal;—to
<hi>poſtpone</hi>
an explanation is all I deſire."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:1259700102:212"/>
He then requeſted, that, ſince I would not al
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
low him to accompany me to town, I would permit him to write to me, and promiſe to anſwer his letters.
</p>
<p>
A ſudden recollection of the two letters which had already paſſed between us, occurring to me, I haſtily anſwered,
<q rend="inline">"No, indeed, my Lord!—"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I am extremely ſorry,"</q>
ſaid he, gravely,
<q rend="inline">
"that you think me too preſumptuous. I muſt own I had flattered myſelf that to ſoften the in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
quietude of an abſence which ſeems attended by ſo many inexplicable circumſtances, would not have been to incur your diſpleaſure."
</q>
</p>
<p>
This ſeriouſneſs hurt me; and I could not forbear ſaying,
<q rend="inline">
"Can you indeed deſire, my Lord, that I ſhould, a ſecond time, expoſe myſelf, by an unguarded readineſs to write to you?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"A
<hi>ſecond time! unguarded readineſs!</hi>
"
</q>
re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
peated he;
<q rend="inline">"you amaze me!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Has your Lordſhip then quite forgot the fool
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
iſh letter I was ſo imprudent as to ſend you when in town?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I have not the leaſt idea,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">"of what you mean."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why then, my Lord,"</q>
ſaid I,
<q rend="inline">"we had better let the ſubject drop."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Impoſſible!"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"I cannot reſt with
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
out an explanation!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
And then, he obliged me to ſpeak very openly of both the letters; but, my dear Sir, imagine my ſurpriſe, when he aſſured me, in the moſt ſo
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
lemn manner, that far from having ever written me a ſingle line, he had never received, ſeen, or heard of my letter!
</p>
<p>
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:1259700102:213"/>
This ſubject, which cauſed mutual aſtoniſh
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ment and perplexity to us both, entirely engroſſed us for the reſt of the evening; and he made me promiſe to ſhew him the letter I had received in his name to-morrow morning, that he might en
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
deavour to diſcover the author.
</p>
<p>
After ſupper, the converſation became gene
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ral.
</p>
<p>
And now, my deareſt Sir, may I not call for your congratulations upon the events of this day? a day never to be recollected by me but with the moſt grateful joy! I know how much you are in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
clined to think well of Lord Orville, I cannot, therefore, apprehend that my frankneſs to him will diſpleaſe you. Perhaps the time is not very diſtant when your Evelina's choice may receive the ſanction of her beſt friend's judgment and approbation,—which ſeems now all ſhe has to wiſh!
</p>
<p>
In regard to the change in my ſituation which muſt firſt take place, ſurely I cannot be blamed for what has paſſed! the partiality of Lord Or

</p>
<p>
This morning, during breakfaſt, Lord Orville took an opportunity to beg me, in a low voice, to allow him a moment's converſation before I left Clifton;
<q rend="inline">"May I hope,"</q>
added he,
<q rend="inline">
"that you will ſtroll into the garden after breakfaſt?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I made no anſwer, but I believe my looks gave no denial; for, indeed, I much wiſhed to be ſa

tisfied concerning the letter. The moment, there

fore, that I could quit the parlour I ran up ſtairs for my calaſh; but before I reached my room, Mrs. Selwyn called after me,
<q rend="inline">
"If you are go
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing to walk, Miſs Anville, be ſo good as to bid Jenny bring down my hat, and I'll accompany you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Very much diſconcerted, I turned into the draw
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing-room, without making any anſwer, and there I hoped to wait unſeen, till ſhe had otherwiſe diſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
poſed of herſelf. But, in a few minutes, the door opened, and Sir Clement Willoughby en
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tered.
</p>
<p>
Starting at the ſight of him, in riſing haſtily, I let drop the letter which I had brought for Lord Orville's inſpection, and, before I could recover it, Sir Clement, ſpringing forward, had it in his hand. He was juſt preſenting it to me, and, at the ſame time, enquiring after my health, when the ſignature caught his eye, and he read aloud
<q rend="inline">"Orville."</q>
</p>
<p>
I endeavoured, eagerly, to ſnatch it from him, but he would not permit me, and, holding it faſt, in a paſſionate manner exclaimed,
<q rend="inline">
"Good God, Miſs Anville, is it poſſible you can value ſuch a letter as this?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
The queſtion ſurpriſed and confounded me, and I was too much aſhamed to anſwer him; but
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:1259700102:215"/>
finding he made an attempt to ſecure it, I pre
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
vented him, and vehemently demanded him to re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
turn it.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Tell me firſt,"</q>
ſaid he, holding it above my reach,
<q rend="inline">
"tell me if you have, ſince, received any more letters from the ſame perſon?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, indeed,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">"never!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"And will you, alſo, ſweeteſt of women, promiſe that you never
<hi>will</hi>
receive any more? Say that, and you will make me the happieſt of men."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Sir Clement,"</q>
cried I, greatly confuſed,
<q rend="inline">"pray give me the letter."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"And will you not firſt ſatisfy my doubts?—will you not relieve me from the torture of the moſt diſtracting ſuſpence?—tell me but that the deteſted Orville has written to you no more!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Sir Clement,"</q>
cried I, angrily,
<q rend="inline">
"you have no right to make any conditions,—ſo pray give me the letter directly."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why ſuch ſolicitude about this hateful let
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ter? can it poſſibly deſerve your eagerneſs? tell me, with truth, with ſincerity tell me; Does it really merit the leaſt anxiety?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No matter, Sir,"</q>
cried I, in great perplex
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ity,
<q rend="inline">"the letter is mine, and therefore—"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I muſt conclude, then,"</q>
ſaid he,
<q rend="inline">
"that the letter deſerves your utmoſt contempt,—but that the name of Orville is ſufficient to make you prize it."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Sir Clement,"</q>
cried I, colouring,
<q rend="inline">
"you are quite—you are very much—the letter is not—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O Miſs Anville,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"you bluſh!—you ſtammer!—Great Heaven! it is then all as I feared!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:1259700102:216"/>
<q rend="inline">"I know not,"</q>
cried I, half frightened,
<q rend="inline">
"what you mean; but I beſeech you to give me the letter, and to compoſe yourſelf."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"The letter,"</q>
cried he, gnaſhing his teeth,
<q rend="inline">
"you ſhall never ſee more. You ought to have burnt it the moment you had read it!"
</q>
And, in an inſtant, he tore it into a thouſand pieces.
</p>
<p>
Alarmed at a fury ſo indecently outrageous, I would have run out of the room; but he caught hold of my gown, and cried,
<q rend="inline">
"Not yet, not yet muſt you go! I am but half-mad yet, and you muſt ſtay to finiſh your work. Tell me, there
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
fore, does Orville know your fatal partiality?—Say
<hi>yes,</hi>
"
</q>
added he, trembling with paſſion,
<q rend="inline">"and I will fly you for ever!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"For Heaven's ſake, Sir Clement,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">
"releaſe me!—if you do not, you will force me to call for help."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Call then,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"inexorable and moſt unfeeling girl; call, if you pleaſe, and bid all the world witneſs your triumph!—but could ten worlds obey your call, I would not part from you till you had anſwered me. Tell me, then, does Orville know you love him?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
At any other time, an enquiry ſo groſs would have given me inexpreſſible confuſion; but now, the wildneſs of his manner terrified me, and I only ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"Whatever you wiſh to know, Sir Clement, I will tell you another time; but for the preſent, I entreat you to let me go!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Enough,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"I underſtand you!—the art of Orville has prevailed;—cold, inani
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
mate, phlegmatic as he is, you have rendered him the moſt envied of men!—One thing more, and I have done:—Will he marry you?
</q>
</p>
<p>
What a queſtion! my cheeks glowed with in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
dignation,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:1259700102:217"/>
and I felt too proud to make any an
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſwer.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I ſee, I ſee how it is,"</q>
cried he, after a ſhort pauſe,
<q rend="inline">"and I find I am undone for ever!"</q>
Then, letting looſe my gown, he put his hand to his forehead, and walked up and down the room in a haſty and agitated manner.
</p>
<p>
Though now at liberty to go, I had not the courage to leave him: for his evident diſtreſs ex
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cited all my compaſſion. And this was our ſitua
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tion, when Lady Louiſa, Mr. Coverley, and Mrs. Beaumont, entered the room.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Sir Clement Willoughby,"</q>
ſaid the latter,
<q rend="inline">"I beg pardon for making you wait ſo long, but—"</q>
</p>
<p>
She had not time for another word; Sir Cle
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ment, too much diſordered to know or care what he did, ſnatched up his hat, and bruſhing haſtily paſt her, flew down ſtairs, and out of the houſe.
</p>
<p>
And with him went my ſincereſt pity, though I earneſtly hope I ſhall ſee him no more. But what, my dear Sir, am I to conclude from his ſtrange ſpeeches concerning the letter? does it not ſeem as if he was himſelf the author of it? How elſe ſhould he be ſo well acquainted with the contempt it me
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
rits? Neither do I know another human being who could ſerve any intereſt by ſuch a deception. I remember too, that juſt as I had given my own letter to the maid, Sir Clement came into the ſhop; probably he prevailed upon her, by ſome bribery, to give it to him, and afterwards, by the ſame means, to deliver to me an anſwer of his own writing. Indeed I can in no other manner account for this affair. Oh, Sir Clement, were you not yourſelf unhappy, I know not how I could pardon an artifice that has cauſed me ſo much uneaſineſs!
</p>
<p>
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:1259700102:218"/>
His abrupt departure occaſioned a kind of gene
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ral conſternation.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Very extraordinary behaviour this!"</q>
cried Mrs. Beaumont.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Egad,"</q>
ſaid Mr. Coverley,
<q rend="inline">
"the Baronet has a mind to tip us a touch of the heroicks this morning!
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I declare,"</q>
cried Lady Louiſa,
<q rend="inline">
"I never ſaw any thing ſo monſtrous in my life! it's quite abominable,—I fancy the man's mad;—I'm ſure he has given me a ſhocking fright!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Soon after, Mrs. Selwyn came up ſtairs, with Lord Merton. The former, advancing haſtily to me, ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"Miſs Anville, have you an alma
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nack?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Me!—no, Ma'am."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Who has one, then?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Egad,"</q>
cried Mr. Coverley,
<q rend="inline">
"I never bought one in my life; it would make me quite melancholy to have ſuch a time-keeper in my pocket. I would as ſoon walk all day before an hour-glaſs."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You are in the right,"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Selwyn,
<q rend="inline">
"not to
<hi>watch time,</hi>
leſt you ſhould be betrayed, unawares, into reflecting how you employ it."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Egad, Ma'am,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"if Time thought no more of me, than I do of Time, I be
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
lieve I ſhould bid defiance, for one while to old
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
age and wrinkles;—for deuce take me if ever I think about it at all."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Pray, Mr. Coverley,"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Selwyn,
<q rend="inline">
"why do you think it neceſſary to tell me this ſo often?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Often!"</q>
repeated he,
<q rend="inline">
"Egad, Madam, I don't know, why I ſaid it now,—but I'm ſure I can't recollect that I ever owned as much before."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:1259700102:219"/>
<q rend="inline">"Owned it before!"</q>
cried ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
"why, my dear Sir, you own it all day long; for every word, every look, every action proclaims it."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I know not if he underſtood the full ſeverity of her ſatire, but he only turned off with a laugh: and ſhe then applied to Mr. Lovel, and aſked if
<hi>he</hi>
had an almanack?
</p>
<p>
Mr. Lovel, who always looks alarmed when ſhe addreſſes him, with ſome heſitation, anſwer
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed,
<q rend="inline">
"I aſſure you, Ma'am, I have no manner of antipathy to an almanack,—none in the leaſt, I aſſure you;—I dare ſay I have four or five."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Four or five!—pray may I aſk what uſe you make of ſo many?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Uſe!—really, Ma'am, as to that,—I don't make any particular uſe of them,—but one muſt have them, to tell one the day of the month;—I'm ſure, elſe, I ſhould never keep it in my head."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"And does your time paſs ſo ſmoothly un
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
marked, that, without an almanack, you could not diſtinguiſh one day from another?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Really, Ma'am,"</q>
cried he, colouring,
<q rend="inline">
"I don't ſee any thing ſo very particular in having a few almanacks; other people have them, I be
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
lieve, as well as me."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Don't be offended,"</q>
cried ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
"I have but made a little digreſſion. All I want to know, is the ſtate of the moon,—for if it is at the
<hi>full</hi>
I ſhall be ſaved a world of conjectures, and know at once to what cauſe to attribute the inconſiſten
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cies I have witneſſed this morning. In the firſt place, I heard Lord Orville excuſe himſelf from going out, becauſe he had buſineſs of importance to tranſact at home,—yet have I ſeen him ſaunter
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing alone in the garden this half-hour. Miſs An
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ville, on the other hand, I invited to walk out
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:1259700102:220"/>
with me; and, after ſeeking her every where round the houſe, I find her quietly ſeated in the drawing-room. And, but a few minutes ſince, Sir Clement Willoughby, with even more than his uſual politeneſs, told me he was come to ſpend the morning here,—when, juſt now, I met him flying down ſtairs, as if purſued by the Fu

ries; and, far from repeating his compliments, or making any excuſe, he did not even anſwer a queſtion I aſked him, but ruſhed paſt me, with the rapidity of a thief from a bailiff!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I proteſt,"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Beaumont,
<q rend="inline">
"I can't think what he meant; ſuch rudeneſs from a man of any family is quite incomprehenſible."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q>
cried Lady Louiſa to Lord Mer

ton,
<q rend="inline">
"do you know he did the ſame by
<hi>me?</hi>
—I was juſt going to aſk him what was the matter, but he ran paſt me ſo quick, that I declare he quite dazzled my eyes. You can't think, my Lord, how he frighted me; I dare ſay I look as pale—don't I look very pale, my Lord?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Your Ladyſhip,"</q>
ſaid Mr. Lovel,
<q rend="inline">
"ſo well becomes the lilies, that the roſes might bluſh to ſee themſelves ſo excelled."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Pray, Mr. Lovel,"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Selwyn,
<q rend="inline">
"if the roſes ſhould bluſh, how would you find it out?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Egad,"</q>
cried Mr. Coverley,
<q rend="inline">
"I ſuppoſe they muſt bluſh, as the ſaying is, like a blue dog,—for they are

already."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Prithee, Jack,"</q>
ſaid Lord Merton,
<q rend="inline">
"don't you pretend to talk about bluſhes, that never knew what they were in your life."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Selwyn,
<q rend="inline">
"if experi

</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:1259700102:221"/>
<q rend="inline">"O, pray, Ma'am,"</q>
anſwered he,
<q rend="inline">
"ſtick to Jack Coverley,—he's your only man; for my part, I confeſs I have a mortal averſion to argu

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O fie, my Lord,"</q>
cried Mrs. Selwyn,
<q rend="inline">
a ſe

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why, faith my Lord,"</q>
ſaid Mr. Lovel,
<q rend="inline">
"I think, in general, your Houſe is not much addicted to ſtudy; we of the lower Houſe have indubitably moſt application; and, if I did not ſpeak before a ſuperior power,"
</q>
(bowing low to Lord Merton)
<q rend="inline">
I ſhould preſume to add, we have likewiſe the moſt able ſpeakers."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Mr. Lovel,"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Selwyn,
<q rend="inline">
"you de

</q>
</p>
<p>
Lord Merton, turning upon his heel, aſked Lady Louiſa, if ſhe ſhould
<hi>take the air</hi>
before dinner?
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Really,"</q>
anſwered ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
"I don't know;—I'm afraid it's monſtrous hot; beſides,"
</q>
(put
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ting her hand to her forehead)
<q rend="inline">
"I a'n't half well; it's quite horrid to have ſuch weak nerves—the leaſt thing in the world diſcompoſes me: I declare, that man's oddneſs has given me ſuch a ſhock,—I don't know when I ſhall recover from it. But I'm a ſad weak creature,—don't you think I am, my Lord?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O, by no means,"</q>
anſwered he,
<q rend="inline">
"your Ladyſhip is merely delicate,—and devil take me if ever I had the leaſt paſſion for an amazon."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:1259700102:222"/>
<q rend="inline">
"I have the honour to be quite of your Lord

</q>
"ſaid Mr. Lovel, looking ma

<q rend="inline">
"for I have an inſu

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Faith, and ſo have I,"</q>
ſaid Mr. Coverley;
<q rend="inline">
"for egad I'd as ſoon ſee a woman chop wood, as hear her chop logic."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"So would every man in his ſenſes,"</q>
ſaid Lord Merton;
<q rend="inline">
"for a woman wants nothing to recommend her but beauty and good-nature; in every thing elſe ſhe is either impertinent or unna

tural. For my part, deuce take me if ever I wiſh to hear a word of ſenſe from a woman as long as live!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"It has always been agreed,"</q>
ſaid Mrs Sel

wyn, looking round her with the utmoſt con

tempt,
<q rend="inline">
"that no man ought to be connected with a woman whoſe underſtanding is ſuperior to his own. Now I very much fear, that to accommodate all this good company, according to ſuch a rule, would be utterly impracticable, unleſs we ſhould chuſe ſubjects from Swift's hoſpital of idiots."
</q>
</p>
<p>
How many enemies, my dear Sir, does this un
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
bounded ſeverity excite! Lord Merton, however, only whiſtled; Mr. Coverley ſang; and Mr. Lo
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
vel, after biting his lips ſome time, ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"'Pon honour, that lady—if ſhe was
<hi>not</hi>
a lady,—I ſhould be half tempted to obſerve,—that there is ſomething,—in ſuch ſeverity,—that is rather, I muſt ſay,—rather—
<hi>oddiſh.</hi>
"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Juſt then, a ſervant brought Lady Louiſa a note, upon a
<hi>waiter,</hi>
which is a ceremony always uſed to her Ladyſhip; and I took the opportunity of this interruption to the converſation, to ſteal out of the room.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:1259700102:223"/>
I went immediately to the parlour, which I found quite empty; for I did not dare walk in the garden after what Mrs. Selwyn had ſaid.
</p>
<p>
In a few minutes, a ſervant announced Mr. Macartney, ſaying, as he entered the room, that he would acquaint Lord Orville he was there.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Macartney rejoiced much at finding me alone. He told me he had taken the liberty to enquire for Lord Orville, by way of pretext for coming to the houſe.
</p>
<p>
I then very eagerly enquired if he had ſeen his father.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I have, Madam,"</q>
ſaid he;
<q rend="inline">
"and the ge
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nerous compaſſion you have ſhewn made me haſten to acquaint you, that upon reading my un

happy mother's letter, he did not heſitate to ac

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">Good God,"</q>
cried I, with no little emotion,
<q rend="inline">
"how ſimilar are our circumſtances! And did he receive you kindly?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I could not, Madam, expect that he would: the cruel tranſaction that obliged me to fly Paris, was too recent in his memory."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"And,—have you ſeen the young lady?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, Madam,"</q>
ſaid he mournfully,
<q rend="inline">"I was forbid her ſight."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Forbid her ſight!—and why?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Partly, perhaps, from prudence,—and part
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<q rend="inline">"You have, you have a ſiſter!"</q>
cried I, from an impulſe of pity which I could not repreſs,
<q rend="inline">
"a ſiſter who is moſt warmly intereſted in all your concerns, and who only wants opportunity to ma

nifeſt her friendſhip and regard."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Gracious Heaven!"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">"what does Miſs Anville mean?</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Anville,"</q>
ſaid I,
<q rend="inline">
"is not my real name; Sir John Belmont is my father,—he is your's,—and I am your ſiſter!—You ſee, therefore, the claim we mutually have to each other's regard; we are not merely bound by the ties of friend

</p>
<p>

"At the Hotwell, Madam; he arrived there yeſterday morning."

<p>
I would have proceeded with further queſtions, but the entrance of Lord Orville prevented me. The moment he ſaw us, he ſtarted, and would have retreated; but, drawing my hand from Mr. Macartney's I begged him to come in.
</p>
<p>
For a few moments we were all ſilent, and, I believe all in equal confuſion. Mr. Macartney, however, recollecting himſelf, ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"I hope your Lordſhip will forgive the liberty I have taken in making uſe of your name?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Lord Orville, rather coldly, bowed, but ſaid nothing.
</p>
<p>
Again we were all ſilent, and then Mr. Macart

</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I fancy,"</q>
ſaid Lord Orville, when he was gone,
<q rend="inline">"I have ſhortened Mr. Macartney's viſit?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, my Lord, not at all."</q>

<q rend="inline">
"I ſhould have ſeen Miſs Anville in the garden;—but I knew not ſhe was ſo much better engaged."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Before I could anſwer, a ſervant came to tell me the chaiſe was ready, and that Mrs. Selwyn was enquiring for me.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I will wait on her immediately,"</q>
cried I, and away I was running; but Lord Orville, ſtopping me, ſaid, with great emotion,
<q rend="inline">"Is it thus, Miſs Anville, you leave me?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">
"how can I help it?—perhaps, ſoon, ſome better opportunity may offer—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Good Heaven!"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"do you indeed take me for a Stoic? What better opportunity

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Mr. Macartney,"</q>
ſaid he, gravely,
<q rend="inline">
"ſeems to have great influence,—yet he is a very young counſellor."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Is it poſſible, my Lord, Mr. Macartney can give you the leaſt uneaſineſs?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My deareſt Miſs Anville,"</q>
ſaid he, taking my hand,
<q rend="inline">
"I ſee, and I adore the purity of your mind, ſuperior as it is to all little arts, and all ap

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q>

<q rend="inline">"Mr. Macartney is my brother!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Your brother! you amaze me!—What ſtrange myſtery, then, makes his relationſhip a ſecret?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Juſt then, Mrs. Selwyn opened the door.
<q rend="inline">"O, you are here!"</q>
cried ſhe;
<q rend="inline">
"Pray is my Lord ſo kind as to aſſiſt you in

</p>
<p>

ville, ſmiling,
<q rend="inline">
"if it were in my power to do the

</q>
</p>
<p>
I then acquainted her with Mr. Macartney's communication.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:1259700102:227"/>
She immediately ordered the chaiſe away, and then took me into her own room, to conſider what ſhould be done.
</p>
<p>
A few minutes ſufficed to determine her, and ſhe wrote the following note.
</p>
<floatingText type="letter">
<body>
<head>To Sir John Belmont, Bart.</head>
<p>
MRS. Selwyn preſents her compliments to Sir John Belmont, and, if he is at leiſure, will be glad to wait on him this morning, upon buſineſs of importance.
</p>
</body>
</floatingText>
<p>
She then ordered her man to enquire at the pump room for a direction, and went herſelf to Mrs. Beaumont to apologiſe for deferring her journey.
</p>
<p>
An anſwer was preſently returned, that he would be glad to ſee her.
</p>
<p>
She would have had me immediately accom
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
pany her to the Hotwells; but I entreated her to ſpare me the diſtreſs of ſo abrupt an introduction, and to pave the way for my reception. She con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſented rather reluctantly, and, attended only by her ſervant, walked to the Wells.
</p>
<p>
She was not abſent two hours, yet ſo miſerably did time ſeem to linger, that I thought a thouſand accidents had happened, and feared ſhe would ne
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ver return. I paſſed the whole time in my own room, for I was too much agitated even to con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
verſe with Lord Orville.
</p>
<p>
The inſtant that, from my window, I ſaw her returning, I flew down ſtairs, and met her in the garden.
</p>
<p>We both walked to the arbour.</p>
<p>
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:1259700102:228"/>
Her looks, in which diſappointment and anger were expreſſed, preſently announced to me the failure of her embaſſy. Finding that ſhe did not ſpeak, I aſked her, in a faultering voice, Whether or not I had a father?
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"You have
<hi>not,</hi>
my dear!"
</q>
ſaid ſhe, ab
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ruptly.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Very well, Madam,"</q>
ſaid I, with tolerable calmneſs,
<q rend="inline">
"let the chaiſe, then, be ordered again,—I will go to Berry Hill,—and there, I truſt, I ſhall ſtill find one!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
It was ſome time ere ſhe could give, or I could hear, the account of her viſit; and then ſhe related it in a haſty manner; yet I believe I can recollect every word.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I found Sir John alone. He received me with the utmoſt politeneſs. I did not keep him a moment in ſuſpence as to the purport of my viſit. But I had no ſooner made it known, than, with a ſupercilious ſmile, he ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"And have you, Madam, been prevailed upon to revive that ridi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
culous old ſtory?"
</q>
Ridiculous, I told him, was a term which he would find no one elſe do him the favour to make uſe of, in ſpeaking of the horri
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ble actions belonging to the
<hi>old ſtory</hi>
he made ſo light of;
<q rend="inline">"actions,"</q>
continued I,
<q rend="inline">
"which would dye ſtill deeper the black annals of Nero or Cali
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
gula."
</q>
He attempted in vain to rally, for I pur
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſued him with all the ſeverity in my power, and ceaſed not painting the enormity of his crime, till I ſtung him to the quick, and, in a voice of paſſion and impatience, he ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"No more, Madam,—this is not a ſubject upon which I need a monitor."
</q>
<q rend="inline">"Make, then,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">
"the only reparation in your power.—Your daughter is now at Clifton; ſend for her hither, and, in the face of the world, proclaim the legitimacy
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:1259700102:229"/>
of her birth, and clear the reputation of your injured wife."
</q>
<q rend="inline">"Madam,"</q>
ſaid he,
<q rend="inline">
"you are much miſtaken, if you ſuppoſe I waited for the honour of this viſit, before I did what little juſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tice now depends upon me, to the memory of that unfortunate woman: her daughter has been my care from her infancy; I have taken her into my houſe; ſhe bears my name, and ſhe will be my ſole heireſs."
</q>
For ſome time this aſſertion appeared ſo abſurd, that I only laughed at it; but at laſt, he aſſured me, I had myſelf been im
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
poſed upon, for that the very woman who at
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tended Lady Belmont in her laſt illneſs conveyed the child to him while he was in London, before ſhe was a year old.
<q rend="inline">"Unwilling,"</q>
he added,
<q rend="inline">
"at that time to confirm the rumour of my be
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing married, I ſent the woman with the child to France; as ſoon as ſhe was old enough, I put her into a convent, where ſhe has been properly edu
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cated; and now I have taken her home, I have acknowledged her for my lawful child, and paid, at length, to the memory of her unhappy mother, a tribute of fame which has made me wiſh to hide myſelf hereafter from all the world."
</q>
This whole ſtory ſounded ſo improbable, that I did not ſcruple to tell him I diſcredited every word. He then rung his bell, and enquiring if his hair
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
dreſſer was come, ſaid he was ſorry to leave me, but that, if I would favour him with my compa
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ny to-morrow, he would do himſelf the honour of introducing Miſs Belmont to
<hi>me,</hi>
inſtead of troubling me to introduce her to
<hi>him.</hi>
I roſe in great indignation, and, aſſuring him I would make his conduct as public as it was infamous, I left the houſe."
</q>
</p>
<p>
"Good Heaven, how ſtrange a recital! how incomprehenſible an affair! The Miſs Belmont,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:1259700102:230"/>
then, who is actually at Briſtol, paſſes for the daughter of my unhappy mother!—paſſes, in ſhort, for your Evelina! Who ſhe can be or what this tale can mean, I have not any idea.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Selwyn ſoon after left me to my own reflections. Indeed they were not very pleaſant. Quietly as I had borne her relation, the mo
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ment I was alone I felt moſt bitterly both the diſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
grace and the ſorrow of a rejection ſo cruelly in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
explicable.
</p>
<p>
I know not how long I might have continued in this ſituation, had I not been awakened from my melancholy reverie by the voice of Lord Or
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ville.
<q rend="inline">"May I come in,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">"or ſhall I interrupt you?"</q>
I was ſilent, and he ſeated himſelf next me.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I fear,"</q>
he continued,
<q rend="inline">
"Miſs Anville will think I perſecute her; yet ſo much as I have to ſay, and ſo much as I wiſh to hear, with ſo few opportunities for either, ſhe cannot wonder,—and I hope ſhe will not be offended,—that I ſeize with ſuch avidity every moment in my power to converſe with her. You are grave,"
</q>
added he, taking my hand;
<q rend="inline">
"I hope you do not regret the delay of your journey?—I hope the pleaſure it gives to
<hi>me,</hi>
will not be a ſubject of pain to
<hi>you?</hi>
—You are ſilent?—Something, I am ſure, has afflicted you:—Would to Heaven I were able to conſole you!—Would to Heaven I were worthy to participate in your ſorrows!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
My heart was too full to bear this kindneſs, and I could only anſwer by my tears.
<q rend="inline">
"Good Hea
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ven,"
</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"how you alarm me!—My love, my ſweet Miſs Anville, deny me no longer to be the ſharer of your griefs!—tell me, at leaſt, that you have not withdrawn your eſteem!—that you do not repent the goodneſs you have ſhewn
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:1259700102:231"/>
me!—that you ſtill think me the ſame grate
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ful Orville whoſe heart you have deigned to ac
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cept!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Oh, my Lord,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">"your generoſity overpowers me!"</q>
And I wept like an infant. For now that all my hopes of being acknowledged ſeemed finally cruſhed, I felt the nobleneſs of his diſintereſted attachment ſo forcibly, that I could ſcarce breathe under the weight of gratitude that oppreſſed me.
</p>
<p>
He ſeemed greatly ſhocked, and in terms the moſt flattering, the moſt reſpectfully tender, he at once ſoothed my diſtreſs, and urged me to tell him its cauſe.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q>
ſaid I, when I was able to ſpeak,
<q rend="inline">
"you little know what an outcaſt you have ho
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
noured with your choice!—a child of bounty,—an orphan from infancy,—dependent, even for ſubſiſtence dependent, upon the kindneſs of com
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
paſſion!—Rejected by my natural friends,—diſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
owned for ever by my neareſt relation,—Oh, my Lord, ſo circumſtanced, can I deſerve the diſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tinction with which you honour me? No, no; I feel the inequality too painfully;—you muſt leave me, my Lord, you muſt ſuffer me to return to obſcurity,—and there, in the boſom of my firſt, beſt,—my only friend,—I will pour forth all the grief of my heart!—while you, my Lord, muſt ſeek elſewhere—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I could not proceed; my whole ſoul recoiled againſt the charge I would have given, and my voice refuſed to utter it.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Never!"</q>
cried he, warmly;
<q rend="inline">
"my heart is your's, and I ſwear to you an attachment eter
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nal!—You prepare me, indeed, for a tale of hor
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ror, and I am almoſt breathleſs with expectation,—but ſo firm is my conviction, that, whatever
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:1259700102:232"/>
are your misfortunes, to have merited them is not of the number, that I feel myſelf more ſtrongly, more invincibly attached to you than ever!—Tell me but where I may find this noble friend, whoſe virtues you have already taught me to re

verence,—and I will fly to obtain his conſent and interceſſion,—that henceforward our fates may be indiſſolubly united,—and, then ſhall it be the ſole ſtudy of my life to endeavour to ſoften your paſt,—and guard you from future misfor
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tunes!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I had juſt raiſed my eyes, to anſwer this moſt generous of men, when the firſt object they met was Mrs. Selwyn!
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"So, my dear,"</q>
cried ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
"what, ſtill courting the rural ſhades!—I thought, ere now, you would have been ſatiated with this retired ſeat, and I have been ſeeking you all over the Houſe. But I now ſee the only way to meet with
<hi>you,</hi>
—is to enquire for
<hi>Lord Orville.</hi>
However, don't let me diſturb your meditations; you are poſſibly planning ſome paſtoral dialogue."
</q>
</p>
<p>And, with this provoking ſpeech, ſhe walked on.</p>
<p>
In the greateſt confuſion, I was quitting the ar
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
bour, when Lord Orville ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"permit
<hi>me</hi>
to follow Mrs. Selwyn;—it is time to put an end to all impertinent conjectures; will you allow me to ſpeak to her openly?
</q>
</p>
<p>I aſſented in ſilence; and he left me.</p>
<p>
I then went to my own room, where I conti
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nued till I was ſummoned to dinner; after which, Mrs. Selwyn invited me to her's.
</p>
<p>
The moment ſhe had ſhut the door,
<q rend="inline">"Your Ladyſhip,"</q>
ſaid ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
"will, I hope, be ſeat
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Ma'am!"</q>
cried I, ſtaring.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:1259700102:233"/>
<q rend="inline">
"O the ſweet innocent! ſo you don't know what I mean?—but, my dear, my ſole view is to accuſtom you a little to your dignity elect, leſt, when you are addreſſed by your title, you ſhould look another way, from an apprehenſion of liſtening to a diſcourſe not meant for you to hear."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Having, in this manner, diverted herſelf with my confuſion, till her raillery was almoſt exhauſt
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed, ſhe congratulated me, very ſeriouſly, upon the attachment of Lord Orville, and painted to me, in the ſtrongeſt terms, his diſintereſted deſire of being married to me immediately. She had told him, ſhe ſaid, my whole ſtory; and yet he was willing, nay eager, that our union ſhould take place of any further application to my fami
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ly.
<q rend="inline">"Now, my dear,"</q>
continued ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
"I adviſe you, by all means, to marry him directly; nothing can be more precarious than our ſucceſs with Sir John; and the young men of this age are not to be truſted with too much time for de
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
liberation, where their intereſts are concern
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Good God, Madam,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">
"do you think I would
<hi>hurry</hi>
Lord Orville?
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Well, do as you will;"</q>
ſaid ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
"luckily you have an excellent ſubject for Quixotiſm;—otherwiſe, this delay might prove your ruin: but Lord Orville is almoſt as romantic as if he had been born and bred at Berry Hill."
</q>
</p>
<p>
She then propoſed, as no better expedient ſeemed likely to be ſuggeſted, that I ſhould ac
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
company her at once, in her viſit to the Hot-wells to-morrow morning.
</p>
<p>
The very idea made me tremble; yet ſhe re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
preſented ſo ſtrongly the neceſſity of purſuing this unhappy affair with ſpirit, or giving it totally up,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:1259700102:234"/>
that, wanting her force of argument, I was al
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
moſt obliged to yield to her propoſal.
</p>
<p>
In the evening, we all walked in the garden: and Lord Orville, who never quitted my ſide, told me, he had been liſtening to a tale, which, though it had removed the perplexities that had ſo long tormented him, had penetrated him with ſorrow and compaſſion. I acquainted him with Mrs. Selwyn's plan for to-morrow, and confeſſed the extreme terror it gave me. He then, in a manner almoſt unanſwerable, beſought me to leave to him the conduct of the affair, by conſenting to be his before an interview took place.
</p>
<p>
I could not but acknowledge my ſenſe of his generouſity; but I told him I was wholly depen
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
dent upon you, and that I was certain your opi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nion would be the ſame as mine, which was, that it would be highly improper I ſhould diſpoſe of myſelf for ever, ſo very near the time which muſt finally decide by whoſe authority I ought to be guided. The ſubject of this dreaded meeting, with the thouſand conjectures and apprehenſions to which it gives birth, employed all our conver
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſation then, as it has all my thoughts ſince.
</p>
<p>
Heaven only knows how I ſhall ſupport myſelf, when the long-expected,—the wiſhed,—yet ter
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
rible moment arrives, that will proſtrate me at the feet of the neareſt, the moſt reverenced of all relations, whom my heart yearns to know, and longs to love!

<p>
I COULD not write yeſterday, ſo violent was the agitation of my mind,—but I will not, now, loſe a moment till I have haſtened to my beſt friend an account of the tranſactions of a day, I can never recollect without emotion.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Selwyn determined upon ſending no meſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſage,
<q rend="inline">"Leſt,"</q>
ſaid ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
"Sir John, fatigued with the very idea of my reproaches, ſhould en
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
deavour to avoid a meeting: all we have to do, is to take him by ſurprize. He cannot but ſee who you are, whether he will do you juſtice or not."
</q>
</p>
<p>
We went early, and in Mrs. Beaumont's chariot; into which, Lord Orville, uttering words of the kindeſt encouragement, handed us both.
</p>
<p>
My uneaſineſs, during the ride, was exceſſive, but, when we ſtopped at the door, I was almoſt ſenſeleſs with terror! the meeting at laſt, was not ſo dreadful as that moment! I believe I was car
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ried into the houſe; but I ſcarce recollect what was done with me: however, I know we remain
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed ſome time in the parlour, ere Mrs. Selwyn could ſend any meſſage up ſtairs.
</p>
<p>
When I was ſomewhat recovered, I entreat
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed her to let me return home, aſſuring her I felt myſelf quite unequal to ſupporting the in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
terview.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:1259700102:236"/>
<q rend="inline">"No,"</q>
ſaid ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
"you muſt ſtay now; your fears will but gain ſtrength by delay, and we muſt not have ſuch a ſhock as this repeated."
</q>
Then, turning to the ſervant, ſhe ſent up her name.
</p>
<p>
An anſwer was brought, that he was going out in great haſte, but would attend her immediate
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ly. I turned ſo ſick, that Mrs. Selwyn was ap
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
prehenſive I ſhould have fainted; and opening a door which led to an inner apartment, ſhe beg
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ged me to wait there till I was ſomewhat com
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
poſed, and till ſhe had prepared for my recep
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tion.
</p>
<p>
Glad of every moment's reprieve, I willingly agreed to the propoſal, and Mrs. Selwyn had but juſt time to ſhut me in, ere her preſence was ne
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ceſſary.
</p>
<p>
The voice of a
<hi>father,</hi>
—Oh dear and re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
vered name!—which then, for the firſt time, ſtruck my ears,—affected me in a manner I cannot deſcribe, though it was only employ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed to give orders to a ſervant as he came down ſtairs.
</p>
<p>
Then, entering the parlour, I heard him ſay,
<q rend="inline">
"I am ſorry, madam, I made you wait, but I have an engagement which now calls me away: however, if you have any commands for me, I ſhall be glad of the honour of your company ſome other time."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I am come, Sir,"</q>
anſwered Mrs. Selwyn,
<q rend="inline">"to introduce to you your daughter."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I am infinitely obliged to you,"</q>
anſwered he,

"I am much indebted to you, Madam, for this deſire of encreaſing my family, but you muſt excuſe me if decline taking advantage of it.

</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I am very unwilling, Madam,"</q>
anſwered he,
<q rend="inline">
"to enter into any diſcuſſion of this point; but you are determined to compel me to ſpeak. There lives not, at this time, the human being who ſhould talk to
<hi>me</hi>
of the regret due to the me

mory of that ill-fated woman; no one can feel it ſo ſeverely as myſelf: but let me, nevertheleſs, aſſure you I have already done all that remained in my power to prove the reſpect ſhe merited from me; her child I have educated, and owned for my lawful heireſs, if, Madam, you can ſug

geſt to me any other means by which I may more fully do her juſtice, and more clearly manifeſt her innocence, name them to me, and though they ſhould wound my character ſtill deeper, I will per

form them readily."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"All this ſounds vaſtly well,"</q>
returned Mrs. Selwyn,
<q rend="inline">
"but I muſt own it is rather too enig
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
matical
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:1259700102:238"/>
for
<hi>my</hi>
faculties of comprehenſion. You can, however, have no objection to ſeeing this young lady?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"None in the world."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Come forth, then, my dear,"</q>
cried ſhe, opening the door,
<q rend="inline">"come forth, and ſee your father!"</q>
Then, taking my trembling hand, ſhe led me forward. I would have withdrawn it, and retreated, but as he advanced inſtantly towards me, I found myſelf already before him.
</p>
<p>
What a moment for your Evelina!—an invo
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
luntary ſcream eſcaped me, and covering my face with my hands, I ſunk on the floor.
</p>
<p>
He had, however, ſeen me firſt; for in a voice ſcarce articulate he exclaimed,
<q rend="inline">"My God! does Caroline Evelyn ſtill live!"</q>
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Selwyn ſaid ſomething, but I could not liſten to her; and, in a few minutes, he added,
<q rend="inline">
"Lift up thy head,—if my ſight has not blaſted thee,—lift up thy head, thou image of my long
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
loſt Caroline!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Affected beyond meaſure, I half aroſe, and embraced his knees, while yet on my own.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Yes, yes,"</q>
cried he, looking earneſtly in my face,
<q rend="inline">
"I ſee, I ſee thou art her child! ſhe lives—ſhe breathes—ſhe is preſent to my view!—Oh God, that ſhe indeed lived!—Go, child, go,"
</q>
added he, wildly ſtarting, and puſhing me from him,
<q rend="inline">
"take her away, Madam,—I cannot bear to look at her!"
</q>
And then, breaking haſtily from me, he ruſhed out of the room.
</p>
<p>
Speechleſs, motionleſs myſelf, I attempted not to ſtop him: but Mrs. Selwyn, haſtening after him, caught hold of his arm.
<q rend="inline">"Leave me, Madam,"</q>
cried he, with quickneſs,
<q rend="inline">
"and take care of the poor child;—bid her not think me un
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
kind,—tell her I would at this moment plunge a
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:1259700102:239"/>
dagger in my heart to ſerve her,—but ſhe has ſet my brain on fire, and I can ſee her no more!"
</q>
Then, with violence almoſt frantic, he ran up ſtairs.
</p>
<p>
Oh Sir, had I not indeed cauſe to dread this in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
terview?—an interview ſo unſpeakably painful and afflicting to us both! Mrs. Selwyn would have immediately returned to Clifton; but I in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
treated her to wait ſome time, in the hope that my unhappy father, when his firſt emotion was over, would again bear me in his ſight. How
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ever, he ſoon after ſent his ſervant to enquire how I did, and to tell Mrs. Selwyn he was much indiſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
poſed, but would hope for the honour of ſeeing her to-morrow, at any time ſhe would pleaſe to appoint.
</p>
<p>
She fixed upon ten o'clock in the morning, and then, with a heavy heart, I got into the chariot. Thoſe afflicting words,
<hi>I can ſee her no more</hi>
were never a moment abſent from my mind.
</p>
<p>
Yet the ſight of Lord Orville, who handed us from the carriage, gave ſome relief to the ſadneſs of my thoughts. I could not, however, enter upon the painful ſubject, but begging Mrs. Sel
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
wyn to ſatisfy him, I went to my own room.
</p>
<p>
As ſoon as I communicated to the good Mrs. Clinton the preſent ſituation of my affairs, an idea occurred to her, which ſeemed to clear up all the myſtery of my having been ſo long diſowned.
</p>
<p>
The woman, ſhe ſays, who attended my ever
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
to-be-regretted mother in her laſt illneſs, and who nurſed me the firſt four months of my life, ſoon after being diſcharged from your houſe, left Berry Hill entirely with her baby, who was but ſix weeks older than myſelf. Mrs. Clinton remem
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
bers, that her quitting the place appeared, at the time, very extraordinary to the neighbours, but,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:1259700102:240"/>
as ſhe was never heard of afterwards, ſhe was, by degrees, quite forgotten.
</p>
<p>
The moment this was mentioned, it ſtruck Mrs. Selwyn, as well as Mrs. Clinton herſelf, that my father had been impoſed upon, and that the nurſe who ſaid ſhe had brought his child to him, had, in fact, carried her own.
</p>
<p>
The name by which I was known, the ſecrecy obſerved in regard to my family, and the retire
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ment in which I lived, all conſpired to render this ſcheme, however daring and fraudulent, by no means impracticable, and, in ſhort, the idea was no ſooner ſtarted, than conviction ſeemed to fol
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
low it.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Selwyn determined immediately to diſco
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ver the truth or miſtake of this conjecture; there
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
fore, the moment ſhe had dined, ſhe walked to the Hotwells, attended by Mrs. Clinton.
</p>
<p>
I waited in my room till her return, and then heard the following account of her viſit.
</p>
<p>
She found my poor father in great agitation. She immediately informed him of the occaſion of her ſo ſpeedy return, and of her ſuſpicions of the woman who had pretended to convey to him his child. Interrupting her with quickneſs, he ſaid he had juſt ſent her from his preſence: that the certainty I carried in my countenance, of my real birth, made him, the moment he had recovered from a ſurpriſe which had almoſt deprived him of reaſon, ſuſpect, himſelf, the impoſition ſhe men
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tioned. He had, therefore, ſent for the woman, and queſtioned her with the utmoſt auſterity: ſhe turned pale, and was extremely embarraſſed, but ſtill ſhe perſiſted in affirming, that ſhe had really brought him the daughter of Lady Belmont. His perplexity, he ſaid, almoſt diſtracted him; he had
<hi>always</hi>
obſerved that his daughter bore no re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſemblance
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:1259700102:241"/>
of either of her parents, but, as he had never doubted the veraci
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
<desc>•</desc>
</gap>
y of the nurſe, this cir
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cumſtance did not give birth to any ſuſpicion.
</p>
<p>
At Mrs. Selwyn's deſire, the woman was again called, and interrogated with equal art and ſeve
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
rity; her confuſion was evident, and her anſwers often contradictory, yet ſhe ſtill declared ſhe was no impoſtor.
<q rend="inline">"We will ſee that in a minute,"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Selwyn, and then deſired Mrs. Clinton might be called up ſtairs. The poor wretch, changing colour, would have eſcaped out of the room, but, being prevented, dropt on her knees, and implored forgiveneſs. A confeſſion of the whole affair was then extorted from her.
</p>
<p>
Doubtleſs, my dear Sir, you muſt remember
<hi>Dame Green,</hi>
who was my firſt nurſe? The de
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ceit ſhe has practiſed, was ſuggeſted, ſhe ſays, by a converſation ſhe overheard, in which my un
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
happy mother beſought you, that, if her child ſurvived her, you would take the ſole care of its education; and, in particular, if it ſhould be a female, you would by no means part with her early in life. You not only conſented, ſhe ſays, but aſſured her you would even retire abroad with me yourſelf, if my father ſhould importunately demand me. Her own child, ſhe ſaid, was then in her arms, and ſhe could not forbear wiſhing it were poſſible to give
<hi>her</hi>
the fortune which ſeemed ſo little valued for me. This wiſh once raiſed, was not eaſily ſuppreſſed; on the contrary, what at firſt appeared a mere idle deſire, in a ſhort time ſeemed a feaſible ſcheme. Her huſband was dead, and ſhe had little regard for any body but her child; and, in ſhort, having ſaved money for the journey, ſhe contrived to enquire a direction to my father, and, telling her neighbours ſhe was
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:1259700102:242"/>
going to ſettle in Devonſhire, ſhe ſet out on her expedition.
</p>
<p>
When Mrs. Selwyn aſked her, how ſhe dared to perpetrate ſuch a fraud, ſhe proteſted ſhe had no ill deſigns, but that, as
<hi>Miſs</hi>
would be never the worſe for it, ſhe thought it a pity
<hi>nobody</hi>
ſhould be the better.
</p>
<p>
Her ſucceſs we are already acquainted with. Indeed every thing ſeemed to contribute to wards it: my father had no correſpondent at Berry Hill, the child was inſtantly ſent to France, where be
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing brought up in as much retirement as myſelf, nothing but accident could diſcover the fraud.
</p>
<p>
And here, let me indulge myſelf in obſerving, and rejoicing to obſerve, that the total neglect I thought I met with, was not the effect of inſenſi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
bility or unkindneſs, but of impoſition and error; and that, at the very time we concluded I was unnaturally rejected, my deluded father meant to ſhew me moſt favour and protection.
</p>
<p>
He acknowledges that lady Howard's letter flung him into ſome perplexity; he immediately communicated it to Dame Green, who confeſſed it was the greateſt ſhock ſhe had ever received in her life; yet ſhe had the art and boldneſs to aſſert, that Lady Howard muſt herſelf have been deceiv
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed: and as ſhe had, from the beginning of her enterprize, declared ſhe had ſtolen away the child without your knowledge, ſhe concluded that ſome deceit was
<hi>then</hi>
intended him; and this thought occaſioned his abrupt anſwer.
</p>
<p>
Dame Green owned, that from the moment the journey to England was ſettled, ſhe gave herſelf up for loſt. All her hope was to have had her daughter married before it took place, for which reaſon ſhe had ſo much promoted Mr. Macart
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ney's addreſſes: for though ſuch a match was in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
adequate
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:1259700102:243"/>
to the pretenſions of
<hi>Miſs Belmont,</hi>
ſhe well knew it was far ſuperior to thoſe
<hi>her daughter</hi>
could form, after the diſcovery of her birth.
</p>
<p>
My firſt enquiry was, if this innocent daughter was yet acquainted with the affair? No, Mrs. Sel
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
wyn ſaid, nor was any plan ſettled how to divulge it to her. Poor unfortunate girl! how hard is her fate! ſhe is entitled to my kindeſt offices, and I ſhall always conſider her as my ſiſter.
</p>
<p>
I then aſked whether my father would again al
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
low me to ſee him?
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why, no, my dear, not yet,"</q>
anſwered ſhe;
<q rend="inline">
"he declares the ſight of you is too much for him: however, we are to ſettle every thing concerning you to-morrow, for this woman took up all our time to-day."
</q>
</p>
<p>
This morning, therefore, ſhe is again gone to the Hotwells. I am waiting in all impatience for her return; but as I know you will be anxious for the account this letter contains, I will not de
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
lay ſending it.

<p>
HOW agitated, my dear Sir, is the preſent life of your Evelina! every day ſeems important, and one event only a prelude to another.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Selwyn, upon her return this morning from the Hotwell, entering my room very abrupt
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ly,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:1259700102:244"/>
ſaid,
<q rend="inline">"O my dear, I have terrible news for you!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"For me, Ma'am!—Good God! what now?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Arm yourſelf,"</q>
cried ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
"with all your Berry Hill philoſophy;—con over every leſſon of fortitude or reſignation you ever learnt in your life,—for know,—you are next week to be married to Lord Orville!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Doubt, aſtoniſhment, and a kind of perturba
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tion I cannot deſcribe, made this abrupt commu
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nication alarm me extremely, and, almoſt breath
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
leſs, I could only exclaim,
<q rend="inline">
"Good God, Ma
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
dam, what do you tell me?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You may well be frightened, my dear,"</q>
ſaid ſhe, ironically,
<q rend="inline">
"for really there is ſomething mighty terrific, in becoming, at once, the wife of the man you adore,—and a Counteſs!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I entreated her to ſpare her raillery, and tell me her real meaning. She could not prevail with her
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſelf to grant the
<hi>firſt</hi>
requeſt, though ſhe readily complied with the ſecond.
</p>
<p>
My poor father, ſhe ſaid, was ſtill in the ut
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
moſt uneaſineſs. He entered upon his affairs with great openneſs, and told her he was equally di
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſturbed how to diſpoſe either of the daughter he had diſcovered, or the daughter he was now to give up: the former he dreaded to truſt himſelf with again beholding, and the latter he knew not how to ſhock with the intelligence of her diſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
grace. Mrs. Selwyn then acquainted him with my ſituation in regard to Lord Orville; this de
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
lighted him extremely, and, when he heard of his Lordſhip's eagerneſs, he ſaid he was himſelf of opinion, the ſooner the union took place the better: and, in return, he informed her of the af
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
fair of Mr. Macartney.
<q rend="inline">
"And, after a very long
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:1259700102:245"/>
converſation,
</q>
continued Mrs. Selwyn,
<q rend="inline">
"we agreed, that the moſt eligible ſcheme for all par
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ties, would be to have both the real and the ficti
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tious daughter married without delay. There
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
fore, if either of you have any inclination to pull caps for the title of Miſs Belmont, you muſt do it with all ſpeed, as next week will take from both of you all pretenſions to it."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Next week!"—dear Madam, what a ſtrange plan!—without my being conſulted—without ap
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
plying to Mr. Villars,—without even the concur
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
rence of Lord Orville!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"As to conſulting
<hi>you,</hi>
my dear, it was out of all queſtion, becauſe, you know, young ladies hearts and hands are always to be given with re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
luctance;—as to Mr. Villars, it is ſufficient we know him for your friend;—and as for Lord Or
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ville, he is a party concerned."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"A party concerned!—you amaze me!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why, yes; for as I found our conſultation likely to redound to his advantage, I perſuaded Sir John to ſend for him."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Send for him!—Good God!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Yes, and Sir John agreed. I told the ſer
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
vant, that if he could not hear of his Lordſhip in the houſe, he might be pretty certain of encoun
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tering him in the arbour.—Why do you colour, my dear?—Well, he was with us in a moment; I introduced him to Sir John, and we proceeded to buſineſs."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I am very, very ſorry for it!—Lord Orville muſt, himſelf, think this conduct ſtrangely preci
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
pitate."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"No, my dear, you are miſtaken, Lord Or
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ville has too much good ſenſe. Every thing was then diſcuſſed in a rational manner. You are to be married privately, tho' not ſecretly, and then
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:1259700102:246"/>
go to one of his Lordſhip's country ſeats: and poor little Miſs Green and your brother, who have no houſe of their own, muſt go to one of Sir John's."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"But why, my dear Madam, why all this haſte? why may we not be allowed a little longer ti me?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I could give you a thouſand reaſons,"</q>
an
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſwered ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
"but that I am tolerably certain
<hi>two</hi>
or
<hi>three</hi>
will be more than you can controvert, even with all the logic of genuine coquetry. In the firſt place, you doubtleſs wiſh to quit the houſe of Mrs. Beaumont,—to whoſe, then, can you with ſuch propriety remove, as to Lord Or
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ville's?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Surely, Madam,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">
"I am not more deſtitute now, than when I thought myſelf an orphan?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Your father, my dear,"</q>
anſwered ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
"is willing to ſave the little impoſtor as much of the mortification of her diſgrace as it is in his power: now if you immediately take her place, according to your right, as Miſs Belmont, why not all that either of you can do for her, will prevent her be
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing eternally ſtigmatized, as the bantling of Dame Green, waſh-woman and wet nurſe of Berry Hill, Dorſetſhire. Now ſuch a genealogy will not be very flattering, even to Mr. Macartney, who, all
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
diſmal as he is, you will find by no means wanting in pride and ſelf conſequence."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"For the univerſe,"</q>
interrupted I,
<q rend="inline">
"I would not be acceſſary to the degradation you mention; but, ſurely, Madam, I may return to Berry Hill."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"By no means,"</q>
ſaid ſhe;
<q rend="inline">
"for though com
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
paſſion may make us wiſh to ſave the poor girl the confuſion of an immediate and public fall, yet juſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tice demands you ſhould appear, henceforward,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:1259700102:247"/>
in no other light than that of Sir John Belmont's daughter. Beſides, between friends, I, who know the world, can ſee that half this prodigious delicacy for the little uſurper, is the mere reſult of ſelf-intereſt; for while
<hi>her</hi>
affairs are huſht up, Sir John's, you know, are kept from being brought further to light. Now the double marriage we have projected, obviates all rational objections. Sir John will give you, immediately, £ 30,000; all ſettlements, and ſo forth, will be made for you in the name of Evelina Belmont;—Mr. Ma
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cartney will, at the ſame time, take poor Polly Green,—and yet, at firſt, it will only be generally known, that
<hi>a daughter of</hi>
Sir
<hi>John Belmont</hi>
's is married."
</q>
</p>
<p>
In this manner, though ſhe did not convince me, yet the quickneſs of her arguments ſilenced and perplexed me. I enquired, however, if I might not be permitted to again ſee my father, or whether I muſt regard myſelf as baniſhed his pre
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſence for ever?
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My dear,"</q>
ſaid ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
"he does not know you; he concludes that you have been brought up to deteſt him, and therefore he is rather pre
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
pared to dread, than to love you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
This anſwer made me very unhappy; I wiſh
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed, moſt impatiently, to remove his prejudice, and endeavour, by dutiful aſſiduity, to engage his kindneſs, yet knew not how to propoſe ſeeing him, while conſcious he wiſhed to avoid me.
</p>
<p>
This evening, as ſoon as the company was en
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
gaged with cards, Lord Orville exerted his ut
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
moſt eloquence to reconcile me to this haſty plan; but how was I ſtartled, when he told me that next

</p>
<p>
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:1259700102:248"/>
<q rend="inline">"Next Tueſday!</q>
repeated I, quite out of breath,
<q rend="inline">"Oh my Lord!—"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My ſweet Evelina,"</q>
ſaid he,
<q rend="inline">
"the day which will make me the happieſt of mortals, would probably appear awful to you, were it to be deferred a twelvemonth: Mrs. Selwyn has, doubtleſs, acquainted you with the many motives which, independent of my eagerneſs, require it to be ſpeedy; ſuffer, therefore, its acceleration, and generouſly complete my felicity, by endea

vouring to ſuffer it without repugnance."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Indeed, my Lord, I would not wilfully raiſe objections, nor do I deſire to appear inſenſible of the honour of your good opinion;—but there is ſomething in this plan, ſo very haſty,—ſo unrea

ſonably precipitate,—beſides, I ſhall have no time to hear from Berry Hill,—and believe me, my Lord, I ſhould be for ever miſerable, were I, in an affair ſo important, to act without the ſanction of Mr. Villars' advice."
</q>
</p>
<p>
He offered to wait on you himſelf; but I told him I had rather write to you. And then he pro
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
poſed, that, inſtead of my immediately accom

panying him to Lincolnſhire, we ſhould, firſt, paſs a month at
<hi>my native Berry Hill.</hi>
</p>
<p>
This was, indeed, a grateful propoſal to me, and I liſtened to it with undiſguiſed pleaſure. And,—in ſhort, I was obliged to conſent to a com

promiſe, in merely deferring the day till Thurſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
day! He readily undertook to engage my father's concurrence in this little delay, and I beſought him, at the ſame time, to make uſe of his influ

preſent the deep concern I felt in being thus ba

<p>
He would then have ſpoken of

I aſſured him, I was almoſt ignorant even of the word.

<p>
YESTERDAY morning, as ſoon as breakfaſt was over, Lord Orville went to the Hotwells, to wait upon my father with my double petition.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Beaumont then, in general terms, propoſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed a walk in the garden. Mrs. Selwyn ſaid ſhe had letters to write, but Lady Louiſa aroſe to ac
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
company her.
</p>
<p>
I had ſome reaſon to imagine, from the notice with which her Ladyſhip had honoured me during breakfaſt, that her brother had acquainted her with my preſent ſituation: and her behaviour now confirmed my conjecture; for, when I would have gone up ſtairs, inſtead of ſuffering me, as
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:1259700102:250"/>
uſual, to paſs diſregarded, ſhe called after me, with an affected ſurpriſe,
<q rend="inline">"Miſs Anville, don't you walk with us?"</q>
</p>
<p>
There ſeemed ſomething ſo little-minded in this ſudden change of conduct, that, from an invo
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
luntary emotion of contempt, I thanked her, with a coldneſs like her own, and declined her offer. Yet, obſerving that ſhe bluſhed extremely at my refuſal, and recollecting ſhe was ſiſter to Lord Orville, my indignation ſubſided, and upon Mrs. Beaumont's repeating the invitation, I accepted it.
</p>
<p>
Our walk proved extremely dull; Mrs. Beau
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
mont, who never ſays much, was more ſilent than uſual; Lady Louiſa ſtrove in vain to lay aſide the reſtraint and diſtance ſhe has hitherto preſerv
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed; and as to me, I was too conſcious of the cir
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cumſtances to which I owed their attention, to feel either pride or pleaſure from receiving it.
</p>
<p>
Lord Orville was not long abſent; he joined us in the garden, with a look of gaiety and good-hu
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
mour that revived us all.
<q rend="inline">"You are juſt the party,"</q>
ſaid he,
<q rend="inline">"I wiſhed to ſee together. Will you, Madam,"</q>
taking my hand,
<q rend="inline">
"allow me the honour of introducing you, by your real name, to two of my neareſt relations? Mrs. Beaumont, give me leave to preſent to you the daughter of Sir John Belmont; a young lady who, I am ſure, muſt long ſince have engaged your eſteem and ad
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
miration, tho' you were a ſtranger to her birth."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Beaumont, graciouſly ſaluting me,
<q rend="inline">
"the young lady's rank in life,—your Lordſh p's recommendation,—or her own merit, would any one of them have been ſuffi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cient to have entitled her to my regard; and I hope ſhe has always met with that reſpect in my houſe which is ſo much her due; though, had I been
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:1259700102:251"/>
ſooner made acquainted with her family, I ſhould, doubtleſs, have the better known how to have ſecured it."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Miſs Belmont,"</q>
ſaid Lord. Orville,
<q rend="inline">
"can receive no luſtre from family, whatever ſhe may give to it. Louiſa, you will, I am ſure, be hap
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
py to make yourſelf an intereſt in the friendſhip of Miſs Belmont, whom I hope ſhortly,"
</q>
kiſſing my hand, and joining it with her Ladyſhip's,
<q rend="inline">
"to have the happineſs of preſenting to you by yet another name, and by the moſt endearing of all titles."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I believe it would be difficult to ſay whoſe cheeks were, at that moment, of the deepeſt dye, Lady Louiſa's or my own; for the conſcious pride with which ſhe has hitherto ſlighted me, gave to her an embarraſſment which equalled the confuſion that an introduction ſo unexpected gave to me. She ſaluted me, however, and, with a faint ſmile, ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"I ſhall eſteem myſelf very happy to profit by the honour of Miſs Belmont's acquaintance."
</q>
</p>
<p>
I only courtſied, and we walked on; but it was evident, from the little ſurpriſe they expreſſed, that they had been already informed of the ſtate of the affair.
</p>
<p>
We were, ſoon after, joined by more compa
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ny: and Lord Orville then, in a low voice, took an opportunity to tell me the ſucceſs of his viſit. In the firſt place, Thurſday was agreed to; and, in the ſecond, my father, he ſaid, was much con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cerned to hear of my uneaſineſs, ſent me his bleſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſing, and complied with my requeſt of ſeeing him, with the ſame readineſs he ſhould agree to any other I could make. Lord Orville, therefore, ſettled that I ſhould wait upon him in the evening,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:1259700102:252"/>
and, at his particular requeſt, unaccompanied by Mrs. Selwyn.
</p>
<p>
This kind meſſage, and the proſpect of ſo ſoon ſeeing him, gave me ſenſations of mixed pleaſure and pain, which wholly occupied my mind till the time of my going to the Hotwells.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Beaumont lent me her chariot, and Lord Orville abſolutely inſiſted upon attending me.
<q rend="inline">"If you go alone,"</q>
ſaid he,
<q rend="inline">
"Mrs. Selwyn will certainly be offended; but, if you allow me to conduct you, tho' ſhe may give the freer ſcope to her raillery, ſhe cannot poſſibly be affronted: and we had much better ſuffer her laughter, than provoke her ſatire."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Indeed, I muſt own I had no reaſon to regret being ſo accompanied; for his converſation ſup
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ported my ſpirits from drooping, and made the ride ſeem ſo ſhort, that we actually ſtopt at my father's door, ere I knew we had proceeded ten yards.
</p>
<p>
He handed me from the carriage, and conduct
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed me to the parlour, at the door of which I was met by Mr. Macartney.
<q rend="inline">
"Ah, my dear bro
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ther,"
</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">"how happy am I to ſee you here!"</q>
</p>
<p>
He bowed and thanked me. Lord Orville, then, holding out his hand, ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"Mr. Macart
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ney, I hope we ſhall be better acquainted; I pro
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
miſe myſelf much pleaſure from cultivating your friendſhip.
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Your Lordſhip does me but too much ho
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nour,"
</q>
anſwered Mr. Macartney.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"But where,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">
"is my ſiſter? for ſo I muſt already call, and always conſider her:—I am afraid ſhe avoids me;—you muſt endeavour, my dear brother, to prepoſſeſs her in my favour, and reconcile her to owning me."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:1259700102:253"/>
<q rend="inline">"Oh, Madam,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"you are all goodneſs and benevolence! but at preſent, I hope you will excuſe her, for I fear ſhe has hardly for
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
titude ſufficient to ſee you: in a ſhort time, per
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
haps—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"In a
<hi>very</hi>
ſhort time, then,"
</q>
ſaid Lord Or
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ville,
<q rend="inline">
"I hope you will yourſelf introduce her, and that we ſhall have the pleaſure of wiſhing you both joy: allow me, my Evelina, to ſay
<hi>we,</hi>
and permit me, in your name, as well as my own, to entreat that the firſt gueſts we ſhall have the hap
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
pineſs of receiving, may be Mr. and Mrs. Ma
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
Macartney."
</q>
</p>
<p>A ſervant then came to beg I would walk up ſtairs.</p>
<p>
I beſought Lord Orville to accompany me; but he feared the diſpleaſure of Sir John, who had deſired to ſee me alone. He led me, however, to the head of the ſtairs, and made the kindeſt ef
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
forts to give me courage; but indeed he did not ſucceed, for the interview appeared to me in all its terrors, and left me no feeling but apprehen
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſion.
</p>
<p>
The moment I reached the landing-place, the drawing-room door was opened, and my father, with a voice of kindneſs, called out,
<q rend="inline">"My child, is it you?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir,"</q>
cried I, ſpringing forward, and kneeling at his feet,
<q rend="inline">"it is your child, if you will own her!"</q>
</p>
<p>
He knelt by my ſide, and folding me in his arms,
<q rend="inline">"own thee!"</q>
repeated he,
<q rend="inline">
"yes, my poor girl, and Heaven knows with what bitter contrition!"
</q>
Then, raiſing both himſelf and me, he brought me into the drawing-room, ſhut the door, and took me to the window, where, look
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing at me with great earneſtneſs,
<q rend="inline">
"Poor unhap
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
py
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:1259700102:254"/>
Caroline!"
</q>
cried he, and, to my inexpreſſible concern, he burſt into tears. Need I tell you, my dear Sir, how mine flowed at the ſight?
</p>
<p>
I would again have embraced his knees; but, hurrying from me, he flung himſelf upon a ſo
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
pha, and leaning his face on his arms, ſeemed, for ſome time, abſorbed in bitterneſs of grief.
</p>
<p>
I ventured not to interrupt a ſorrow I ſo much reſpected, but waited in ſilence, and at a diſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tance, till he recovered from its violence. But then it ſeemed, in a moment, to give way to a kind of frantic fury; for, ſtarting ſuddenly, with a ſternneſs which at once ſurpriſed and frightened me,
<q rend="inline">"Child,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"haſt thou yet ſuffi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ciently humbled thy father?—if thou haſt, be contented with this proof of my weakneſs, and no longer force thyſelf into my preſence!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Thunderſtruck by a command ſo unexpected, I ſtood ſtill and ſpeechleſs, and doubted whether my own ears did not deceive me:
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Oh, go, go!"</q>
cried he, paſſionately,
<q rend="inline">
"in pity—in compaſſion,—if thou valueſt my ſenſes, leave me,—and for ever!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I will, I will!"</q>
cried I, greatly terrified; and I moved haſtily towards the door: yet ſtop
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ping when I reached it, and, almoſt involuntarily, dropping on my knees,
<q rend="inline">"Vouchſafe,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">
"oh, Sir, vouchſafe but once to bleſs your daugh
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ter, and her ſight ſhall never more offend you!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Alas,"</q>
cried he, in a ſoftened voice,
<q rend="inline">
"I am not worthy to bleſs thee!—I am not worthy to call thee daughter!—I am not worthy that the fair light of heaven ſhould viſit my eyes!—Oh God! that I could but call back the time ere thou waſt born,—or elſe bury its remembrance in eternal obli
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
vion!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:1259700102:255"/>
<q rend="inline">"Would to Heaven,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">
"that the ſight of me were leſs terrible to you! that, in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſtead of irritating, I could ſoothe your ſorrows!—Oh Sir, how thankfully would I then prove my duty, even at the hazard of my life!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Are you ſo kind?"</q>
cried he, gently;
<q rend="inline">
"come hither, child,—riſe, Evelina;—alas, it is for
<hi>me</hi>
to kneel, not you!—and I
<hi>would</hi>
kneel,—I would crawl upon the earth,—I would kiſs the duſt,—could I, by ſuch ſubmiſſion, obtain the forgive
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
neſs of the repreſentative of the moſt injured of women!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Oh, Sir,"</q>
exclaimed I,
<q rend="inline">
"that you could but read my heart!—that you could but ſee the fi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
lial tenderneſs and concern with which it over
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
flows! you would not then talk thus,—you would not then baniſh me your preſence, and exclude me from your affection!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Good God,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"is it then poſſible that you do not hate me?—Can the child of the wronged Caroline look at,—and not execrate me? Waſt thou not born to abhor, and bred to curſe me? did not thy mother bequeath thee her bleſſing, on condition that thou ſhouldſt deteſt and avoid me?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Oh no, no, no!"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">
"think not ſo unkindly of her, nor ſo hardly of me."
</q>
I then took from my pocket-book her laſt letter, and, preſſing it to my lips, with a trembling hand, and ſtill upon my knees, I held it out to him.
</p>
<p>
Haſtily ſnatching it from me,
<q rend="inline">
"Great Hea
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ven!"
</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
'tis her writing!—Whence comes this?—who gave it you?—why had I it not ſoon
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
er?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I made no anſwer; his vehemence intimidated me, and I ventured not to move from the ſuppli
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ant poſture in which I had put myſelf.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:1259700102:256"/>
He went from me to the window, where his eyes were for ſome time rivetted upon the directi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
on of the letter, though his hand ſhook ſo vio
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
lently he could hardly hold it. Then, bringing it to me,
<q rend="inline">"Open it,"</q>
—cried he,—
<q rend="inline">
"for I can
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
not!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I had, myſelf, hardly ſtrength to obey him; but, when I had, he took it back, and walked haſtily up and down the room, as if dreading to read it. At length, turning to me,
<q rend="inline">"Do you know,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">"its contents?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, Sir,</q>
anſwered I;
<q rend="inline">"it has never been unſealed."</q>
</p>
<p>
He then again went to the window, and began reading. Having haſtily run it over, he caſt up his eyes with a look of deſperation; the letter fell from his hand, and he exclaimed,
<q rend="inline">
"yes! thou art ſainted!—thou art bleſſed!—and I am curſed for ever!"
</q>
He continued ſome time fixed in this melancholy poſition; after which, caſting him
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſelf with violence upon the ground,
<q rend="inline">"Oh wretch,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"unworthy life and light, in what dungeon canſt thou hide thy head?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I could reſtrain myſelf no longer; I roſe and went to him; I did not dare to ſpeak, but with pity and concern unutterable, I wept and hung over him.
</p>
<p>
Soon after, ſtarting up, he again ſeized the letter, exclaiming,
<q rend="inline">
"Acknowledge thee, Caro
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
line!—yes, with my heart's beſt blood would I acknowledge thee!—Oh that thou couldſt witneſs the agony of my ſoul!—Ten thouſand daggers could not have wounded me like this letter!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Then, after again reading it,
<q rend="inline">"Evelina,"</q>
he cried,
<q rend="inline">
"ſhe charges me to receive thee;—wilt thou, in obedience to her will, own for thy fa
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ther the deſtroyer of thy mother?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:1259700102:257"/>
What a dreadful queſtion! I ſhuddered, but could not ſpeak.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"To clear her fame, and receive her child,"</q>
continued he, looking ſtedfaſtly at the letter,
<q rend="inline">
"are the conditions upon which ſhe leaves me her forgiveneſs: her fame, I have already clear
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed;—and oh how willingly would I take her child to my boſom,—fold her to my heart,—call upon her to mitigate my anguiſh, and pour the balm of comfort on my wounds, were I not conſcious I deſerve not to receive it, and that all my affliction is the reſult of my own guilt!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
It was in vain I attempted to ſpeak; hor
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ror and grief took from me all power of utte
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
rance.
</p>
<p>
He then read aloud from the letter,
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>Look not like thy unfortunate mother!</hi>
—Sweet ſoul, with what bitterneſs of ſpirit haſt thou written!—Come hither, Evelina: Gracious Heaven!"
</q>
looking earneſtly at me,
<q rend="inline">
"never was likeneſs more ſtriking!—the eye,—the face,—the form,—Oh my child, my child!"
</q>
Imagine, Sir,—for I can never deſcribe my feelings, when I ſaw him ſink upon his knees before me!
<q rend="inline">
"Oh dear re
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſemblance of thy murdered mother!—Oh all that remains of the moſt-injured of women! be
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
hold thy father at thy feet!—bending thus lowly to implore you would not hate him;—Oh then, thou repreſentative of my departed wife, ſpeak to me in her name, and ſay that the remorſe which tears my ſoul, tortures me not in vain!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Oh riſe, riſe, my beloved father,"</q>
cried I, attempting to aſſiſt him,
<q rend="inline">
"I cannot bear to ſee you thus;—reverſe not the law of na
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ture,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:1259700102:258"/>
riſe yourſelf, and bleſs your kneeling daughter!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"May Heaven bleſs thee, my child!—"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"for
<hi>I</hi>
dare not."
</q>
He then roſe, and embracing me moſt affectionately, added,
<q rend="inline">
"I ſee, I ſee that thou art all kindneſs, ſoftneſs, and tenderneſs; I need not have feared thee, thou art all the fondeſt father could wiſh, and I will try to frame my mind to leſs painful ſenſations at thy ſight. Perhaps the time may come when I may know the comfort of ſuch a daughter,—at preſent, I am only fit to be alone: dreadful as are my reflections, they ought merely to torment my
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſelf.—Adieu, my child;—be not angry,—I cannot ſtay with thee,—oh Evelina! thy countenance is a dagger to my heart!—juſt ſo, thy mother look
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed,—juſt ſo—"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Tears and ſighs ſeemed to choak him!—and waving his hand, he would have left me,—but, clinging to him,
<q rend="inline">"Oh, Sir,"</q>
cried I,
<q rend="inline">
"will you ſo ſoon abandon me?—am I again an orphan?—oh my dear, my long-loſt father, leave me not, I beſeech you! take pity on your child, and rob her not of the parent ſhe ſo fondly hoped would cheriſh her!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You know not what you aſk,"</q>
cried he;
<q rend="inline">
"the emotions which now rend my ſoul are more than my reaſon can endure: ſuffer me, then, to leave you,—impute it not to unkindneſs, but think of me as well as thou canſt.—Lord Orville has behaved nobly;—I believe he will make thee happy."
</q>
Then, again embracing me,
<q rend="inline">"God bleſs thee, my dear child,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"God bleſs thee, my Evelina!—endeavour to love,—at leaſt not to hate me,—and to make me an in
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tereſt in thy filial boſom by thinking of me as thy father."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:1259700102:259"/>
I could not ſpeak; I kiſſed his hands on my knees; and then, with yet more emotion, he again bleſſed me, and hurried out of the room,—leaving me almoſt drowned in tears.
</p>
<p>
Oh Sir, all goodneſs as you are, how much will you feel for your Evelina, during a ſcene of ſuch agitation! I pray Heaven to accept the tribute of his remorſe, and reſtore him to tranquility!
</p>
<p>
When I was ſufficiently compoſed to return to the parlour, I found Lord Orville waiting for me with the utmoſt anxiety;—and then, a new ſcene of emotion, though of a far different nature, awaited me; for I learnt, by Mr. Macartney, that this nobleſt of men had inſiſted the ſo-long-ſup

Oh Lord Orville!—it ſhall be the ſole ſtudy of my happy life, to expreſs, better than by words, the ſenſe I have of your exalted benevolence, and greatneſs of mind!

THIS morning, early, I received the follow
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing letter from Sir Clement Willoughby.
</p>
<floatingText type="letter">
<body>
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:1259700102:260"/>
<head>To Miſs Anville.</head>
<p>
I HAVE this moment received intelligence that preparations are actually making for your marriage with Lord Orville.
</p>
<p>
Imagine not that I write with the imbecile idea of rendering thoſe preparations abortive. No, I am not ſo mad. My ſole view is to explain the motive of my conduct in a particular inſtance, and to obviate the accuſation of treachery which may be laid to my charge.
</p>
<p>
My unguarded behaviour when I laſt ſaw you, has, probably, already acquainted you, that the letter I then ſaw you reading was written by my
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſelf. For your further ſatisfaction, let me have the honour of informing you, thatt the one you had deſigned for Lord Orville, had fallen into my hands.
</p>
<p>
However I may have been urged on by a paſſi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
on the moſt violent that ever warmed the heart of man, I can by no means calmly ſubmit to be ſtig
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
matiſed for an action ſeemingly ſo diſhonourable; and it is for this reaſon that I trouble you with my juſtification.
</p>
<p>
Lord Orville,—the happy Orville, whom you are ſo ready to bleſs,—had made me believe he loved you not,—nay, that he held you in con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tempt.
</p>
<p>
Such were my thoughts of his ſentiments of you, when I got poſſeſſion of the letter you meant to ſend him; I pretend not to vindicate either the means I uſed to obtain it, or the action of break
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing the ſeal;—but I was impelled by an impetuous
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:1259700102:261"/>
curioſity to diſcover the terms upon which you wrote to him.
</p>
<p>
The letter, however, was wholly unintelligible to me, and the peruſal of it only added to my perplexity.
</p>
<p>
A tame ſuſpence I was not born to endure, and I determined to clear my doubts at all hazards and events.
</p>
<p>I anſwered it, therefore, in Orville's name.</p>
<p>
The views which I am now going to acknow
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ledge, muſt, infallibly, incur your diſpleaſure,—yet I ſcorn all palliation.
</p>
<p>
Briefly, then,—I concealed your letter to pre
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
vent a diſcovery of your capacity,—and I wrote you an anſwer which I hoped would prevent your wiſhing for any other.
</p>
<p>
I am well aware of everything which can be ſaid upon this ſubject. Lord Orville will, poſſi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
bly, think himſelf ill uſed;—but I am extremely indifferent as to his opinion, nor do I now write by way of offering any apology to him, but merely to make known to yourſelf the reaſons by which I have been governed.
</p>
<p>
I intend to ſet off next week for the Continent. Should his Lordſhip have any commands for me in the mean time, I ſhall be glad to receive them. I ſay not this by way of defiance,—I ſhould bluſh to be ſuſpected of ſo doing through an indirect channel,—but ſimply that, if you ſhew him this letter, he may know I dare defend, as well as ex
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

conduct. The rudeneſs of his manner of writing to me ſprings from the ſame cauſe: the proof he has received of my indifference to him, has ſtung him to the ſoul, and he has neither the delicacy nor forbearance to diſguiſe his diſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
pleaſure.
</p>
<p>
I determined not to ſhew this letter to Lord Orville, and thought it moſt prudent to let Sir Clement know I ſhould not. I therefore wrote the following note.

<head>To Sir Clement Willoughby.</head>

<salute>Sir,</salute>

<p>
THE letter you have been pleaſed to addreſs to me, is ſo little calculated to afford Lord Or
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ville any ſatisfaction, that you may depend up
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
on my carefully keeping it from his ſight. I will bear you no reſentment for what is paſt; but I moſt earneſtly entreat, nay implore, that you will not write again, while in your preſent frame of mind, by
<hi>any</hi>
channel, direct or indirect.
</p>
<p>
I hope you will have much pleaſure in your pur

<p>
Not knowing by what name to ſign, I was ob

liged to ſend it without any.
</p>
<p>
The

which Sir Clement mentions, go on juſt as if your conſent were arrived: it is in
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:1259700102:263"/>
vain that I expoſtulate; Lord Orville ſays, ſhould any objections be raiſed, all ſhall be given up, but that, as his hopes forbid him to expect any, he muſt proceed as if already aſſured of your con

<p>
We have had, this afternoon, a moſt intereſting converſation, in which we have traced our ſen
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
timents of each other from our firſt acquain
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tance. I have made him confeſs how ill he thought of me, upon my fooliſh giddineſs at Mrs. Stanley's ball; but he flatters me with aſſurances, that every ſucceeding time he ſaw me, I appeared to ſomething leſs and leſs diſadvan

tage.
</p>
<p>
When I expreſſed my amazement that he could honour with his choice a girl who ſeemed ſo infi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nitely, in
<hi>every</hi>
reſpect, beneath his alliance, he frankly owned, that he had fully intended making more minute enquiries into my family and connec

tions, and particularly concerning
<hi>thoſe people</hi>
he ſaw with me at Marybone, before he acknow
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ledged his prepoſſeſſion in my favour: but the ſuddenneſs of my intended journey, and the un
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
certainty of ſeeing me again, put him quite off his guard, and
<q rend="inline">
"diveſting him of prudence, left him nothing but love."
</q>
Theſe were his words; and yet, he has repeatedly aſſured me, that his par

Mr. Macartney has juſt been with me, on an embaſſy from my father. He has ſent me his kindeſt love, and aſſurances of favour, and deſired to know if I am happy in the proſpect of chang

<p>
THE time approaches now, when I hope we ſhall meet,—yet I cannot ſleep,—great joy is as reſtleſs as ſorrow,—and therefore I will continue my journal.
</p>
<p>
As I had never had any opportunity of ſee
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing Bath, a party was formed laſt night for ſhewing me that celebrated city; and this morn
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing, after breakfaſt, we ſet out in three pha
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
etons. Lady Louiſa and Mrs. Beaumont, with Lord Merton; Mr. Coverly with Mr. Lo
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
vel; and Mrs. Selwyn and myſelf, with Lord Orville.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:1259700102:265"/>
We had hardly proceeded half a mile, when a gentleman in a poſt-chaiſe, which came gal
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
loping after us, called out to the ſervants,
<q rend="inline">
"Hol
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
la, my Lads,—pray is one Miſs Anville in any of them
<hi>thing-embobs?</hi>
"
</q>
</p>
<p>
I immediately recollected the voice of Cap
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tain Mirvan, and Lord Orville ſtopt the pha
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
eton. He was out of the chaiſe, and with us in a moment.
<q rend="inline">"So, Miſs Anville,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"how do you do? So I hear you're Miſs Bel
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
mont now;—pray how does old Madame French do?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Madame Duval,"</q>
ſaid I,
<q rend="inline">"is, I believe, very well."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"I hope ſhe's in
<hi>good caſe,</hi>
"
</q>
ſaid he, wink
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing ſignificantly,
<q rend="inline">
"and won't flinch at ſeeing ſervice: ſhe has laid by long enough to refit and be made tight. And pray how does poor Monſieur Doleful do? is he as lank-jawed as ever?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"They are neither of them,"</q>
ſaid I,
<q rend="inline">"at Briſtol."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"No!—But ſurely the old dowager intends coming to the wedding! 'twill be a moſt ex
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cellent opportunity to ſhew off her beſt Lyons' ſilk. Beſides, I purpoſe to dance a new-fa
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſhioned jig with her. Don't you know when ſhe'll come?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I have no reaſon, Sir, to expect her at all."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"No!—'Fore George this here's the worſt news I'd wiſh to hear!—why, I've thought of nothing all the way but what trick I ſhould ſerve her!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"You have been very obliging!"</q>
ſaid I, laughing.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:1259700102:266"/>
<q rend="inline">"O, I promiſe you,"</q>
cried he,
<q rend="inline">
"our Moll would never have wheedled me into this jaunt, if I'd known ſhe was not here; for, to let you into the ſecret, I fully intended to have treated the old buck with another frolic."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Did Miſs Mirvan, then, perſuade you to this journey?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Yes, and we've been travelling all night."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>We!</hi>
"
</q>
cried I:"
<q rend="inline">"Is Miſs Mirvan, then, with you?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"What, Molly?—yes, ſhe's in that there chaiſe."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Good God, Sir, why did not you tell me ſooner?"</q>
cried I; and immediately, with Lord Orville's aſſiſtance, I jumpt out of the phaeton, and ran to the dear girl. Lord Orville opened the chaiſe-door, and I am ſure I need not tell you what unfeigned joy accompanied our meeting.
</p>
<p>
We both begged we might not be parted during the ride, and Lord Orville was ſo good as to invite Captain Mirvan into his phae
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ton.
</p>
<p>
I think I was hardly ever more rejoiced than at this ſo ſeaſonable viſit from my dear Maria; who had no ſooner heard the ſituation of my affairs, than, with the aſſiſtance of Lady Howard and her kind mother, ſhe beſought her father with ſuch earneſtneſs to conſent to the journey, that he had not been able to withſtand their united en
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
treaties; though ſhe owned that, had he not ex
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
pected to have met with Madame Duval, ſhe be
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
lieves he would not ſo readily have yielded. They arrived at Mrs. Beaumont's but a few minutes af
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ter we were out of ſight, and overtook us without much difficulty.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:1259700102:267"/>
I ſay nothing of our converſation, becauſe you may ſo well ſuppoſe both the ſubjects we choſe, and our manner of diſcuſſing them.
</p>
<p>
We all ſtopped at a great hotel, where we were obliged to enquire for a room, as Lady Louiſa,
<hi>fatigued to death,</hi>
deſired to
<hi>take ſomething</hi>
before we began our rambles.
</p>
<p>
As ſoon as the party was aſſembled, the Cap
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tain, abruptly ſaluting me, ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"So, Miſs Bel
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
mont, I wiſh you joy; ſo I hear you've quarrelled with your new name already?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Me!—no, indeed, Sir."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Then pleaſe for to tell me the reaſon you're in ſuch a hurry to change it."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Miſs Belmont!"</q>
cried Mr. Lovel, looking round him with the utmoſt aſtoniſhment,
<q rend="inline">
"I beg pardon,—but, if it is not impertinent,—I muſt beg leave to ſay, I always underſtood that Lady's name was Anville."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"'Fore George,"</q>
cried the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"it runs in my head, I've ſeen you ſomewhere before! and now I think on't, pray a'n't you the perſon I ſaw at the play one night, and who did n't know, all the time, whether it was a tragedy or a come

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I believe, Sir,"</q>
ſaid Mr. Lovel, ſtammering,
<q rend="inline">
"I had once,—I think—the pleaſure of ſeeing you laſt ſpring."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Ay, and if I live an hundred ſprings,"</q>
an
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſwered he,
<q rend="inline">
"I ſhall never forget it; by Jingo, it has ſerved me for a moſt excellent good joke ever ſince. Well, however, I'm glad to ſee you ſtill in the land of the living,"
</q>
ſhaking him roughly by the hand;
<q rend="inline">
"pray, if a body may be ſo bold, how much a night may you give at preſent to keep the undertakers aloof?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:1259700102:268"/>
<q rend="inline">"Me, Sir!"</q>
ſaid Mr. Lovel, very much diſ

compoſed;
<q rend="inline">
"I proteſt I never thought myſelf in ſuch imminent danger as to—really, Sir, I don't underſtand you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"O, you don't!—why then I'll make free for to explain myſelf. Gentlemen and Ladies, I'll tell you what; do you know this here gentleman, ſimple as he ſits there, pays five ſhillings a night to let his friends know he's alive!
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"And very cheap too,"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Selwyn,
<q rend="inline">
"if we conſider the value of the intelli

</q>
</p>
<p>
Lady Louiſa, being now refreſhed, we proceed
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed upon our expedition.
</p>
<p>
The charming city of Bath anſwered all my ex
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
pectations. The Creſcent, the proſpect from it, and the elegant ſymmetry of the Circus, delighted me. The Parades, I own, rather diſappointed me; one of them is ſcarce preferable to ſome of the beſt paved ſtreets in London, and the other, though it affords a beautiful proſpect, a charming view of Prior Park and of the Avon, yet wanted ſomething in
<hi>itſelf</hi>
of more ſtriking elegance than a mere broad pavement, to ſatisfy the ideas I had formed of it.
</p>
<p>
At the pump-room, I was amazed at the pub
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
lic exhibition of the ladies in the bath: it is true, their heads are covered with bonnets, but the very idea of being ſeen, in ſuch a ſituation, by whoever pleaſes to look, is indelicate.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"'Fore George,"</q>
ſaid the Captain, look
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing into the bath,
<q rend="inline">
"this would be a moſt ex
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
cellent place for old Madame French to dance a fandango in! By Jingo, I would n't wiſh for better ſport than to ſwing her round this here pond!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:1259700102:269"/>
<q rend="inline">"She would be very much obliged to you,"</q>
ſaid Lord Orville,
<q rend="inline">"for ſo extraordinary a mark of your favour."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why, to let you know,"</q>
anſwered the Cap
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tain,
<q rend="inline">
"ſhe hit my fancy mightily; I never took ſo much to an old tabby before."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Really, now,"</q>
cried Mr. Lovel, looking alſo into the bath,
<q rend="inline">
"I muſt confeſs it is, to me, very incomprehenſible why the ladies chuſe that frightful unbecoming dreſs to bathe in! I have of
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ten pondered very ſeriouſly upon the ſubject, but could never hit upon the reaſon."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Well, I declare,"</q>
ſaid Lady Louiſa,
<q rend="inline">
"I ſhould like of all things to ſet ſomething new a going; I always hated bathing, becauſe one can get no pretty dreſs for it; now do, there's a good creature, try to help me to ſomething."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Who? me!—O dear Ma'am,"</q>
ſaid he, ſimpering,
<q rend="inline">
"I can't pretend to aſſiſt a perſon of your Ladyſhip's taſte; beſides, I have not the leaſt head for faſhions,—I really don't think I ever invented three in my life!—but I never had the leaſt turn for dreſs,—never any notion of fancy or elegance."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"O fie, Mr. Lovel! how can you talk ſo?—don't we all know that you lead the
<hi>ton</hi>
in the
<hi>beau monde?</hi>
—I declare, I think you dreſs better than any body."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"O dear Ma'am, you confuſe me to the laſt degree!
<hi>I</hi>
dreſs well!—I proteſt I don't think I'm ever fit to be ſeen!—I'm often ſhocked to death to think what a figure I go. If your Ladyſhip will believe me, I was full half an hour this morning thinking what I ſhould put on!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Odds my life,"</q>
cried the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"I wiſh I'd been near you! I warrant I'd have quickened
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:1259700102:270"/>
your motions a little! Half an hour thinking what you'd put on? and who the deuce, do you think, cares the ſnuff of a candle whether you've any thing on or not?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O pray, Captain,"</q>
cried Mrs. Selwyn,
<q rend="inline">
"don't be angry with the gentleman for
<hi>
think
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing,
</hi>
whatever be the cauſe, for, I aſſure you, he makes no common practice of offending in that way."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Really, Ma'am, you are prodigiouſly kind!"</q>
ſaid Mr. Lovel, angrily.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Pray, now,"</q>
ſaid the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"did you ever get a ducking in that there place your
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſelf?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"A ducking, Sir!"</q>
repeated Mr. Lovel;
<q rend="inline">
"I proteſt I think that's rather an odd term!—but if you mean a
<hi>bathing,</hi>
it is an honour I have had many times."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"And pray, if a body may be ſo bold, what do you do with that frizle-frize top of your own? Why, I'll lay you what you will, there is fat and greaſe enough on your crown, to buoy you up, if you were to go in head down
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
wards."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"And I don't know,"</q>
cried Mrs. Selwyn,
<q rend="inline">
"but that might be the eaſieſt way, for I'm ſure it would be the lighteſt."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"For the matter of that there,"</q>
ſaid the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"you muſt make him a ſoldier, be

fore you can tell which is the lighteſt, head or heels. Howſomever, I'd lay ten pounds to a ſhilling, I could whiſk him ſo dexterouſly over into the pool, that he ſhould light plump upon his foretop, and turn round like a tetotum."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Done!"</q>
cried Lord Merton:
<q rend="inline">"I take your odds!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:1259700102:271"/>
<q rend="inline">"Will you?"</q>
returned he;
<q rend="inline">
"why then, 'fore George, I'd do it, as ſoon as ſay Jack Ro
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
binſon."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"He, he!"</q>
faintly laughed Mr. Lovel, as he moved abruptly from the window,
<q rend="inline">
"'pon ho
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nour, this is pleaſant enough; but I don't ſee what right any body has to lay wagers about one, without one's conſent."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"There, Lovel, you are out;"</q>
cried Mr. Coverly;
<q rend="inline">
"any man may lay what wager about you he pleaſes; your conſent is nothing to the purpoſe: he may lay that your noſe is a ſky-blue, if he pleaſes."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Ay,"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Selwyn,
<q rend="inline">
"or that your mind is more adorned than your perſon;—or any ab
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſurdity whatſoever."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I proteſt,"</q>
ſaid Mr. Lovel, angrily,
<q rend="inline">
"I think it's a very diſagreeable privilege, and I muſt beg that nobody may take ſuch a liberty with
<hi>me.</hi>
"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Like enough you may,"</q>
cried the Cap
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tain;
<q rend="inline">
"but what's that to the purpoſe? ſup
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
poſe I've a mind to lay that you've never a tooth in your head?—pray how will you hinder me?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"You'll allow me, at leaſt, Sir, to take the liberty of aſking how you'll
<hi>prove</hi>
it?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"How!—why, by knocking them all down your throat."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Knocking them all down my throat, Sir!"</q>
repeated Mr. Lovel, with a look of horror,
<q rend="inline">
"I proteſt I never heard any thing ſo ſhocking in my life; and I muſt beg leave to obſerve, that no wager, in my opinion, could juſtify ſuch a bar
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
barous action."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Here Lord Orville interfered, and hurried us to our carriages.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:1259700102:272"/>
We returned in the ſame order we came.—Mrs. Beaumont invited all the party to dinner, and has been ſo obliging as to beg Miſs Mirvan may continue at her houſe during her ſtay. The Captain will lodge at the Wells.
</p>
<p>
The firſt half-hour after our return, was de
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
voted to hearing Mr. Lovel's apologies for dining in his riding-dreſs.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Beaumont then, addreſſing herſelf to Miſs Mirvan and me, enquired how we liked Bath?
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I hope,"</q>
ſaid Mr. Lovel,
<q rend="inline">"the Ladies do not call this ſeeing Bath."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No!—what ſhould ail 'em?"</q>
cried the Cap
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tain;
<q rend="inline">
"do you ſuppoſe they put their eyes in their pockets?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"No, Sir; but I fancy you will find no per

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Mayhap, then,"</q>
ſaid the literal Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"you think we ſhould ſee it better by going about at midnight?'
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, Sir, no,"</q>
ſaid Mr. Lovel, with a ſu

percilious ſmile,
<q rend="inline">
"I perceive you don't under

ſtand me,—
<hi>we</hi>

without going at the right ſeaſon."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why, what a plague, then,"</q>
demanded he,
<q rend="inline">"can you only ſee at one ſeaſon of the year?"</q>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Lovel again ſmiled; but ſeemed ſuperior to making any anſwer.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"The Bath amuſements,"</q>
ſaid Lord Orville,
<q rend="inline">
"have a ſameneſs in them, which, after a ſhort time, renders them rather inſipid: but the greateſt objection that can be made to the place, is the encouragement it gives to gameſters."

"'tis the very

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I am ſorry for it,"</q>
ſaid Lord Orville, grave

ly, and looking at Lady Louiſa.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Your Lordſhip is no judge of this ſubject,"</q>
continued the other:—
<q rend="inline">
"but if once we could get you to a gaming-table, you'd never be happy away from it."

<q rend="inline">"You men of wit, Jack,"</q>
anſwered his Lord

<q rend="inline">
"are always ready;—for my part, I don't pretend to any talents that way."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Really, my Lord?"</q>
aſked the ſarcaſtic Mrs. Selwyn;
<q rend="inline">
"well, that is wonderful, conſidering ſucceſs would be ſo much in your power."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Pray, Madam,"</q>
ſaid Mr. Lovel to Lady Louiſa,
<q rend="inline">"has your Ladyſhip heard the news?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"News!—what news?"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why, the report circulating at the Wells concerning a certain perſon?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O Lord, no; pray tell me what it is!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"O no, Ma'am, I beg your La'ſhip will ex

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Lord, now, how can you be ſo monſtrous?—I declare, now, you're a provoking creature!
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:1259700102:274"/>
But come, I know you'll tell me;—won't you now?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Your La'ſhip knows I am but too happy to obey you; but, 'pon honour, I can't ſpeak a word, if you won't all promiſe me the moſt inviola

</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I wiſh you'd wait for that from me,"</q>
ſaid the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"and I'll give you my word you'd be dumb for one while. Secrecy, quoth a!—Fore George, I wonder you a'n't aſhamed to men
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tion ſuch a word, when you talk of telling it to a woman. Though, for the matter of that, I'd as lieve blab it to the whole ſex at once, as to go for to tell it to ſuch a thing as you."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Such a thing as me, Sir!"</q>
ſaid Mr. Lovel, letting fall his knife and fork, and looking very important:
<q rend="inline">
"I really have not the honour to underſtand your expreſſion."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"It's all one for that,"</q>
ſaid the Captain;
<q rend="inline">"you may have it explained whenever you like it."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"'Pon honour, Sir,"</q>
returned Mr. Lovel,
<q rend="inline">
"I muſt take the liberty to tell you, that I ſhould be extremely offended, but that I ſuppoſe it to be ſome ſea-phraſe, and therefore I'll let it paſs with

out further notice."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Lord Orville then, to change the diſcourſe, aſked Miſs Mirvan if ſhe ſhould ſpend the enſuing winter in London?"
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"No, to be ſure,"</q>
ſaid the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"what ſhould ſhe for? ſhe ſaw all that was to be ſeen before."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Is London, then,"</q>
ſaid Mr. Lovel ſmiling, at Lady Louiſa,
<q rend="inline">
"only to be regarded as a
<hi>ſight?</hi>
"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why pray, Mr. Wiſeacre, how are you pleaſed for to regard it yourſelf?—Anſwer me to that?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:1259700102:275"/>
<q rend="inline">
"O Sir,
<hi>my</hi>
opinion I fancy you would hardly find intelligible. I don't underſtand
<hi>ſea-phraſes</hi>
enough to define it to your comprehenſion. Does n't your La'ſhip think the taſk would be rather difficult?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"O Lard, yes,"</q>
cried Lady Louiſa,
<q rend="inline">
"I de
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
clare I'd as ſoon teach my parrot to talk Welch."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Ha! ha! ha! admirable!—Pon honour, your La'ſhip's quite in luck to day;—but that, indeed, your La'ſhip is every day. Though, to be ſure, it is but candid to acknowledge, that the gentlemen of the ocean have a ſet of ideas, as well as a dialect, ſo oppoſite to
<hi>ours,</hi>
that it is by no means ſurpriſing
<hi>they</hi>
ſhould regard London as a mere
<hi>ſhow,</hi>
that may be ſeen by being
<hi>looked at.</hi>
Ha! ha! ha!
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Ha! ha!</q>
echoed Lady Louiſa:
<q rend="inline">
Well, I de
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
clare you are the drolleſt creature!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"He! he! 'pon honour I can't help laughing at the conceit of
<hi>ſeeing London</hi>
in a few weeks!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"And what a plague ſhould hinder you?"</q>
cri
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed the Captain;
<q rend="inline">"do you want to ſpend a day in every ſtreet?"</q>
</p>
<p>
Here again Lady Louiſa and Mr. Lovel inter
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
changed ſmiles.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why, I warrant you, if I had the ſhewing of it, I'd haul you from St. James's to Wapping the very firſt morning."
</q>
</p>
<p>
The ſmiles were now, with added contempt, repeated; which the Captain obſerving, looked very fiercely at Mr. Lovel, and ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"Hark'ee, my ſpark, none of your grinning!—'tis a lingo I don't underſtand; and if you give me any more of it, I ſhall go near to lend you a box o' the ear."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I proteſt, Sir,"</q>
ſaid Mr. Lovel, turning ex
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tremely pale,
<q rend="inline">
"I think it's taking a very particular
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:1259700102:276"/>
liberty with a perſon, to talk to one in ſuch a ſtyle as this!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"It's like you may,"</q>
returned the Captain;
<q rend="inline">
"but give a good gulp and I warrant you'll ſwal
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
low it."
</q>
Then, calling for a glaſs of ale, with a very provoking and ſignificant nod, he drank to his eaſy digeſtion.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Lovel made no anſwer, but looked ex
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tremely ſullen: and ſoon after, we left the gen
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tlemen to themſelves.
</p>
<p>
I had then two letters delivered to me; one from Lady Howard and Mrs. Mirvan, which con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tained the kindeſt congratulations; and the other from Madame Duval,—but not a word from
<hi>you,</hi>
—to my no ſmall ſurpriſe and concern.
</p>
<p>
Madame Duval ſeems greatly rejoiced at my late intelligence: a violent cold, ſhe ſays, pre
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
vented her coming to Briſtol. The Branghtons, ſhe tells me, are all well; Miſs Polly is ſoon to be married to Mr. Brown, but Mr. Smith has changed his lodgings,
<q rend="inline">"which,"</q>
ſhe adds,
<q rend="inline">
"has made the houſe extremely dull. However, that's not the worſe news;
<hi>pardie,</hi>
I wiſh it was! but I've been uſed like nobody,—for Monſieur Du Bois has had the baſeneſs to go back to France with
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
out me."
</q>
In concluſion, ſhe aſſures me, as you prognoſticated ſhe would, that I ſhall be ſole heireſs of all ſhe is worth, when Lady Orville.
</p>
<p>
At tea-time, we were joined by all the gentle
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
men but Captain Mirvan, who went to the Ho
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tel where he was to ſleep, and made his daughter accompany him, to ſeparate her
<hi>trumpery,</hi>
as he called it, from his cloaths.
</p>
<p>
As ſoon as they were gone, Mr. Lovel, who ſtill appeared extremely ſulky, ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"I proteſt, I never ſaw ſuch a vulgar, abuſive fellow in my life, as that Captain: 'pon honour, I believe he
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:1259700102:277"/>
came here for no purpoſe in the world but to pick a quarrel; however, for my part, I vow I won't humour him."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I declare,"</q>
cried Lady Louiſa,
<q rend="inline">
"he put me in a monſtrous fright,—I never heard any body talk ſo ſhocking in my life!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I think,"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Selwyn, with great ſo
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
lemnity,
<q rend="inline">
"he threatened to box your ears, Mr. Lovel,—did not he?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Really, Ma'am,"</q>
ſaid Mr. Lovel, colour
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing,
<q rend="inline">
"if one was to mind every thing thoſe low kind of people ſay,—one ſhould never be at reſt for one impertinence or other,—ſo I think the beſt way is to be above taking any notice of them."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"What,"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Selwyn, with the ſame gravity,
<q rend="inline">"and ſo receive the blow in ſilence!"</q>
</p>
<p>
During this diſcourſe, I ſaw the Captain's chaiſe drive up to the gate, and ran down ſtairs to meet Maria. She was alone, and told me, that her father, who, ſhe was ſure, had ſome ſcheme in agitation againſt Mr. Lovel, had ſent her on before him. We continued in the garden till his return, and were joined by Lord Orville, who begged me not to inſiſt on a patience ſo unnatu
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ral, as ſubmitting to be excluded our ſociety. And let me, my dear Sir, with a grateful heart, let me own, I never before paſſed half an hour in ſuch perfect felicity.
</p>
<p>
I believe we were all ſorry when we ſaw the Captain return; yet his inward ſatisfaction, from however different a cauſe, did not ſeem inferior to what ours had been. He chucked Maria un
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
der the chin, rubbed his hands, and was ſcarce able to contain the fullneſs of his glee. We all attended him to the drawing-room, where, hav
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing compoſed his countenance, without any pre
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
vious
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:1259700102:278"/>
attention to Mrs. Beaumont, he marched up to Mr. Lovel, and abruptly ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"Pray have you ever a brother in theſe here parts?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Me, Sir?—no, thank Heaven, I'm free from all incumbrances of that ſort."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Well,"</q>
cried the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"I met a perſon juſt now, ſo like you, I could have ſworn he had been your twin-brother."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"It would have been a moſt ſingular pleaſure to me,"
</q>
ſaid Mr. Lovel,
<q rend="inline">
"if I alſo could have ſeen him; for, really, I have not the leaſt notion what ſort of a perſon I am, and I have a prodigi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ous curioſity to know."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Juſt then, the Captain's ſervant opening the door, ſaid,
<q rend="inline">
"A little gentleman below deſires to ſee one Mr. Lovel."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Beg him to walk up ſtairs,"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Beau
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
mont.
<q rend="inline">
"But pray what is the reaſon William is out of the way?"
</q>
</p>
<p>The man ſhut the door without any anſwer.</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I can't imagine who it is,"</q>
ſaid Mr. Lovel;
<q rend="inline">
"I recollect no little Gentleman of my acquaint
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ance now at Briſtol,—except, indeed, the Mar
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
quis of Carlton,—but I don't much fancy it can be him. Let me ſee, who elſe is there ſo very little?"—
</q>
</p>
<p>
A confuſed noiſe among the ſervants now drew all eyes towards the door; the impatient Captain haſtened to open it, and then, clapping his hands, called out,
<q rend="inline">
"'Fore George, 'tis the ſame per
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſon I took for your relation!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
And then, to the utter aſtoniſhment of every body but himſelf, he hauled into the room a monkey! full dreſſed, and extravagantly
<hi>à-la-mode!</hi>
</p>
<p>
The diſmay of the company was almoſt gene
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ral. Poor Mr. Lovel ſeemed thunderſtruck with
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:1259700102:279"/>
indignation and ſurpriſe; Lady Louiſa began a ſcream, which for ſome time was inceſſant; Miſs Mirvan and I jumped involuntarily upon the ſeats of our chairs; Mrs. Beaumont herſelf followed our example; Lord Orville placed himſelf before me as a guard; and Mrs. Selwyn, Lord Merton, and Mr. Coverley, burſt into a loud, immode
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
rate, ungovernable fit of laughter, in which they were joined by the Captain, till, unable to ſup
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
port himſelf, he rolled on the floor.
</p>
<p>
The firſt voice which made its way thro' this general noiſe, was that of Lady Louiſa, which her fright and ſcreaming rendered extremely ſhrill.
<q rend="inline">"Take it away!"</q>
cried ſhe,
<q rend="inline">
"take the mon
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſter away,—I ſhall faint, I ſhall faint if you don't!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Lovel, irritated beyond endurance, an
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
grily demanded of the Captain what he meant?"
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Mean?"</q>
cried the Captain, as ſoon as he was able to ſpeak,
<q rend="inline">"why only to ſhew you in your proper colours."</q>
Then riſing, and pointing to the monkey,
<q rend="inline">
"Why now, Ladies and Gen
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tlemen, I'll be judged by you!—Did you ever ſee any thing more like? Odds my life, if it was n't for this here tail, you would n't know one from t'other."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Sir,"</q>
cried Mr. Lovel, ſtamping,
<q rend="inline">"I ſhall take a time to make you feel my wrath."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Come, now,"</q>
continued the regardleſs Cap
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tain,
<q rend="inline">
"juſt for the fun's ſake, doff your coat and waiſtcoat, and ſwop with Monſieur
<hi>Grinagain</hi>
here, and I'll warrant you'll not know yourſelf which is which."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Not know myſelf from a monkey?—I aſſure you, Sir, I'm not to be uſed in this manner, and I won't bear it,—curſe me if I will!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:1259700102:280"/>
<q rend="inline">"Why heyday,"</q>
cried the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"what, is Maſter in a paſſion?—well, don't be angry,—come, he ſhan't hurt you;—here, ſhake a paw with him,—why he'll do you no harm, man!—come, kiſs and friends!"—
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Who I?"</q>
cried Mr. Lovel, almoſt mad with vexation,
<q rend="inline">
"as I'm a living creature, I would not touch him for a thouſand worlds!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Send him a challenge,"</q>
cried Mr. Coverley,
<q rend="inline">"and I'll be your ſecond."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Ay, do,"</q>
ſaid the Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"and I'll be ſecond to my friend Monſieur Clapperclaw here. Come, to it at once!—tooth and nail!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"God forbid!"</q>
cried Mr. Lovel, retreating,
<q rend="inline">"I would ſooner truſt my perſon with a mad bull!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I don't like the looks of him myſelf,"</q>
ſaid Lord Merton,
<q rend="inline">"for he grins moſt horribly."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Oh I'm frightened out of my ſenſes!"</q>
cried Lady Louiſa,
<q rend="inline">"take him away, or I ſhall die!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Captain,"</q>
ſaid Lord Orville,
<q rend="inline">
"the ladies are alarmed, and I muſt beg you would ſend the monkey away."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"Why, where can be the mighty harm of one monkey more than another?"
</q>
anſwered the Cap
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tain;
<q rend="inline">
howſomever, if it's agreeable to the ladies, ſuppoſe we turn them out together?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"What do you mean by that, Sir?"</q>
cried Mr. Lovel, lifting up his cane.
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">
"What do
<hi>you</hi>
mean?"
</q>
cried the Captain, fiercely:
<q rend="inline">be ſo good as to down with your cane."</q>
</p>
<p>
Poor Mr. Lovel, too much intimidated to ſtand his ground, yet too much enraged to ſubmit, turn
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed haſtily round, and, forgetful of conſequences, vented his paſſion by giving a furious blow to the monkey.
</p>
<p>
The creature, darting forwards, ſprung inſtant
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ly upon him, and olinging round his neck, faſten
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ed his teeth to one of his ears.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:1259700102:281"/>
I was really ſorry for the poor man, who, though an egregious fop, had committed no of
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
fence that merited ſuch chaſtiſement.
</p>
<p>
It was impoſſible, now, to diſtinguiſh whoſe ſcreams were loudeſt, thoſe of Mr. Lovel or the terrified Lady Louiſa, who, I believe, thought her own turn was approaching: but the unrelent
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing Captain roared with joy.
</p>
<p>
Not ſo Lord Orville: ever humane, generous, and benevolent, he quitted his charge, whom he ſaw was wholly out of danger, and ſeizing the monkey by the collar, made him looſen the ear, and then, with a ſudden ſwing, flung him out of the room, and ſhut the door.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Lovel was now a dreadful object; his face was beſmeared with tears, the blood from his ear ran trickling down his cloaths, and he ſunk upon the floor, crying out,
<q rend="inline">
"Oh I ſhall die, I ſhall die!—Oh I'm bit to death!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Captain Mirvan,"</q>
ſaid Mrs. Beaumont, with no little indignation,
<q rend="inline">
"I muſt own I don't perceive the wit of this action; and I am ſorry to have ſuch cruelty practiſed in my houſe."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why, Lord, Ma'am,"</q>
ſaid the Captain, when his rapture abated ſufficiently for ſpeech,
<q rend="inline">
"how could I tell they'd fall out ſo?—by Jingo, I brought him to be a meſſmate for t'other."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Egad,"</q>
ſaid Mr. Coverley,
<q rend="inline">
"I would not have been ſerved ſo for a thouſand pounds!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why then there's the odds on't,"</q>
ſaid the Cap
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tain,
<q rend="inline">
"for you ſee he is ſerved ſo for nothing. But come,"
</q>
(turning to Mr. Lovel,)
<q rend="inline">
"be of good heart, all may end well yet, and you and Monſieur Longtail be as good friends as ever."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I'm ſurpriſed, Mrs. Beaumont,"</q>
cried Mr. Lovel, ſtarting up,
<q rend="inline">
"that you can ſuffer a per
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſon under your roof to be treated ſo inhumanly."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"What argufies ſo many words?"</q>
ſaid the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:1259700102:282"/>
unfeeling Captain,
<q rend="inline">
"it is but a ſlit of the ear; it only looks as if you had been in the pillory."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Very true,"</q>
added Mrs. Selwyn,
<q rend="inline">
and who knows but it may acquire you the credit of being an anti-miniſterial writer?"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I proteſt,"</q>
cried Mr. Lovel, looking ruefully at his dreſs,
<q rend="inline">"my new riding-ſuit's all over blood!"</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Ha, ha, ha!"</q>
cried the captain,
<q rend="inline">
"ſee what comes of ſtudying for an hour what you ſhall put on."
</q>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Lovel then walked to the glaſs, and look
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing at the place, exclaimed,
<q rend="inline">
"Oh Heaven, what a monſtrous wound! my ear will never be fit to be ſeen again!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Why then,"</q>
ſaid the Captain,
<q rend="inline">"you muſt hide it;—'tis but wearing a wig."</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"A wig!"</q>
repeated the affrighted Mr. Lovel,
<q rend="inline">
"
<hi>I</hi>
wear a wig?—no, not if you would give me a thouſand pounds an hour!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"I declare,"</q>
ſaid Lady Louiſa,
<q rend="inline">
"I never heard ſuch a ſhocking propoſal in my life!"
</q>
</p>
<p>
"Lord Orville then, ſeeing no proſpect that the altercation would ceaſe, propoſed to the Cap

</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"'Pon honour,"</q>
ſaid Mr. Lovel, the moment the door was ſhut,
<q rend="inline">
"that fellow is the greateſt brute in nature! he ought not to be admitted into a civilized ſociety."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Lovel,"</q>
ſaid Mr. Coverley, affecting to whiſper,
<q rend="inline">
"you muſt certainly pink him: you muſt not put up with ſuch an affront."
</q>
</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Sir,"</q>
ſaid Mr. Lovel,
<q rend="inline">
"with any common perſon, I ſhould not deliberate an inſtant; but, re

</p>
<p>
<q rend="inline">"Lovel,"</q>

And then, very abruptly, he left the room.

<p>
What a commotion has this miſchief-loving Captain raiſed! Were I to remain here long, even the ſociety of my dear Maria could ſcarce com

</p>
<p>
When he returned, and heard of his quiet exit, his triumph was intolerable.
<q rend="inline">"I think, I think,"</q>
cried he,

"I have peppered him well! I'll war

All the company then, Lord Orville, Miſs Mir

van, and myſelf excepted, played at cards, and
<hi>we</hi>
—oh how much better did we paſs our time!"
</p>
<p>
While we were engaged in a moſt delightful converſation, a ſervant brought me a letter, which
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:1259700102:284"/>
he told me had, by ſome accident, been miſlaid. Judge my feelings, when I ſaw, my deareſt Sir, your revered hand-writing! My emotions ſoon betrayed to Lord Orville whom the letter was from: the importance of the contents he well knew, and aſſuring me I ſhould not be ſeen by the card-players, he beſought me to open it with
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
out delay.
</p>
<p>
Open it, indeed, I did;—but read it I could not,—the willing, yet aweful conſent you have granted,—the tenderneſs of your expreſſions,—the certainty that no obſtacle remained to my eter

nal union with the loved owner of my heart, gave me ſenſations too various, and though joyful, too little placid for obſervation. Finding myſelf un
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
able to proceed, and blinded by the tears of gra
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
titude and delight which ſtarted into my eyes, I gave over the attempt of reading, till I retired to my own room: and, having no voice to an
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ter into his hands, and left it to ſpeak both for me and itſelf.
</p>
<p>
Lord Orville was himſelf affected by your kindneſs; he kiſſed the letter as he returned it, and, preſſing my hand affectionately to his heart,
<q rend="inline">"You are now,"</q>
(ſaid he, in a low voice)
<q rend="inline">
"all my own! Oh my Evelina, how will my ſoul find room for its happineſs?—it ſeems already burſt

</q>
I could make no reply; indeed I hardly ſpoke another word the reſt of the evening; ſo lit

tle talkative is the fullneſs of contentment.
</p>
<p>
O my deareſt Sir, the thankfulneſs of my heart I muſt pour-forth at our meeting, when, at your feet, my happineſs receives its confir

<head type="sub">Mr. Villars to Evelina.</head>
<p>
EVERY wiſh of my ſoul is now fulfilled—for the felicity of my Evelina is equal to her worthineſs!
</p>
<p>
Yes, my child, thy happineſs is engraved, in golden characters, upon the tablets of my heart! and their impreſſion is indelible; for, ſhould the rude and deep-ſearching hand of Misfortune at
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tempt to pluck them from their repoſitory, the fleeting fabric of life would give way, and in tear
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing from my vitals the nouriſhment by which they are ſupported, ſhe would but graſp at a ſhadow inſenſible to her touch.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:1259700102:286"/>
Give thee my conſent?—Oh thou joy, comfort, and pride of my life, how cold is that word to expreſs the fervency of my approbation! yes, I do indeed give thee my conſent, and ſo thank
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
fully, that, with the humbleſt gratitude to Pro
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
vidence, I would ſeal it with the remnant of my days.
</p>
<p>
Haſten, then, my love, to bleſs me with thy preſence, and to receive the bleſſings with which my fond heart overflows!—And, oh my Evelina, hear and aſſiſt in one only, humble, but ardent prayer which yet animates my devotions: that the height of bliſs to which thou art riſing may not render thee giddy, but that the purity of thy mind may form the brighteſt ſplendor of thy proſ
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
perity!—and that the weak and aged frame of thy almoſt idolizing parent, nearly worn out by time, paſt afflictions, and infirmities, may yet be able to ſuſtain a meeting with all its better part holds dear: and then, that all the wounds which the former ſeverity of fortune inflicted, may be healed and purified by the ultimate conſolation of pour
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ing forth my dying words in bleſſings on my child!—cloſing theſe joy-ſtreaming eyes in her pre
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſence, and breathing my laſt faint ſighs in her loved arms!
</p>
<p>
Grieve not, oh child of my care, grieve not at the inevitable moment; but may thy own end be equally propitious! Oh may'ſt thou when full of days, and full of honour, ſink down as gently to reſt,—be loved as kindly, watched as tenderly as thy happy father! And may'ſt thou, when thy glaſs is run, be ſweetly but not bitterly mourned, by ſome remaining darling of thy affections,—ſome yet ſurviving Evelina!
