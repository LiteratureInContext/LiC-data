                        The first printings were anonymous, and Frances Burney's name was not
                        inscribed on the title page. All the earliest London printings were in three
                        volumes. This etext is based on the first Dublin edition. Transcribed and
                        made available through ECCO-TCP, the this Dublin edition was printed in two
                        volumes. Each volume has its own title page.</note>

               <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p> THE liberty which I take in addressing to You the trifling production of a few idle
               hours, will, doubtless, move your wonder, and, probably, your contempt. I will not,
               however, with the futility of apologies, intrude upon your time, but briefly
               acknowledge the motives of my teme rity: lest, by a premature exercise of the
               patience from which I hope to profit, I should abate of its benevolence, and <pb
                  n="vi"/> be myself accessary to my own condem nation. </p>
            <p> Without name, without recommen dation, and unknown alike to success and disgrace, to
               whom can I so properly apply for patronage, as to those who publicly profess
               themselves Inspectors of all literary performances? </p>
            <p> The extensive plan of your critical observations,—which, not confined to works of
               utility or ingenuity, is equally open to those of frivolous amusement, and yet worse
               than frivolous dullness,—encourages me to seek for your protec tion, since,—perhaps
               for my sins!—it entitles me to your annotations. To resent, therefore, this offering,
               howe ver insignificant, would ill become the universality of your undertaking, tho'
               not to despise it may, alas! be out of your power. </p>
            <p> The language of adulation, and the incense of flattery, though the natural
               inheritance, and constant resource, from time immemorial, of the Dedicator, to me
               offer nothing but the wistful regret that I dare not invoke their aid. Sinis ter
               views would be imputed to all I <pb n="vii"/> could say; since, thus situated, to ex
               tol your judgment, would seem the ef fect of art, and to celebrate your im
               partiality, be attributed to suspecting it. </p>
            <p> As Magistrates of the Press, and Cen sors for the Public,—to which you are bound by
               the sacred ties of integrity to exert the most spirited impartiality, and to which
               your suffrages should carry the marks of pure, dauntless, irrefragable truth,—to
               appeal for your MERCY, were to solicit your dishonour; and therefore,—though it is
               sweeter than frankincense,—more grateful to the senses than all the odorous perfumes
               of Arabia,—and though <q>
                  <l>It droppeth like the gentle rain from heaven</l>
                  <l>Upon the place beneath,—</l>
               </q> I court it not! to your justice alone I am entitled, and by that I must abide.
               Your engagements are not to the suppli cating author, but to the candid public, which
               will not fail to crave <q>
                  <l>The penalty and forfeit of your bond.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p> No hackneyed writer, inured to a buse, and callous to criticism, here <pb n="viii"/>
               braves your severity;—neither does a half-starved garretteer, <q>
                  <l>Compell'd by hunger,—and request of friends,—</l>
               </q> implore your lenity; your examination will be alike unbiassed by partiality and
               prejudice;—no refractory murmur ing will follow your censure, no pri vate interest be
               gratified by your praise. </p>
            <p> Let not the anxious solicitude with which I recommend myself to your no tice, expose
               me to your derision. Re member, Gentlemen, you were all young writers once, and the
               most ex perienced veteran of your corps, may, by recollecting his first publication,
               re novate his first terrors, and learn to al low for mine. For, though Courage is one
               of the noblest virtues of this nether sphere, and though scarcely more re quisite in
               the field of battle, to guard the fighting hero from disgrace, than in the private
               commerce of the world, to ward off that littleness of soul which leads by steps
               imperceptible, to all the base train of the inferior passions, and <pb n="ix"/> by
               which the too timid mind is be trayed into a servility derogatory to the dignity of
               human nature;—yet is it a virtue of no necessity in a situation such as mine; a
               situation which removes, even from cowardice itself, the sting of ignominy;—for
               surely that Courage may easily be dispensed with, which would rather raise disgust
               than admi ration? Indeed, it is the peculiar pri vilege of an author, to rob terror
               of contempt, and pusillanimity of re proach. </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here let me rest,</hi> —and snatch myself, while yet I am able, from the fascina
               tion of EGOTISM,—a monster who has more votaries than ever did homage to the most
               popular deity of antiquity; and whose singular quality is, that while he excites a
               blind and involuntary adoration in almost every individual, his influence is
               universally disallowed, his power universally contemned, and his worship, even by his
               followers, never mentioned but with abhor rence. </p>
            <p> In addressing you jointly, I mean but to mark the generous sentiments by <pb n="x"/>
               which liberal criticism, to the utter annihilation of envy, jealousy, and all selfish
               views, ought to be distinguish ed. </p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p> IN the republic of letters, there is no member of such inferior rank, or who is so
               much dis dained by his brethren of the quill, as the humble Novelist: nor is his fate
               less hard in the world at large, since, among the whole class of writers, perhaps not
               one can be named, of whom the votaries are more numerous, but less respect able. </p>
            <p> Yet, while in the annals of those few of our predecessors, to whom this species of
               writing is indebted for being saved from contempt, and res cued from depravity, we
               can trace such names as Rousseau, Johnson, <note n="*" place="bottom"> However
                  superior the capacities in which these great writers deserve to be considered,
                  they must par don me that, for the dignity of my subject, I here rank the authors
                  of Rasselas and Eloïse as Novelists. </note> Marivaux, Fielding, Ri chardson, and
               Smollet, no man need blush at <pb n="xii"/> starting from the same post, though many,
               nay, most men, may sigh at finding themselves di stanced. </p>
            <p> The following letters are presented to the public—for such, by novel writers, novel
               read ers will be called,—with a very singular mix ture of timidity and confidence,
               resulting from the peculiar situation of the editor, who, though trembling for their
               success from a consciousness of their imperfections, yet fears not being in volved in
               their disgrace, while happily wrapped up in a mantle of impenetrable obscurity. </p>
            <p> To draw characters from nature, though not from life, and to mark the manners of the
               times, is the attempted plan of the following letters. For this purpose, a young
               female, educated in the most secluded retirement, makes, at the age of seventeen, her
               first appearance upon the great and busy stage of life; with a virtuous mind, a
               cultivated understanding, and a feeling heart, her ignorance of the forms, and
               inexperience in the manners, of the world, occasion all the little incidents which
               these volumes record, and which form the natural progression of the life of a young
               woman of obscure birth, but conspicuous beauty, for the first six months after her
                  <hi> En trance into the World. </hi>
            </p>
            <p> Perhaps were it possible to effect the total extirpation of novels, our young ladies
               in gene ral, <pb n="xiii"/> and boarding-school damsels in particular, might profit
               from their annihilation: but since the distemper they have spread seems incurable,
               since their contagion bids defiance to the medicine of advice or reprehension, and
               since they are found to baffle all the mental art of physic, save what is prescribed
               by the slow regimen of Time, and bitter diet of Experience, surely all attempts to
               contribute to the number of those which may be read, if not with advantage, at least
               without injury, ought rather to be encouraged than con temned. </p>
            <p> Let me, therefore, prepare for dsiappointment those who, in the perusal of these
               sheets, enter tain the gentle expectation of being transported to the fantastic
               regions of Romance, where Fiction is coloured by all the gay tints of luxurious Ima
               gination, where Reason is an outcast, and where the sublimity of <hi>the
                  Marvellous</hi> rejects all aid from sober Probability. The heroine of these
               memoirs, young, artless, and inexperienced, is <q>
                  <l>No faultless Monster, that the World ne'er saw,</l>
               </q> but the offspring of Nature, and of Nature in her simplest attire. </p>
            <p> In all the Arts, the value of copies can only be proportioned to the scarceness of
               originals: among sculptors and painters, a fine statue, or a beautiful picture, of
               some great master, may de servedly employ the imitative talents of younger and
               inferior artists, that their appropriation to <pb n="xiv"/> one spot, may not wholly
               prevent the more ge neral expansion of their excellence; but, among authors, the
               reverse is the case, since the noblest productions of literature, are almost equally
               at tainable with the meanest. In books, therefore, imitation cannot be shunned too
               sedulously; for the very perfection of a model which is frequent ly seen, serves but
               more forcibly to mark the in feriority of a copy. </p>
            <p> To avoid what is common, without adopting what is unnatural, must limit the ambition
               of the vulgar herd of authors: however zealous, therefore, my veneration of the great
               writers I have mentioned, however 1 may feel myself en lightened by the knowledge of
               Johnson, charmed with the eloquence of Rousseau, softened by the pathetic powers of
               Richardson, and exhilarated by the wit of Fielding, and humour of Smollet; I yet
               presume not to attempt pursuing the same ground which they have tracked; whence,
               though they may have cleared the weeds, they have also culled the flowers, and though
               they have rendered the path plain, they have left it barren. </p>
            <p> The candour of my readers, I have not the impertinence to doubt, and to their
               indulgence, I am sensible I have no claim: I have, there fore, only to entreat, that
               my own words may not pronounce my condemnation, and that what I have here ventured to
               say in regard to imita tion, may be understood, as it is meant, in a ge neral <pb
                  n="xv"/> sense, and not be imputed to an opinion of my own originality, which I
               have not the vanity, the folly, or the blindness, to entertain. </p>
            <p> Whatever may be the fate of these letters, the editor is satisfied they will meet
               with jus tice; and commits them to the press, though hopeless of fame, yet not
               regardless of cen sure. </p>

            <p> CAN there, my good Sir, be any thing more painful to a friendly mind, than a
               necessity of com municating disagreeable intelligence? Indeed, it is sometimes
               difficult to determine, whether the rela tor or the receiver of evil tidings is most
               to be pitied. </p>
            <p> I have just had a letter from Madame Duval; she is totally at a loss in what manner
               to behave; she seems desirous to repair the wrongs she has done, yet wishes the world
               to believe her blame less. She would fain cast upon another the odium of those
               misfortunes for which she alone is answer able. Her letter is violent, sometimes
               abusive, and that of <hi>you!—you,</hi> to whom she is under obliga tions which are
               greater even than her faults, but to whose advice she wickedly imputes all the suf
               ferings of her much injured daughter, the late Lady Belmont. The chief purport of her
               writing I will acquaint you with; the letter itself is not worthy your notice. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2"/> She tells me that she has, for many years past, been in continual
               expectation of making a journey to England, which prevented her writing for in
               formation concerning this melancholy subject, by giving her hopes of making personal
               enquiries; but family occurrences have still detained her in France, which country
               she now sees no prospect of quitting. She has, therefore, lately used her ut most
               endeavours to obtain a faithful account of whatever related to her
                  <hi>ill-advised</hi> daughter; the result of which giving her <hi>some reason</hi>
               to apprehend that, upon her death bed, she bequeathed an infant orphan to the world,
               she most graciously says that if <hi>you,</hi> with whom <hi>she understands</hi> the
               child is pla ced, will procure authentic proofs of its relation ship to her, you may
               send it to Paris, where she will properly provide for it. </p>
            <p> This woman is, undoubtedly, at length, con scious of her most unnatural conduct: it
               is evident, from her writing, that she is still as vulgar and illi terate as when her
               first husband, Mr. Evelyn, had the weakness to marry her; nor does she at all apo
               logise for addressing herself to me, though I was only once in her company. </p>
            <p> This letter has excited in my daughter Mirvan, a strong desire to be informed of the
               motives which induced Madame Duval to abandon the unfortu nate Lady Belmont, at a
               time when a mother's pro tection was so peculiarly necessary for her peace and her
               reputation. Notwithstanding I was per sonally acquainted with all the parties
               concerned in that affair, the subject always appeared of too de licate a nature to be
               spoken of with the principals; I cannot, therefore, satisfy Mrs. Mirvan otherwise
               than by applying to you. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3"/> By saying that you <hi>may</hi> send the child, Madame Duval aims at
                  <hi>conferring,</hi> where she most <hi>owes</hi> obli gation. I pretend not to
               give you advice; you, to whose generous protection this helpless orphan is indebted
               for every thing, are the best and only judge of what she ought to do; but I am much
               concern ed for the trouble and uneasiness which this unwor thy woman may occasion
               you. </p>
            <p> My daughter and my grandchild join with me in desiring to be most kindly remembered
               to the amiable girl; and they bid me remind you, that the annual visit to Howard
               Grove, which we were formerly promised, has been discontinued for more than four
               years. </p>

            <p> YOUR Ladyship did but too well foresee the perplexity and uneasiness of which Madame
               Du val's letter has been productive. However, I ought rather to be thankful that I
               have so many years remained unmolested, than repine at my pre sent embarrassment;
               since it proves, at least, that this wretched woman is at length awakened to re
               morse. </p>
            <p> In regard to my answer, I must humbly request your Ladyship to write to this effect:
                  <q rend="inline"> "That I would not, upon any account, intentionally offend Madame
                  Duval, but that I have weighty, nay un answerable <pb n="4"/> reasons for
                  detaining her grand-daughter at present in England; the principal of which is,
                  that it was the earnest desire of one to whose will she owes implicit duty. Madame
                  Duval may be assured that she meets with the utmost attention and tenderness; that
                  her education, however short of my wishes, almost exceeds my abilities; and that I
                  flatter myself, when the time arrives that she shall pay her duty to her
                  grand-mother, Madame Duval will find no reason to be dissatisfied with what has
                  been done for her." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Your Ladyship will not, I am sure, be surprised at this answer. Madame Duval is by
               no means a proper companion or guardian for a young woman: she is at once uneducated
               and unprincipled; ungen tle in her temper, and unamiable in her manners. I have long
               known that she has persuaded herself to harbour an aversion for me—Unhappy woman! I
               can only regard her as an object of pity! </p>
            <p> I dare not hesitate at a request from Mrs. Mir van, yet, in complying with it, I
               shall, for her own sake, be as concise as I possibly can; since the cruel
               transactions which preceded the birth of my ward, can afford no entertainment to a
               mind so humane as her's. </p>
            <p> Your Ladyship may probably have heard, that I had the honour to accompany Mr.
               Evelyn, the grand-father of my young charge, when upon his travels, in capacity of
               tutor. His unhappy mar riage, immediately upon his return to England, with Madame
               Duval, then a waiting-girl at a ta vern, contrary to the advice and entreaties of all
               his friends, among whom I was myself the most ur gent to dissuade him, induced him to
               abandon his native land, and fix his abode in France. Thither he was followed by
               shame and repentance; feelings <pb n="5"/> which his heart was not formed to support:
               for, notwithstanding he had been too weak to resist the allurements of beauty, which
               nature, though a niggard to her of every other boon, had with a la vish hand bestowed
               on his wife; yet he was a young man of excellent character, and, till thus unac
               countably infatuated, of unblemished conduct. He survived this ill-judged marriage
               but two years. Upon his death-bed, with an unsteady hand, he wrote me the following
               note: </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "My friend! forget your resentment, in favour of your humanity;—a
                  father, trembling for the welfare of his child, bequeaths her to your care.—O
                  Villars! hear! pity! and relieve me!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> Had my circumstances permitted, I should have answered these words by an immediate
               journey to Paris; but I was obliged to act by the agency of a friend, who was upon
               the spot, and present at the opening of the will. </p>
            <p> Mr. Evelyn left to me a legacy of a thousand pounds, and the sole guardianship of
               his daughter's person till her eighteenth year, conjuring me, in the most affecting
               terms, to take the charge of her education till she was able to act with propriety
               for herself; but in regard to fortune, he left her wholly dependent on her mother, to
               whose tenderness he earnestly recommended her. </p>
            <p> Thus, though he would not, to a woman low bred and illiberal as Mrs. Evelyn, trust
               the mind and morals of his daughter, he nevertheless thought proper to secure to her
               that respect and duty which, from her own child, were certainly her due; but,
               unhappily, it never occurred to him that the mo ther, on her part, could fail in
               affection or justice. </p>
            <p> Miss Evelyn, Madam, from the second to the eighteenth year of her life, was brought
               up under <pb n="6"/> my care, and, except when at school, under my roof. I need not
               speak to your Ladyship of the virtues of that excellent young creature. She loved me
               as her father; nor was Mrs. Villars less valued by her; while to me she became so
               dear, that her loss was little less afflicting to me than that which I have since
               sustained of Mrs. Villars herself. </p>
            <p> At that period of her life we parted; her mo ther, then married to Monsieur Duval,
               sent for her to Paris. How often have I since regretted that I did not accompany her
               thither! protected and supported by me, the misery and disgrace which awaited her,
               might, perhaps, have been avoided. But—to be brief, Madame Duval, at the instiga tion
               of her husband, earnestly, or rather tyran nically, endeavoured to effect an union
               between Miss Evelyn and one of his nephews. And, when she found her power inadequate
               to her attempt, enraged at her non-compliance, she treated her with the grossest
               unkindness, and threatened her with poverty and ruin. </p>
            <p> Miss Evelyn, to whom wrath and violence had hitherto been strangers, soon grew weary
               of this usage; and rashly, and without a witness, con sented to a private marriage
               with Sir John Bel mont, a very profligate young man, who had but too successfully
               found means to insinuate himself into her favour. He promised to conduct her to
               England—he did.—O, Madam, you know the rest!—Disappointed of the fortune he expect
               ed, by the inexorable rancour of the Duvals, he infamously burnt the certificate of
               their marriage, and denied that they had ever been united! </p>
            <p> She flew to me for protection. With what mixed transports of joy and anguish did I
               again <pb n="7"/> see her! By my advice she endeavoured to procure proofs of her
               marriage;—but in vain: her cre dulity had been no match for his art. </p>
            <p> Every body believed her innocent, from the guiltless tenor of her unspotted youth,
               and from the known libertinism of her barbarous betrayer. Yet her sufferings were too
               acute for her tender frame, and the same moment that gave birth to her infant, put an
               end at once to the sorrows and the life of its mother. </p>
            <p> The rage of Madame Duval at her elopement, abated not while this injured victim of
               cruelty yet drew breath. She probably intended, in time, to have pardoned her, but
               time was not allowed. When she was informed of her death, I have been told, that the
               agonies of grief and remorse, with which she was seized, occasioned her a severe fit
               of illness. But, from the time of her recovery to the date of her letter to your
               Ladyship, I had ne ver heard that she manifested any desire to be made acquainted
               with the circumstances which attended the death of Lady-Belmont, and the birth of her
               helpless child. </p>
            <p> That child, Madam, shall never, while life is lent me, know the loss she has
               sustained. I have cherished, succoured, and supported her, from her earliest infancy
               to her sixteenth year; and so amply has she repaid my care and affection, that my
               fondest wish is now bounded in the desire of bestowing her on one who may be sensible
               of her worth, and then sinking to eternal rest in her arms. </p>
            <p> Thus it has happened that the education of the father, daughter, and grand-daughter
               has devolved on me. What infinite misery have the two first caused me! Should the
               fate of the dear survivor be <pb n="8"/> equally adverse, how wretched will be the
               end of my cares—the end of my days! </p>
            <p> Even had Madame Duval merited the charge she claims, I fear my fortitude would have
               been unequal to such a parting; but, being such as she is, not only my affection, but
               my humanity re coils, at the barbarous idea of deserting the sacred trust reposed in
               me. Indeed, I could but ill sup port her former yearly visits to the respectable
               mansion at Howard Grove; pardon me, dear Ma dam, and do not think me insensible of
               the honour which your Ladyship's condescension confers upon us both; but so deep is
               the impression which the misfortunes of her mother have made on my heart, that she
               does not, even for a moment, quit my sight, without exciting apprehensions and
               terrors which almost overpower me. Such, Madam, is my ten derness, and such my
               weakness! But she is the only tie I have upon earth, and I trust to your Ladyship's
               goodness not to judge of my feelings with severity. </p>
            <p> I beg leave to present my humble respects to Mrs. and Miss Mirvan; and have the
               honour to be, </p>

               <salute>Dear and Rev. Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p> YOUR last letter gave me infinite pleasure: after so long and tedious an illness,
               how grateful to yourself and to your friends must be your return ing health! You have
               the hearty wishes of every individual of this place for its continuance and in
               crease. </p>
            <p> Will you not think I talk advantage of your ac knowledged recovery, if I once more
               venture to mention your pupil and Howard Grove together? Yet you must remember the
               patience with which we submitted to your desire of not parting with her during the
               bad state of your health, though it was with much reluctance we forbore to solicit
               her company. My grand-daughter, in particular, has scarce been able to repress her
               eagerness to again meet the friend of her infancy; and for my own part, it is very
               strongly my wish to manifest the regard which I had for the unfortunate Lady Bel
               mont, by proving serviceable to her child; which seems to me the best respect that
               can be paid to her memory. Permit me, therefore, to lay before you a plan which Mrs.
               Mirvan and I have formed, in consequence of your restoration to health. </p>
            <p> I would not frighten you;—but do you think you could bear to part with your young
               companion for two or three months? Mrs. Mirvan proposes to <pb n="10"/> spend the
               ensuing spring in London, whither, for the first time, my grandchild will accompany
               her: Now, my good friend, it is very earnestly their wish to enlarge and enliven
               their party by the ad dition of your amiable ward, who would share, equally with her
               own daughter, the care and at tention of Mrs. Mirvan. Do not start at this pro posal;
               it is time that she should see something of the world. When young people are too
               rigidly sequestered from it, their lively and romantic ima ginations paint it to them
               as a paradise of which they have been beguiled; but when they are shown it properly,
               and in due time, they see it such as it really is, equally shared by pain and
               pleasure, hope and disappointment. </p>
            <p> You have nothing to apprehend from her meet ing with Sir John Belmont, as that
               abandoned man is now abroad, and not expected home this year. </p>
            <p> Well, my good Sir, what say you to our scheme? I hope it will meet with your
               approbation; but if it should not, be assured I can never be dis pleased at any
               decision made by one who is so much respected and esteemed as yourself by, </p>

            <p> I AM grieved, Madam, to appear obstinate, and I blush to incur the imputation of
               selfishness. In detaining my young charge thus long with myself in the country, I
               consulted not solely my own in clination. Destined, in all probability, to possess a
               very moderate fortune, I wished to contract her views to something within it. The
               mind is but too naturally prone to pleasure, but too easily yield ed to dissipation:
               it has been my study to guard her against their delusions, by preparing her to ex
               pect,—and to despise them. But the time draws on for experience and observation to
               take place of instruc tion: if I have, in some measure, rendered her capable of using
               the one with discretion, and mak ing the other with improvement, I shall rejoice
               myself with the assurance of having largely con tributed to her welfare. She is now
               of an age that happiness is eager to attend,—let her then enjoy it! I commit her to
               the protection of your Lady ship, and only hope she may be found worthy half the
               goodness I am satisfied she will meet with at your hospitable mansion. </p>
            <p> Thus far, Madam, I chearfully submit to your desire. In confiding my ward to the
               care of Lady Howard, I can feel no uneasiness from her absence, but what will arise
               from the loss of her company, since I shall be as well convinced of her safety, as if
               she were under my own roof;—but, can your Ladyship be serious in proposing to
               introduce her to the gaieties of a London life? Permit me to <pb n="12"/> ask, for
               what end, or what purpose? A youthful mind is seldom totally free from ambition; to
               curb that, is the first step to contentment, since to di minish expectation, is to
               increase enjoyment. I apprehend nothing more than too much raising her hopes and her
               views, which the natural vivacity of her disposition would render but too easy to
               effect. The town acquaintance of Mrs. Mirvan are all in the circle of high life; this
               artless young creature, with too much beauty to escape notice, has too much
               sensibility to be indifferent to it; but she has too little wealth to be sought with
               propriety by men of the fashionable world. </p>
            <p> Consider, Madam, the peculiar cruelty of her situation; only child of a wealthy
               baronet, whose person she has never seen, whose character she has reason to abhor,
               and whose name she is forbidden to claim; entitled as she is to lawfully inherit his
               fortune and estate, is there any probability that he will <hi>properly</hi> own her?
               And while he continues to persevere in disavowing his marriage with Miss Evelyn, she
               shall never, at the expence of her mo ther's honour, receive a part of her right, as
               the donation of his bounty. </p>
            <p> And as to Mr. Evelyn's estate, I have no doubt but that Madame Duval and her
               relations will dis pose of it among themselves. </p>
            <p> It seems, therefore, as if this deserted child, though legally heiress to two large
               fortunes, must owe all her rational expectations to adoption and friendship. Yet her
               income will be such as may make her happy, if she is disposed to be so in pri vate
               life; though it will by no means allow her to enjoy the luxury of a London fine lady. </p>
            <p> Let Miss Mirvan, then, Madam, shine in all the splendor of high life, but suffer my
               child still <pb n="13"/> to enjoy the pleasures of humble retirement, with a mind to
               which greater views are unknown. </p>
            <p> I hope this reasoning will be honoured with your approbation; and I have yet another
               motive that has some weight with me; I would not wil lingly give offence to any human
               being, and surely Madame Duval might accuse me of injustice, if, while I refuse to
               let her grand-daughter wait upon her, I consent to her joining a party of pleasure to
               London. </p>
            <p> In sending her to Howard Grove, not one of these scruples arise; and therefore Mrs.
               Clinton, a most worthy woman, formerly her nurse, and now my housekeeper, shall
               attend her thither next week. </p>
            <p> Though I have always called her by the name of Anville, and reported in this
               neighbourhood that her father, my intimate friend, left her to my guardianship, yet I
               have thought it necessary to let her be herself acquainted with the melancholy
               circumstances attending her birth; for, though I am very desirous of guarding her
               from curiosity and impertinence, by concealing her name, fa mily, and story, yet I
               would not leave it in the power of charce, to shock her gentle nature with a tale of
               so much sorrow. </p>
            <p> You must not, Madam, expect too much from my pupil. She is quite a little rustic,
               and knows nothing of the world; and though her education has been the best I could
               bestow in this retired place, to which Dorchester, the nearest town, is seven miles
               distant, yet I shall not be surprised if you should discover in her a thousand
               deficiencies of which I have never dreamt. She must be very much altered since she
               was last at Howard Grove,—but I will say nothing of her; I leave her to your <pb

            </opener>
            <p> THE solemn manner in which you have com mitted your child to my care, has in some
               mea sure dampt the pleasure which I receive from the trust, as it makes me fear that
               you suffer from your compliance, in which case I shall very sin cerely blame myself
               for the earnestness with which I have requested this favour; but remember, my good
               Sir, she is within a few days summons, and be assured I will not detain her a moment
               longer than you wish. </p>
            <p>You desire my opinion of her.</p>
            <p> She is a little angel! I cannot wonder that you sought to monopolize her. Neither
               ought you, at finding it impossible. </p>
            <p> Her face and person answer my most refined ideas of complete beauty: and this,
               though a subject of praise less important to you, or to me, than any other, is yet so
               striking, it is not possible to pass it unnoticed. Had I not known from whom she
               received her education, I should, at first sight of so perfect a face, have been in
               pain for her understanding; since it has been long and justly remarked, that folly
               has ever sought alli ance with beauty. </p>
            <p> She has the same gentleness in her manners, the same natural grace in her motions,
               that I formerly so much admired in her mother. Her character seems truly ingenuous
               and simple; and, at the <pb n="16"/> same time that nature hus blessed her with an ex
               cellent understanding, and great quickness of parts, she has a certain air of
               inexperience and in nocency that is extremely interesting. </p>
            <p> You have no reason to regret the retirement in which she has lived; since that
               politeness which is acquired by an acquaintance with high life, is in her so well
               supplied by a natural desire of ob liging, joined to a deportment infinitely
               engaging. </p>
            <p> I observe with great satisfaction a growing affec tion between this amiable girl and
               my grand-daugh ter, whose heart is as free from selfishness or con ceit, as that of
               her young friend is from all guile. Their attachment may be mutually useful, since
               much is to be expected from emulation, where nothing is to be feared from envy. I
               would have them love each other as sisters, and reciprocally supply the place of that
               tender and happy relati onship to which neither of them have a natural claim. </p>
            <p> Be satisfied, my good Sir, that your child shall meet with the same attention as our
               own. We all join in most hearty wishes for your health and happiness, and in

            <opener>

            <p> BE not alarmed, my worthy friend, at my so speedily troubling you again; I seldom
               use the ceremony of waiting for answers, or writing with any regularity, and I have
               at present immediate occasion for begging your patience. </p>
            <p> Mrs. Mirvan has just received a letter from her long-absent husband, containing the
               welcome news of his hoping to reach London by the be ginning of next week. My
               daughter and the Captain have been separated almost seven years, and it would
               therefore be needless to say what joy, surprise, and consequently confusion, his, at
               present, unexpected return has caused at Howard Grove. Mrs. Mirvan, you cannot doubt,
               will go instantly to town to meet him; her daughter is under a thousand obligations
               to attend her; I grieve that her mother cannot. </p>
            <p> And now, my good Sir, I almost blush to pro ceed;—but, tell me, may I ask—will you
               permit—that your child may accompany them? Do not think us unreasonable, but consider
               the many in ducements which conspire to make London the happiest place at present she
               can be in. The joyful occasion of the journey; the gaiety of the whole party; opposed
               to the dull life she must lead if left here, with a solitary old woman for her sole
               companion, while she so well knows the chearfulness and felicity enjoyed by the rest
               of the family,—are circumstances that seem to merit <pb n="18"/> your consideration.
               Mrs. Mirvan desires me to assure you, that one week is all she asks, as she is
               certain that the Captain, who hates London, will be eager to revisit. Howard Grove:
               and Maria is so very earnest in wishing to have the company of her friend, that, if
               you are inexora ble, she will be deprived of half the pleasure she otherwise hopes to
               receive. </p>
            <p> However, I will not, my good Sir, deceive you into an opinion that they intend to
               live in a retired manner, as that cannot be fairly expected. But you have no reason
               to be uneasy concerning Madame Duval; she has no correspondent in England, and only
               gains intelligence by common report. She must be a stranger to the name your child
               bears; and, even should she hear of this excursion, so short a time as a week, or
               less, spent in town upon so particular an occasion, though previous to their meeting,
               cannot be con strued into disrespect to herself. </p>
            <p> Mrs. Mirvan desires me to assure you, that if you will oblige her, her <hi>two</hi>
               children shall equally share her time and her attention. She has sent a commission to
               a friend in town to take a house for her, and while she waits for an answer con
               cerning it, I shall for one from you to our pe tition. However, your child is writing
               herself, and that, I doubt not, will more avail than all we can possibly urge. </p>
            <p> My daughter desires her best compliments to you, <hi>if,</hi> she says, you will
               grant her request, but <hi>not else.</hi>
            </p>
            <p> Adieu, my dear Sir,—we all hope every thing from your goodness. </p>

            <p> THIS house seems to be the house of joy; every face wears a smile, and a laugh is at
               every body's service. It is quite amusing to walk about, and see the general
               confusion; a room leading to the garden is fitting up for Captain Mirvan's study.
               Lady Howard does not sit a moment in a place; Miss Mirvan is making caps; every body
               so busy!—such flying from room to room!—so many orders given, and retracted, and
               given again!—nothing but hurry and perturbation. </p>
            <p> Well but, my dear Sir, I am desired to make a request to you. I hope you will not
               think me an incroacher; Lady Howard insists upon my writing!—yet I hardly know how to
               go on; a petition implies a want,—and have you left me one? No, indeed. </p>
            <p> I am half ashamed of myself for beginning this letter. But these dear ladies are so
               pressing—I cannot, for my life, resist wishing for the pleasures they offer
               me,—provided you do not dis approve them. </p>
            <p> They are to make a very short stay in town. The captain will meet them in a day or
               two. Mrs. Mirvan and her sweet daughter both go;—what a happy party! Yet I am not
                  <hi>very</hi> eager to accom pany them: at least, I shall be very well con tented
               to remain where I am, if you desire that I should. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20"/> Assured, my dearest Sir, of your goodness, your bounty, and your
               indulgent kindness, ought I to form a wish that has not your sanction? Decide for me,
               therefore, without the least apprehen sion that I shall be uneasy, or discontented.
               While I am yet in suspense, perhaps I may <hi>hope,</hi> but I am most certain, that
               when you have once determined, I shall not repine. </p>
            <p> They tell me that London is now in full splen dour. Two Play-houses are open,—the
               Opera-House,—Ranelagh,—the Pantheon.—You see I have learned all their names. However,
               pray don't suppose that I make any point of going, for I shall hardly sigh to see
               them depart without me; though I shall probably never meet with such ano ther
               opportunity. And, indeed, their domestic happiness will be so great,—it is natural to
               wish to partake of it. </p>
            <p> I believe I am bewitched! I made a resolution when I began, that I would not be
               urgent; but my pen—or rather my thoughts, will not suffer me to keep it—for I
               acknowledge, I must acknowledge, I cannot help wishing for your permission. </p>
            <p> I almost repent already that I have made this confession; pray forget that you have
               read it, if this journey is displeasing to you. But I will not write any longer; for
               the more I think of this affair, the less indifferent to it I find my self. </p>
            <p> Adieu, my most honoured, most reverenced, most beloved father! for by what other
               name can I call you? I have no happiness or sorrow, no hope or fear, but what your
               kindness bestows, or your displeasure may cause. You will not, I am sure, send a
               refusal, without reasons unanswerable, and <pb n="21"/> therefore I shall chearfully
               acquiesce. Yet I hope—I hope you will be able to permit me to go. </p>

            <p> TO resist the urgency of entreaty, is a power which I have not yet acquired: I aim
               not at an au thority which deprives you of liberty, yet I would fain guide myself by

               preserve, and strengthen you! To That, my love, will I daily offer prayers for your
               felicity; O may it guard, watch over you! defend you from danger, save you from
               distress, and keep vice as distant from your person as from your heart! And to Me,

            <p> THIS moment arrived. Just going to Drury-Lane Theatre. The celebrated Mr. Garrick
               per forms Ranger. I am quite in extacy. So is Miss Mirvan. How fortunate, that he
               should happen to play! We would not let Mrs. Mirvan rest till she consented to go;
               her chief objection was to our dress, for we have had no time to <hi>Londonize</hi>
               our selves; but we teized her into compliance, and so we are to sit in some obscure
               place, that she may not be seen. As to me, I should be alike unknown in the most
               conspicuous or most private part of the house. </p>
            <p> I can write no more now. I have hardly time to breathe—only just this, the houses
               and streets are not quite so superb as I expected. However, I have seen nothing yet,
               so I ought not to judge. </p>
            <p> Well, adieu, my dearest Sir, for the present; I could not forbear writing a few
               words instantly on my arrival; though I suppose my letter of thanks for your consent
               is still on the road. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23"/> Saturday Night. </p>
            <p> O my dear Sir, in what raptures am I returned! Well may Mr. Garrick be so
               celebrated, so univer sally admired—I had not any idea of so great a performer. </p>
            <p> Such ease! such vivacity in his manner! such grace in his motions! such fire and
               meaning in his eyes!—I could hardly believe he had studied a written part, for every
               word seemed spoke from the impulse of the moment. </p>
            <p> His action—at once so graceful and so free!—his voice—so clear, so melodious, yet so
               wonder fully various in its tones—such animation!—every look <hi>speaks!</hi>
            </p>
            <p> I would have given the world to have had the whole play acted over again. And when
               he danced—O how I envied Clarinda! I almost wished to have jumped on the stage and
               joined them. </p>
            <p> I am afraid you will think me mad, so I won't say any more; yet I really believe Mr.
               Garrick would make you mad too, if you could see him. I intend to ask Mrs. Mirvan to
               go to the play every night while we stay in town. She is extremely kind to me, and
               Maria, her charming daughter, is the sweetest girl in the world. </p>
            <p> I shall write to you every evening all that passes in the day, and that in the same
               manner as, if I could see, I should tell you. </p>
            <p>Sunday.</p>
            <p> This morning we went to Portland chapel, and afterwards we walked in the Mall in St.
               James's Park, which by no means answered my expectati ons: it is a long straight
               walk, of dirty gravel, ve ry uneasy to the feet; and at each end, instead of an open
               prospect, nothing is to be seen but houses <pb n="24"/> built of brick. When Mrs.
               Mirvan pointed out the <hi>Palace</hi> to me—I think I was never much more surprised. </p>
            <p> However the walk was very agreeable to us; every body looked gay, and seemed
               pleased, and the ladies were so much dressed, that Miss Mirvan and I could do nothing
               but look at them. Mrs. Mirvan met several of her friends. No wonder, for I never saw
               so many people assembled together before. I looked about for some of <hi>my</hi>
               acquaint ance, but in vain, for I saw not one person that I knew, which is very odd,
               for all the world seemed there. </p>
            <p> Mrs. Mirvan says we are not to walk in the Park again next Sunday, even if we should
               be in town, because there is better company in Kensing ton Gardens. But really if you
               had seen how much every body was dressed, you would not think that possible. </p>
            <p> We are to go this evening to a private ball, gi ven by Mrs. Stanley, a very
               fashionable lady of Mrs. Mirvan's acquaintance. </p>
            <p> We have been a <hi>shopping,</hi> as Mrs. Mirvan calls it, all this morning, to buy
               silks, caps, gauzes, and so forth. </p>
            <p> The shops are really very entertaining, especially the mercers; there seem to be six
               or seven men be longing to each shop, and every one took care, by bowing and
               smirking, to be noticed; we were con ducted from one to another, and carried from
               room to room, with so much ceremony, that at first I was almost afraid to follow. </p>
            <p> I thought I should never have chosen a silk, for they produced so many, I knew not
               which to fix upon, and they recommended them all so strongly that I fancy they
               thought I only wanted persuasion <pb n="25"/> to buy every thing they shewed me. And,
               indeed, they took so much trouble, that I was almost asha med I could not. </p>
            <p> At the milliners, the ladies we met were so much dressed, that I should rather have
               imagined they were making visits than purchases. But what most diverted me was, that
               we were more frequently served by men than by women; and such men! so finical, so
               affected! they seemed to understand eve ry part of a woman's dress better than we do
               our selves; and they recommended caps and ribbands with an air of so much importance,
               that I wished to ask them how long they had left off wearing them! </p>
            <p> The dispatch with which they work in these great shops is amazing, for they have
               promised me a com pleat suit of linen against the evening. </p>
            <p> I have just had my hair dressed. You can't think how oddly my head feels; full of
               powder and black pins, and a great <hi>cushion</hi> on the top of it. I believe you
               would hardly know me, for my face looks quite different from what it did before my
               hair was dressed. When I shall be able to make use of a comb for myself I cannot
               tell, for my hair is so much entangled, <hi>frizzled</hi> they call it, that I fear
               it will be very difficult. </p>
            <p> I am half afraid of this ball to-night, for, you know, I have never danced but at
               school; however, Miss Mirvan says there is nothing in it. Yet I wish it was over. </p>
            <p> Adieu, my dear Sir; pray excuse the wretched stuff I write, perhaps I may improve by
               being in this town, and then my letters will be less unwor thy your reading. Mean

            <p> I HAVE a vast deal to say, and shall give all this morning to my pen. As to my plan
               of writ ing every evening the adventures of the day, I find it impracticable; for the
               diversions here are so very late, that if I begin my letters after them, I could not
               go to bed at all. </p>
            <p> We past a most extraordinary evening. A <hi> pri vate </hi> ball this was called, so
               I expected to have seen about four or five couple; but, Lord, my dear Sir, I believe
               I saw half the world! Two very large rooms were full of company; in one, were cards
               for the elderly ladies, and in the other, were the dancers. My mamma Mirvan, for she
               always calls me her child, said she would sit with Ma ria and me till we were
               provided with partners, and then join the card players. </p>
            <p> The gentlemen, as they passed and repassed, looked as if they thought we were quite
               at their disposal, and only waiting for the honour of their commands; and they
               sauntered about in a careless indolent manner, as if with a view to keep us in
               suspense. I don't speak of this in regard to Miss Mirvan and myself only, but to the
               ladies in ge neral; and I thought it so provoking, that I de termined, in my own
               mind, that, far from humour ing <pb n="27"/> such airs, I would rather not dance at
               all, than with any one who should seem to think me ready to accept the first partner
               who would con descend to take me. </p>
            <p> Not long after, a young man, who had for some time looked at us with a kind of
               negligent imper tinence, advanced, on tiptoe, towards me; he had a set smile on his
               face, and his dress was so fop pish, that I really believe he even wished to be
               stared at; and yet he was very ugly. </p>
            <p> Bowing almost to the ground, with a sort of swing, and waving his hand with the
               greatest con ceit, after a short and silly pause, he said, <q rend="inline"> "Ma
                  dam—may I presume?"— </q> and stopt, offering to take my hand, I drew it back, but
               could scarce forbear laughing. <q rend="inline">"Allow me, Madam,"</q> (con tinued
               he, affectedly breaking off every half mo ment) <q rend="inline"> "the honour and
                  happiness—if I am not so unhappy as to address you too late—to have the happiness
                  and honour—" </q>
            </p>
            <p> Again he would have taken my hand, but, bow ing my head, I begged to be excused, and
               turned to Miss Mirvan to conceal my laughter. He then desired to know if I had
               already engaged myself to some more fortunate man? I said No, and that I believed I
               should not dance at all. He would keep himself, he told me, disengaged, in hopes I
               should relent; and then, uttering some ridiculous speeches of sorrow and
               disappointment, though his face still wore the same invariable smile, he re treated. </p>
            <p> It so happened, as we have since recollected, that during this little dialogue, Mrs.
               Mirvan was con versing with the lady of the house. And very soon after another
               gentleman, who seemed about six and-twenty years old, gayly, but not soppishly, <pb
                  n="28"/> dressed, and indeed extremely handsome, with an air of mixed politeness
               and gallantry, desired to know if I was engaged, or would honour him with my hand. So
               he was pleased to say, though I am sure I know not what honour he could re ceive from
               me; but these sort of expressions, I find, are used as words of course, without any
               dis tinction of persons, or study of propriety. </p>
            <p> Well, I bowed, and I am sure I coloured; for indeed I was frightened at the thoughts
               of dancing before so many people, all strangers, and, which was worse, <hi>with</hi>
               a stranger; however, that was unavoidable, for though I looked round the room several
               times, I could not see one person that I knew. And so, he took my hand, and led me to
               join in the dance. </p>
            <p> The minuets were over before we arrived, for we were kept late by the milliner's
               making us wait for our things. </p>
            <p> He seemed very desirous of entering into con versation with me; but I was seized
               with such a panic, that I could hardly speak a word, and no thing but the shame of so
               soon changing my mind, prevented my returning to my seat, and declining to dance at
               all. </p>
            <p> He appeared to be surprised at my terror, which I believe was but too apparent:
               however, he asked no questions, though I fear he must think it very odd; for I did
               not choose to tell him it was owing to my never before dancing but with a school
               girl. </p>
            <p> His conversation was sensible and spirited; his air and address were open and noble;
               his manners gentle, attentive, and infinitely engaging; his per son is all elegance,
               and his countenance the most animated and expressive I have ever seen. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29"/> In a short time we were joined by Miss Mirvan, who stood next couple to
               us. But how was I startled, when she whispered me that my partner was a nobleman!
               This gave me a new alarm; how will he be provoked, thought I, when he finds what a
               simple rustic he has honoured with his choice! one whose ignorance of the world makes
               her perpetually fear doing something wrong! </p>
            <p> That he should be so much my superior every way, quite disconcerted me; and you will
               suppose my spirits were not much raised, when I heard a lady in passing us, say, <q
                  rend="inline">"This is the most difficult dance I ever saw."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O dear, then,"</q> cried Maria to her partner, <q rend="inline"
                  >"with your leave, I'll sit down till the next."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"So will I too, then,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline">"for I am sure
                  I can hardly stand."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"But you must speak to your partner first,"</q> answered she; for he
               had turned aside to talk with some gentlemen. However, I had not sufficient courage
               to address him, and so away we all three tript, and seated ourselves at another end
               of the room. </p>
            <p> But, unfortunately for me, Miss Mirvan soon after suffered herself to be prevailed
               upon to at tempt the dance; and just as she rose to go, she cried, <q rend="inline">
                  "My dear, yonder is your partner, Lord Orville, walking about the room in search
                  of you." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Don't leave me, then, dear girl!"</q> cried I; but she was obliged
               to go. And then I was more uneasy than ever; I would have given the world to have
               seen Mrs. Mirvan, and begged of her to make my apologies; for what, thought I, can I
               possibly say for myself in excuse for running away? he must either conclude me a
               fool, or half mad, for any one brought up in the great world, and <pb n="30"/>
               accustomed to its ways, can have no idea of such sort of fears as mine. </p>
            <p> I was in the utmost confusion, when I observed that he was every where seeking me,
               with apparent perplexity and surprise; but when, at last, I saw him move towards the
               place where I sat, I was ready to sink with shame and distress. I found it absolutely
               impossible to keep my seat, because I could not think of a word to say for myself,
               and so I rose, and walked hastily towards the card-room, resolving to stay with Mrs.
               Mirvan the rest of the evening, and not to dance at all. But before I could find her,
               Lord Orville saw and approached me. </p>
            <p> He begged to know if I was not well? You may easily imagine how much I was confused.
               I made no answer, but hung my head, like a fool, and looked on my fan. </p>
            <p> He then, with an air the most respectfully se rious, asked if he had been so unhappy
               as to of fend me? </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No, indeed!"</q> cried I: and then, in hopes of changing the
               discourse, and preventing his further inquiries, I desired to know if he had seen the
               young lady who had been conversing with me? </p>
            <p> No;—but would I honour him with my com mands to see for her? </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O by no means!"</q>
            </p>
            <p> Was there any other person with whom I wished to speak? </p>
            <p> I said <hi>no,</hi> before I knew I had answered at all. </p>
            <p> Should he have the pleasure of bringing me any refreshment? </p>
            <p>I bowed, almost involuntarily. And away he flew.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31"/> I was quite ashamed at being so troublesome, and so much <hi>above</hi>
               myself as these seeming airs made me appear; but indeed I was too much confused to
               think or act with any consistency. </p>
            <p> If he had not been swift as lightning, I don't know whether I should not have stolen
               away again; but he returned in a moment. When I had drank a glass of lemonade, he
               hoped, he said, that I would again honour him with my hand, as a new dance was just
               begun. I had not the presence of mind to say a single word, and so I let him once
               more lead me to the place I had left. </p>
            <p> Shocked to find how silly, how childish a part I had acted, my former fears of
               dancing before such a company, and with such a partner, returned more forcibly than
               ever. I suppose he perceived my uneasiness, for he intreated me to sit down again, if
               dancing was disagreeable to me. But I was quite satisfied with the folly I had
               already shewn, and therefore declined his offer, though I was really scarce able to
               stand. </p>
            <p> Under such conscious disadvantages, you may easily imagine, my dear Sir, how ill I
               acquitted myself. But, though I both expected and de served to find him very much
               mortified and dis pleased at his ill fortune in the choice he had made, yet, to my
               very great relief, he appeared to be even contented, and very much assisted and en
               couraged me. These people in high life have too much presence of mind, I believe, to
                  <hi>seem</hi> discon certed, or out of humour, however they may feel; for had I
               been the person of the most consequence in the room, I could not have met with more
               at tention and respect. </p>
            <p> When the dance was over, seeing me still very much slurried, he led me to a seat,
               saying that he <pb n="32"/> would not suffer me to fatigue myself from po liteness. </p>
            <p> And then, if my capacity, or even if my spirits had been better, in how animated a
               conver <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/> sation might I have been engaged! It was then that
               I saw the rank of Lord Orville was his least recommendation, his understanding and
               his man ners being far more distinguished. His remarks upon the company in general
               were so apt, so just, so lively, I am almost surprised myself that they did not
               re-animate me; but indeed I was too well convinced of the ridiculous part I had
               myself played before so nice an observer, to be able to enjoy his pleasantry: so
               self-compassion gave me feeling for others. Yet I had not the courage to attempt
               either to defend them, or to rally in my turn, but listened to him in silent
               embarrass ment. </p>
            <p> When he found this, he changed the subject, and talked of public places, and public
               performers; but he soon discovered that I was totally igno rant of them. </p>
            <p> He then, very ingeniously, turned the dis course to the amusements and occupations
               of the country. </p>
            <p> It now struck me, that he was resolved to try whether or not I was capable of
               talking upon <hi>any</hi> subject. This put so great a constraint upon my thoughts,
               that I was unable to go further than a monosyllable, and not even so far, when I
               could possibly avoid it. </p>
            <p> We were sitting in this manner, he conversing with all gaiety, I looking down with
               all foolish ness, when that fop who had first asked me to dance, with a most
               ridiculous solemnity, approach ed, and after a profound bow or two, said, <q
                  rend="inline"> "I <pb n="33"/> humbly beg pardon, Madam,—and of you too, my
                  Lord,—for breaking in upon such agreeable conversation—which must, doubtless, be
                  much more delectable—than what I have the honour to offer—but—" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I interrupted him—I blush for my folly,—with laughing; yet I could not help it, for,
               added to the man's stately foppishness, (and he actually took snuff between every
               three words) when I looked round at Lord Orville, I saw such ex treme surprise in his
               face,—the cause of which appeared so absurd, that I could not for my life preserve my
               gravity. </p>
            <p> I had not laughed before from the time I had left Miss Mirvan, and I had much better
               have cried then; Lord Orville actually stared at me; the beau, I know not his name,
               looked quite enraged. <q rend="inline">"Refrain—Madam,"</q> (said he, with an
               important air,) <q rend="inline"> "a few moments refrain!—I have but a sentence to
                  trouble you with.—May I know to what accident I must attribute not having the
                  honour of your hand?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Accident, Sir!"</q> repeated I, much asto nished. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Yes, accident, Madam—for surely,—I must take the liberty to
                  observe—pardon me, Madam, it ought to be no common one—that should tempt a lady—so
                  young a one too,—to be guilty of ill manners." </q>
            </p>
            <p> A confused idea now for the first time entered my head, something I had heard of the
               rules of assemblies; but I was never at one before,—I have only danced at school,—and
               so giddy and heedless I was, that I had not once considered the impropriety of
               refusing one partner, and after wards accepting another. I was thunderstruck at <pb
                  n="34"/> the recollection: but, while these thoughts were rushing into my head,
               Lord Orville, with some warmth, said, <q rend="inline"> "This lady, Sir, is incapable
                  of meriting such an accusation!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> The creature—for I am very angry with him,—made a low bow, and with a grin the most
               malicious I ever saw, <q rend="inline"> "My Lord, said he, far be it from me to
                     <hi>accuse</hi> the lady, for having the discernment to distinguish and
                  prefer—the superior attractions of your Lordship." </q>
            </p>
            <p>Again he bowed, and walked off.</p>
            <p> Was ever any thing so provoking? I was ready to die with shame. <q rend="inline"
                  >"What a coxcomb!"</q> ex claimed Lord Orville; while I, without know ing what I
               did, rose hastily, and moving off, <q rend="inline"> "I can't imagine, cried I, where
                  Mrs. Mirvan has hid herself!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Give me leave to see,"</q> answered he. I bowed and sat down again,
               not daring to meet his eyes; for what must he think of me, between my blunder and the
               supposed preference? </p>
            <p> He returned in a moment, and told me that Mrs. Mirvan was at cards, but would be
               glad to see me; and I went immediately. There was but one chair vacant, so, to my
               great relief, Lord Orville presently left us. I then told Mrs. Mirvan my disasters,
               and she good-naturedly blamed her self for not having better instructed me, but said
               she had taken it for granted that I must know such common customs. However, the man
               may, I think, be satisfied with his pretty speech, and carry his resentment no
               farther. </p>
            <p> In a short time, Lord Orville returned. I con sented, with the best grace I could,
               to go down another dance, for I had had time to recollect myself, and therefore
               resolved to use some exer tion, <pb n="35"/> and, if possible, appear less a fool
               than I hitherto had: for it occurred to me that, insigni ficant as I was, compared to
               a man of his rank and figure, yet, since he had been so unfortunate as to make choice
               of me for a partner, why I should endeavour to make the best of it. </p>
            <p> The dance, however, was short, and he spoke very little; so I had no opportunity of
               putting my re solution in practice. He was satisfied, I suppose, with his former
               successless efforts to draw me out: or, rather, I fancied, he has been inquiring
                  <hi>who I was.</hi> This again disconcerted me, and the spi rits I had determined
               to exert, again failed me. Tired, ashamed, and mortified, I begged to sit down till
               we returned home, which we did soon after. Lord Orville did me the honour to hand me
               to the coach, talking all the way of the honour <hi>I</hi> had done <hi>him!</hi> O
               these fashionable people! </p>
            <p> Well, my dear Sir, was it not a strange even ing? I could not help being thus
               particular, be cause, to me, every thing is so new. But it is now time to conclude. I
               am, with all love and duty, </p>

               <p> THERE is to be no end to the troubles of last night. I have, this moment, between
                  persuasion and laughter, gathered from Maria the most curi ous dialogue that ever
                  I heard. You will, at first, be startled at my vanity; but, my dear Sir, have
                  patience! </p>
               <p> It must have passed while I was sitting with Mrs. Mirvan in the card-room. Maria
                  was taking some refreshment, and saw Lord Orville advanc ing for the same purpose
                  himself; but he did not know her, though she immediately recollected him.
                  Presently after, a very gay-looking man, stepping hastily up to him, cried, <q
                     rend="inline"> "Why, my Lord, what have you done with your lovely partner!"
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> " <hi>Nothing!</hi> " </q> answered Lord Orville, with a smile
                  and a shrug. </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "By Jove, cried the man, she is the most beau tiful creature I
                     ever saw in my life!" </q>
               </p>
               <p> Lord Orville, as he well might, laughed, but answered, <q rend="inline">"Yes, a
                     pretty modest-looking girl."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"O my Lord!"</q> cried the madman, <q rend="inline">"she is an
                     angel!"</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "A <hi>silent</hi> one," </q> returned he. </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "Why ay, my Lord, how stands she as to that? She looks all
                     intelligence and expression." </q>

               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"A poor weak girl!"</q> answered Lord Orville, shaking his head. </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37"/>
                  <q rend="inline">"By Jove,"</q> cried the other, <q rend="inline">"I am glad to
                     hear it!"</q>
               </p>
               <p> At that moment, the same odious creature who had been my former torment, joined
                  them. Ad dressing Lord Orville with great respect, he said, <q rend="inline"> "I
                     beg pardon, my Lord,—if I was—as I fear might be the case—rather too severe in
                     my cen sure of the lady who is honoured with your pro tection—but, my Lord, ill
                     breeding is apt to pro voke a man." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Ill-breeding!"</q> cried my unknown champion, <q rend="inline">
                     "impossible! that elegant face can never be so vile a mask!" </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"O Sir, as to that,"</q> answered he, <q rend="inline"> "you must
                     allow <hi>me</hi> to judge; for though I pay all deference to your opinion—in
                     other things,—yet I hope you will grant—and I appeal to your Lordship also—that
                     I am not totally despicable as a judge of good or ill manners." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"I was so wholly ignorant,"</q> said Lord Orville gravely, <q
                     rend="inline"> "of the provocation you might have had, that I could not but be
                     surprised at your singular resentment." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "It was far from my intention, answered he, to offend your
                     Lordship; but really, for a per son who is nobody, to give herself such airs,—I
                     own I could not command my passions. For, my Lord, though I have made diligent
                     enquiry—I cannot learn who she is." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"By what I can make out,"</q> cried my defender, <q rend="inline"
                     >"she must be a country parson's daughter."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"He! he! he! very good, 'pon honour!"</q> cried the fop,— <q

               </p>
               <p> And then, delighted at his own wit, he laughed, and went away, as I suppose, to
                  repeat it. </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38"/>
                  <q rend="inline">"But what the deuce is all this?</q> demanded the other. </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Why a very foolish affair,"</q> answered Lord Orville; <q
                     rend="inline"> "your Helen first refused this coxcomb, and then—danced with me.
                     This is all I can ga ther of it." </q>

               <p>

                     though I have really fatigued myself with fruitless endeavours to enter tain
                     her, with the most immoveable gravity; but no sooner did Lovel begin his

                     poor beau, and then enjoying his mor tification." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "Ha! ha! ha! why there's some <hi>genius</hi> in that, my Lord,
                     though perhaps rather <hi>rustick.</hi> " </q>
               </p>
               <p> Here Maria was called to dance, and so heard no more. </p>
               <p> Now tell me, my dear Sir, did you ever know any thing more provoking? <q
                     rend="inline"> " <hi>A poor weak girl!</hi> " " <hi>ignorant or
                        mischievous!</hi> " </q> What mortifying words! I'm resolved, however, that
                  I will never again be tempted to go to an assembly. I wish I had been in
                  Dorsetshire. </p>
               <p> Well, after this, you will not be surprised that Lord Orville contented himself
                  with an enquiry after our healths this morning, by his servant, without troubling
                  himself to call; as Miss Mirvan had told me he would: but perhaps it may be only a
                  country custom. </p>
               <p> I would not live here for the world. I don't care how soon we leave town. London
                  soon <pb n="39"/> grows tiresome. I wish the Captain would come Mrs. Mirvan talks
                  of the opera for this evening; however, I am very indifferent about it. </p>

               <p> Well, my dear Sir, I have been pleased, against my will, I could almost say, for
                  I must own I went out in very ill-humour, which I think you can't wonder at: but
                  the music and the singing were charming; they soothed me into a pleasure the most
                  grateful, the best suited to my present disposition in the world. I hope to
                  persuade Mrs. Mirvan to go again on Saturday. I wish the opera was every night. It
                  is, of all entertain ments, the sweetest and most delightful. Some of the songs
                  seemed to melt my very soul. It was what they call a <hi>serious</hi> opera, as
                  the <hi>comic</hi> first singer was ill. </p>
               <p> To-night we go to Ranelagh. If any of those three gentlemen who conversed so
                  freely about me should be there—but I won't think of it. </p>

               <p> Well, my dear Sir, we went to Ranelagh. It is a charming place, and the
                  brilliancy of the lights, on my first entrance, made me almost think I was in some
                  inchanted castle, or fairy palace, for all looked like magic to me. </p>
               <p> The very first person I saw was Lord Orville. I felt so confused!—but he did not
                  see me. After tea, Mrs. Mirvan being tired, Maria and I walked round the room
                  alone. Then again we saw him, standing by the orchestra. We, too, stopt to hear a
                  singer. He bowed to me; I courtsied, and I am sure I coloured. We soon <pb n="40"
                  /> walked on, not liking our situation; however, he did not follow us, and when we
                  past by the orchestra again, he was gone. Afterwards, in the course of the
                  evening, we met him several times, but he was always with some party, and never
                  spoke to us, tho' whenever he chanced to meet my eyes, he condescended to bow. </p>
               <p> I cannot but be hurt at the opinion he enter tains of me. It is true, my own
                  behaviour in curred it—yet is himself the most agreeable, and, seemingly, the most
                  amiable man in the world, and therefore it is, that I am grieved to be thought ill
                  of by him: for of whose esteem ought we to be ambitious, if not of those who most
                  merit our own?—But it is too late to reflect upon this now. Well, I can't help
                  it;—How ever, I think I have done with assemblies! </p>
               <p> This morning was destined for <hi>seeing sights,</hi> auc tions, curious shops,
                  and so forth; but my head ached, and I was not in a humour to be amused, and so I
                  made them go without me, though very unwillingly. They are all kindness. </p>
               <p> And now I am sorry I did not accompany them, for I know not what to do with
                  myself. I had re solved not to go to the play to-night; but I believe I shall. In
                  short, I hardly care whether I do or not. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <p> I thought I had done wrong! Mrs. Mirvan and Maria have been half the town over,
                  and so en tertained!—while I, like a fool, stayed at home to do nothing. And, at
                  an auction in Pall-Mall, who should they meet but Lord Orville! He sat next to Mrs
                  Mirvan, and they talked a great deal <pb n="41"/> together: but she gave me no
                  account of the con versation. </p>
               <p> I may never have such another opportunity of seeing London; I am quite sorry that
                  I was not of the party; but I deserve this mortification, for having indulged my
                  ill-humour. </p>

               <p> Captain Mirvan is arrived. I have not spirits to give an account of his
                  introduction, for he has really shocked me. I do not like him. He seems to be
                  surly, vulgar, and disagreeable. </p>
               <p> Almost the same moment that Maria was pre sented to him, he began some rude jests
                  upon the bad shape of her nose, and called her a tall, ill formed thing. She bore
                  it with the utmost good humour; but that kind and sweet-tempered wo man, Mrs.
                  Mirvan, deserved a better lot. I am amazed she would marry him. </p>
               <p> For my own part, I have been so shy, that I have hardly spoken to him, or he to
                  me. I can not imagine why the family was so rejoiced at his return. If he had
                  spent his whole life abroad, I should have supposed they might rather have been
                  thankful than sorrowful. However, I hope they do not think so ill of him as I do.
                  At least, I am sure they have too much prudence to make it known. </p>

               <p> We have been to the opera, and I am still more pleased than I was on Tuesday. I
                  could have thought myself in paradise, but for the continual talking of the
                  company around me. We sat in the pit, where every body was dressed in so high a
                  style, that, if I had been less delighted with the performance, my eyes would have
                  found me suffi cient entertainment from looking at the ladies. </p>
               <p> I was very glad I did not sit next the Captain, for he could not bear the music,
                  or singers, and was extremely gross in his observations on both. When the opera
                  was over, we went into a place called the coffee-room, where ladies as well as
                  gentlemen assemble. There are all sorts of re freshments, and the company walk
                  about, and <hi>chat,</hi> with the same ease and freedom as in a pri vate room. </p>
               <p> On Monday we go to a ridotto, and on Wed nesday we return to Howard Grove. The

            </opener>
            <p> WE came home from the ridotto so late, or ra ther, so early, that it was not
               possible for me to write. Indeed we did not <hi>go,</hi> you will be fright ened to
               hear it,—till past eleven o'clock: but nobody does. A terrible reverse of the order
               of nature! We sleep with the sun, and wake with the moon. </p>
            <p> The room was very magnificent, the lights and decorations brilliant, and the company
               gay and splendid. But I should have told you, that I made very many objections to
               being of the party, according to the resolution I had formed. How ever, Maria laughed
               me out of my scruples, and so, once again—I went to an assembly. </p>
            <p> Miss Mirvan danced a minuet, but I had not the courage to follow her example. In our
               walks I saw Lord Orville. He was quite alone, but did not observe us. Yet, as he
               seemed of no party, I thought it was not impossible that he might join us; and tho' I
               did not wish much to dance at all,—yet, as I was more acquainted with him than with
               any other person in the room, I must own I could not help thinking it would be
               infinitely more desireable to dance again with him, than with an entire stranger. To
               be sure, after all that had passed, it was very ridiculous to suppose it even
               probable, that Lord Orville would again honour <pb n="44"/> me with his choice; yet I
               am compelled to con fess my absurdity, by way of explaining what fol lows. </p>
            <p> Miss Mirvan was soon engaged; and, presently after, a very fashionable, gay-looking
               man, who seemed about 30 years of age, addressed himself to me, and begged to have
               the honour of dancing with me. Now Maria's partner was a gentleman of Mrs. Mirvan's
               acquaintance; for she had told us it was highly improper for young women to dance
               with strangers, at any public assembly. In deed it was by no means my wish so to do;
               yet I did not like to confine myself from dancing at all; neither did I dare refuse
               this gentleman, as I had done Mr. Lovel, and then, if any acquaint ance should offer,
               accept him: and so, all these reasons combining, induced me to tell him—yet I blush
               to write it to you!—that I was <hi> already en gaged; </hi> by which I meant to keep
               myself at liberty to dance or not, as matters should fall out. </p>
            <p> I suppose my consciousness betrayed my artifice, for he looked at me as if
               incredulous; and, instead of being satisfied with my answer, and leaving me,
               according to my expectation, he walked at my side, and, with the greatest ease
               imaginable, began a conversation, in that free style which only belongs to old and
               intimate acquaintance. But, what was most provoking, he asked me a thousand questions
               concerning <hi>the partner to whom I was engaged.</hi> And, at last, he said, <q
                  rend="inline"> "Is it really possible that a man whom you have honoured with your
                  accept ance, can fail to be at hand to profit from your goodness?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I felt extremely foolish, and begged Mrs. Mir van to lead to a seat, which she very
               obligingly did. The Captain sat next her, and, to my great sur prise, <pb n="45"/>
               this gentleman thought proper to follow, and seat himself next to me. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"What an insensible!"</q> continued he, <q rend="inline"> "why,
                  Madam, you are missing the most delightful dance in the world! The man must be
                  either mad, or a fool.—Which do you incline to think him your self?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Neither, Sir,"</q> answered I, in some confusion. </p>
            <p> He begged my pardon for the freedom of his supposition, saying, <q rend="inline"> "I
                  really was off my guard, from astonishment that any man can be so much and so
                  unaccountably his own enemy. But where, Madam, can he possibly be?—has he left the
                  room?—or has not he been in it?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Indeed, Sir,"</q> said I peevishly, <q rend="inline"> "I know no
                  thing of him." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "I don't wonder that you are disconcerted, Madam, it is really very
                  provoking. The best part of the evening will be absolutely lost. He deserves not
                  that you should wait for him." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I do not, Sir,"</q> said I, <q rend="inline">"and I beg you not
                  to—"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Mortifying, indeed, Madam,"</q> interrupted he, <q rend="inline">
                  "a lady to wait for a gentleman!—O fie!—care less fellow!—what can detain
                  him?—Will you give me leave to seek him?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"If you please, Sir,"</q> answered I, quite terri fied lest Mrs.
               Mirvan should attend to him, for she looked very much surprised at seeing me enter
               into conversation with a stranger. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"With all my heart,"</q> cried he; <q rend="inline">"pray what coat
                  has he on?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Indeed I never looked at it."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Out upon him!"</q> cried he; <q rend="inline"> "What! did he
                  address you in a coat not worth looking at?—What a shabby dog!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46"/> How ridiculous! I really could not help laugh ing, which, I fear,
               encouraged him, for he went on. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Charming creature!—and can you really bear ill usage with so much
                  sweetness?—Can you, <hi>like patience on a monument,</hi> smile in the midst of
                  disappointment?—For my part, though I am not the offended person, my indignation
                  is so great, that I long to kick the fellow round the room!—unless,
                  indeed,—(hesitating and looking earnestly at me,) unless, indeed—it is a partner
                  of your own <hi>creating?</hi> " </q>
            </p>
            <p> I was dreadfully abashed, and could not make any answer. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"But no!"</q> cried he, (again, and with warmth,) <q rend="inline">
                  "it cannot be that you are so cruel! Softness itself is painted in your eyes:—You
                  could not, surely, have the barbarity so wantonly to trifle with my misery?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I turned away from this nonsense, with real disgust. Mrs. Mirvan saw my confusion,
               but was perplexed what to think of it, and I could not ex plain to her the cause,
               lest the captain should hear me. I therefore proposed to walk, she consented, and we
               all rose; but, would you believe it? this man had the assurance to rise too, and walk
               close by my side, as if of my party! </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Now,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline">"I hope we shall see this
                  ingrate.—Is that he?"—</q> pointing to an old man, who was lame, <q rend="inline"
                  >"or that?"</q> And in this manner he asked me of whoever was old or ugly in the
               room. I made no sort of answer; and when he found that I was resolutely silent, and
               walked on, as much as I could, without observing him, he suddenly stamped his foot,
               and cried out, in a pas sion, <q rend="inline">"Fool! idiot! booby!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47"/> I turned hastily toward him: <q rend="inline">"O Madam,"</q> continued
               he, <q rend="inline"> "forgive my vehemence, but I am distracted to think there
                  should exist a wretch who can slight a blessing for which I would forfeit my
                  life!—O! that I could but meet him!—I would soon—But I grow angry: pardon me,
                  Madam, my passions are violent, and your injuries affect me!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I began to apprehend he was a madman, and stared at him with the utmost
               astonishment. <q rend="inline">"I see you are moved, Madam,"</q> said he, <q
                  rend="inline"> "generous creature!—but don't be alarmed, I am cool again, I am
                  indeed,—upon my soul I am,—I entreat you, most lovely of mortals! I entreat you to
                  be easy." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Indeed, Sir,"</q> said I very seriously, <q rend="inline"> "I must
                  insist upon your leaving me; you are quite a stran ger to me, and I am both
                  unused, and averse to your language and your manners." </q>
            </p>
            <p> This seemed to have some effect on him. He made me a low bow, begged my pardon, and
               vowed he would not for the world offend me. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Then, Sir, you must leave me,"</q> cried I. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I am gone, Madam, I am gone!"</q> with a most tragical air; and he
               marched away, a quick pace, out of sight in a moment; but before I had time to
               congratulate myself, he was again at my elbow. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "And could you really let me go, and not be sorry?—Can you see me
                  suffer torments inexpres sible, and yet retain all your favour for that mis creant
                  who flies you?—Ungrateful puppy!—I could bastinado him!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"For Heaven's sake,"</q> my dear, cried Mrs. Mirvan, <q
                  rend="inline">"who is he talking of?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Indeed—I do not know, Madam,"</q> said I, <q rend="inline">"but I
                  wish he would leave me."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"What's all that there?"</q> cried the Captain. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48"/> The man made a low bow, and said, <q rend="inline"> "Only, Sir, a slight
                  objection which this young lady makes to dancing with me, and which I am endeavour
                  ing to obviate. I shall think myself greatly ho noured, if you will intercede for
                  me." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"That lady, Sir,</q> said the Captain coldly, <q rend="inline">"is
                  her own mistress."</q> And he walked sullenly on. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"You Madam,"</q> said the man, (who looked de lighted, to Mrs.
               Mirvan,) <q rend="inline"> "you, I hope, will have the goodness to speak for me."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Sir,"</q> answered she gravely, <q rend="inline"> "I have not the
                  pleasure of being acquainted with you." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I hope when you have, Ma'am,"</q> cried he, (undaunted,) <q
                  rend="inline"> "you will honour me with your ap probation; but while I am yet
                  unknown to you, it would be truly generous in you to countenance me; and, I
                  flatter myself, Madam, that you will not have cause to repent it." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Mrs. Mirvan, with an embarrassed air, replied, <q rend="inline"> "I do not at all
                  mean, Sir, to doubt your being a gentleman,—but,—" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "But <hi>what,</hi> Madam?—that doubt removed, why a <hi>but?</hi>
                  " </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Well, Sir,"</q> said Mrs. Mirvan, (with a good humoured smile,) <q
                  rend="inline"> "I will even treat you with your own plainness, and try what effect
                  that will have on you: I must therefore tell you, once for all,—" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O pardon me, Madam!"</q> interrupted he eager ly, <q rend="inline">
                  "you must not proceed with those words, <hi>once for all;</hi> no, if <hi>I</hi>
                  have been too <hi>plain,</hi> and though a <hi>man,</hi> deserve a rebuke,
                  remember, dear ladies, that if you <hi>copy,</hi> you ought, in justice, to
                     <hi>excuse</hi> me." </q>
            </p>
            <p>We both stared at the man's strange behaviour.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Be nobler than your sex,"</q> continued he, turn ing to me, <q
                  rend="inline"> "honour me with one dance, and give <pb n="49"/> up the ingrate who
                  has merited so ill your pa tience." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Mrs. Mirvan looked with astonishment at us both. <q rend="inline"> "Who does he
                  speak of, my dear?—you never mentioned—. </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O Madam!"</q> exclaimed he, <q rend="inline"> "he was not worth
                  mentioning—it is pity he was ever thought of; but let us forget his existence. One
                  dance is all I solicit; permit me, madam, the honour of this young lady's hand; it
                  will be a favour I shall ever most gratefully acknowledge." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Sir,"</q> answered she, <q rend="inline"> "favours and strangers
                  have with me no connection." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"If you have hitherto,"</q> said he, <q rend="inline"> "confined
                  your benevolence to your intimate friends, suffer me to be the first for whom your
                  charity is en larged." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Well, Sir, I know not what to say to you,—but—"</q>
            </p>
            <p> He stopt her <hi>but</hi> with so many urgent entreaties, that she at last told me,
               I must either go down one dance, or avoid his importunities by returning home. I
               hesitated which alternative to chuse; but this impetuous man at length prevailed, and
               I was obliged to consent to dance with him. </p>
            <p> And thus was my deviation from truth punished; and thus did this man's determined
               boldness con quer. </p>
            <p> During the dance, before we were too much engaged in it for conversation, he was
               extremely provoking about <hi>my partner,</hi> and tried every means in his power to
               make me own that I had deceived him; which, though I would not so far humble myself,
               was indeed but too obvious. </p>
            <p> Lord Orville, I fancy, did not dance at all; he seemed to have a large acquaintance,
               and joined <pb n="50"/> several different parties: but you will easily sup pose I was
               not much pleased to see him, in a few minutes after I was gone, walk towards the
               place I had just left, and bow to, and join Mrs. Mir van! </p>
            <p> How unlucky I thought myself, that I had not longer withstood this stranger's
               importunities! The moment we had gone down the dance, I was has tening away from him,
               but he stopt me, and said that I could by no means return to my party, without giving
               offence, before we had <hi> done our duty of walk ing up the dance. </hi> As I know
               nothing at all of these rules and customs, I was obliged to submit to his directions;
               but I fancy I looked rather uneasy, for he took notice of my inattention, saying, in
               his free way, <q rend="inline"> "Whence that anxiety?—Why are those lovely eyes
                  perpetually averted?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I wish you would say no more to me, Sir,"</q> (cried I peevishly)
                  <q rend="inline"> "you have already destroyed all my happiness for this evening."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Good Heaven; what is it I have done?—How have I merited this

            </p>

               <q rend="inline"> "You have tormented me to death; you have forced me from my

            <p> The very moment we had done what he called our duty, I eagerly desired to return to
               Mrs. Mir van. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "To your <hi>partner,</hi> I presume, Madam?" </q> said he, very
               gravely. </p>
            <p> This quite confounded me; I dreaded lest this mischievous man, ignorant of his rank,
               should ad dress himself to Lord Orville, and say something which might expose my
               artifice. Fool! to involve myself in such difficulties! I now feared what I had
               before wished, and, therefore, to <hi>avoid</hi> Lord Orville, I was obliged myself
               to <hi>propose</hi> going down another dance, though I was ready to sink with shame
               while I spoke. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "But your <hi>partner,</hi> Ma'am?" </q> (said he, af fecting a
               very solemn air) <q rend="inline"> "perhaps he may resent my detaining you: if you
                  will give me leave to ask his consent—" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Not for the universe."</q>

            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Who is he, Madam?"</q>
            </p>
            <p> I wished myself a hundred miles off. He re peated his question. <q rend="inline"
                  >"What is his name?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Nothing—nobody—I don't know.—"</q>
            </p>
            <p> He assumed a most important solemnity; <q rend="inline"> "How!—not know? Give me
                  leave, my dear Madam, to recommend this caution to you; never dance in public with
                  a stranger,—with one whose name you are unacquainted with,—who may be a mere
                  adventurer,—a man of no character,—con sider to what impertinence you may expose
                  your self." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Was ever any thing so ridiculous? I could not help laughing, in spite of my
               vexation. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53"/> At this instant, Mrs. Mirvan, followed by Lord Orville, walked up to us.
               You will easily believe it was not difficult for me to recover my gravity; but what
               was my consternation, when this strange man, destined to be the scourge of my
               artifice, exclaimed, <q rend="inline"> "Ha! my Lord Orville!—I protest I did not know
                  your Lordship. What can I say for my usurpation <gap reason="illegible"
                     resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> —Yet, faith, my Lord, such a prize was not to be neglected." </q>
            </p>
            <p> My shame and confusion were unspeakable. Who could have supposed or foreseen that
               this man knew Lord Orville! But falsehood is not more unjustifiable than unsafe. </p>
            <p>Lord Orville—well he might,—looked all amazement.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"The philosophic coldness of your Lordship,"</q> continued this
               odious creature, <q rend="inline"> "every man is not endowed with. I have used my
                  utmost endeavours to entertain this lady, though I fear without suc cess; and your
                  Lordship would not be a little flat tered, if acquainted with the difficulty which
                  at tended my procuring the honour of only one dance." </q> Then, turning to me,
               who was sinking with shame, while Lord Orville stood motionless, and Mrs. Mirvan
               astonished,—he suddenly seized my hand, saying, <q rend="inline"> "Think, my Lord,
                  what must be my reluctance to resign this fair hand to your Lordship!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> In the same instant, Lord Orville took it of him; I coloured violently, and made an
               effort to recover it. <q rend="inline">"You do me too much honour, Sir, cried
                  he,"</q> (with an air of gallantry, pressing it to his lips ere he let it go) <q
                  rend="inline"> "however, I shall be happy to profit by it, if this lady," </q>
               (turning to Mrs. Mirvan) <q rend="inline">"will permit me to seek for her party."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54"/> To compel him thus to dance, I could not en dure, and eagerly called
               out, <q rend="inline">"By no means,—not for the world!—I must beg—"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Will you honour <hi>me,</hi> Madam, with your commands," </q>
               cried my tormentor; <q rend="inline"> "may <hi>I</hi> seek the lady's party? </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No, Sir,"</q> answered I, turning from him. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "What <hi>shall</hi> be done, my dear," </q> said Mrs. Mirvan? </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Nothing, Ma'am;—any thing, I mean.—"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "But do you dance, or not? you see his Lord ship waits." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "I hope not,—I beg that—I would not for the world—I am sure I ought
                  to—to—" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I could not speak; but that confident man, de termined to discover whether or not I
               had deceived him, said to Lord Orville, who stood suspended, <q rend="inline"> "My
                  Lord, this affair, which, at present, seems perplexed, I will briefly
                  explain;—this Lady pro posed to me another dance,—nothing could have made me more
                  happy—I only wished for your Lordship's permission, which, if now granted, will, I
                  am persuaded, set every thing right." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I glowed with indignation. <q rend="inline"> "No, Sir—It is your absence, and that
                  alone, can set every thing right." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"For Heaven's sake, my dear,"</q> (cried Mrs. Mirvan, who could no
               longer contain her sur prise,) <q rend="inline"> "what does all this mean?—were you
                  pre-engaged?—had Lord Orville?—" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "No, Madam, cried I,—only,—only I did not know that gentleman,—and
                  so,—and so I thought—I intended—I—" </q>
            </p>
            <p> Overpowered by all that had passed, I had not strength to make my mortifying
               explanation;—my spirits quite sailed me, and I burst into tears. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55"/> They all seemed shocked and amazed. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"What is the matter, my dearest love?"</q> cried Mrs. Mirvan, with
               the kindest concern. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"What have I done?"</q> exclaimed my evil ge nius, and ran
               officiously for a glass of water. </p>
            <p> However, a hint was sufficient for Lord Orville, who comprehended all I would have
               explained. He immediately led me to a seat, and said, in a low voice, <q
                  rend="inline"> "Be not distressed, I beseech you; I shall ever think my name
                  honoured by your making use of it." </q>
            </p>
            <p> This politeness relieved me. A general mur mur had alarmed Miss Mirvan, who flew
               instantly to me; while Lord Orville, the moment Mrs. Mirvan had taken the water, led
               my tormentor away. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"For Heaven's sake, dear Madam,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline"> "let
                  me go home,—indeed I cannot stay here any longer." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Let us all go,"</q> cried my kind Maria. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "But the Captain—what will he say?—I had better go home in a
                  chair." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Mrs. Mirvan consented, and I rose to depart. Lord Orville and that man both came to
               me. The first, with an attention I had but ill merited from him, led me to a chair,,
               while the other followed, pestering me with apologies. I wished to have made mine to
               Lord Orville, but was too much ashamed. </p>
            <p> It was about one o'clock. Mrs. Mirvan's ser vants saw me home. </p>
            <p> And now,—what again shall ever tempt me to an assembly? I dread to hear what you
               will think of me, my most dear and honoured Sir: you will need your utmost partiality
               to receive me without displeasure. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56"/> This morning Lord Orville has sent to enquire after our healths: and Sir
               Clement Willoughby, for that, I find, is the name of my persecutor, has called: but I
               would not go down stairs till he was gone. </p>
            <p> And now, my dear Sir, I can somewhat account for the strange, provoking, and
               ridiculous conduct of this Sir Clement last night; for Miss Mirvan says, he is the
               very man with whom she heard Lord Orville conversing at Mrs. Stanley's, when I was
               spoken of in so mortifying a manner. He was pleased to say he was glad to hear I was
               a fool, and therefore, I suppose, he concluded he might talk as much nonsense as he
               pleased to me: however, I am very indifferent as to his opinion;—but for Lord
               Orville,—if then he thought me an idiot, now, I am sure, he must believe me both bold
               and presuming. Make use of his name!—what impertinence!—he can never know how it hap
               pened,—he can only imagine it was from an ex cess of vanity:—well, however, I shall
               leave this bad city to-morrow, and never again will I enter it! </p>
            <p> The Captain intends to take us to-night to the Fantocini. I cannot bear that
               Captain; I can give you no idea how gross he is. I heartily rejoice that he was not
               present at the disagreeable con clusion of yesterday's adventure, for I am sure he
               would have contributed to my confusion; which might perhaps have diverted him, as he
               seldom or never smiles but at some other person's ex pence. </p>
            <p> And here I conclude my London letters;—and without any regret, for I am too
               inexperienced and ignorant to conduct myself with propriety in <pb n="57"/> this
               town, where every thing is new to me, and many things are unaccountable and
               perplexing. </p>
            <p> Adieu, my dear Sir; Heaven restore me safely to you! I wish I was to go immediately
               to Berry Hill; yet the wish is ungrateful to Mrs. Mirvan, and therefore I will
               repress it. I shall write an account of the Fantocini from Howard Grove. We have not
               been to half the public places that are now open, though I dare say you will think we
               have been to all. But they are almost as in numerable as the persons who fill them.

            <p> HOW much will you be surprised, my dear est Sir, at receiving another letter from
               London of your Evelina's writing! But, believe me, it was not my fault, neither is it
               my happiness, that I am still here: our journey has been postponed by an accident
               equally unexpected and disagree able. </p>
            <p> We went last night to see the Fantocini, where we had infinite entertainment from
               the perform ance of a little comedy, in French and Italian, by puppets, so admirably
               managed, that they both astonished and diverted us all, except the Captain, who has a
               fixed and most prejudiced hatred of whatever is not English. </p>
            <p> When it was over, while we waited for the coach, a tall elderly woman brushed
               quickly past us, calling out, <q rend="inline">"My God! what shall I do?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58"/>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why what <hi>would</hi> you do," </q> cried the Captain. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> " <hi>Ma foi, Monsieur,</hi> " </q> answered she, <q rend="inline">
                  "I have lost my company, and in this place I don't know nobody." </q>
            </p>
            <p> There was something foreign in her accent, though it was difficult to discover
               whether she was an English or a French woman. She was very well dressed, and seemed
               so entirely at a loss what to do, that Mrs. Mirvan proposed to the Captain to assist
               her. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Assist her!"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "ay, with all my
                  heart;—let a link-boy call her a coach." </q>
            </p>
            <p> There was not one to be had, and it rained very fast. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> " <hi>Mon Dieu,</hi> " </q> exclaimed the stranger, <q
                  rend="inline"> "what shall become of me? <hi>Je suis au désespoir!</hi> " </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Dear Sir,"</q> cried Miss Mirvan, <q rend="inline"> "pray let us
                  take the poor lady into our coach. She is quite alone, and a foreigner—." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"She's never the better for that,"</q> answered he: <q rend="inline"
                  > "she may be a woman of the town, for any thing you know." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"She does not appear such,"</q> said Mrs. Mirvan, <q rend="inline">
                  "and indeed she seems so much distressed, that we shall but follow the golden
                  rule, if we carry her to her lodgings." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"You are mighty fond of new acquaintance,"</q> returned he, <q
                  rend="inline">"but first let us know if she be going our way."</q>
            </p>
            <p> Upon enquiry, we found that she lived in Ox ford Road, and, after some disputing,
               the Captain, surlily, and with a very bad grace, consented to admit her into his
               coach; though he soon con vinced us, that he was determined she should not be too
               much obliged to him, for he seemed ab solutely bent upon quarrelling with her: for
               which <pb n="59"/> strange inhospitality, I can assign no other reason, than that she
               appeared to be a foreigner. </p>
            <p> The conversation began, by her telling us, that she had been in England only two
               days; that the gentlemen belonging to her were Parisians, and had left her, to see
               for a hackney-coach, as her own carriage was abroad; and that she had waited for them
               till she was quite frightened, and con cluded that they had lost themselves. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"And pray,"</q> said the Captain, <q rend="inline"> "why did you go
                  to a public place without an Englishman?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> " <hi>Ma foi,</hi> Sir," </q> answered she, <q rend="inline"
                  >"because none of my acquaintance is in town."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why then,"</q> said he, <q rend="inline"> "I'll tell you what; your
                  best way is to go out of it yourself." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> " <hi>Pardie, Monsieur,</hi> " </q> returned she, <q rend="inline">
                  "and so I shall; for, I promise you, I think the English a parcel of brutes; and
                  I'll go back to France as fast as I can, for I would not live among none of you."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Who wants you?"</q> cried the Captain; <q rend="inline"> "do you
                  suppose, Madam French, we have not enough of other nations to pick our pockets
                  already? I'll warrant you, there's no need of you for to put in your oar." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Pick your pockets, Sir! I wish nobody wanted to pick your pockets

                  the very sight of them, and so I shall only just visit a person of quality or two,
                  of my particular acquaintance, and then I shall go back again to France." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Ay, do,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "and then go to the devil

               <q rend="inline">"We'll take care, however,"</q> cried the stranger, with great
               vehemence, <q rend="inline"> "not to admit none of your vulgar, unmannered English
                  among us." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O never fear,"</q> (returned he coolly) <q rend="inline"> "we
                  shan't dispute the point with you; you and the quality may have the devil all to
                  yourselves." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Desirous of changing the subject of a conver sation which now became very alarming,
               Miss Mirvan called out, <q rend="inline">"Lord, how slow the man drives!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Never mind, Moll,"</q> said her father, <q rend="inline"> "I'll
                  warrant you he'll drive fast enough to-morrow, when you're going to Howard Grove."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"To Howard Grove!"</q> exclaimed the stranger; <q rend="inline">
                  "why, <hi>mon Dieu,</hi> do you know Lady Howard?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why, what if we do?"</q> answered he, <q rend="inline"> "that's
                  nothing to you; she's none of <hi>your</hi> quality, I'll promise you." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Who told you that?</q> cried she, <q rend="inline"> "you don't know
                  nothing about the matter; besides, you're the ill-bredest person ever I see; and
                  as to your knowing Lady Howard, I don't believe no such a thing; unless, indeed,
                  you are her steward." </q>
            </p>
            <p> The Captain, swearing terribly, said, with great fury, <q rend="inline"> "
                     <hi>you</hi> would much sooner be taken for her wash-woman." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Her wash-woman, indeed!—Ha, ha, ha!—why you han't no eyes; did you
                  ever see a wash woman in such a gown as this?—besides, I'm no such mean person,
                  for I'm as good as Lady Howard, and as rich too; and besides, I'm now come to
                  England to visit her." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"You may spare yourself that there trouble,"</q> said the Captain,
                  <q rend="inline">"she has paupers enough about her already."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61"/>
               <q rend="inline"> "Paupers, Mr.!—no more a pauper than yourself, nor so much
                  neither;—but you're a low, dirty fellow, and I shan't stoop to take no more notice
                  of you." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Dirty fellow!"</q> (exclaimed the Captain, seiz ing both her
               wrists) <q rend="inline"> "hark you, Mrs. Frog, you'd best hold your tongue, for I
                  must make bold to tell you, if you don't, that I shall make no ceremony of
                  tripping you out of the window; and there you may lie in the mud till some of your
                  Monsieurs come to help you out of it." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Their encreasing passion quite terrified us; and Mrs. Mirvan was beginning to
               remonstrate with the Captain, when we were all silenced by what follows. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Let me go, villain that you are, let me go, or I'll promise you
                  I'll get you put to prison for this usage; I'm no common person, I assure you,
                  and, <hi>ma foi,</hi> I'll go to Justice Fielding about you; for I'm a person of
                  fashion, and I'll make you know it, or my name i' n't Duval." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I heard no more: amazed, frightened, and un speakably shocked, an involuntary
               exclamation of <hi>Gracious Heaven!</hi> escaped me, and more dead than alive, I sunk
               into Mrs. Mirvan's arms. But let me draw a veil over a scene too cruel for a heart so
               compassionately tender as yours; it is sufficient that you know this supposed
               foreigner proved to be Madame Duval,—the grandmother of your Evelina. </p>
            <p> O, Sir, to discover so near a relation in a woman who had thus introduced
               herself!—what would become of me, were it not for you, my protector, my friend, and
               my refuge? </p>
            <p> My extreme concern, and Mrs. Mirvan's sur prise, immediately betrayed me. But I will
               not <pb n="62"/> shock you with the manner of her acknowledging me, or the
               bitterness, the <hi>grossness</hi> —I cannot other wise express myself,—with which
               she spoke of those unhappy past transactions you have so pa thetically related to me.
               All the misery of a much injured parent, dear, though never seen, regretted though
               never known, crowded so forcibly upon my memory, that they rendered this
               interview—one only excepted—the most afflicting I can ever know. </p>
            <p> When we stopt at her lodgings, she desired me to accompany her into the house, and
               said she could easily procure a room for me to sleep in. Alarmed and trembling, I
               turned to Mrs. Mirvan. <q rend="inline">"My daughter, Madam,</q> said that sweet
               woman," <q rend="inline"> cannot so abruptly part with her young friend; you must
                  allow a little time to wean them from each other." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Pardon me, Ma'am,"</q> answered Madame Du val, (who, from the time
               of her being known some what softened her manners) <q rend="inline"> "Miss can't
                  possibly be so nearly connected to this child as I am." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No matter for that,"</q> cried the Captain, (who espoused my cause
               to satisfy his own pique, though an awkward apology had passed between them) <q
                  rend="inline"> "she was sent to us, and so, d'ye see, we don't chuse for to part
                  with her." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I promised to wait upon her at what time she pleased the next day, and, after a
               short debate, she desired me to breakfast with her, and we pro ceeded to
               Queen-Ann-Street. </p>
            <p> What an unfortunate adventure! I could not close my eyes the whole night. A thousand
               times I wished I had never left Berry Hill; however, my return thither shall be
               accelerated to the utmost of my power; and once more in that abode of tran quil <pb
                  n="63"/> happiness, I will suffer no temptation to al lure me elsewhere. </p>
            <p> Mrs. Mirvan was so kind as to accompany me to Madame Duval's house this morning. The
               Captain, too, offered his service, which I de clined, from a fear she should suppose
               I meant to insult her. </p>
            <p> She frowned most terribly upon Mrs. Mirvan, but she received me with as much
               tenderness as I believe she is capable of feeling. Indeed, our meeting seems really
               to have affected her; for when, overcome by the variety of emotions which the sight
               of her occasioned, I almost fainted in her arms, she burst into tears, and said, <q
                  rend="inline">"Let me not lose my poor daughter a second time!"</q> This
               unexpected humanity softened me extremely; but she very soon excited my warmest
               indignation, by the ungrateful mention she made of the best of men, my dear, and most
               generous benefactor. However, grief and anger mutually gave way to terror, upon her
               avowing the intention of her vi siting England was to make me return with her to
               France. This, she said, was a plan she had form ed from the instant she had heard of
               my birth, which, she protested, did not reach her ears till I must have been twelve
               years of age; but Mon sieur Duval, who, she declared, was the worst husband in the
               world, would not permit her to do any thing she wished: he had been dead but three
               months, which had been employed in ar ranging certain affairs, that were no sooner
               settled, than she set off for England. She was already out of mourning, for she said
               nobody here could tell how long she had been a widow. </p>
            <p> She must have been married very early in life; what her age is, I do not know, but
               she really <pb n="64"/> looks to be less than fifty. She dresses very gaily, paints
               very high, and the traces of former beauty are still very visible in her face. </p>
            <p> I know not, when, or how, this visit would have ended, had not the Captain called
               for Mrs. Mir van, and absolutely insisted upon my attending her. He is become, very
               suddenly, so warmly my friend, that I quite dread his officiousness. Mrs. Mirvan,
               however, whose principal study seems to be healing those wounds which her husband
               inflicts, appeased Madame Duval's wrath, by a very polite invita tion to drink tea
               and spend the evening here. Not without great difficulty was the Captain prevailed
               upon to defer his journey some time longer; but what could be done? it would have
               been indecent for me to have quitted the town the very instant I discovered that
               Madame Duval was in it; and to have stayed here solely under her protection—Mrs.
               Mirvan, thank Heaven, was too kind for such a thought. That she should follow us to
               Howard Grove, I almost equally dreaded; it is, therefore, determined that we remain
               in London for some days, or a week: though the Captain has de clared that the <hi>old
                  French hag,</hi> as he is pleased to call her, shall fare never the better for it. </p>
            <p> My only hope, is to get safe to Berry Hill; where, counselled and sheltered by you,
               I shall have nothing more to fear. Adieu, my ever dear and most honoured Sir! I shall
               have no happiness till I am again with you! </p>

            <p> IN the belief and hope that my Evelina would ere now have bid adieu to London, I had
               intended to have deferred writing, till I heard of her return to Howard Grove; but
               the letter I have this moment received, with intelligence of Madame Duval's ar rival
               in England, demands an immediate answer. </p>
            <p> Her journey hither equally grieves and alarms me: how much did I pity my child, when
               I read of a discovery at once so unexpected and unwished! I have long dreaded this
               meeting and its conse quence; to claim you, seems naturally to follow acknowledging
               you: I am well acquainted with her disposition, and have for many years foreseen the
               contest which now threatens us. </p>
            <p> Cruel as are the circumstances of this affair, you must not, my love, suffer it to
               depress your spirits; remember, that while life is lent me, I will devote it to your
               service; and, for future time, I will make such provision as shall seem to me most
               conducive to your future happiness. Se cure of my protection, and relying on my
               tender ness, let no apprehensions of Madame Duval dis turb your peace; conduct
               yourself towards her with all the respect and deference due to so near a relation,
               remembering always, that the failure of duty on her part, can by no means justify any
               ne glect on yours: indeed, the more forcibly you are struck with improprieties and
               misconduct in ano ther, <pb n="66"/> the greater should be your observance and
               diligence to avoid even the shadow of similar er rors. Be careful, therefore, that no
               remissness of attention, no indifference of obliging, make known to her the
               independence I assure you of; but when she fixes the time for her leaving England,
               trust to me the task of refusing your attending her: disa greeable to myself I own it
               will be, yet to you, it would be improper, if not impossible. </p>
            <p> In regard to her opinion of me, I am more sorry than surprised at her determined
               blindness; the palliation, which she feels the want of, for her own conduct, leads
               her to seek for failings in all who were concerned in those unhappy transactions
               which she has so much reason to lament. And this, as it is the cause, so we must, in
               some mea sure, consider it as the excuse of her inveteracy. </p>
            <p> How grateful to me are your wishes to return to Berry Hill! your lengthened stay in
               London, and the dissipation in which I find you are involved, fill me with
               uneasiness: I mean not, however, that I would have you sequester yourself from the
               party to which you belong, since Mrs. Mirvan might thence infer a reproof which your
               youth and her kindness would render inexcusable. I will not, therefore, enlarge upon
               this subject, but content myself with telling you, that I shall heartily re joice
               when I hear of your safe arrival at How ard Grove, for which place I hope you will be
               preparing at the time you receive this letter. </p>
            <p> I cannot too much thank you, my best Evelina, for the minuteness of your
               communications; con tinue to me this indulgence, for I should be mi serable if in
               ignorance of your proceedings. </p>
            <p> How new to you is the scene of life in which you are now
               engaged,—balls—plays—operas—ri dottos <pb n="67"/> —Ah, my child! at your return
               hither, how will you bear the change? My heart trembles for your future
               tranquillity.—Yet I will hope every thing from the unsullied whiteness of your soul,
               and the native liveliness of your disposition. </p>
            <p> I am sure I need not say, how much more I was pleased with the mistakes of your
               inexperience at the private ball, than with the attempted adoption of more
               fashionable manners at the ridotto. But your confusion and mortifications were such
               as to entirely silence all reproofs on my part. </p>
            <p> I hope you will see no more of Sir Clement Wil loughby, whose conversation and
               boldness are ex tremely disgustful to me. I was gratified by the good-nature of Lord
               Orville, upon your making use of his name, but I hope you will never again put it to
               such a trial. </p>
            <p> Heaven bless thee, my dear child, and grant that neither misfortune nor vice may
               ever rob thee of that gaiety of heart which, resulting from in nocence, while it
               constitutes your own, contributes also to the felicity of all who know you! </p>

            <p> BEFORE our dinner was over yesterday, Ma dame Duval came to tea; though it will
               lessen your surprise, to hear that it was near five o'clock, for we never dine till
               the day is almost over. She was asked into another room, while the table was <pb
                  n="68"/> cleared, and then was invited to partake of the dessert. </p>
            <p> She was attended by a French gentleman, whom she introduced by the name of Monsieur
               Du Bois: Mrs. Mirvan received them both with her usual politeness; but the Captain
               looked very much dis pleased, and, after a short silence, very sternly said to Madame
               Duval, <q rend="inline"> "Pray who asked you to bring that there spark with you?"
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O,"</q> cried she, <q rend="inline"> "I never go no-where with out
                  him." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Another short silence ensued, which was termi nated by the Captain's turning roughly
               to the fo reigner, and saying, <q rend="inline"> "Do you know, Monsieur, that you're
                  the first Frenchman I ever let come into my house?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> Monsieur Du Bois made a profound bow. He speaks no English and understands it so
               imperfectly, that he might possibly imagine he had received a compliment. </p>
            <p> Mrs. Mirvan endeavoured to divert the Cap tain's ill-humour, by starting new
               subjects; but he left to her all the trouble of supporting them, and leant back in
               his chair in gloomy silence, ex cept when any opportunity offered of uttering some
               sarcasm upon the French. Finding her efforts to render the evening agreeable were
               fruitless, Mrs. Mirvan proposed a party to Ranelagh. Madame Duval joyfully consented
               to it, and the Captain, though he railed against the dissipation of the wo men, did
               not oppose it, and therefore Maria and I ran up stairs to dress ourselves. </p>
            <p> Before we were ready, word was brought us, that Sir Clement Willoughby was in the
               draw ing-room. He introduced himself under the pre tence of enquiring after all our
               healths, and entered <pb n="69"/> the room with the easy air of an old acquaintance;
               though Mrs. Mirvan confesses that he seemed em barrassed, when he found how coldly he
               was re ceived, not only by the Captain, but by herself. </p>
            <p> I was extremely disconcerted at the thoughts of seeing this man again, and did not
               go down stairs till I was called to tea. He was then deeply en gaged in a discourse
               upon French manners with Madame Duval and the Captain, and the subject seemed so
               entirely to engross him, that he did not, at first, observe my entrance into the
               room. Their conversation was supported with great vehemence; the Captain roughly
               maintaining the superiority of the English in every particular, and Madame Duval
               warmly refusing to allow of it in any; while Sir Clement exerted all his powers of
               argu ment and of ridicule to second and strengthen whatever was advanced by the
               Captain: for he had the sagacity to discover, that he could take no method so
               effectual for making the master of the house his friend, as to make Madame Duval his
               enemy: and indeed, in a very short time, he had reason to congratulate himself upon
               his success ful discernment. </p>
            <p> As soon as he saw me he made a most respect ful bow, and hoped I had not suffered
               from the fatigue of the ridotto: I made no other answer than a slight inclination of
               the head, for I was very much ashamed of that whole affair. He then returned to the
               disputants, where he mana ged the argument so skilfully, at once provoking Madame
               Duval and delighting the Captain, that I could not forbear admiring his address,
               though I condemned his subtlety. Mrs. Mirvan, dreading such violent antagonists,
               attempted frequently to change the subject; and she might have succeeded <pb n="70"/>
               but for the interposition of Sir Clement, who would not suffer it to be given up, and
               supported it with such humour and satire, that he seems to have won the Captain's
               heart; though their uni ted forces so enraged and overpowered Madame Duval, that she
               really trembled with passion. </p>
            <p> I was very glad when Mrs. Mirvan said it was time to be gone. Sir Clement arose to
               take leave; but the Captain very cordially invited him to join our party: he
                  <hi>had</hi> an engagement, he said, but would give it up to have that pleasure. </p>
            <p> Some little confusion ensued in regard to our manner of setting off: Mrs. Mirvan
               offered Ma dame Duval a place in her coach, and proposed that we four females should
               go all together; how ever, this she rejected, declaring she would by no means go so
               far without a gentleman, and won dering so polite a lady could make <hi>so
                  English</hi> a proposal. Sir Clement Willoughby said his cha riot was waiting at
               the door, and begged to know if it could be of any use. It was, at last, deci ded,
               that a hackney-coach should be called for Monsieur Du Bois and Madame Duval, in which
               the Captain, and, at his request, Sir Clement, went also; Mrs. and Miss Mirvan and I
               had a peaceful and comfortable ride by ourselves. </p>
            <p> I don't doubt but they quarrelled all the way; for when we met at Ranelagh, every
               one seemed out of humour: and, though we joined parties, poor Madame Duval was
               avoided as much as pos sible by all but me, and I did not dare quit her for an
               instant: indeed I believe she was resolved I should not, for she leant upon my arm
               almost all the evening. </p>
            <p> The room was so very much crowded, that, but for the uncommon assiduity of Sir
               Clement <pb n="71"/> Willoughby, we should not have been able to pro cure a box
               (which is the name given to the arched recesses which are appropriated for
               tea-parties) till half the company had retired. As we were taking possession of our
               places, some ladies of Mrs. Mir van's acquaintance stopped to speak to her, and
               persuaded her to <hi>take a round</hi> with them. When she returned to us, what was
               my surprize, to see that Lord Orville had joined her party! The ladies walked on;
               Mrs. Mirvan seated herself, and made a slight, though respectful invitation to Lord
               Orville to drink his tea with us, which, to my no small consternation, he accepted. </p>
            <p> I felt a confusion unspeakable at again seeing him, from the recollection of the
               ridotto adven ture: nor did my situation lessen it, for I was seated between Madame
               Duval and Sir Clement, who seemed as little as myself to desire Lord Orville's
               presence. Indeed, the continual wrangling and ill-breeding of Captain Mirvan and
               Madame Du val, made me blush that I belonged to them. And poor Mrs. Mirvan and her
               amiable daughter had still less reason to be satisfied. </p>
            <p> A general silence ensued after he was seated: his appearance, from different
               motives, gave a universal restraint to every body. What his own reasons were for
               honouring us with his company, I cannot imagine, unless, indeed, he had a curiosity
               to know whether I should invent any new imperti nence concerning him. </p>
            <p> The first speech was made by Madame Duval, who said, <q rend="inline"> "It's quite a
                  shocking thing to see ladies come to so genteel a place as Ranelagh with hats on;
                  it has a monstrous vulgar look: I can't think what they wear them for. There's no
                  such a thing to be seen in Paris." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Indeed,"</q> cried Sir Clement, <q rend="inline"> "I must own
                  myself no advocate for hats; I am sorry the la dies ever invented or adopted so
                  tantalizing a fa shion; for, where there is beauty, they only serve to shade it,
                  and where there is none, to excite an unavailing curiosity. I fancy they were
                  originally worn by some young and whimsical coquet." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"More likely,"</q> answered the Captain, <q rend="inline"> "they
                  were invented by some wrinkled old hag, who'd a mind for to keep the young fellows
                  in chace, let them be never so weary." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I don't know what you may do in England,"</q> cried Madame Duval,
                  <q rend="inline"> "but I know in Paris no woman need n't be at such a trouble as
                  that, to be taken very genteel notice of." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why, will you pretend for to say,"</q> returned the Captain, <q
                  rend="inline"> "that they don't distinguish the old from the young there as well
                  as here?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"They don't make no distinguishments at all,"</q> said she; <q
                  rend="inline">"they're vastly too polite."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"More fools they!"</q> said the Captain sneer ingly. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Would to Heaven,"</q> cried Sir Clement, <q rend="inline"> "that,
                  for our own sakes, we Englishmen too were blest with so accommodating a
                  blindness!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why the devil do you make such a prayer as that?"</q> demanded the
               Captain: <q rend="inline"> "them are the first foolish words I've heard you speak;
                  but I suppose you're not much used to that sort of work. Did you ever make a
                  prayer before, since you were a sniveler?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Ay, now,"</q> cried Madame Duval, <q rend="inline"> "that's another
                  of the unpolitenesses of you English, to go to talking of such things as that:
                  now, in Paris, nobody never says nothing about religion, no more than about
                  politics." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Why then,"</q> answered he, <q rend="inline"> "it's a sign they
                  take no more care of their souls, than of their country, and so both one and
                  t'other go to old Nick." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Well, if they do,"</q> said she, <q rend="inline"> "who's the
                  worse, so long as they don't say nothing about it? it's the tiresomest thing in
                  the world to be always talking of them sort of things, and nobody that's ever been
                  abroad troubles their heads about them." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Pray then,"</q> cried the Captain, <q rend="inline"> "since you
                  know so much of the matter, be so good as to tell us what they <hi>do</hi> trouble
                  their heads about?—hay, Sir Clement! ha'n't we a right to know that much?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"A very comprehensive question,"</q> said Sir Clement, <q
                  rend="inline"> "and I expect much instruction from the lady's answer." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Come, Madam,"</q> continued the Captain, <q rend="inline"> "never
                  flinch; speak at once; don't stop for thinking." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I assure you I am not going,"</q> answered she; <q rend="inline">
                  "for as to what they <hi>do</hi> do, why they've enough to do, I promise you, what

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "But <hi>what, what</hi> do they do, these famous Monsieurs?" </q>
               demanded the Captain; <q rend="inline"> "can't you tell us? do they game?—or
                  drink?—or fiddle?—or are they jockies?—or do they spend all their time in
                  slummering old women?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "As to that, Sir,—but indeed I shan't trouble myself to answer such
                  a parcel of low questions, so don't ask me no more about it." </q> And then, to my
               great vexation, turning to Lord Orville, she said, <q rend="inline">"Pray, Sir, was
                  you ever in Paris?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>He only bowed.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"And pray, Sir, how did you like it?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74"/> This <hi>comprehensive</hi> question, as Sir Clement would have called
               it, though it made him smile, also made him hesitate; however, his answer was
               expressive of his approbation. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "I thought you would like it, Sir, because you look so like a
                  gentleman. As to the Captain, and as to that other gentleman, why they may very
                  well not like what they don't know: for I suppose, Sir, you was never abroad?"
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Only three years, Ma'am,"</q> answered Sir Clement, drily. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Well, that's very surprising! I should never have thought it:
                  however, I dare say you only kept company with the English." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why pray, who <hi>should</hi> he keep company with?" </q> cried
               the Captain: <q rend="inline"> "what, I suppose you'd have him ashamed of his own
                  nation, like some other people, not a thousand miles off, on purpose to make his

            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "How will you make out that, hay, Madam? come, please to tell me,

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Where! why a great deal. They'd make quite another person of you."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "What, I suppose you'd have me learn to cut capers?—and dress like

               <q rend="inline"> "I would have you learn to be more politer, Sir, and not to talk to

               </q> (again addressing herself to Lord Orville) <q rend="inline"> "can tell this

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why look ye, Madam,"</q> answered the Cap tain, <q rend="inline">
                  "as to your hair-pinchers and shoe-blacks, you may puff off their manners, and
                  welcome; and I am heartily glad you like 'em so well; but, as to me, since you
                  must needs make so free of your advice, I must e'en tell you, I never kept company
                  with any such gentry." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Come, ladies and gentlemen,"</q> said Mrs. Mirvan, <q rend="inline"
                  > "as many of you as have done tea, I invite to walk with me." </q> Maria and I
               started up instantly; Lord Orville followed; and I question whether we were not half
               round the room ere the angry disputants knew that we had left the box. </p>
            <p> As the husband of Mrs. Mirvan had borne so large a share in this disagreeable
               altercation, Lord Orville forbore to make any comments upon it; so that the subject
               was immediately dropt, and the conversation became calmly sociable, and po litely
               chearful, and, to every body but me, must have been highly agreeable:—but, as to
               myself, I was so eagerly desirous of making some apology to Lord Orville for the
               impertinence of which he must have thought me guilty at the ridotto, and yet so
               utterly unable to assume sufficient courage to speak to him concerning an affair in
               which I had so terribly exposed myself, that I hardly ven tured to say a word all the
               time we were walk ing. Besides, the knowledge of his contemptuous opinion, haunted
               and dispirited me, and made me fear he might possibly misconstrue whatever I should
               say. So that, far from enjoying a conver sation <pb n="76"/> that might, at any other
               time, have de lighted me, I continued silent, uncomfortable, and ashamed. O Sir,
               shall I ever again involve myself in so foolish an embarrassment? I am sure that if I
               do, I shall deserve yet greater mortification. </p>
            <p> We were not joined by the rest of the party till we had taken three or four turns
               round the room, and then, they were so quarrelsome, that Mrs. Mirvan complained of
               being fatigued, and propo sed going home. No one dissented. Lord Or ville joined
               another party, having first made an offer of his services, which the gentlemen de
               clined, and we proceeded to an outward room, where we waited for the carriages. It
               was settled that we should return to town in the same man ner we came to Ranelagh,
               and, accordingly, Mon sieur Du Bois handed Madame Duval into a hack ney-coach, and
               was just preparing to follow her, when she screamed, and jumpt hastily out, de
               claring she was wet through all her clothes. In deed, upon examination, the coach was
               found to be in a dismal condition; for the weather proved very bad, and the rain had,
               though I know not how, made its way into the carriage. </p>
            <p> Mrs. and Miss Mirvan, and myself, were al ready disposed of as before; but no sooner
               did the Captain hear this account, than, without any ceremony, he was so civil as to
               immediately take possession of the vacant seat in his own coach, leaving Madame Duval
               and Monsieur Du Bois to take care of themselves. As to Sir Clement Wil loughby, his
               own chariot was in waiting. </p>
            <p> I instantly begged permission to offer Madame Duval my own place, and made a motion
               to get out; but Mrs. Mirvan stopped me, saying that I <pb n="77"/> should then be
               obliged to return to town with only the foreigner, or Sir Clement. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O never mind the old Beldame,"</q> cried the Captain, <q
                  rend="inline"> "she's weather-proof, I'll answer for her; and besides, as we are
                  all, I hope, <hi>English,</hi> why she'll meet with no worse than she expects from
                  us." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I do not mean to defend her,"</q> said Mrs. Mirvan; <q
                  rend="inline"> "but indeed, as she belongs to our par ty, we cannot, with any
                  decency, leave the place, till she is, by some means, accommodated." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Lord, my dear,"</q> cried the Captain, whom the distress of Madame
               Duval had put into very good humour, <q rend="inline"> "why she'll break her heart,
                  if she meets with any civility from a filthy Englishman." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Mrs. Mirvan, however, prevailed, and we all got out of the coach, to wait till
               Madame Duval could meet with some better carriage. We found her, attended by Monsieur
               Du Bois, standing amongst the servants, and very busy in wiping her negligee, and
               endeavouring to save it from being stained by the wet, as she said it was a new Lyons
               silk. Sir Clement Willoughby offered her the use of his chariot, but she had been too
               much piqued by his raillery to accept it. We waited some time, but in vain, for no
               hackney-coach could be procured. The Captain, at last, was persuaded to accompany Sir
               Clement himself, and we four females were handed into Mrs. Mirvan's carriage, though
               not before Madame Duval had insisted upon our making room for Monsieur Du Bois, to
               which the Captain only consented in pre ference to being incommoded by him in Sir Cle
               ment's chariot. </p>
            <p> Our party drove off first. We were silent and unsociable; for the difficulties
               attending this ar rangement <pb n="78"/> had made every one languid and fa tigued.
               Unsociable, I must own, we continued; but very short was the duration of our silence,
               as we had not proceeded thirty yards, ere every voice was heard at once,—for the
               coach broke down! I suppose we concluded of course, that we were all half killed, by
               the violent shrieks that seemed to come from every mouth. The chariot was stopped,
               the servants came to our assistance, and we were all taken out of the carriage, with
               out having been at all hurt. The night was dark and wet; but I had scarce touched the
               ground, when I was lifted suddenly from it, by Sir Clement Willoughby, who begged
               permission to assist me, though he did not wait to have it granted, but car ried me
               in his arms back to Ranelagh. </p>
            <p> He enquired very earnestly if I was not hurt by the accident? I assured him I was
               perfectly safe, and free from injury, and desired he would leave me, and return to
               the rest of the party, for I was very uneasy to know whether they had been equally
               fortunate. He told me he was happy in being honoured with my commands, and would
               joyfully execute them; but insisted upon first con ducting me to a warm room, as I
               had not wholly escaped being wet. He did not regard my objec tions, but made me
               follow him to an apartment, where we found an excellent fire, and some com pany
               waiting for carriages. I readily accepted a seat, and then begged he would go. </p>
            <p> And go, indeed, he did; but he returned in a moment, telling me that the rain was
               more violent than ever, and that he had sent his servants to offer their assistance,
               and acquaint <hi>the Mirvans</hi> of my situation. I was very mad that he would not
               go himself; but as my acquaintance with him <pb n="79"/> was so very slight, I did
               not think proper to urge him contrary to his inclination. </p>
            <p> Well, he drew a chair close to mine, and, after again enquiring how I did, said, in
               a low voice, <q rend="inline"> "You will pardon me, Miss Anville, if the eager ness I
                  feel to vindicate myself, induces me to snatch this opportunity of making sincere
                  acknowledg ments for the impertinence with which I torment ed you at the last
                  ridotto. I can assure you, Madam, I have been a true and sorrowful peni tent ever
                  since; but—shall I tell you honestly what encouraged me to—" </q>
            </p>
            <p> He stopt; but I said nothing, for I thought instantly of the conversation Miss
               Mirvan had overheard, and supposed he was going to tell me himself what part Lord
               Orville had borne in it; and really I did not wish to hear it repeated. In deed, the
               rest of his speech convinces me that such was his intention; with what view, I know
               not, except to make a merit of his defending me. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"And yet,</q> he continued, <q rend="inline"> "my excuse may only
                  expose my own credulity, and want of judg ment and penetration. I will, therefore,
                  merely beseech your pardon, and hope that some future time—" </q>
            </p>
            <p> Just then, the door was opened by Sir Clement's servant, and I had the pleasure of
               seeing the Cap tain, Mrs. and Miss Mirvan, enter the room. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O ho,"</q> cried the former, <q rend="inline"> "you have got a good
                  warm birth here; but we shall beat up your quarters. Here, Lucy, Moll, come to the
                  fire, and dry your trumpery. But, hey-day,—why where's old Madam French?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Good God,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline">"is not Madame Duval then
                  with you?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"With me! No,—thank God."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80"/> I was very uneasy to know what might have become of her, and, if they
               would have suffered me, I should have gone out in search of her my self; but all the
               servants were dispatched to find her, and the Captain said we might be very sure her
                  <hi>French beau</hi> would take care of her. </p>
            <p> We waited some time without any tidings, and were soon the only party in the room.
               My un easiness encreased so much, that Sir Clement now made a voluntary offer of
               seeking her. However, the same moment that he opened the door with this design, she
               presented herself at it, attended by Monsieur Du Bois. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I was this instant, Madam,"</q> said he, <q rend="inline">"coming
                  to see for you."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"You are mighty good, truly,"</q> cried she, <q rend="inline">"to
                  come when all the mischief's over."</q>
            </p>
            <p> She then entered,—in such a condition!—en tirely covered with mud, and in so great a
               rage, it was with difficulty she could speak. We all expressed our concern, and
               offered our assistance,—except the Captain; who no sooner beheld her, than he burst
               into a loud laugh. </p>
            <p> We endeavoured, by our enquiries and condole ments, to prevent her attending to him;
               and she was, for some time, so wholly engrossed by her anger and her distress, that
               we succeeded without much trouble. We begged her to inform us how this accident had
               happened. <q rend="inline">"How!"</q> repeated she,—why <q rend="inline"> "it was all
                  along of your all going away,—and there poor Monsieur Du Bois—but it was n't his
                  fault,—for he's as bad off as me." </q>
            </p>
            <p> All eyes were then turned to Monsieur Du Bois, whose clothes were in the same
               miserable plight with those of Madame Duval, and who, wet, shivering, and
               disconsolate, had crept to the fire. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81"/> The Captain laughed yet more heartily; while Mrs. Mirvan, ashamed of his
               rudeness, repeated her enquiries to Madame Duval; who answered, <q rend="inline">
                  "Why, as we were a-coming along, all in the rain, Monsieur Du Bois was so
                  obliging, though I'm sure it was an unlucky obligingness for me, as to lift me up
                  in his arms, to carry me over a place that was ancle-deep in mud; but instead of
                  my being ever the better for it, just as we were in the worst part,—I'm sure I
                  wish we had been fifty miles off,—for somehow or other, his foot slipt,—at least,
                  I suppose so,—though I can't think how it happened, for I'm no such great
                  weight,—but, however that was, down we both came toge ther, all in the mud;—and
                  the more we tried to get up, the more deeper we got covered with the
                  nastiness,—and my new Lyons negligee, too, quite spoilt!—however, it's well we got
                  up at all, for we might have laid there till now, for aught you all cared; for
                  nobody never came near us." </q>
            </p>
            <p> This recital put the Captain into an extacy; he went from the lady to the gentleman,
               and from the gentleman to the lady, to enjoy alter nately the sight of their
               distress. He really shout ed with pleasure; and, shaking Monsieur Du Bois strenuously
               by the hand, wished him joy of having <hi>touched English ground;</hi> and then he
               held a candle to Madame Duval, that he might have a more complete view of her
               disaster, declaring repeatedly, that he had never been better pleased in his life. </p>
            <p> The rage of poor Madame Duval was unspeak able; she dashed the candle out of his
               hand, stamped upon the floor, and, at last, spat in his face. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82"/> This action seemed immediately to calm them both, as the joy of the
               Captain was converted into resentment, and the wrath of Madame Duval into fear; for
               he put his hands upon her shoulders, and gave her so violent a shake, that she
               screamed out for help; assuring her, at the same time, that if she had been one ounce
               less old, or less ugly, she should have had it all returned on her own face. </p>
            <p> Monsieur Du Bois, who had seated himself very quietly at the fire, approached them,
               and expostulated very warmly with the Captain; but he was neither understood nor
               regarded, and Ma dame Duval was not released, till she quite sobbed with passion. </p>
            <p> When they were parted, I entreated her to permit the woman who has the charge of the
               ladies cloaks to assist her in drying her clothes; she con sented, and we did what
               was possible to save her from catching cold. We were obliged to wait in this
               disagreeable situation near an hour, ere a hackney-coach could be found; and then we
               were disposed in the same manner as before our ac cident. </p>
            <p> I am going this morning to see poor Madame Duval, and to enquire after her health,
               which I think must have suffered by her last night's mis fortunes; though, indeed,
               she seems to be natu rally strong and hearty. </p>
            <closer>Adieu, my dear Sir, till to-morrow.</closer>

               <dateline>
                  <date>Friday Morning, April 15.</date>
               </dateline>
            </opener>
            <p> SIR Clement Willoughby called here yester day at noon, and Captain Mirvan invited
               him to dinner. For my part, I spent the day in a manner the most uncomfortable
               imaginable. </p>
            <p> I found Madame Duval at breakfast in bed, though Monsieur Du Bois was in the
               chamber; which so much astonished me, that I was, invo luntarily, retiring, without
               considering how odd an appearance my retreat would have, when Madame Duval called me
               back, and laughed very heartily at my ignorance of foreign customs. </p>
            <p> The conversation, however, very soon took a more serious turn; for she began, with
               great bit terness, to inveigh against the <hi>barbarous brutality of that fellow the
                  Captain,</hi> and the horrible ill breeding of the English in general, declaring
               she should make her escape with all expedition from so <hi>beastly a nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p> She lamented, very mournfully, the fate of her Lyons silk, and protested she had
               rather have parted with all the rest of her wardrobe, because it was the first gown
               she had bought to wear upon leaving off her weeds. She has a very bad cold, and
               Monsieur Du Bois is so hoarse, he can hardly speak. </p>
            <p> She insisted upon my staying with her all day, as she intended, she said, to
               introduce me to some of my own relations. I would very fain have <pb n="84"/> excused
               myself, but she did not allow me any choice. </p>
            <p> Till the arrival of these relations, one continu ed series of questions on her side,
               and of answers on mine, filled up all the time we passed together. Her curiosity was
               insatiable; she enquired into every action of my life, and every particular that had
               fallen under my observation, in the lives of all I knew. Again, she was so cruel as
               to avow the most inveterate rancour against the sole benefactor her deserted child
               and grand-child have met with; and such was the indignation her in gratitude raised,
               that I would actually have quitted her presence and house, had she not, in a man ner
               the most peremptory, absolutely forbid me. But what, good Heaven! can induce her to
               such shocking injustice? O my friend and father! I have no command of myself when
               this subject is started. </p>
            <p> She talked very much of taking me to Paris, and said I greatly wanted the polish of
               a French education. She lamented that I had been brought up in the country, which,
               she observed, had given me a very <hi>bumpkinish air.</hi> However, she bid me not
               despair, for she had known many girls, much worse than me, who had become very fine
               ladies after a few years residence abroad; and she parti cularly instanced a Miss
               Polly Moore, daughter of a chandler's-shop woman, who, by an accident not worth
               relating, happened to be sent to Paris, where, from an awkward, ill-bred girl, she so
               much improved, that she has since been taken for a woman of quality. </p>
            <p> The relations to whom she was pleased to in troduce me, consisted of a Mr.
               Branghton, who is her nephew, and three of his children, the eldest <pb n="85"/> of
               which is a son, and the two younger are daughters. </p>
            <p> Mr. Branghton appears about forty years of age. He does not seem to want a common un
               derstanding, though he is very contracted and pre judiced: he has spent his whole
               time in the city, and I believe feels a great contempt for all who reside elsewhere. </p>
            <p> His son seems weaker in his understanding, and more gay in his temper; but his
               gaiety is that of a foolish, over-grown school-boy, whose mirth consists in noise and
               disturbance. He disdains his father for his close attention to business, and love of
               money, though he seems himself to have no talents, spirit, or generosity, to make him
               supe rior to either. His chief delight appears to be tormenting and ridiculing his
               sisters, who, in re turn, most heartily despise him. </p>
            <p> Miss Branghton, the eldest daughter, is by no means ugly, but looks proud,
               ill-tempered, and conceited. She hates the city, though without knowing why; for it
               is easy to discover she has lived no where else. </p>
            <p> Miss Polly Branghton is rather pretty, very foolish, very ignorant, very giddy, and,
               I believe, very good-natured. </p>
            <p> The first half hour was allotted to <hi> making them selves comfortable, </hi> for
               they complained of having had a very dirty walk, as they came on foot from Snow Hill,
               where Mr. Branghton keeps a silver smith's shop; and the young ladies had not only
               their coats to brush, and shoes to dry, but to ad just their head dress, which their
               bonnets had to tally discomposed. </p>
            <p> The manner in which Madame Duval was pleased to introduce me to this family,
               extremely <pb n="86"/> shocked me. <q rend="inline">"Here, my dears,"</q> said she,
                  <q rend="inline"> "here's a relation you little thought of; but you must know my
                  poor daughter Caroline had this child after she run away from me,—though I never
                  knew nothing of it, not I, for a long while after; for they took care to keep it a
                  secret from me, though the poor child has never a friend in the world besides."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Miss seems very tender-hearted, aunt,"</q> said Miss Polly, <q
                  rend="inline"> "and to be sure she's not to blame for her mama's undutifulness,
                  for she could n't help it." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Lord, no,"</q> answered she, <q rend="inline"> "and I never took no
                  notice of it to her; for indeed, as to that, my own poor daughter was n't so much
                  to blame as you may think, for she'd never have gone astray, if it had not been
                  for that meddling old parson I told you of." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"If aunt pleases,"</q> said young Mr. Branghton, <q rend="inline">
                  "we'll talk o' somewhat else, for Miss looks very uneasy-like." </q>
            </p>
            <p> The next subject that was chosen, was the age of the three young Branghtons and
               myself. The son is twenty; the daughters upon hearing that I was seventeen, said that
               was just the age of Miss Polly; but their brother, after a long dispute, proved that
               she was two years older, to the great anger of both sisters, who agreed that he was
               very ill-natured and spiteful. </p>
            <p> When this point was settled, the question was put, which was tallest?—We were
               desired to mea sure, as the Branghtons were all of different opi nions. They, none of
               them, however, disputed my being the tallest in the company, but, in re gard to one
               another, they were extremely quarrel some: the brother insisted upon their measuring
                  <pb n="87"/>
               <hi>fair,</hi> and not with <hi>heads</hi> and <hi>heels;</hi> but they would by no
               means consent to lose these privileges of our sex, and therefore the young man was
                  <hi>cast,</hi> as shortest; though he appealed to all present upon the injustice
               of the decree. </p>
            <p> This ceremony over, the young ladies, began, very freely, to examine my dress, and
               to interro gate me concerning it. <q rend="inline"> "This apron's your own work, I
                  suppose, Miss? but these sprigs a'n't in fashion now. Pray, if it is not
                  impertinent, what might you give a yard for this lutestring?—Do you make your own
                  caps, Miss?—" </q> and many other questions equally interesting and well-bred. </p>
            <p> They then asked me <hi>how I liked London?</hi> and whether I should not think the
               country a very <hi>dull place,</hi> when I returned thither? <q rend="inline">"Miss
                  must try if she can't get a good husband,"</q> said Mr. Branghton, <q
                  rend="inline">"and then she may stay and live here."</q>
            </p>
            <p> The next topic was public places, or rather the theatres, for they knew of no other;
               and the me rits and defects of all the actors and actresses were discussed: the young
               man here took the lead, and seemed to be very conversant on the subject. But, during
               this time, what was my concern, and suf fer me to add, my indignation, when I found,
               by some words I occasionally heard, that Madame Duval was entertaining Mr. Branghton
               with all the most secret and cruel particulars of my situation! The eldest daughter
               was soon drawn to them by the recital; the youngest and the son still kept their
               places, intending, I believe, to divert me, though the conversation was all their
               own. </p>
            <p> In a few minutes, Miss Branghton, coming sud denly up to her sister, exclaimed, <q
                  rend="inline"> "Lord, Polly, only think! Miss never saw her papa!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Lord, how odd!"</q> cried the other; <q rend="inline"> "why then,
                  Miss, I suppose you would n't know him?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> This was quite too much for me; I rose hastily, and ran out of the room: but I soon
               regretted I had so little command of myself, for the two sisters both followed, and
               insisted upon comforting me, notwithstanding my earnest entreaties to be left alone. </p>
            <p> As soon as I returned to the company, Madame Duval said, <q rend="inline"> "Why, my
                  dear, what was the matter with you? why did you run away so?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> This question almost made me run again, for I knew not how to answer it. But is it
               not very extraordinary, that she can put me in situations so shocking, and then
               wonder to find me sensible of any concern? </p>
            <p> Mr. Branghton, junior, now enquired of me, whether I had seen the Tower, or St.
               Paul's church? and, upon answering in the negative, they proposed making a party to
               shew them to me. Among other questions, they also asked if I had ever seen <hi>such a
                  thing as an Opera?</hi> I told them I had. <q rend="inline">"Well,"</q> said Mr.
               Branghton, <q rend="inline"> "I never saw one in my life, so long as I've lived in
                  London, and I never desire to see one, if I live here as much longer." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Lord, Papa,"</q> cried Miss Polly, <q rend="inline"> "why not? you
                  might as well for once, for the curiosity of the thing: besides, Miss Pomfret saw
                  one, and she says it was very pretty." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Miss will think us very vulgar,"</q> said Miss Branghton, <q
                  rend="inline"> "to live in London, and never have been to an Opera; but it's no
                  fault of mine, I as sure you, Miss, only Papa don't like to go." </q>
            </p>
            <p> The result was, that a party was proposed, and agreed to, for some early
               opportunity. I did not dare oppose them; but I said that my time, while <pb n="89"/>
               I remained in town, was at the disposal of Mrs. Mirvan. However, I am sure I will not
               attend them, if I can possibly avoid so doing. </p>
            <p> When we parted, Madame Duval desired to see me the next day; and the Branghtons told
               me, that the first time I went towards Snow Hill, they should be very glad if I would
               call upon them. </p>
            <p> I wish we may not meet again till that time ar rives. </p>
            <p> I am sure I shall not be very ambitious of being known to any more of my relations,
               if they have any resemblance to those whose acquaintance I have been introduced to
               already. </p>

            <p> I Had just finished my letter to you this morning, when a violent rapping at the
               door made me run down stairs; and who should I see in the draw ing room, but Lord
               Orville! </p>
            <p> He was quite alone, for the family had not as sembled to breakfast. He enquired,
               first of mine, then of the health of Mrs. and Miss Mirvan, with a degree of concern
               that rather surprised me, till he said that he had just been informed of the accident
               we had met with at Ranelagh. He expressed his sorrow upon the occasion with the
               utmost politeness, and lamented that he had not been so fortunate as to hear of it in
               time to offer his services. <q rend="inline">"But, I think,"</q> he added, <q
                  rend="inline"> "Sir Clement Willoughby had the honour of assisting you?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"He was with Captain Mirvan, my Lord."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I had heard of his being of your party."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90"/> I hope that flighty man has not been telling Lord Orville he only
               assisted <hi>me?</hi> however, he did not pursue the subject, but said, <q
                  rend="inline"> "This accident, though extremely unfortunate, will not, I hope, be
                  the means of frightening you from gracing Ra nelagh with your presence in future?"
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Our time, my Lord, for London is almost expired already." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Indeed! do you leave town so very soon?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "O yes, my Lord, our stay has already exceed ed our intentions."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Are you, then, so particularly partial to the country?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "We merely came to town, my Lord, to meet Captain Mirvan." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "And does Miss Anville feel no concern at the idea of the many
                  mourners her absence will occa sion?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O, my Lord,—I'm sure you don't think—"</q> I stopt there, for,
               indeed, I hardly knew what I was going to say. My foolish embarrassment, I suppose,
               was the cause of what followed;—for he came to me, and took my hand, saying, <q
                  rend="inline"> "I <hi>do</hi> think, that whoever has once seen Miss Anville, must
                  re ceive an impression never to be forgotten." </q>
            </p>
            <p> This compliment,—from Lord Orville,—so sur prised me, that I could not speak; but
               felt myself change colour, and stood, for some moments, si lent and looking down:
               however, the instant I re collected my situation, I withdrew my hand, and told him
               that I would see if Mrs. Mirvan was not dressed. He did not oppose me, so away I
               went. </p>
            <p> I met them all on the stairs, and returned with them to breakfast. </p>
            <p> I have since been extremely angry with myself for neglecting so excellent an
               opportunity of apo logizing <pb n="91"/> for my behaviour at the Ridotto: but, to own
               the truth, that affair never once occurred to me during the short
                  <hi>tête-à-tête</hi> which we had to gether. But, if, ever we should happen to be
               so situated again, I will certainly mention it; for I am inexpressibly concerned at
               the thought of his harbouring an opinion that I am bold or imperti nent, and I could
               almost kill myself for having given him the shadow of a reason for so shocking an
               idea. </p>
            <p> But was it not very odd, that he should make me such a compliment? I expected it not
               from him;—but gallantry, I believe, is common to all men, whatever other qualities
               they may have in particular. </p>
            <p> Our breakfast was the most agreeable meal, if it may be called a <hi>meal,</hi> that
               we have had since we came to town. Indeed, but for Madame Du val I should like London
               extremely. </p>
            <p> The conversation of Lord Orville is really de lightful. His manners are so elegant,
               so gentle, so unassuming, that they at once engage esteem, and diffuse complacence.
               Far from being indolently satisfied with his own accomplishments, as I have already
               observed many men here are, though with out any pretensions to his merit, he is most
               assi duously attentive to please and to serve all who are in his company; and, though
               his success is inva riable, he never manifests the smallest degree of consciousness. </p>
            <p> I could wish that <hi>you,</hi> my dearest Sir, knew Lord Orville, because I am sure
               you would love him; and I have felt that wish for no other person I have seen since I
               came to London. I sometimes imagine, that, when his youth is flown, his viva city
               abated, and his life is devoted to retirement, he will, perhaps, resemble him whom I
               most love <pb n="92"/> and honour. His present sweetness, politeness, and diffidence,
               seem to promise in future the same be nevolence, dignity, and goodness. But I must
               not expatiate upon this subject. </p>
            <p> When Lord Orville was gone,—and he made but a very short visit,—I was preparing,
               most re luctantly, to wait upon Madame Duval; but Mrs. Mirvan proposed to the
               Captain, that she should be invited to dinner in Queen-Ann-Street, and he readily
               consented, for he said he wished to ask after her Lyons negligee. </p>
            <p> The invitation is accepted, and we expect her every moment. But to me, it is very
               strange, that a woman, who is the uncontrolled mistress of her time, fortune, and
               actions, should chuse to ex pose herself voluntarily to the rudeness of a man who is
               openly determined to make her his sport. But she has very few acquaintance, and, I
               fancy, scarce knows how to employ herself. </p>
            <p> How great is my obligation to Mrs. Mirvan, for bestowing her time in a manner so
               disagree able to herself, merely to promote my happiness! every dispute in which her
               undeserving husband engages, is productive of pain, and uneasines s to herself; of
               this I am so sensible, that I even be sought her not to send to Madame Duval, but she
               declared she could not bear to have me pass all my time, while in town, with her
               only. Indeed she is so infinitely kind to me, that one would think she was your
               daughter. </p>

            <p> MADAME Duval was accompanied by Monsieur Du Bois. I am surprised that she should
               chuse to introduce him where he is so unwelcome; and, indeed, it is strange that they
               should be so constantly together: though I believe I should not have taken notice of
               it, but that Captain Mirvan is perpetually rallying me upon my <hi>grandmama's
                  beau.</hi>
            </p>
            <p> They were both received by Mrs. Mirvan with her usual good-breeding; but the
               Captain, most provokingly, attacked her immediately, saying, <q rend="inline"> "Now,
                  Madam, you that have lived abroad, please to tell me this here; Which did you like
                  best, the <hi>warm room</hi> at Ranelagh, or the <hi>cold bath</hi> you went into
                  afterwards? though, I assure you, you look so well that I should advise you to
                  take another dip." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> " <hi>Ma foi,</hi> Sir," </q> cried she, <q rend="inline"> "nobody
                  asked for your advice, so you may as well keep it to your self: besides, it's no
                  great joke to be splashed, and to catch cold, and spoil all one's things, whatever
                  you may think of it." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> " <hi>Splashed,</hi> quoth-a!—why I thought you were soused all
                  over.—Come, come, don't mince the matter, never spoil a good story; you know you
                  had n't a dry thread about you—'Fore George, I shall never think on't without
                  hallooing! such a poor, forlorn, draggle-tailed— <hi>gentlewoman!</hi> and poor
                  Monsieur French, here, like a drowned rat, by your side!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94"/>
               <q rend="inline"> "Well, the worse pickle we was in, so much the worser in you not to
                  help us, for you knowed where we was fast enough, because, while I laid in the
                  mud, I'm pretty sure I heard you snigger; so it's like enough you jostled us down
                  yourself, for Monsieur Du Bois says, that he is sure he had a great jolt given
                  him, or he should n't have fell." </q>
            </p>
            <p> The Captain laughed so immoderately, that he really gave me also a suspicion that he
               was not entirely innocent of the charge: however, he dis claimed it very
               peremptorily. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why then,"</q> continued she, <q rend="inline"> "if you did n't do
                  that, why did n't you come to help us?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Who, I?—what, do you suppose I had forgot I was an
                     <hi>Englishman,</hi> a filthy, beastly <hi>Englishman?</hi> " </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Very well, Sir, very well; but I was a fool to expect any better,
                  for it's all of a piece with the rest; you know you wanted to fling me out of the
                  coach-window, the very first time ever I see you: but I'll never go to Ranelagh
                  with you no more, that I'm resolved; for I dare say, if the horses had runn'd over
                  me, as I laid in that nas tiness, you'd never have stirred a step to save me?"
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Lord, no, to be sure, Ma'am, not for the world! I know your
                  opinion of our nation too well, to affront you by supposing a <hi>Frenchman</hi>
                  would want <hi>my</hi> assistance to protect you. Did you think that Monsieur
                  here, and I, had changed characters, and that he should pop you into the mud, and
                  I help you out of it? Ha, ha, ha!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "O, very well, Sir, laugh on, it's like your manners; however, if
                  poor Monsieur Du Bois had n't met with that unlucky accident himself, I should n't
                  have wanted nobody's help." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "O, I promise you, Madam, you'd never have had mine; I knew my
                  distance better; <pb n="95"/> and as to your being a little ducked, or so, why, to
                  be sure, Monsieur and you settled that be tween yourselves; so it was no business
                  of mine." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "What, then, I suppose, you want to make me believe as Monsieur Du
                  Bois served me that trick o' purpose?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "O' purpose! ay, certainly, who ever doubt ed that? Do you think a
                     <hi>Frenchman</hi> ever made a blunder? If he had been some clumsy-footed
                     <hi>English</hi> fellow, indeed, it might have been acci dental: but what the
                  devil signifies all your hop ping and capering with your dancing-masters, if you
                  can't balance yourselves upright?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> In the midst of this dialogue, Sir Clement Willoughby made his appearance. He
               affects to enter the house with the freedom of an old ac quaintance, and this very
                  <hi>easiness,</hi> which, to me, is astonishing, is what most particularly recom
               mends him to the Captain. Indeed, he seems very successfully to study all the humours
               of that gentleman. </p>
            <p> After having heartily welcomed him, <q rend="inline">"You are just come in time, my
                  boy,"</q> said he, <q rend="inline"> "to settle a little matter of a dispute
                  between this here gentlewoman and I; do you know, she has been trying to persuade
                  me, that she did not above half like the ducking Monsieur gave her t'other night?"
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I should have hoped,"</q> (said Sir Clement, with the utmost
               gravity) <q rend="inline"> "that the friendship subsisting between that lady and
                  gentleman, would have guarded them against any actions professedly disagreeable to
                  each other; but, probably, they might not have discussed the matter previously; in
                  which case, the gentleman, I must own, seems to have been guilty of inattention,
                  since, in my <pb n="96"/> humble opinion, it was his business first to have
                  enquired whether the lady preferred soft, or hard ground, before he dropt her."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O very fine, Gentlemen, very fine,"</q> cried Madame Duval, <q

            <p> Monsieur Du Bois, who was just able to disco ver the subject upon which the
               conversation turn ed, made his defence, in French, with great so lemnity; he hoped,
               he said, that the company would at least acknowledge, he did not come from a nation
               of brutes, and consequently, that to wil fully offend any lady, was, to him, utterly
               impossi ble; but that, on the contrary, in endeavouring, as was his duty, to save and
               guard her, he had himself suffered, in a manner which he would for bear to relate,
               but which, he greatly apprehended, he should feel the ill effects of for many months;
               and then, with a countenance exceedingly length ened, he added, that he hoped it
               would not be attributed to him as national prejudice, when he owned that he must, to
               the best of his memory, aver, that his unfortunate fall was owing to a sud den, but
               violent push, which, he was shocked to say, some malevolent person, with a design to
               his injury, must certainly have given him; but whe ther with a view to mortify him,
               by making him let the lady fall, or whether merely to spoil his clothes, he could not
               pretend to determine. </p>
            <p> This disputation was, at last, concluded by Mrs. Mirvan proposing that we should all
               go to Cox's Museum. Nobody objected, and carriages were immediately ordered. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97"/> In our way down stairs, Madame Duval in a very passionate manner, said,
                  <q rend="inline"> " <hi>Ma foi,</hi> if I would n't give fifty guineas, only to
                  know who gave us that shove!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> This Museum is very astonishing, and very superb; yet, it afforded me but little
               pleasure, for it is a mere show, though a wonderful one. </p>
            <p> Sir Clement Willoughby, in our walk round the room, asked me what my opinion was of
               this brilliant <hi>spectacle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Excellently answered!"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "you have
                  exactly defined my own feelings, though in a man ner I should never have arrived
                  at. But I was certain your taste was too well formed, to be pleased at the expence
                  of your understanding." </q>

            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> " <hi>Pardie,</hi> " </q> cried Madame Duval, <q rend="inline"> "I

            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"What,"</q> (cried the Captain, with a sneer) <q rend="inline"> "I

                     <hi>kickshaw</hi> work. But, pry'thee, friend," </q> (turning to the person who
               ex plained the devices) <q rend="inline"> "will you tell me the <hi>use</hi> of all
                  this? for I'm not enough of a conjurer to find it out." </q>

               <q rend="inline">"Use, indeed!"</q> (repeated Madame Duval dis dainfully) <q

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, as to that, Sir,"</q> said our con ductor, <q
                  rend="inline"> "the ingenuity of the mechanism,—the beauty of the
                  workmanship,—the—undoubt edly, Sir, any person of taste may easily discern the
                  utility of such extraordinary performances." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Why then, Sir,"</q> answered the Captain, <q rend="inline"> "your
                  person of taste must be either a coxcomb, or a Frenchman; though, for the matter
                  of that, 'tis the same thing." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Just then, our attention was attracted by a pine apple, which, suddenly opening,
               discovered a nest of birds, who immediately began to sing. <q rend="inline"
                  >"Well,"</q> cried Madame Duval, <q rend="inline"> "this is prettier than all the
                  rest! I declare, in all my travels, I never see nothing eleganter." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Hark ye, friend,"</q> said the Captain, <q rend="inline">"hast
                  never another pine-apple?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Sir?—"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Because, if thou hast, pry'thee give it us without the birds; for,
                  d'ye see, I'm no French man, and should relish something more substan tial." </q>
            </p>
            <p> This entertainment concluded with a concert of mechanical music: I cannot explain
               how it was produced, but the effect was pleasing. Ma dame Duval was in extacies; and
               the Captain flung himself into so many ridiculous distortions, by way of mimicking
               her, that he engaged the attention of all the company; and, in the midst of the
               performance of the Coronation Anthem, while Madame Duval was affecting to beat time,
               and uttering many expressions of delight, he called suddenly for salts, which a lady,
               apprehending some distress, politely handed to him, and which, instantly applying to
               the nostrils of poor Madame Duval, she involuntarily snuffed up such a quantity, that
               the pain and surprise made her scream aloud. When she recovered, she reproached him,
               with her usual vehemence; but he protested he had taken that measure out of pure
               friendship, as he concluded, from her raptures, that she was going <pb n="99"/> into
               hysterics. This excuse by no means appeased her, and they had a violent quarrel; but
               the only effect her anger had on the Captain, was to encrease his diversion. Indeed,
               he laughs and talks so terribly loud in public, that he frequently makes us ashamed
               of belonging to him. </p>
            <p> Madame Duval, notwithstanding her wrath, made no scruple of returning to dine in
               Queen-Ann-street. Mrs. Mirvan had secured places for the play at Drury Lane Theatre,
               and, though ever uneasy in her company, she very politely invited Madame Duval to be
               of our party; however, she had a bad cold, and chose to nurse it. I was sorry for her
               indisposition, but I knew not how to be sorry she did not accompany us, for she is—I
               must not say what, but very unlike other people. </p>

            <head type="sub">Evelina in continuation.</head>
            <p> OUR places were in the front row of a side box. Sir Clement Willoughby, who knew our
               intention, was at the door of the Theatre, and handed us from the carriage. </p>
            <p> We had not been seated five minutes, ere Lord Orville, who we saw in the stage-box,
               came to us; and he honoured us with his company all the evening. Miss Mirvan and I
               both rejoiced that Madame Duval was absent, as we hoped for the enjoyment of some
               conversation, uninterrupted by her quarrels with the Captain: but I soon <pb n="100"
               /> found that her presence would have made very little alteration, for so far was I
               from daring to speak, that I knew not where even to look. </p>
            <p> The play was Love for Love, and though it is fraught with wit and entertainment, I
               hope I shall never see it represented again; for it is so ex tremely indelicate,—to
               use the softest word I can,—that Miss Mirvan and I were perpetually out of
               countenance, and could neither make any ob servations ourselves, nor venture to
               listen to those of others. This was the more provoking, as Lord Orville was in
               excellent spirits, and exceedingly entertaining. </p>
            <p> When the Play was over, I flattered myself I should be able to look about me with
               less restraint, as we intended to stay the Farce; but the curtain had hardly dropped
               when the box-door opened, and in came Mr. Lovel, the man by whose fop pery and
               impertinence I was so much teazed at the ball where I first saw Lord Orville. </p>
            <p> I turned away my head, and began talking to Miss Mirvan, for I was desirous to avoid
               speak ing to him!—but in vain, for as soon as he had made his compliments to Lord
               Orville and Sir Clement Willoughby, who returned them very coldly, he bent his head
               forward, and said to me, <q rend="inline"> "I hope, Ma'am, you have enjoyed your
                  health since I had the honour—I beg ten thou sand pardons, but I protest I was
                  going to say the honour of <hi>dancing</hi> with you—however, I mean the honour of
                     <hi>seeing</hi> you dance?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> He spoke with a self-complacency that con vinced me he had studied this address, by
               way of making reprisals for my conduct at the ball: I therefore bowed slightly, but
               made no answer. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101"/> After a short silence, he again called my atten tion, by saying, in an
               easy, negligent way, <q rend="inline">"I think, Ma'am, you was never in town
                  before?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No, Sir."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "So I did presume. Doubtless, Ma'am, every thing must be infinitely
                  novel to you. Our cus toms, our manners, and <hi>les etiquettes de nous
                     autres,</hi> can have very little resemblance to those you have been used to. I
                  imagine, Ma'am, your retirement is at no very small distance from the capital?"
               </q>
            </p>
            <p> I was so much disconcerted at this sneering speech, that I said not a word; though I
               have since thought my vexation both stimulated and de lighted him. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"The air we breathe here, however, Ma'am,</q> (continued he, very
               conceitedly) <q rend="inline"> "though foreign to that you have been accustomed to,
                  has not, I hope, been at variance with your health?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Mr. Lovel,"</q> said Lord Orville, <q rend="inline"> "could not
                  your <hi>eye</hi> have spared that question?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O, my Lord,"</q> answered he, <q rend="inline"> "if <hi>health</hi>
                  were the only cause of a lady's bloom, my eye, I grant, had been infallible from

               <q rend="inline">"Come, come,"</q> cried Mrs. Mirvan, <q rend="inline"> "I must beg
                  no insinuations of that sort; Miss An ville's colour, as you have successfully
                  tried, may, you see, be heightened;—but I assure you, it would be past your skill
                  to lessen it." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"'Pon honour, Madam,"</q> returned he, <q rend="inline"> "you wrong
                  me; I presumed not to infer that <hi>rouge</hi> was the only succedaneum for
                  health; but, really, I have known so many different causes for a lady's colour,
                  such as flushing,—anger,— <hi>mauvaise honte,</hi> —and so forth, that I never
                  dare decide to which it may be owing." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102"/>
               <q rend="inline">"As to such causes as them there,"</q> cried the Captain, <q
                  rend="inline"> "they must belong to those that they keep company with." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Very true, Captain,"</q> said Sir Clement; <q rend="inline"> "the
                  natural complexion has nothing to do with occasional sallies of the passions, or
                  any accidental causes." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No, truly,"</q> returned the Captain, <q rend="inline"> "for now
                  here's me, why I look like any other man just now; and yet, if you were to put me
                  in a passion, 'fore George, you'd soon see me have as fine a high colour as any
                  painted Jezebel in all this place, be she never so bedaubed." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"But,"</q> said Lord Orville, <q rend="inline"> "the difference of
                  natural and of artificial colour, seems to me very easily discerned; that of
                  Nature, is mottled, and varying; that of art, <hi>set,</hi> and <hi>too</hi>
                  smooth; it wants that animation, that glow, that <hi>indescribable something</hi>
                  which, even now that I see it, wholly surpasses all my powers of expression." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Your Lordship,"</q> said Sir Clement, <q rend="inline"> "is

            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"And you, Sir Clement,"</q> returned he, <q rend="inline"> "an

            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Pr'ythee a truce with all this palavering,"</q> cried the Captain,

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I could have ventured to answer for the Ladies,"</q> said Lord
               Orville, <q rend="inline"> "since I am sure this is not a play that can be honoured

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"What, I suppose it is not sentimental enough!"</q> cried the

                  one of the best come dies in the language, and has more wit in one scene, than

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"For my part,"</q> said Mr. Lovel, <q rend="inline"> "I confess I

                  Pray,—(most affectedly fixing his eyes upon a diamond-ring on his little finger)

               <q rend="inline"> "O yes, Sir, yes, very frequently; I have no time to read

                  and don't know what the play was?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104"/>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why, really, Sir, a play requires so much attention,—it is
                  scarcely possible to keep awake, if one listens;—for, indeed, by the time it is
                  even ing, one has been so fatigued, with dining,—or wine,—or the house,—or
                  studying,—that it is—it is perfectly an impossibility. But, now I think of it, I
                  believe I have a bill in my pocket; O, ay, here it is—Love for Love, ay,—true,—ha,
                  ha,—how could I be so stupid! </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O, easily enough as to that, I warrant you,"</q> said the Captain;
                  <q rend="inline"> "but, by my soul, this is one of the best jokes I ever heard!
                  Come to a play, and not know what it is!—Why, I suppose you would n't have found
                  it out, if they had <hi>fob'd</hi> you off with a scraping of fidlers, or an
                  opera?—Ha! ha! ha!—why now, I should have thought you might have taken some notice
                  of one Mr. <hi>Tattle</hi> that is in this play? </q>
            </p>
            <p> This sarcasm, which caused a general smile, made him colour: but, turning to the
               Captain with a look of conceit, which implied that he had a retort ready, he said, <q
                  rend="inline"> "Pray, Sir, give me leave to ask,—what do <hi>you</hi> think of
                     <hi>one Mr. Ben,</hi> who is also in this play? </q>
            </p>
            <p> The Captain, regarding him with the utmost contempt, answered in a loud voice, <q
                  rend="inline"> "Think of him!—why I think he's a <hi>man!</hi> " </q> And then,
               staring full in his face, he struck his cane on the ground, with a violence that made
               him start. He did not, however, chuse to take any notice of this; but, having bit his
               nails some time, in manifest confusion, he turned very quick to me, and, in a
               sneering tone of voice, said, <q rend="inline"> "For my part, I was most struck with
                  the <hi>country</hi> young lady, Miss Prue; pray what do <hi>you</hi> think of
                  her, Ma'am?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Indeed, Sir,"</q> cried I, very much provoked, <q rend="inline"> "I
                  think—that is, I do not think any thing about her." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Well, really, Ma'am, you prodigiously sur prize me!— <hi>mais,
                     apparemment ce n'est qu'un façon à parler?</hi> —though I should beg your
                  pardon, for probably you do not understand French?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I made no answer, for I thought his rudeness intolerable; but Sir Clement, with
               great warmth, said, <q rend="inline"> "I am surprised that you can suppose such an
                  object as Miss Prue would engage the attention of Miss Anville even for a moment."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O, Sir,"</q> returned this fop, <q rend="inline"> 'tis the first
                  character in the piece!—so well drawn,—so much the thing!—such true
                  country-breeding,—such rural ignorance!—ha! ha! ha!—'tis most ad mirably hit off,
                  'pon honour!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I could almost have cried, that such imperti nence should be levelled at me; and
               yet, chagri ned as I was, I could never behold Lord Orville and this man at the same
               time, and feel any regret for the cause I had given of displeasure. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"The only character in the play,"</q> said Lord Orville, <q
                  rend="inline"> "worthy of being mentioned to these ladies is Angelica." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Angelica,"</q> cried Sir Clement, <q rend="inline"> "is a noble
                  girl; she tries her lover severely, but she rewards him generously." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Yet, in a trial so long,"</q> said Mrs. Mirvan, <q rend="inline">
                  "there seems rather too much consciousness of her power." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Since my opinion has the sanction of Mrs. Mirvan's," </q> added
               Lord Orville," <q rend="inline"> "I will venture to say, that Angelica bestows her
                  hand rather with the air of a benefactress, than with the ten terness of a
                  mistress. Generosity without delicacy, <pb n="106"/> like wit without judgment,
                  generally gives as much pain as pleasure. The uncertainty in which she keeps
                  Valentine, and her manner of trifling with his temper, give no very favourable
                  idea of her own." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Well, my Lord,"</q> said Mr. Lovel, <q rend="inline"> "it must,
                  however, be owned, that uncertainty is not the <hi>ton</hi> among our ladies at
                  present; nay, indeed, I think they say, though, faith," </q> taking a pinch of
               snuff, <q rend="inline"> "I hope it is not true—but they say, that <hi>we</hi> now
                  are most shy and backward." </q>
            </p>
            <p> The curtain then drew up, and our conversa tion ceased. Mr. Lovel finding we chose
               to attend to the players, lest the box. How strange it is, Sir, that this man, not
               contented with the large share of foppery and nonsense which he has from nature,
               should think proper to affect yet more! for what he faid of Tattle and of Miss Prue,
               con vinced me that he really had listened to the play, though he was so ridiculous
               and foolish as to pre tend ignorance. </p>
            <p> But how malicicious and impertinent in this creature to talk to me in such a manner!
               I am sure I hope I shall never see him again. I should have despised him heartily as
               a fop, had he never spoken to me at at all; but now, that he thinks proper to resent
               his supposed ill usage, I am really quite afraid of him. </p>
            <p> The entertainment was, The Deuce is in him, which Lord Orville observed to be the
               most finish ed and elegant <hi>petite piece</hi> that was ever written in English. </p>
            <p> In our way home, Mrs. Mirvan put me into some consternation, by saying it was
               evident, from the resentment which this Mr. Lovel harbours of my conduct, that he
               would think it a provocation <pb n="107"/> sufficiently important for a duel, if his
               courage equalled his wrath. </p>
            <p> I am terrified at the very idea. Good Heaven! that a man so weak and frivolous
               should be so re vengeful! However! if bravery would have exci ted him to affront Lord
               Orville, how much rea son have I to rejoice, that cowardice makes him contented with
               venting his spleen upon me! But we shall leave town soon, and, I hope, see him no
               more. </p>
            <p> It was some consolation to me, to hear, from Miss Mirvan, that, while he was
               speaking to me so cavalierly, Lord Orville regarded him with great indignation. </p>
            <p> But, really, I think there ought to be a book, of the laws and customs
                  <hi>a-la-mode,</hi> presented to all young people, upon their first introduction
               into public company. </p>
            <p> To night we go to the opera, where I expect very great pleasure. We shall have the
               same party as at the play; for Lord Orville said he should be there, and would look
               for us. </p>

            <p> I HAVE a volume to write, of the adventures of yesterday. </p>
            <p> In the afternoon,—at Berry Hill, I should have said the <hi>evening,</hi> for it was
               almost six o'clock,—while Miss Mirvan and I were dressing for the ope ra, and in high
               spirits, from the expectation of great entertainment and pleasure, we heard a car
               riage <pb n="108"/> stop at the door, and concluded that Sir Clement Willoughby, with
               his usual assiduity, was come to attend us to the Hay-market; but, in a few moments,
               what was our surprise, to see our chamber-door flung open, and the two Miss Brangh
               tons enter the room! They advanced to me with great familiarity, saying, <q
                  rend="inline"> "How do you do, cou sin?—so we've caught you at the glass!—well,
                  I'm determined I'll tell my brother of that!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> Miss Mirvan, who had never before seen them, and could not, at first, imagine who
               they were, looked so much astonished, that I was ready to laugh myself, till the
               eldest said, <q rend="inline"> "We're come to take you to the opera, Miss; papa and
                  my brother are below, and we are to call for your grand-mama as we go along." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I am very sorry,"</q> answered I, <q rend="inline"> "that you
                  should have taken so much trouble, as I am enga ged already." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Engaged! Lord, Miss, never mind that,"</q> cried the youngest, <q
                  rend="inline"> "this young lady will make your excuses, I dare say; it's only
                  doing as one would be done by, you know." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Indeed, Ma'am,"</q> said Miss Mirvan, <q rend="inline"> "I shall
                  myself be very sorry to be deprived of Miss Anville's company this evening." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Well, Miss, that is not so very good-natured in you," </q> said
               Miss Branghton, <q rend="inline"> "considering we only come to give our cousin
                  pleasure; it's no good to us; it's all upon her account; for we came, I don't know
                  how much round about to take her up." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I am extremely obliged to you,"</q> said I, <q rend="inline"> "and
                  very sorry you have lost so much time; but I cannot possibly help it, for I
                  engaged myself with out knowing you would call." </q>

            <p>
               <pb n="109"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Lord, what signifies that?"</q> said Miss Polly, <q rend="inline">
                  "you're no old maid, and so you need n't be so very formal: besides, I dare say
                  those you are engaged to, a'n't half so near related to you as we are." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "I must beg you not to press me any further, for I assure you it is
                  not in my power to attend you." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why we came all out of the city on purpose: besides, your
                  grand-mama expects you;—and, pray, what are we to say to her?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Tell her, if you please, that I am much con cerned,—but that I am
                  pre-engaged." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"And who to?"</q> demanded the abrupt Miss Branghton. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"To Mrs. Mirvan,—and a large party."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "And, pray, what are you all going to do, that it would be such a
                  mighty matter for you to come along with us?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"We are going to—to the opera."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "O dear, if that be all, why can't we go all together?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I was extremely disconcerted at this forward and ignorant behaviour, and yet their
               rudeness very much lessened my concern at refusing them. Indeed, their dress was such
               as would have rendered their scheme of accompanying our party impracticable, even if
               I had desired it; and this, as they did not them selves find out, I was obliged, in
               terms the least mortifying I could think of, to tell them. </p>
            <p> They were very much chagrined, and asked where I should sit? </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"In the pit,"</q> answered I. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"In the pit!"</q> repeated Miss Branghton, <q rend="inline"> "well,
                  really, I must own I should never have supposed that my gown was not good enough
                  for the pit: but come, Polly, let's go; if Miss does not think <pb n="110"/> us
                  fine enough for her, why to be sure she may chuse." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Surprised at this ignorance, I would have ex plained to them that the pit at the
               opera required the same dress as the boxes; but they were so much affronted, they
               would not hear me, and, in great dis pleasure, left the room, saying they would not
               have troubled me, only they thought I should not be so proud with my own relations,
               and that they had at least as good a right to my company as strangers. </p>
            <p> I endeavoured to apologize, and would have sent a long message to Madame Duval; but
               they has tened away without listening to me; and I could not follow them down stairs,
               because I was not dressed. The last words I heard them say, were, <q rend="inline">
                  "Well, her grand-mama will be in a fine passion, that's one good thing." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Though I was extremely mad at this visit, yet I so heartily rejoiced at their going,
               that I would not suffer myself to think gravely about it. </p>
            <p> Soon after, Sir Clement actually came, and we all went down stairs. Mrs. Mirvan
               ordered tea; and we were engaged in a very lively conversation, when the servant
               announced Madame Duval, who in stantly followed him into the room. </p>
            <p> Her face was the colour of scarlet, and her eyes sparkled with fury. She came up to
               me with a hasty step, saying, <q rend="inline"> "So, Miss, you refuses to come to me,
                  do you? And pray who are you, to dare to disobey me?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I was quite frightened;—I made no answer;—I even attempted to rise, and could not,
               but sat still, mute and motionless. </p>
            <p> Every body, but Miss Mirvan, seemed in the ut most astonishment; and the Captain,
               raising and approaching Madame Duval, with a voice of au thority, <pb n="111"/> said,
                  <q rend="inline"> "Why how now, Mrs. Turkey Cock, what's put you into this here
                  fluster?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"It's nothing to you,"</q> answered she, <q rend="inline"> "so you
                  may as well hold your tongue, for I sha'n't be called to no account by you, I
                  assure you." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"There you're out, Madam Fury,"</q> returned he, <q rend="inline">
                  "for you must know I never suffer any body to be in a passion in my house, but
                  myself." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "But you <hi>shall,</hi> " </q> cried she, in a great rage, <q
                  rend="inline"> "for I'll be in as great a passion as ever I please, without asking
                  your leave, so don't give yourself no more airs about it. And as for you, Miss,"
               </q> again advancing to me <q rend="inline"> "I order you to follow me this moment,
                  or else I'll make you repent it all your life." </q> And, with these words, she
               flung out of the room. </p>
            <p> I was in such extreme terror at being addressed and threatened in a manner to which
               I am so wholly unused, that I almost thought I should have fainted. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Don't be alarmed, my love,"</q> cried Mrs. Mir van, <q
                  rend="inline"> "but stay where you are, and I will follow Madame Duval, and try to
                  bring her to reason." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Miss Mirvan took my hand, and most kindly endeavoured to raise my spirits: Sir
               Clement, too, approached me, with an air so interested in my dis tress, that I could
               not but feel myself obliged to him; and, taking my other hand, said, <q rend="inline"
                  > "For Heaven's sake, my dear Madam, compose your self; surely the violence of
                  such a wretch ought merely to move your contempt: she can have no right, I
                  imagine, to lay her commands upon you, and I only wish that you would allow
                     <hi>me</hi> leave to speak to her." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "O no! not for the world! indeed, I believe,—I am afraid—I had
                  better follow her." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Follow her! Good God, my dear Miss An ville, would you trust
                  yourself with a mad woman? <pb n="112"/> for what else can you call a creature
                  whose pas sions are so insolent? No, no; send her word at once to leave the house,
                  and tell her you desire that she will never see you again." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "O Sir! you don't know who you talk of!—it would ill become me to
                  send Madame Duval such a message." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "But <hi>why,</hi> " </q> cried he, (looking very inquisitive,) <q
                  rend="inline"> " <hi>why</hi> should you scruple to treat her as she de serves?"
               </q>
            </p>
            <p> I then found that his aim was to discover the nature of her connection with me; but
               I felt so much ashamed of my near relationship to her, that I could not persuade
               myself to answer him, and only entreated that he would leave her to Mrs. Mirvan, who
               just then entered. </p>
            <p> Before she could speak to me, the Captain called out, <q rend="inline"> "Well,
                  Goody, what have you done with Madame French? is she cooled a little? 'cause, if
                  she be n't, I've just thought of a most excellent device to bring her to." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"My dear Evelina,"</q> said Mrs. Mirvan, <q rend="inline"> "I have
                  been vainly endeavouring to appease her; I pleaded your engagement, and promised
                  your fu ture attendance: but I am sorry to say, my love, that I fear her rage will
                  end in a total breach (which I think you had better avoid) if she is any further
                  opposed." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Then I will go to her, Madam,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline"> "and,
                  indeed, it is now no matter, for I should not be able to recover my spirits
                  sufficiently to enjoy much pleasure <hi>any</hi> where this evening." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Sir Clement began a very warm expostulation, and entreaty, that I would not go; but
               I begged him to desist, and told him, very honestly, that, if my compliance were not
               indispensably necessary, <pb n="113"/> I should require no persuasion to stay. He
               then took my hand, to lead me down stairs; but the Captain desired him to be quiet,
               saying he would 'squire me himself, <q rend="inline">"because,"</q> he added exult
               ingly rubbing his hands,) <q rend="inline"> "I have a wipe ready for the old lady,
                  which may serve her to <hi>chew</hi> as she goes along." </q>
            </p>
            <p> We found her in the parlour. <q rend="inline"> "O, you're come at last, Miss, are
                  you?—fine airs you give yourself, indeed!— <hi>ma foi,</hi> if you had n't come,
                  you might have stayed, I assure you, and have been a beggar for your pains." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Heyday, Madam,"</q> cried the Captain, pranc ing forward, with a
               look of great glee,) <q rend="inline"> "what, a'n't you got out of that there passion
                  yet? why then, I'll tell you what to do to cool yourself; call upon your old
                  friend, Monsieur Slippery, who was with you at Ranelagh, and give my service to
                  him, and tell him, if he sets any store by your health, that I desire he'll give
                  you such another souse as he did before: he'll know what I mean, and I'll war rant
                  you he'll do't for my sake." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Let him, if he dares!"</q> cried Madame Duval; <q rend="inline">
                  "but I sha'n't stay to answer you no more; you are a vulgar fellow,—and so, child,
                  let us leave him to himself." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Hark ye, Madam,"</q> cried the Captain, <q rend="inline"> "you'd
                  best not call names, because, d'ye see, if you do, I shall make bold to show you
                  the door." </q>
            </p>
            <p> She changed colour, and, saying, <q rend="inline"> " <hi>Pardie,</hi> I can shew it
                  myself," </q> hurried out of the room, and I followed her into a hackney-coach.
               But, be fore we drove off, the Captain, looking out of the parlour window, called
               out, <q rend="inline"> "D'ye hear, Madam,—don't forget my message to Monsieur." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114"/> You will believe, our ride was not the most agreeable in the world;
               indeed, it would be dif ficult to say which was least pleased, Madame Du val or me,
               though the reasons of our discontent were so different: however, Madame Duval soon
               got the start of me; for we had hardly turned out of Queen-Anne-street, when a man,
               running full speed, stopt the coach. He came up to the win dow, and I saw he was the
               Captain's servant. He had a broad grin on his face, and panted for breath. Madame
               Duval demanded his business; <q rend="inline"> "Ma dam," </q> answered he, <q
                  rend="inline"> "my master desires his com pliments to you, and—and—and he says he
                  wishes it well over with you. He! he! he!—" </q>
            </p>
            <p> Madame Duval instantly darted forward, and gave him a violent blow on the face; <q
                  rend="inline">"Take that back for your answer, sirrah,"</q> cried she, <q
                  rend="inline"> "and learn to grin at your betters another time. Coach man, drive
                  on!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> The servant was in a violent passion, and swore terribly; but we were soon out of
               hearing. </p>
            <p> The rage of Madame Duval was greater than ever, and she inveighed against the
               Captain with such fury, that I was even apprehensive she would have returned to his
               house, purposely to reproach him, which she repeatedly threatened to do; nor would
               she, I believe, have hesitated a moment, but that, notwithstanding her violence, he
               has really made her afraid of him. </p>
            <p> When we came to her lodgings, we found all the Branghtons in the passage,
               impatiently waiting for us, with the door open. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Only see, here's Miss!"</q> cried the brother. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Well, I declare I thought as much!"</q> said the younger sister. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Why, Miss,"</q> said Mr. Branghton, <q rend="inline"> "I think you
                  might as well have come with your cousins at once; it's throwing money in the
                  dirt, to pay two coaches for one fare." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Lord, father,"</q> cried the son, <q rend="inline"> "make no words
                  about that; for I'll pay for the coach that Miss had." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O, I know very well,"</q> answered Mr. Brangh ton, <q rend="inline"
                  > "that you're always more ready to spend than to earn." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I then interfered, and begged that I might my self be allowed to pay the fare, as
               the expence was incurred upon my account; they all said <hi>no,</hi> and proposed
               that the same coach should carry us on to the opera. </p>
            <p> While this passed, the Miss Branghtons were examining my dress, which, indeed, was
               very improper for my company; and, as I was ex tremely unwilling to be so conspicuous
               amongst them, I requested Madame Duval to borrow a hat or bonnet for me of the people
               of the house. But she never wears either herself, and thinks them very
                  <hi>English</hi> and barbarous; therefore she insisted that I should go full
               dressed, as I had pre pared myself for the pit, though I made many objections. </p>
            <p> We were then all crowded into the same carri age; but when we arrived at the
               opera-house, I contrived to pay the coachman. They made a great many speeches; but
               Mr. Branghton's reflec tion had determined me not to be indebted to him. </p>
            <p> If I had not been too much chagrined to laugh, I should have been extremely diverted
               at their ig norance of whatever belongs to an opera. In the first place, they could
               not tell at what door we <pb n="116"/> ought to enter, and we wandered about for some
               time, without knowing which way to turn: they did not chuse to apply to me, though I
               was the only person of the party who had ever before been at an opera; because they
               were unwilling to suppose that their <hi>country cousin,</hi> as they were pleas ed
               to call me, should be better acquainted with any London public place than themselves.
               I was very indifferent and careless upon this subject, but not a little uneasy at
               finding my dress, so different from that of the company to which I belonged,
               attracted general notice and observation. </p>
            <p> In a short time however we arrived at one of the door-keeper's <hi>bars.</hi> Mr.
               Branghton demand ed for what part of the house they took money? They answered the
               pit, and regarded us all with great earnestness. The son then advancing, said, <q
                  rend="inline">"Sir, if you please, I beg that I may treat Miss."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"We'll settle that another time,"</q> answered Mr. Branghton, and
               put down a guinea. </p>
            <p>Two tickets of admission were given to him.</p>
            <p> Mr. Branghton, in his turn, now stared at the door-keeper, and demanded what he
               meant by giving him only two tickets for a guinea? </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Only two, Sir!"</q> said the man, <q rend="inline"> "why don't you
                  know that the tickets are half a guinea each?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Half a guinea each!"</q> repeated Mr. Brangh ton, <q rend="inline">
                  "why I never heard of such a thing in my life! And pray, Sir, how many will they
                  admit?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Just as usual, Sir, one person each."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "But one person for half a guinea!—why I only want to sit in the
                  pit, friend." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Had not the Ladies better sit in the gallery, Sir; for they'll
                  hardly chuse to go into the pit with their hats on?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117"/>
               <q rend="inline">"O, as to that,"</q> cried Miss Branghton, <q rend="inline"> "if our
                  hats are too high, we'll take them off when we get in. I sha'n't mind it, for I
                  did my hair on purpose." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Another party then approaching, the door-keeper coul no longer attend to Mr.
               Branghton, who, tak ing up the guinea, told him it should be long enough before he'd
               see it again, and walked away. </p>
            <p> The young ladies, in some confusion, expressed their surprise, that their
                  <hi>papa</hi> should not know the opera prices, which for their parts they had
               read in the papers a thousand times. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"The price of stocks"</q> said he, <q rend="inline"> "is enough for
                  me to see after; and I took it for granted it was the same thing here as at the
                  play-house." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I knew well enough what the price was,"</q> said the son, <q
                  rend="inline"> "but I would not speak, because I thought perhaps they'd take less,
                  as we're such a large party." </q>
            </p>
            <p> The sisters both laughed very contemptuously at this idea, and asked him if he ever
               heard of <hi>people's abating</hi> any thing at a public place? </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I don't know whether I have or no,"</q> an swered he, <q
                  rend="inline"> "but I'm sure if they would, you'd like it so much the worse." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Very true, Tom,</q> cried Mr. Branghton; <q rend="inline"> "tell a
                  woman that any thing is reasonable, and she'll be sure to hate it." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Well,"</q> said Miss Polly, <q rend="inline"> "I hope that Aunt and
                  Miss will be of our side, for Papa always takes part with Tom." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Come, come,"</q> cried Madam Duval, <q rend="inline"> "if you stand
                  talking here, we sha'n't get no place at all." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Mr. Branghton then enquired the way to the gal lery, and, when we came to the
               door-keeper, de manded what was to pay. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118"/>
               <q rend="inline">"The usual price, Sir,"</q> said the man. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Then give me change,"</q> cried Mr. Branghton, again putting down
               his guinea. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"For how many, Sir?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why—let's see,—for six."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"For six, Sir? why you've given me but a guinea."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> " <hi>But</hi> a guinea! why how much would you have? I suppose it
                  i'n't half a guinea apiece here too?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No, Sir, only five shillings."</q>
            </p>
            <p> Mr. Branghton again took up his unfortunate guinea, and protested he would submit to
               no such imposition. I then proposed that we should return home, but Madame Duval
               would not consent, and we were conducted, by a woman who sells books of the Opera, to
               another gallery-door, where, after some disputing, Mr. Branghton at last paid, and we
               all went up stairs. </p>
            <p> Madame Duval complained very much of the trouble of going so high, but Mr. Branghton
               de sired her not to hold the place too cheap, <q rend="inline">"for, whatever you may
                  think,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "I assure you I paid pit price; so don't
                  suppose I come here to save my money." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Well, to be sure,"</q> said Miss Branghton, <q rend="inline">
                  "there's no judging of a place by the outside, else, I must needs say, there's
                  nothing very extraordi nary in the stair-case." </q>
            </p>
            <p> But, when we entered the gallery, their amaze ment and disappointment became
               general. For a few instants, they looked at one another without speaking, and then
               they all broke silence at once. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Lord, Papa,</q> exclaimed Miss Polly, <q rend="inline"> "why you
                  have brought us to the one-shilling gallery!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119"/>
               <q rend="inline">"I'll be glad to give you two shillings, though,"</q> answered he,
                  <q rend="inline"> "to pay. I was never so fooled out of my money before, since the

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> " <hi>Ma foi,</hi> " </q> cried Madame Duval, <q rend="inline"> "I

                  nothing." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I thought, at the time,"</q> said Mr. Branghton, <q rend="inline">
                  "that three shillings was an exorbitant price for a place in the gallery, but as
                  we'd been asked so much more at the other doors, why I paid it with out many
                  words; but then, to be sure, thinks I, it never can be like any other gallery,—we
                  shall see some <hi>crinkum-crankum</hi> or other for our money;—but I find it's as
                  arrant a take-in as ever I met with." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why it's as like the twelvepenny gallery at Drury-lane," </q>
               cried the son, <q rend="inline"> "as two peas are one to another. I never knew father
                  so bit before." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Lord,</q> "said Miss Branghton, <q rend="inline"> "I thought it
                  would have been quite a fine place,—all over I don't know what,—and done quite in
                  taste." </q>
            </p>
            <p> In this manner they continued to express their dissatisfaction till the curtain drew
               up; after which, their observations were very curious. They made no allowance for the
               customs, or even for the lan guage of another country, but formed all their re marks
               upon comparisons with the English theatre. </p>
            <p> Notwithstanding all my vexation at having been forced into a party so very
               disagreeabl, and that, too, from one so much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF"
                  extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> so very much the con trary—yet, would they have suffered me to listen, I
               should have forgotten every thing unpleasant, and selt nothing but delight, in
               hearing the sweet voice <pb n="120"/> of Signor Millico, the first singer; but they
               tor mented me with continual talking." </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"What a jabbering they make!"</q> cried Mr. Branghton; <q
                  rend="inline"> "there's no knowing a word they say. Pray what's the reason they
                  can't as well sing in English?—but I suppose the fine folks would not like it, if
                  they could understand it." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"How unnatural their action is!"</q> said the son; <q rend="inline">
                  "why now who ever saw an Englishman put him self in such out-of-the-way postures?"
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"For my part,"</q> said Miss Polly, <q rend="inline"> "I think it's
                  very pretty, only I don't know what it means." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Lord, what does that signify?"</q> cried her sister; <q
                  rend="inline"> "mayn't one like a thing without being so very particular?—You may
                  see that Miss likes it, and I don't suppose she knows more of the matter than we
                  do." </q>
            </p>
            <p> A gentleman, soon after, was so obliging as to make room in the front row for Miss
               Branghton and me. We had no sooner seated ourselves, than Miss Branghton exclaimed,
                  <q rend="inline"> "Good gracious! only see!—why, Polly, all the people in the pit
                  are without hats, dressed like any thing!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Lord, so they are,</q> cried Miss Polly, <q rend="inline"> "well, I
                  never saw the like!—it's worth coming to the Opera if one saw nothing else." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I was then able to distinguish the happy party I had left; and I saw that Lord
               Orville had seated himself next to Mrs. Mirvan. Sir Clement had his eyes perpetually
               cast towards the five shilling gallery, where I suppose he concluded that we were
               seated; however, before the Opera was over, I have reason to believe that he had
               discovered me, high and distant as I was from him. Pro bably he distinguished me by
               my head-dress. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121"/> At the end of the first act, as the green curtain dropped, to prepare
               for the dance, they imagined that the Opera was done, and Mr. Branghton ex pressed
               great indignation that he had been <hi>tricked</hi> out of his money with so little
               trouble. <q rend="inline"> "Now if any Englishman was to do such an impudent thing as
                  this," </q> said he, <q rend="inline"> "why he'd be pelted;—but here, one of these
                  outlandish gentry may do just what he pleases, and come on, and squeak out a song
                  or two, and then pocket your money with out further ceremony." </q>
            </p>
            <p> However, so determined he was to be dissatis fied, that, before the conclusion of
               the third act, he found still more fault with the Opera for being too long, and
               wondered whether they thought their singing good enough to serve us for supper. </p>
            <p> During the symphony of a song of Signor Mil lico's, in the second act, young Mr.
               Branghton said, <q rend="inline"> "It's my belief that that fellow's going to sing
                  another song!—why there's nothing but sing ing!—I wonder when they'll speak." </q>
            </p>
            <p> This song, which was slow and pathetic, caught all my attention, and I leaned my
               head forward to avoid hearing their observations, that I might listen without
               interruption; but, upon turning round, when the song was over, I found that I was the
               object of general diversion to the whole party; for the Miss Branghtons were
               tittering, and the two gentlemen making signs and faces at me, implying their
               contempt of my affectation. </p>
            <p> This discovery determined me to appear as in attentive as themselves; but I was very
               much pro voked at being thus prevented enjoying the only pleasure, which, in such a
               party, was within my power. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122"/>
               <q rend="inline">"So, Miss,"</q> said Mr. Branghton, <q rend="inline"> "you're quite
                  in the fashion, I see;—so you like Operas? well, I'm not so polite; I can't like
                  nonsense, let it be never so much the taste." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"But pray, Miss,</q> said the son, <q rend="inline"> "what makes
                  that fellow look so doleful while he's singing?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Probably because the character he performs is in distress." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why then I think he might as well let alone singing till he's in
                  better cue: it's out of all nature for a man to be piping when he's in distress.
                  For my part, I never sing but when I'm merry; yet I love a song as well as most
                  people." </q>
            </p>
            <p>When the curtain dropt, they all rejoiced.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "How do <hi>you</hi> like it?—and how do <hi>you</hi> like it?"
               </q> passed from one to another with looks of the utmost contempt. <q rend="inline"
                  >"As for me,"</q> said Mr. Brangh ton, <q rend="inline"> "they've caught me once,
                  but if ever they do again, I'll give 'em leave to sing me to Bedlam for my pains:
                  for such a heap of stuff never did I hear; there is n't one ounce of sense in the
                  whole Opera, nothing but one continued squeaking and squalling from beginning to
                  end." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"If I had been in the pit,"</q> said Madame Du val, <q rend="inline"
                  > "I should have liked it vastly, for music is my passion; but sitting in such a
                  place as this, is quite unbearable." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Miss Branghton, looking at me, declared, that she was not <hi>genteel</hi> enough to
               admire it. </p>
            <p> Miss Polly confessed, that, if they would but sing <hi>English,</hi> she should like
               it <hi>very well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p> The brother wished he could raise a riot in the house, because then he might get his
               money again. </p>
            <p> And, finally, they all agreed, that it was <hi> mon strous dear. </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123"/> During the last dance, I perceived, standing near the gallery-door, Sir
               Clement Willoughby. I was extremely vexed, and would have given the world to have
               avoided being seen by him: my chief objection was, from the apprehension that he
               wou'd hear Miss Branghton call me <hi>cousin.</hi> —I fear you will think this London
               journey has made me grow very proud, but indeed this family is so low-bred and
               vulgar, that I should be equally ashamed of such a connexion in the country, or any
               where. And really I had already been so much chagrined that Sir Clement had been a
               witness of Madame Duval's power over me, that I could not bear to be exposed to any
               further mortification. </p>
            <p> As the seats cleared, by parties going away, Sir Clement approached nearer to us;
               the Miss Branghtons observed with surprise, what a fine gentleman was come into the
               gallery, and they gave me great reason to expect, that they would endeavour to
               attract his notice, by familiarity with me, whenever he should join us; and so, I
               formed a sort of plan, to prevent any conversation. I am afraid you will think it
               wrong; and so I do myself, now,—but, at the time, I only considered how I might avoid
               immediate humiliation. </p>
            <p> As soon as he was within two seats of us, he spoke to me, <q rend="inline"> "I am
                  very happy, Miss Anville, to have sound you, for the Ladies below have each an
                  humble attendant, and therefore I am come to offer my services here." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why then,"</q> cried I, (not without hesitating) <q rend="inline"
                  >"if you please,—I will join them."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Will you allow me the honour of conducting you?"</q> cried he
               eagerly; and, instantly taking my hand, he would have marched away with me: but I
               turned to Madame Duval, and said, <q rend="inline"> "As our <pb n="124"/> party is so
                  large, Madam, if you will give me leave, I will go down to Mrs. Mirvan, that I may
                  not crowd you in the coach." </q>
            </p>
            <p> And then, without waiting for an answer, I suffered Sir Clement to hand me out of
               the gal lery. </p>
            <p> Madame Duval, I doubt not, will be very an gry, and so I am with myself, now, and
               therefore I cannot be surprised: but Mr. Branghton, I am sure, will easily comfort
               himself, in having escaped the additional coach expence of carrying me to
               Queen-Ann-street; as to his daughters, they had no time to speak, but I saw they were
               in utter amazement. </p>
            <p> My intention was to join Mrs. Mirvan, and accompany her home. Sir Clement was in
               high spirits and good humour; and, all the way we went, I was fool enough to rejoice
               in secret at the success of my plan; nor was it till I got down stairs, and amidst
               the servants, that any difficulty occurred to me of meeting with my friends. </p>
            <p> I then asked Sir Clement how I should contrive to acquaint Mrs. Mirvan that I had
               left Madame Duval? </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I fear it will be almost impossible to find her,</q> answered he;
                  <q rend="inline"> "but you can have no objec tion to permitting me to see you safe
                  home." </q>
            </p>
            <p> He then desired his servant, who was waiting, to order his chariot to draw up. </p>
            <p> This quite startled me; I turned to him hastily, and said that I could not think of
               going away without Mrs. Mirvan. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"But how can we meet with her?"</q> cried he; <q rend="inline"> "you
                  will not chuse to go into the pit yourself; I cannot send a servant there; and it
                  is impossible for <hi>me</hi> to go and leave you alone?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125"/> The truth of this was indisputable, and totally silenced me. Yet, as
               soon as I could recollect my self, I determined not to go in his chariot, and told
               him I believed I had best return to my party up stairs. </p>
            <p> He would not hear of this; and earnestly en treated me not to withdraw the trust I
               had repo sed in him. </p>
            <p> While he was speaking, I saw Lord Orville, with several ladies and gentlemen, coming
               from the pit passage: unfortunately, he saw me too, and, leaving his company,
               advanced instantly to wards me, and, with an air and voice of surprise, said, <q
                  rend="inline">"Good God, do I see Miss Anville!"</q>
            </p>
            <p> I now most severely felt the folly of my plan, and the aukwardness of my situation;
               however, I hastened to tell him, though in a hesitating manner, that I was waiting
               for Mrs. Mirvan! but what was my disappointment, when he acquainted me that she was
               already gone home! </p>
            <p> I was inexpressibly distressed; to suffer Lord Orville to think me satisfied with
               the single pro tection of Sir Clement Willoughby, I could not bear; yet I was more
               than ever averse to return ing to a party which I dreaded his seeing: I stood some
               moments in suspense, and could not help ex claiming, <q rend="inline">"Good Heaven,
                  what can I do!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why, my dear Madam,"</q> cried Sir Clement, <q rend="inline">
                  "should you be thus uneasy?—you will reach Queen-Ann street almost as soon as Mrs.
                  Mirvan, and I am sure you cannot doubt being as safe." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I made no answer, and Lord Orville then said, <q rend="inline"> "My coach is here;
                  and my servants are ready to take any commands Miss Anville will honour me with
                  for them. I shall myself go home in a chair, and therefore—" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126"/> How grateful did I feel for a proposal so conside rate, and made with
               so much delicacy! I should gladly have accepted it, had I been permitted, but Sir
               Clement would not let him even finish his speech; he interrupted him with evident
               displea sure, and said, <q rend="inline">"My Lord, my own chariot is now at the
                  door."</q>
            </p>
            <p> And just then the servant came, and told him the carriage was ready. He begged to
               have the honour of conducting me to it, and would have taken my hand, but I drew it
               back, saying, <q rend="inline"> "I can't—I can't indeed! pray go by yourself—and as
                  to me, let me have a chair." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Impossible!"</q> (cried he with vehemence) <q rend="inline"> "I
                  cannot think of trusting you with strange chairmen,—I cannot answer it to Mrs.
                  Mirvan,—come, dear Madam, we shall be home in five minutes." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Again I stood suspended. With what joy would I then have compromised with my pride,
               to have been once more with Madame Duval and the Branghtons, provided I had not met
               with Lord Orville! However, I flatter myself that he not only saw, but pitied my
               embarrassment, for he said, in a tone of voice unusually softened, <q rend="inline">
                  "To offer my services in the presence of Sir Clement Willoughby would be
                  superfluous; but I hope I need not assure Miss Anville, how happy it would make me
                  to be of the least use to her." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I courtsied my thanks. Sir Clement with great eagerness pressed me to go; and while
               I was thus uneasily deliberating what to do, the dance, I sup pose, finished, for the
               people crowded down stairs. Had Lord Orville then repeated his offer, I should have
               accepted it, notwithstanding Sir Clement's re pugnance; but I fancy he thought it
               would be im pertinent. In a very few minutes I heard Madame <pb n="127"/> Duval's
               voice, as she descended from the gallery; <q rend="inline">"Well,"</q> cried I,
               hastily, <q rend="inline">"if I must go—".</q> I stopt, but Sir Clement immediately
               handed me into his chariot, called out <q rend="inline">"Queen-Ann-street,"</q> and
               then jumped in himself. Lord Orville, with a bow and a half smile, wished me good
               night. </p>
            <p> My concern was so great, at being seen and left by Lord Orville in so strange a
               situation, that I should have been best pleased to have remained wholly silent during
               our ride home: but Sir Cle ment took care to prevent that. </p>
            <p> He began by making many complaints of my unwillingness to trust myself with him, and
               begged to know what could be the reason. This question so much embarrassed me, that I
               could not tell what to answer, but only said, that I was sorry to have taken up so
               much of his time. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O Miss Anville,"</q> (cried he, taking my hand) <q rend="inline">
                  "if you knew with what transport I would dedicate to you not only the present but
                  all the future time allotted to me, you would not injure me by making such an
                  apology." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I could not think of a word to say to this, nor to a great many other equally fine
               speeches with which he ran on, though I would fain have with drawn my hand, and made
               almost continual at tempts; but in vain, for he actually grasped it be tween both
               his, without any regard to my resist ance. </p>
            <p> Soon after, he said that he believed the coach man was going the wrong way, and he
               called to his servant, and gave him directions. Then ad dressing himself to me, <q
                  rend="inline"> "How often, how assidu ously have I sought an opportunity of
                  speaking to you, without the presence of that brute Captain Mirvan! Fortune has
                  now kindly favoured me <pb n="128"/> with one, and permit me," </q> (again seizing
               my hand) <q rend="inline"> "permit me to use it, in telling you that I adore you!"
               </q>
            </p>
            <p> I was quite thunderstruck at this abrupt and un expected declaration. For some
               moments I was silent, but, when I recovered from my surprise, I said, <q
                  rend="inline"> "Indeed, Sir, if you were determined to make me repent leaving my
                  own party so foolishly, you have very well succeeded." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"My dearest life,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "is it possible
                  you can be so cruel? Can your nature and your countenance be so totally opposite?
                  Can the sweet bloom upon those charming cheeks, which appears as much the result
                  of good-humour as of beau ty—" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O, Sir,</q> cried I, interrupting him, <q rend="inline"> "this is
                  very fine; but I had hoped we had had enough of this sort of conversation at the
                  Ridotto, and I did not expect you would so soon resume it." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "What I then said, my sweet reproacher, was the effect of a
                  mistaken, a prophane idea, that your understanding held no competition with your
                  beauty; but now, now that I find you equally in comparable in both, all words, all
                  powers of speech, are too feeble to express the admiration I feel of your
                  excellencies." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Indeed,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline"> "if you did not talk in one
                  language, and think in another, you would never suppose that I could give credit
                  to praise so very much above my desert." </q>
            </p>
            <p> This speech, which I made very gravely, occa sioned still stronger protestations,
               which he conti nued to pour forth, and I continued to disclaim, till I began to
               wonder that we were not in Queen-Ann-Street, and begged he would desire the coach man
               to drive faster. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129"/>
               <q rend="inline">"And does this little moment,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline">
                  "which is the first of happiness I have ever known, does it already appear so very
                  long to you?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I am afraid the man has mistaken the way,"</q> answered I, <q
                  rend="inline"> "or else we should ere now have been at our journey's end. I must
                  beg you will speak to him." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "And can you think me so much my own ene my?—if my good genius has
                  inspired the man with a desire of prolonging my happiness, can you expect that I
                  should counteract its indul gence?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I now began to apprehend that he had himself ordered the man to go a wrong way, and
               I was so much alarmed at the idea, that, the very instant it occurred to me, I let
               down the glass, and made a sudden effort to open the chariot-door myself, with a view
               of jumping into the street; but he caught hold of me, exclaiming, <q rend="inline"
                  >"For Heaven's sake, what is the matter?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I—I don't know,"</q> cried I, (quite out of breath) <q
                  rend="inline"> "but I am sure the man goes wrong, and, if you will not speak to
                  him, I am determined I will get out myself." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"You amaze me,"</q> answered he, (still holding me) <q rend="inline"
                  > "I cannot imagine what you apprehend. Surely you can have no doubts of my
                  honour?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> He drew me towards him as he spoke. I was dreadfully frightened, and could hardly
               say, <q rend="inline"> "No, Sir, no,—none at all,—only Mrs. Mirvan,—I think she will
                  be uneasy." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Whence this alarm, my dearest angel?—What can you fear?—my life is
                  at your devo tion, and can you, then, doubt my protection?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>And so saying, he passionately kissed my hand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130"/> Never, in my whole life, have I been so terri fied. I broke forcibly
               from him, and, putting my head out of the window, called aloud to the man to stop.
               Where we then were I knew not, but I saw not a human being, or I should have called
               for help. </p>
            <p> Sir Clement, with great earnestness, endeavour ed to appease and compose me; <q
                  rend="inline">"If you do not intend to murder me,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline"
                  >"for mercy's, for pity's sake, let me get out!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Compose your spirits, my dearest life,"</q> cried he, <q
                  rend="inline">"and I will do every thing you would have me."</q> And then he
               called to the man himself, and bid him make haste to Queen-Ann-Street. <q
                  rend="inline">"This stupid fellow,"</q> continued he, <q rend="inline"> "has
                  certainly mis taken my orders; but I hope you are now fully satisfied." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I made no answer, but kept my head at the window, watching which way he drove, but
               with out any comfort to myself, as I was quite unac quainted with either the right or
               the wrong. </p>
            <p> Sir Clement now poured forth abundant protest ations of honour, and assurances of
               respect, en treating my pardon for having offended me, and beseeching my good
               opinion: but I was quite silent, having too much apprehension to make re proaches,
               and too much anger to speak without. </p>
            <p> In this manner we went through several streets, till at last, to my great terror, he
               suddenly ordered the man to stop, and said, <q rend="inline"> "Miss Anville, we are
                  now within twenty yards of your house; but I cannot bear to part with you, till
                  you generously forgive me for the offence you have taken, and pro mise not to make
                  it known to the Mirvans." </q>
            </p>
            <p>I hesitated between fear and indignation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131"/>
               <q rend="inline"> "Your reluctance to speak, redoubles my con trition for having
                  displeased you, since it shews the reliance I might have on a promise which you
                  will not give without consideration." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I am very, very much distressed,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline">
                  "you ask a promise which you must be sensible I ought not to grant, and yet dare
                  not refuse." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Drive on!"</q> cried he to the coachman;— <q rend="inline"> "Miss
                  Anville, I will not compel you; I will ex act no promise, but trust wholly to your
                  genero sity." </q>
            </p>
            <p> This rather softened me; which advantage he no sooner perceived, than he determined
               to avail himself of, for he flung himself on his knees, and pleaded with so much
               submission, that I was really obliged to forgive him, because his humili ation made
               me quite ashamed: and, after that, he would not let me rest till I gave him my word
               that I would not complain of him to Mrs. Mir van. </p>
            <p> My own folly and pride, which had put me in his power, were pleas which I could not
               but at tend to in his favour. However, I shall take very particular care never to be
               again alone with him. </p>
            <p> When, at last, we arrived at our house, I was so overjoyed, that I should certainly
               have pardoned him then, if I had not before. As he handed me up stairs, he scolded
               his servant aloud, and very angrily, for having gone so much out of the way. Miss
               Mirvan ran out to meet me,—and who should I see behind her, but—Lord Orville! </p>
            <p> All my joy now vanished, and gave place to shame and confusion; for I could not
               endure that he should know how long a time Sir Clement and <pb n="132"/> I had been
               together, since I was not at liberty to assign any reason for it. </p>
            <p> They all expressed great satisfaction at seeing me, and said they had been extremely
               uneasy and surprised that I was so long coming home, as they had heard from Lord
               Orville that I was not with Madame Duval. Sir Clement, in an affected passion, said
               that his booby of a servant had misunderstood his orders, and was driving us to the
               upper end of Piccadilly. For my part, I only coloured, for though I would not forfeit
               my word, I yet dis dained to confirm a tale in which I had myself no belief. </p>
            <p> Lord Orville, with great politeness, congratu lated me that the troubles of the
               evening had so happily ended, and said, that he had found it im possible to return
               home, before he enquired after my safety. </p>
            <p> In a very short time he took leave, and Sir Cle ment followed him. As soon as they
               were gone, Mrs. Mirvan, though with great softness, blamed me for having quitted
               Madame Duval. I assured her, and with truth, that for the future I would be more
               prudent. </p>
            <p> The adventures of the evening so much discon certed me, that I could not sleep all
               night. I am under the most cruel apprehensions, left Lord Or ville should suppose my
               being on the gallery-stairs with Sir Clement was a concerted scheme, and even that
               our continuing so long together in his chariot, was with my approbation, since I did
               not say a word on the subject, nor express any dissatis faction at the coachman's
               pretended blunder. </p>
            <p> Yet, his coming hither to wait our arrival, though it seems to imply some doubt,
               shews also some anxiety. Indeed Miss Mirvan says, that he <pb n="133"/> appeared
                  <hi>extremely</hi> anxious, nay uneasy and impa tient for my return. If I did not
               fear to flatter myself, I should think it not impossible but that he had a suspicion
               of Sir Clement's design, and was therefore concerned for my safety. </p>
            <p> What a long letter is this! however, I shall not write many more from London, for
               the Cap tain said this morning, that he would leave town on Tuesday next. Madame
               Duval will dine here to-day, and then she is to be told his intention. </p>
            <p> I am very much amazed that she accepted Mrs. Mirvan's invitation, as she was in such
               wrath yes terday. I fear that to-day I shall myself be the principal object of her
               displeasure; but I must submit patiently, for I cannot defend myself. </p>
            <p> Adieu, my dearest Sir. Should this letter be productive of any uneasiness to you,
               more than ever shall I repent the heedless imprudence which it recites. </p>

                  </dateline>
               </opener>
               <p> MRS. Mirvan has just communicated to me an anecdote concerning Lord Orville,
                  which has much surprised, half pleased, and half pained me. </p>
               <p> While they were sitting together during the Opera, he told her that he had been
                  greatly con cerned at the impertinence which the young lady under her protection
                  had suffered from Mr. Lovel; but that he had the pleasure of assuring her, she had
                  no future disturbance to apprehend from him. </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134"/> Mrs. Mirvan, with great eagerness, begged he would explain himself,
                  and said she hoped he had not thought so insignificant an affair worthy his se
                  rious attention. </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"There is nothing,"</q> answered he, <q rend="inline"> "which re
                     quires more immediate notice than impertinence, for it ever encroaches when it
                     is tolerated." </q> He then added, that he believed he ought to apologize for
                  the liberty he had taken of interfering, but that, as he regarded himself in the
                  light of a <hi>party concerned,</hi> from having had the honour of dancing with
                  Miss Anville, he could not possibly reconcile to himself a patient neutrality. </p>
               <p> He then proceeded to tell her, that he had waited upon Mr. Lovel the morning
                  after the play; that the visit had proved an amicable one, but the particulars
                  were neither entertaining nor necessary; he only assured her, Miss Anville might
                  be perfectly easy, since Mr. Lovel had en gaged his honour never more to mention,
                  or even to hint at what had passed at Mrs. Stanley's as sembly. </p>
               <p> Mrs. Mirvan expressed her satisfaction at this conclusion, and thanked him for
                  his polite atten tion to her young friend. </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"It would be needless,"</q> said he, <q rend="inline"> "to
                     request that this affair may never transpire, since Mrs. Mir van cannot but see
                     the necessity of keeping it in violably secret; but I thought it incumbent upon
                     me, as the young lady is under your protection, to assure both you and her of
                     Mr. Lovel's future respect." </q>
               </p>
               <p> Had I known of this visit previous to Lord Or ville's making it, what dreadful
                  uneasiness would it have cost me! Yet that he should so much in terest himself in
                  securing me from offence, gives <pb n="135"/> me, I must own, an internal pleasure
                  greater than I can express, for I feared he had too contemp tuous an opinion of
                  me, to take any trouble upon my account. Though, after all, this interference
                  might rather be to satisfy his own delicacy, than from thinking well of me. </p>
               <p> But how cool, how quiet is true courage! Who, from seeing Lord Orville at the
                  play, would have imagined his resentment would have hazarded his life? yet his
                  displeasure was evident, though his real bravery and his politeness equally
                  guarded him from entering into any discussion in our presence. </p>
               <p> Madame Duval, as I expected, was most ter ribly angry yesterday; she scolded me
                  for I believe two hours, on account of having left her, and pro tested she had
                  been so much surprised at my going, without giving her time to answer, that she
                  hardly knew whether she was awake or asleep. But she assured me, that if ever I
                  did so again, she would never more take me into public. And she expressed an equal
                  degree of displeasure against Sir Clement, because he had not even spoken to her,
                  and because he was always of the Captain's side in an argument. The Captain, as
                  bound in honour, warmly de fended him, and then followed a dispute in the usual
                  style. </p>
               <p> After dinner, Mrs. Mirvan introduced the sub ject of our leaving London. Madame
                  Duval said she should stay a month or two longer. The Cap tain told her she was
                  welcome, but that he and his family should go into the country on Tuesday morning. </p>
               <p> A most disagreeable scene followed; Madame Duval insisted upon keeping me with
                  her; but Mrs. Mirvan said, that as I was actually engaged on a visit to Lady
                  Howard, who had only consented to <pb n="136"/> my leaving her for a few days, she
                  could not think of returning without me. </p>
               <p> Perhaps if the Captain had not interfered, the good-breeding and mildness of Mrs.
                  Mirvan might have had some effect upon Madame Duval; but he passes no opportunity
                  of provoking her, and therefore made so many gross and rude speeches, all of which
                  she retorted, that, in conclusion, she vowed she would sooner go to law, in right
                  of her relationship, than that I should be taken away from her. </p>
               <p> I heard this account from Mrs. Mirvan, who was so kindly considerate as to give
                  me a pretence for quitting the room, as soon as this dispute begun, lest Madame
                  Duval should refer to me, and insist on my obedience. </p>
               <p> The final result of the conversation, was, that, to soften matters for the
                  present, Madame Duval should make one in the party for Howard Grove, whither we
                  are positively to go next Wednesday. </p>
               <p> Mrs. Mirvan is now writing to Lady Howard, to excuse bringing this unexpected
                  guest, and to prevent the disagreeable surprise, which must, otherwise, attend her
                  reception. This dear lady seems eternally studying my happiness and advan tage. </p>
               <p> To-night we go to the Pantheon, which is the last diversion we shall partake of
                  in London, for to-morrow— </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <p> This moment, my dearest Sir, I have received your kind letter. </p>
               <p> If you thought us too dissipated the first week, I almost fear to know what you
                  will think of us <pb n="137"/> this second;—however, the Pantheon this even ing
                  will probably be the last public place which I shall ever see. </p>
               <p> The assurance of your support and protection in regard to Madame Duval, though
                  what I never doubted, excites my utmost gratitude: how, in deed, cherished under
                  your roof, the happy ob ject of your constant indulgence, how could I have borne
                  to become the slave of her tyrannical hu mours?—pardon me that I speak so hardly
                  of her, but, whenever the idea of passing my days with her occurs to me, the
                  comparison which naturally fol lows, takes from me all that forbearance, which, I
                  believe, I owe her. </p>
               <p> You are already displeased with Sir Clement: to be sure, then, his behaviour
                  after the opera will not make his peace with you. Indeed, the more I reflect upon
                  it, the more angry I am. I was en tirely in his power, and it was cruel in him to
                  cause me so much terror. </p>
               <p> O my dearest Sir, were I but worthy the prayers and the wishes you offer for me,
                  the utmost am bition of my heart would be fully satisfied! but I greatly fear you
                  will find me, now that I am out of the reach of your assisting prudence, more weak
                  and imperfect than you could have expected. </p>
               <p> I have not now time to write another word, for I must immediately hasten to dress
                  for the evening. </p>

            <opener>

            </opener>
            <p> THERE is something to me half melancholy in writing an account of our last
               adventures in London; however, as this day is merely appro priated to packing, and
               preparations for our journey, and as I shall shortly have no more adventures to
               write, I think I may as well complete my town journal at once. And, when you have it
               all to gether, I hope, my dear Sir, you will send me your observations and thoughts
               upon it to Howard Grove. </p>
            <p> About eight o'clock we went to the Pantheon. I was extremely struck with the beauty
               of the building, which greatly surpassed whatever I could have expected or imagined.
               Yet, it has more the appearance of a chapel, than of a place of diver sion; and,
               though I was quite charmed with the magnificence of the room, I felt that I could not
               be as gay and thoughtless there as at Ranelagh, for there is something in it which
               rather inspires awe and solemnity, than mirth and pleasure. How ever, perhaps it may
               only have this effect upon such a novice as myself. </p>
            <p> I should have said, that our party consisted only of Captain, Mrs. and Miss Mirvan,
               as Madame Duval spent the day in the city:—which I own I could not lament. </p>
            <p> There was a great deal of company; but the first person we saw was Sir Clement
               Willoughby. He addressed us with his usual ease, and joined us <pb n="139"/> for the
               whole evening. I felt myself very uneasy in his presence; for I could not look at
               him, nor hear him speak, without recollecting the chariot adventure; but, to my great
               amazement, I ob served that he looked at <hi>me</hi> without the least ap parent
               discomposure, though certainly he ought not to think of his behaviour without
               blushing. I really wish I had not forgiven him, and then he could not have ventured
               to speak to me any more. </p>
            <p> There was an exceeding good concert, but too much talking to hear it well. Indeed I
               am quite astonished to find how little music is attended to in silence; for though
               every body seems to admire, hardly any body listens. </p>
            <p> We did not see Lord Orville, till we went into the tea-room, which is large, low,
               and under ground, and serves merely as a foil to the apart ments above; he then sat
               next to us; he seemed to belong to a large party, chiefly of ladies; but, among the
               gentlemen attending them, I perceived Mr. Lovel. </p>
            <p> I was extremely irresolute whether or not I ought to make any acknowledgments to
               Lord Or ville for his generous conduct in securing me from the future impertinence of
               that man; and I thought, that as he had seemed to allow Mrs. Mirvan to ac quaint me,
               though no one else, of the measures which he had taken, he might perhaps suppose me
               ungrateful if silent: however I might have spared myself the trouble of deliberating,
               as I never once had the shadow of an opportunity of speaking unheard by Sir Clement.
               On the contrary, he was so exceedingly officious and forward, that I could not say a
               word to any body, but instantly he bent his head forward, with an air of profound at
               tention, as if I had addressed myself wholly to <pb n="140"/> him: and yet, I never
               once looked at him, and would not have spoken to him on any account. </p>
            <p> Indeed, Mrs. Mirvan herself, though unac quainted with the behaviour of Sir Clement
               after the opera, says it is not right for a young woman to be seen so frequently in
               public with the same gentleman; and, if our stay in town was to be lengthened, she
               would endeavour to represent to the Captain the impropriety of allowing his con stant
               attendance; for Sir Clement, with all his <hi>easiness,</hi> could not be so
               eternally of our parties, if the Captain was less fond of his company. </p>
            <p> At the same table with Lord Orville, sat a gen tleman,—I call him so only because he
                  <hi>was</hi> at the same table,—who, almost from the moment I was seated, fixed
               his eyes stedfastly on my face, and never once removed them to any other object dur
               ing tea-time, notwithstanding my dislike of his star ing must, I am sure, have been
               very evident. I was quite surprised, that a man whose boldness was so offensive,
               could have gained admission into a party of which Lord Orville made one; for I na
               turally concluded him to be some low-bred, and uneducated man; and I thought my idea
               was in dubitably confirmed, when I heard him say to Sir Clement Willoughby, in an
                  <hi>audible whisper,</hi> —which is a mode of speech very distressing and disagree
               able to by-standers,— <q rend="inline"> "For Heaven's sake, Wil loughby, who is that
                  lovely creature?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> But what was my amazement, when, listen ing attentively for the answer, though my
               head was turned another away, I heard Sir Clement say, <q rend="inline"> "I am sorry
                  I cannot inform your Lordship, but I am ignorant myself." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lordship!</hi> —how extraordinary! that a <hi>nobleman,</hi> accustomed, in all
               probability, to the first rank <pb n="141"/> of company in the kingdom, from his
               earliest in fancy, can possibly be deficient in <hi>good manners,</hi> however faulty
               in morals and principles! Even Sir Clement Willoughby appeared modest in compa rison
               with this person. </p>
            <p> During tea, a conversation was commenced up on the times, fashions, and public
               places, in which the company of both tables joined. It began by Sir Clement's
               enquiring of Miss Mirvan and of me if the Pantheon had answered our expectations. </p>
            <p> We both readily agreed that it had greatly ex ceeded them. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Ay, to be sure,"</q> said the Captain, <q rend="inline"> "why you
                  don't suppose they'd confess they did n't like it, do you? Whatever's the fashion,
                  they must like of course;—or else I'd be bound for it they'd own, that there never
                  was such a dull place as this here invented." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"And has, then, this building,"</q> said Lord Orville, <q
                  rend="inline"> "no merit that may serve to lessen your censure? Will not your eye,
                  Sir, speak something in its favour?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Eye,"</q> cried the Lord, (I don't know his name,) <q rend="inline"
                  > "and is there any eye here, that can find any pleasure in looking at dead walls
                  or statues, when such heavenly living objects as I now see demand all their
                  admiration?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O, certainly,"</q> said Lord Orville, <q rend="inline"> "the life
                  less symmetry of architecture, however beautiful the design and proportion, no man
                  would be so mad as to put in competition with the animated charms of nature: but
                  when, as to-night, the eye may be regaled at the same time, and in one view, with
                  all the excellence of art, and all the perfec tion of nature, I cannot think that
                  either suffer by being seen together." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="142"/>
               <q rend="inline">"I grant, my Lord,"</q> said Sir Clement, <q rend="inline"> "that
                  the cool eye of unimpassioned philosophy may view both with equal attention, and
                  equal safety; but, where the heart is not so well guarded, it is apt to interfere,
                  and render, even to the eye, all objects but one insipid and uninteresting." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Aye, aye,"</q> cried the Captain, <q rend="inline"> "you may talk
                  what you will of your eye here, and your eye there, and, for the matter of that,
                  to be sure you have two,—but we all know they both squint one way." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Far be it from me,"</q> said Lord Orville, <q rend="inline"> "to
                  dispute the <hi>magnetic</hi> power of beauty, which ir resistibly draws and
                  attracts whatever has soul and sympathy: and I am happy to acknowledge, that
                  though we have now no <hi>gods</hi> to occupy a mansion professedly built for
                  them, yet we have secured their <hi>better halves,</hi> for we have
                     <hi>goddesses</hi> to whom we all most willingly bow down." </q> And then, with
               a very droll air, he made a profound reve rence to the ladies. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"They'd need be goddesses with a vengeance,"</q> said the Captain,
                  <q rend="inline"> "for they're mortal dear to look at. Howsomever, I should be
                  glad to know what you can see in e'er a face among them that's worth half a guinea
                  for a sight." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Half a guinea,"</q> exclaimed that same Lord, <q rend="inline"> "I
                  would give half I am worth, for a sight of only <hi>one,</hi> provided I make my
                  own choice. And, prithee, how can money be better employed than in the service of
                  fine women?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "If the ladies of his own party can pardon the Captain's speech,"
               </q> said Sir Clement, <q rend="inline"> "I think he has a fair claim to the
                  forgiveness of all." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Then you depend very much, as I doubt not but you may," </q> said
               Lord Orville, <q rend="inline"> "upon the ge neral <pb n="143"/> sweetness of the
                  sex;—but, as to the ladies of the Captain's party, they may easily pardon, for
                  they cannot be hurt." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "But they must have a devilish good conceit of themselves, though,"
               </q> said the Captain, <q rend="inline"> "to believe all that. Howsomever, whether or
                  no, I should be glad to be told, by some of you who seem to be knowing in them
                  things, what kind of diversion can be found in such a place as this here, for one
                  who has had, long ago, his full of face-hunting?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>Every body laughed, but nobody spoke.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why look you there, now,"</q> continued the Captain, <q
                  rend="inline"> "you're all at a dead stand!—not a man among you can answer that
                  there question. Why, then, I must make bold to conclude, that you all come here
                  for no manner of purpose but to stare at one another's pretty faces;—though, for
                  the matter of that, half of 'em are plaguy ugly,—and, as to t'other half,—I
                  believe it's none of God's manufactory." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"What the ladies may come hither for, Sir,"</q> said Mr. Lovel,
               (stroking his ruffles, and looking down,) <q rend="inline"> "it would ill become
                     <hi>us</hi> to determine; but as to we men, doubtless we can have no other
                  view, than to admire them." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"If I be n't mistaken,"</q> cried the Captain, (looking earnestly in
               his face,) <q rend="inline"> "you are that same person we saw at Love for Love
                  t'other night;—be n't you?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Lovel bowed.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why then, Gentlemen,"</q> continued he, with a loud laugh, <q
                  rend="inline"> "I must tell you a most excellent good joke;—when all was over, as
                  sure as you're alive, he asked what the play was! Ha, ha, ha!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Sir,"</q> said Mr Lovel, colouring, <q rend="inline"> "if you were
                  as much used to a town life as I am,—which, I presume, is not precisely the
                  case,—I fancy you would not find so much diversion from a circum stance so
                  common." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Common! what, is it common?"</q> repeated the Captain; <q
                  rend="inline"> "why then, 'fore George, such chaps are more fit to be sent to
                  school, and well disciplined with a cat o' nine tails, than to poke their heads
                  into a play-house. Why, a play is the only thing left, now-a-days, that has a
                  grain of sense in it; for as to all the rest of your public places, d'ye see, if
                  they were all put together, I would n't give <hi>that</hi> for 'em!" </q> snapping
               his fingers. <q rend="inline"> "And now we're talking of them sort of things, there's
                  your operas,—I should like to know, now, what any of you can find to say for
                  them." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Lord Orville, who was most able to have an swered, seemed by no means to think the
               Captain worthy an argument, upon a subject concerning which he had neither knowledge
               nor feeling: but, turning to us, he said, <q rend="inline"> "The ladies are silent,
                  and we seem to have engrossed the conversation to our selves, in which we are much
                  more our own ene mies than theirs. But," </q> addressing himself to Miss Mirvan
               and me, <q rend="inline"> "I am most desirous to hear the opinions of these young
                  ladies, to whom all public places must, as yet, be new." </q>
            </p>
            <p> We both, and with eagerness, declared that we had received as much, if not more
               pleasure, at the opera than any where: but we had better have been silent; for the
               Captain, quite displeased, said, <q rend="inline"> what signifies asking them girls?
                  Do you think they know their own minds yet? Ask 'em after any thing that's called
                  diversion, and you're sure they'll say it's vastly fine;—they are set of <pb

                  'em how they like making puddings and pies, and I'll warrant you'll pose 'em. As
                  to them operas, I desire I may hear no more of their liking such monsense; and for
                  you, Moll," </q> to his daughter, <q rend="inline"> "I charge you, as you value my
                  favour, that you'll never again be so impertinent as to have a taste of your own
                  before my face. There are fools enough in the world, without your adding to their
                  number. I'll have no daugh ter of mine affect them sort of megrims. It is a shame
                  they a'n't put down; and if I'd my will, there's not a magistrate in this town,
                  but should be knocked of the head for suffering them. If you've a mind to praise
                  any thing, why you may praise a play, and welcome, for I like it my self." </q>
            </p>
            <p> This reproof effectually silenced us both for the rest of the evening. Nay, indeed,
               for some mi nutes it seemed to silence every body else; till Mr. Lovel, not willing
               to lose an opportunity of re turning the Captain's sarcasm, said, <q rend="inline">
                  "Why, really, Sir, it is but natural, to be most pleased with what is most
                  familiar, and, I think, of all our diversi ons, there is not one so much in common
                  between us and the country, as a play. Not a village but has its barns and
                  comedians; and as for the stage business, why it may be pretty equally done any
                  where; and even in regard to <hi>us,</hi> and the <hi>canaille,</hi> confined as
                  we all are within the semi-circle of a theatre, there is no place where the
                  distinction is less obvious." </q>
            </p>
            <p> While the Captain seemed considering for Mr. Lovel's meaning, Lord Orville, probably
               with a view to prevent his finding it, changed the subject <pb n="146"/> to Cox's
               Museum, and asked what he thought of it? </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Think!—"</q> said he, <q rend="inline"> "why I think as how it
                  i'n't worth thinking about. I like no such <hi>jem cracks.</hi> It is only fit, in
                  my mind, for monkeys,—though, for I aught I know, they too might turn up their
                  noses at it." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"May we ask your Lordship's own opinion?"</q> said Mrs. Mirvan. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"The mechanism,"</q> answered he, <q rend="inline"> "is wonder fully
                  ingenious: I am sorry it is turned to no bet ter account; but its purport is so
                  frivolous, so very remote from all aim at instruction or utility, that the sight
                  of so fine a shew, only leaves a regret on the mind, that so much work, and so
                  much inge nuity, should not be better bestowed." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"The truth is,"</q> said the Captain, <q rend="inline"> "that in all
                  this huge town, so full as it is of folks of all sorts, there i'n't so much as one
                  public place, be sides the play-house, where a man, that's to say a man who
                     <hi>is</hi> a man, ought not to be ashamed to shew his face. T'other day, they
                  got me to a ridotto; but I believe it will be long enough be fore they get me to
                  another. I knew no more what to do with myself, than if my ship's company had been
                  metamorphosed into Frenchmen. Then, again, there's your famous Ranelagh, that you
                  make such a fuss about,—why what a dull place is that!—its the worst of all." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Ranelagh dull!"—"Ranelagh dull!"</q> was echoed from mouth to
               mouth, and all the ladies, as if of one accord, regarded the Captain with looks of
               the most ironical contempt. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"As to Ranelagh,"</q> said Mr. Lovel, <q rend="inline"> "most
                  indubitably, though the price is plebeian, it is by no means adapted to the
                  plebeian taste. It requires <pb n="147"/> a certain acquaintance with high life,
                  and—and—and something of—of—something <hi>d'un vrai goût,</hi> to be really
                  sensible of its merit. Those whose—whose connections, and so forth, are not among
                     <hi>les gens comme il faut,</hi> can feel nothing but <hi>ennui</hi> at such a

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Ranelagh!"</q> cried Lord —, <q rend="inline"> "O, 'tis the

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O you creature!"</q> cried a pretty, but affect ed young lady,
               patting him with her fan, <q rend="inline"> "you shan't talk so; I know what you are
                  going to say; but, positively, I won't sit by you, if you're so wicked." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"And how can one sit by you, and be good?"</q> said he, <q
                  rend="inline"> "when only to look at you is enough to make one wicked—or wish to
                  be so?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Fie, my Lord!"</q> returned she, <q rend="inline"> "you are really
                  insufferable. I don't think I shall speak to you again these seven years." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"What a metamorphosis,"</q> cried Lord Orville, <q rend="inline">
                  "should you make a patriarch of his Lord ship!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Seven years!"</q> said he: <q rend="inline"> "dear Madam, be
                  contented with telling me you will not speak to me <hi>after</hi> seven years, and
                  I will endeavour to sub mit." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O, very well, my Lord,"</q> answered she, <q rend="inline"> "pray
                  date the end of our speaking to each other as early as you please, I'll promise to
                  agree to your time." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"You know, dear Madam,"</q> said he, sip ping his tea, <q
                  rend="inline">"you know I only live in your sight."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="148"/>
               <q rend="inline"> "O yes, my Lord, I have long known that. But I begin to fear we
                  shall be too late for Ranelagh this evening." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O no, Madam,"</q> said Mr. Lovel, looking at his watch, <q
                  rend="inline">"it is but just past ten."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No more!"</q> cried she, <q rend="inline">"O then we shall do very
                  well."</q>
            </p>
            <p> All the ladies then started up, and declared they had no time to lose. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why what the D—l,"</q> cried the Captain, (leaning forward with
               both his arms on the ta ble,) <q rend="inline">are you going to Ranelagh at this time
                  of night?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>The ladies looked at one another, and smiled.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"To Ranelagh?"</q> cried Lord —, <q rend="inline"> "Yes, and I hope
                  you are going too; for we cannot possi bly excuse these ladies." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I go to Ranelagh?—if I do, I'll be —."</q>
            </p>
            <p> Every body now stood up, and the stranger Lord, coming round to me, said, <q
                  rend="inline"> " <hi>You</hi> go, I hope?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No, my Lord, I believe not."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O you cannot, must not be so barbarous."</q> And he took my hand,
               and ran on saying such fine speeches and compliments, that I might almost have
               supposed myself a goddess, and him a pagan, paying me adoration. As soon as I
               possibly could, I drew back my hand; but he frequently, in the course of
               conversation, contrived to take it again, though it was extremely disagreeable to me;
               and the more so, as I saw that Lord Orville had his eyes fixed upon us, with a
               gravity of attention that made me uneasy. </p>
            <p> And, surely, my dear Sir, it was a great liberty in this Lord, notwithstanding his
               rank, to treat me <pb n="149"/> so freely. As to Sir Clement, he seemed in mise ry. </p>
            <p> They all endeavoured to prevail with the Captain to join the Ranelagh party; and
               this Lord told me, in a low voice, that <hi>it was tearing his heart out</hi> to go
               without me. </p>
            <p> During this conversation, Mr. Lovel came for ward, and assuming a look of surprise,
               made me a bow, and enquired how I did, protesting, upon his honour, that he had not
               seen me before, or would sooner have paid his respects to me. </p>
            <p> Though his politeness was evidently constrained, yet I was very glad to be thus
               assured of having nothing more to fear from him. </p>
            <p> The Captain, far from listening to their persua sions of accompanying them to
               Ranelagh, was quite in a passion at the proposal, and vowed he would sooner go to the
                  <hi>Black-hole in Calcutta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"But,"</q> said Lord —, <q rend="inline"> "if the <hi>ladies</hi>
                  will take their tea at Ranelagh, you may depend upon our seeing them safe home,
                  for we shall all be proud of the honour of attending them." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"May be so,"</q> said the Captain; <q rend="inline"> "but I'll tell
                  you what, if one of these places be n't enough for them to-night, why to-morrow
                  they shall go to ne'er a one." </q>
            </p>
            <p> We instantly declared ourselves very ready to go home. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"It is not for yourselves that we petition,"</q> said Lord —, <q
                  rend="inline"> "but for <hi>us;</hi> if you have any charity, you will not be so
                  cruel as to deny us; we only beg you to prolong our happiness for a few mi
                  nutes,—the favour is but a small one for you to grant, though so great a one for
                  us to receive." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"To tell you a piece of my mind,"</q> said the Captain, surlily, <q
                  rend="inline"> "I think you might as well not <pb n="150"/> give the girls so much
                  of this palaver: they'll take it all for gospel. As to Moll, why she's well
                  enough, but nothing extraordinary, though, per haps, you may persuade her that her
                  pug-nose is all the fashion: and as to the other, why she's good white and red, to
                  be sure; but what of that?—I'll warrant she'll moulder away as fast as her
                  neighbours." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Is there,"</q> cried Lord —, <q rend="inline"> "another man in this
                  place, who, seeing such objects, could make such a speech?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"As to that there,"</q> returned the Captain, <q rend="inline"> "I
                  don't know whether there be or no, and, to make free, I don't care; for I sha'n't
                  go for to model myself by any of these fair-weather chaps, who dare not so much as
                  say their souls are their own,—and, for aught I know, no more they ben't. I'm
                  almost as much ashamed of my countrymen, as if I was a Frenchman, and I believe in
                  my heart there i'n't a pin to chuse between them; and, before long, we shall hear
                  the very sailors talking that lingo, and see never a swabber without a bag and a
                  sword." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"He, he, he!—well, 'pon honour,"</q> cried Mr. Lovel <q
                  rend="inline"> "you gentlemen of the ocean have a most severe way of judging."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Severe! 'fore George, that is impossible; for, to cut the matter
                  short, the men, as they call themselves, are no better than monkeys; and as to the
                  women, why they are mere dolls. So, now you've got my opinion of this subject; and
                  so I wish you good night." </q>
            </p>
            <p> The ladies, who were very impatient to be gone, made their courtsies, and tripped
               away, fol lowed by all the gentlemen of their party, except the Lord I have
               before-mentioned, and Lord <pb n="151"/> Orville, who stayed to make enquiries of
               Mrs. Mirvan concerning our leaving town; and then saying, with his usual politeness,
               something civil to each of us, with a very grave air, he quit ted us. </p>
            <p> Lord—remained some minutes longer, which he spent in making a prosusion of com
               pliments to me, by which he prevented my hear ing distinctly what Lord Orville said,
               to my great vexation, especially as he looked—I thought so, at least,—as if
               displeased at his particularity of be haviour to me. </p>
            <p> In going to an outward room, to wait for the carriage, I walked, and could not
               possibly avoid it, between this nobleman and Sir Clement Wil loughby; and, when the
               servant said the coach stopped the way, though the latter offered me his hand, which
               I should much have preferred, this same Lord, without any ceremony, took mine
               himself; and Sir Clement, with a look ex tremely provoked, conducted Mrs. Mirvan. </p>
            <p> In all ranks and all stations of lise, how strange ly do characters and manners
               differ! Lord Orville, with a politeness which knows no intermission, and makes no
               distinction, is as unassuming and modest, as if he had never mixed with the great,
               and was totally ignorant of every qualification he possesses; this other Lord, though
               lavish of compliments and fine speeches, seems to be an entire stranger to real good
               breeding; whoever strikes his fancy, engrosses his whole attention. He is forward and
               bold, has an air of haughtiness towards men, and a look of libertinism towards women,
               and his con cious quality seems to have given him a freedom in his way of speaking to
               either sex, that is very lit tle short of rudeness. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152"/> When we returned home, we were all low spirited; the evening's
               entertainment had displeased the Captain, and his displeasure, I believe, discon
               certed us all. </p>
            <p> And here I thought to have concluded my letter; but, to my great surprise, just now
               we had a visit from Lord Orville. He called, he said, to pay his respects to us
               before we left town, and made many enquiries concerning our return; and, when Mrs.
               Mirvan told him we were going into the country without any view of again quitting it,
               he expressed his concern in such terms—so polite, so flattering, so serious—that I
               could hardly forbear being sorry myself. Were I to go immediately to Berry Hill, I am
               sure I should feel nothing but joy;—but, now we are joined by this Captain, and by
               Madame Duval, I must own I expect very little pleasure at Howard Grove. </p>
            <p> Before Lord Orville went Sir Clement Wil loughby called. He was more grave than I
               had ever seen him, and made several attempts to speak to me in a low voice, and to
               assure me that his regret upon the occasion of our journey, was en tirely upon my
               account. But I was not in spirits, and could not bear to be teazed by him. However,
               he has so well paid his court to Captain Mirvan, that he gave him a very hearty
               invitation to the Grove. At this, he brightened,—and, just then, Lord Orville took
               his leave! </p>
            <p> No doubt but he was disgusted at this ill-timed, ill-bred partiality; for surely it
               was very wrong to make an invitation before Lord Orville, in which he was not
               included! I was so much chagrined that, as soon as he went, I left the room; and I
               shall not go down stairs till Sir Clement is gone. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153"/> Lord Orville cannot but observe his assiduous endeavours to ingratiate
               himself into my favour; and does not this extravagant civility of Captain Mirvan,
               give him reason to suppose, that it meets with our general approbation? I cannot
               think upon this subject, without inexpressible uneasiness;—and yet, I can think of

            <p> Adieu, my dearest Sir. Pray write to me im mediately. How many long letters has this
               one short fortnight produced! More than I may, pro bably, ever write again: I fear I
               shall have tired you with reading them, but you will now have time to rest, for I
               shall find but little to say in future. </p>
            <p> And now, most honoured Sir, with all the fol lies and imperfections which I have
               thus faithfully recounted, can you, and with unabated kindness, suffer me to sign
               myself </p>

            <p> HOW much do I rejoice that I can again ad dress my letters to Howard Grove! My
               Evelina would have grieved, had she known the anxiety of my mind, during her
               residence in the great world. My apprehensions have been inexpressibly alarm ing; and
               your journal, at once exciting and <pb n="154"/> relieving my fears, has almost
               wholly occupied me, since the time of your dating it from London. </p>
            <p> Sir Clement Willoughby must be an artful, de signing man; I am extremely irritated
               at his con duct. The passion he pretends for you has neither sincerity nor honour;
               the manner and the oppor tunities he has chosen to declare it, are bordering upon
               insult. </p>
            <p> His unworthy behaviour after the opera, convin ces me, that, had not your vehemence
               frightened him, Queen-Ann-Street would have been the last place whither he would have
               ordered his chariot. O my child, how thankful am I for your escape! I need not now, I
               am sure, enlarge upon your in discretion and want of thought, in so hastily trust ing
               yourself with a man so little known to you, and whose gaiety and flightiness should
               have put you on your guard. </p>
            <p> The nobleman you met at the Pantheon, bold and forward as you describe him to be,
               gives me no apprehension; a man who appears so openly li centious, and who makes his
               attack with so little regard to decorum, is one who, to such a mind as my Evelina's,
               can never be seen but with the disgust which his manners ought to excite. </p>
            <p> But Sir Clement, though he seeks occasions to give real offence, contrives to avoid
               all appearance of intentional evil. He is far more dangerous, be cause more artful;
               but I am happy to observe, that he seems to have made no impression upon your heart,
               and therefore a very little care and prudence may secure you from those designs which
               I fear he has formed. </p>
            <p> Lord Orville appears to be of a better order of beings. His spirited conduct to the
               meanly imper tinent Lovel, and his anxiety for you after the <pb n="155"/> opera,
               prove him to be a man of sense and of feel ing. Doubtless he thought there was much
               reason to tremble for your safety, while exposed to the power of Sir Clement; and he
               acted with a re gard to real honour, that will always incline me to think well of
               him, in so immediately acquaint ing the Mirvan family with your situation. Many men
               of this age, from a false and pretended deli cacy to a friend, would have quietly
               pursued their own affairs, and thought it more honourable to leave an unsuspecting
               young creature to the mercy of a libertine, than to risk his displeasure by taking
               measures for her security. </p>
            <p> Your evident concern at leaving London, is very natural; and yet it afflicts me. I
               ever dread ed your being too much pleased with a life of dis sipation, which youth
               and vivacity render but too alluring; and I almost regret the consent for your
               journey, which I had not the resolution to with hold. </p>
            <p> Alas, my child, the artlessness of your nature, and the simplicity of your
               education, alike unfit you for the thorny paths of the great and busy world. The
               supposed obscurity of your birth and situation, makes you liable to a thousand
               disagree able adventures. Not only my views, but my hopes for your future life, have
               ever centered in the country. Shall I own to you, that, however I may differ from
               Captain Mirvan in other re spects, yet my opinion of the town, its manners,
               inhabitants, and diversions, is much upon a level with his own? Indeed it is the
               general harbour of fraud and of folly, of duplicity and of imperti nence; and I wish
               few things more fervently, than that you may have taken a lasting leave of it. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156"/> Remember, however, that I only speak in re gard to a public and a
               dissipated life; in private families, we may doubtless find as much goodness,
               honesty, and virtue, in London as in the country. </p>
            <p> If contented with a retired station, I still hope I shall live to see my Evelina the
               ornament of her neighbourhood, and the pride and delight of her family: giving and
               receiving joy from such society as may best deserve her affection, and employing
               herself in such useful and innocent occupations as may secure and merit the tenderest
               love of her friends, and the worthiest satisfaction of her own heart. </p>
            <p> Such are my hopes, and such have been my expectations. Disappoint them not, my
               beloved child, but chear me with a few lines, that may assure me, this one short
               fortnight spent in town, has not undone the work of seventeen years spent in the
               country. </p>

            <p> NO, my dear Sir, no; <hi>the work of seventeen years</hi> remains such as it was,
               ever unworthy your time and your labour, but not more so now,—at least I hope
               not,—than before that fortnight which has so much alarmed you. </p>
            <p> And yet, I must confess, that I am not half so happy here at present, as I was ere I
               went to town: but the change is in the place, not in me. Captain <pb n="157"/> Mirvan
               and Madame Duval have ruined Howard Grove. The harmony that reigned here, is dis
               turbed, our schemes are broken, our way of life is altered, and our comfort is
               destroyed. But do not suppose <hi>London</hi> to be the source of these evils; for,
               had our excursion been any where else, so disagree able an addition to our houshold,
               must have caused the same change at our return. </p>
            <p> I was sure you would be displeased with Sir Cle ment, and therefore I am by no means
               surprised at what you say of him: but for lord Orville—I must own I had greatly
               feared, that my weak and im perfect account would not have procured him the good
               opinion which he so well deserves, and which I am delighted to find you seem to have
               of him. O, Sir, could I have done justice to the merit of which I believe him
               possessed,—could I have paint ed him to <hi>you</hi> such as he appeared to
                  <hi>me,</hi> —then, indeed, you would have had some idea of the claim which he has
               to your approbation! </p>
            <p> After the last letter which I wrote in town, no thing more passed previous to our
               journey hither, except a very violent quarrel between Captain Mir van and Madame
               Duval. As the Captain intend ed to travel on horseback, he had settled that we four
               females should make use of his coach. Ma dame Duval did not come to Queen Ann-street,
               till the carriage had waited some time at the door, and then, attended by Monsieur Du
               Bois, she made her appearance. </p>
            <p> The Captain, impatient to be gone, would not suffer them to enter the house, but
               insisted that we should immediately get into the coach. We obeyed; but were no sooner
               seated than Madame Duval said, <q rend="inline"> "Come, Monsieur Du Bois, these <pb
                     n="158"/> girls can make very good room for you; sit closer, children." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Mrs. Mirvan looked quite confounded, and M. Du Bois, after making some apologies
               about crowd ing us, actually got into the coach, on the side with Miss Mirvan and me.
               But no sooner was he seated than the Captain, who had observed this transaction very
               quietly, walked up to the coach door, saying, <q rend="inline">"What neither with
                  your leave, nor by your leave?"</q>
            </p>
            <p> M. Du Bois seemed rather shocked, and began to make abundance of excuses; but the
               Captain neither understood nor regarded him, and, very roughly said, <q rend="inline"
                  > "Look'ee, Monsieur, this here may be a French fashion, for aught I know;—but
                  Give and Take is fair, in all nations; and so now, d'ye see, I'll make bold to
                  shew you an English one." </q>
            </p>
            <p> And then seizing his wrist, he made him jump out of the coach. </p>
            <p> M. Du Bois instantly put his hand upon his sword, and threatened to resent this
               indignity. The Cap tain, holding up his stick, bid him draw at his peril. Mrs.
               Mirvan, greatly alarmed, got out of the coach, and standing between them, entreated
               her husband to re-enter the house. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"None of your clack!"</q> cried he, angirly, <q rend="inline"> "what
                  the D—l, do you suppose I can't ma nage a Frenchman?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> Mean time, Madame Duval called out to M. Du Bois, <q rend="inline"> " <hi> Eh,
                     laissez-le, mon ami, ne le corriger pas; c' est un vilain bête qui ne vaut pas
                     la peine. </hi> " </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> " <hi>Monsieur le Capitaine,</hi> " </q> cried M. Du Bois, <q
                  rend="inline"> " <hi>voulez-vous bien me demander pardon?</hi> " </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O ho, you demand pardon; do you?"</q> said the Captain, <q
                  rend="inline"> "I thought as much; I thought you'd come to;—so you have lost your
                  relish for <pb n="159"/> an English salutation, have you?" </q> strutting up to
               him with looks of defiance. </p>
            <p> A crowd was now gathering, and Mrs. Mirvan again besought her husband to go into the
               house. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why what a plague is the woman afraid of?—did you ever know a
                  Frenchman that could not take an affront?—I warrant Monsieur knows what he is
                  about;—don't you, Monsieur?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> M. Du Bois, not understanding him, only said, <q rend="inline"> " <hi>plait-il,
                     Monsieur?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "No, nor <hi>dish</hi> me, neither," </q> answered the Captain; <q
                  rend="inline"> "but be that as it may, what signifies our parleying here? if
                  you've any thing to propose, speak at once; if not, why let us go on our journey
                  without more ado." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> " <hi>Parbleu, je n'entends rien, moi!</hi> " </q> cried M. Du
               Bois, shrugging his shoulders, and looking very dis mal. </p>
            <p> Mrs. Mirvan then advanced to him, and faid, in French, that she was sure the Captain
               had not any intention to affront him, and begged he would de sist from a dispute
               which could only be productive of mutual misunderstanding, as neither of them knew
               the language of the other. </p>
            <p> This sensible remonstrance had the desired effect, and M. Du Bois, making a bow to
               every one, ex cept the Captain, very wisely gave up the point, and took leave. </p>
            <p> We then hoped to proceed quietly on our jour ney; but the turbulent Captain would
               not yet per mit us: he approached Madame Duval with an exulting air, and said, <q
                  rend="inline"> "Why how's this, Madam? what, has your champion deserted you? why I
                  thought you told me that you old gentlewomen had it all your own way, among them
                  French sparks?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"As to that, Sir,"</q> answered she, <q rend="inline"> "it's not of
                  no consequence what you thought; for a person <pb n="160"/> who can behave in such
                  a low way, may think what he pleases for me, for I sha'n't mind." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why, then, Mistress, since you must needs make so free," </q>
               cried he, <q rend="inline"> "please to tell me the reason why you took the liberty
                  for to ask any of your followers into my coach, without my leave? Answer me to
                  that." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why then, pray, Sir,"</q> returned she, <q rend="inline"> "tell me,
                  the reason why you took the liberty to treat the gentleman in such a impolite way,
                  as to take and pull him neck and heels out? I'm sure he had n't done nothing to
                  affront you, nor nobody else; and I don't know what great hurt he would have done
                  you, by just sitting still in the coach; he would not have eat it." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "What, do you think, then, that my horses have nothing to do, but
                  to carry about your snivel ling Frenchmen? If you do, Madam, I must make bold to
                  tell you, you are out, for I'll see 'em hanged first." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "More brute you, then! for they've never carried nobody half so
                  good" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> Why, look'ee, Madam, if you must needs pro voke me, I'll tell you a
                  piece of my mind; you must know, I can see as far into a mill-stone as another
                  man; and so, if you thought for to fob me off with one of your smirking French
                  puppies for a son-in-law, why you'll find yourself in a hobble,—that's all." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Sir, you're a—but I won't say what;—but, I protest, I had n't no
                  such a thought, no more had n't Monsieur Du Bois." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"My dear,"</q> said Mrs. Mirvan, <q rend="inline">"we shall be very
                  late."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Well, well,"</q> answered he, <q rend="inline"> get away then; off
                  with you, as fast as you can, it's high time. As to Molly, she's fine lady enough
                  in all con science; <pb n="161"/> I want none of your French chaps to make her
                  worse." </q>
            </p>
            <p> And so saying, he mounted his horse, and we drove off. And I could not but think
               with regret of the different feelings we experienced upon leav ing London, to what
               had belonged to our enter ing it! </p>
            <p> During the journey, Madame Duval was so ve ry violent against the Captain, that she
               obliged Mrs. Mirvan to tell her, that, when in her pre sence, she must beg her to
               chuse some other subject of discourse. </p>
            <p> We had a most affectionate reception from Lady Howard, whose kindness and
               hospitality cannot fail of making every body happy, who is disposed so to be. </p>
            <p> Adieu, my dearest Sir. I hope, though I have hitherto neglected to mention it, that
               you have al ways remembered me to whoever has made any enquiry concerning me. </p>

            </opener>
            <p> O MY dear Sir, I now write in the greatest un easiness! Madame Duval has made a
               proposal which terrifies me to death, and which was as unexpected, as it is shocking. </p>
            <p> She had been employed for some hoursthis af ternoon in reading letters from London,
               and, just about tea-time, she sent for me into her room, and said, with a look of
               great satisfaction, <q rend="inline"> "Come <pb n="162"/> here, child, I've got some
                  very good news to tell you: something that will surprise you, I'll give you my
                  word, for you ha'n't no notion of it." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I begged her to explain herself; and then, in terms which I cannot repeat, she said
               she had been considering what a shame it was, to see me such a poor country,
               shame-faced thing, when I ought to be a fine lady; and that she had long, and upon
               several occasions, blushed for me, though she must own the fault was none of mine:
               for nothing bet ter could be expected from a girl who had been so immured. However,
               she assured me she had, at length, hit upon a plan, which would make quite another
               creature of me. </p>
            <p> I waited, without much impatience, to hear what this preface led to; but I was soon
               awakened to more lively sensations, when she acquainted me, that her intention was to
               prove my birthright, and to claim, by law, the inheritance of my real fa mily! </p>
            <p> It would be impossible for me to express my ex treme consternation, when she thus
               unfolded her scheme. My surprise and terror were equally great. I could say nothing;
               I heard her with a silence which I had not the power to break. </p>
            <p> She then expatiated very warmly upon the ad vantages I should reap from her plan;
               talked in a high style of my future grandeur; assured me how heartily I should
               despise almost every body and every thing I had hitherto seen; predicted my mar rying
               into some family of the first rank in the king dom; and, finally, said I should spend
               a few months in Paris, where my education and manners might receive their last
               polish. </p>
            <p> She enlarged also upon the delight she should have, in common with myself, from
               mortifying the <pb n="163"/> pride of certain people, and shewing them, that she was
               not to be slighted with impunity. </p>
            <p> In the midst of this discourse I was relieved by a summons to tea. Madame Duval was
               in great spirits; but my emotion was too painful for con cealment, and every body
               enquired into the cause. I would fain have waved the subject, but Madame Duval was
               determined to make it public. She told them, that she had it in her head to <hi>make
                  something</hi> of me, and that they should soon call me by an other name than that
               of Anville, and yet that she was not going to have the child married neither. </p>
            <p> I could not endure to hear her proceed, and was going to leave the room; which, when
               Lady Howard perceived, she begged Madame Duval would defer her intelligence to some
               other oppor tunity; but she was so eager to communicate her scheme, that she could
               bear no delay, and there fore they suffered me to go, without opposition. Indeed,
               whenever my situation or affairs are men tioned by Madame Duval, she speaks of them
               with such bluntness and severity, that I cannot be en joined a task more cruel than
               to hear her. </p>
            <p> I was afterwards acquainted with some parti culars of the conversation by Miss
               Mirvan, who told me that Madame Duval informed them of her plan with the utmost
               complacency, and seemed to think herself very fortunate in having suggested it; but
               soon after, she accidentally betrayed, that she had been instigated to the scheme by
               her relations the Branghtons, whose letters, which she received to-day, first
               mentioned the proposal. She declared that she would have nothing to do with any <hi>
                  round about ways, </hi> but go openly and instantly to law, in order to prove my
               birth, real name, and title to the estate of my ancestors. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164"/> How impertinent and officious, in these Brangh tons, to interfere thus
               in my concerns! You can hardly imagine what a disturbance this plan has made in the
               family. The Captain without en quiring into any particulars of the affair, has pe
               remptorily declared himself against it, merely be cause it has been proposed by
               Madame Duval, and they have battled the point together with great violence. Mrs.
               Mirvan says she will not even <hi>think,</hi> till she hears your opinion. But Lady
               Howard, to my great surprise, openly avows her approba tion of Madame Duval's
               intention: however, she will write her reasons and sentiments upon the sub ject to
               you herself </p>
            <p> As to Miss Mirvan, she is my second self, and neither hopes nor fears but as I do.
               And as to <hi>me,</hi> —I know not what to say, nor even what to wish; I have often
               thought my fate peculiarly cruel, to have but one parent, and from that one to be
               banished for ever;—while, on the other side, I have but too well known and felt the
               pro priety of the separation. And yet, you may much better imagine than I can express
               the internal an guish which sometimes oppresses my heart, when I reflect upon the
               strange indifferency, that must occasion a father never to make the least enquiry
               after the health, the welfare, or even the life of his child! </p>
            <p> O Sir, to <hi>me,</hi> the loss is nothing!—greatly, sweetly, and most benevolently
               have you guarded me from seeling it;—but for <hi>him,</hi> I grieve indeed!—I must be
               divested, not merely of a filial piety, but of all humanity, could I ever think upon
               this subject, and not be wounded to the soul. </p>
            <p> Again I must repeat, I know not what to <hi>wish:</hi> think for me, therefore, my
               dearest Sir, and suffer <pb n="165"/> my doubting mind, that knows not which way to
               direct its hopes, to be guided by your wisdom and unerring counsel. </p>

            <head type="sub">Lady Howard to the Rev. Mr. Villars.</head>
            <opener>
               <dateline>Howard Grove.</dateline>
               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p> I Cannot give a greater proof of the high opinion I have of your candour, than by
               the liberty I am now going to take, of presuming to offer you ad vice, upon a subject
               concerning which you have so just a claim to act for yourself: but I know you have
               too unaffected a love of justice to be par tially tenacious of your own judgment. </p>
            <p> Madame Duval has been proposing a scheme which has put us all in commotion, and
               against which, at first, in common with the rest of my family, I exclaimed; but upon
               more mature con sideration, I own my objections have almost wholly vanished. </p>
            <p> This scheme is no other than to commence a law-suit with Sir John Belmont, to prove
               the va lidity of his marriage with Miss Evelyn; the ne cessary consequence of which
               proof, will be secur ing his fortune and estate to his daughter. </p>
            <p> And why, my dear Sir, should not this be? I know that, upon first hearing, this plan
               conveys ideas that must shock you; but I know too, that your mind is superior to
               being governed by preju dices, <pb n="166"/> or to opposing any important cause on ac
               count of a few disagreeable attendant circum stances. </p>
            <p> Your lovely charge, now first entering into life, has merit which ought not to be
               buried in obscu rity. She seems born for an ornament to the world. Nature has been
               bountiful to her of whatever she had to bestow; and the peculiar attention you have
               given to her education, has formed her mind to a degree of excellence, that, in one
               so young, I have scarce ever seen equalled. Fortune, alone, has hitherto been sparing
               of her gifts; and she, too, now opens the way which leads to all that is left to wish
               for her. </p>
            <p> What your reasons may have been, my good Sir, for so carefully concealing the birth,
               name, and pretensions of this amiable girl, and forbearing to make any claim upon Sir
               John Belmont, I am to tally a stranger to; but without knowing, I re spect them, from
               the high opinion I have of your character and judgment: but I hope they are not
               insuperable; for I cannot but think, that it was never designed, for one who seems
               meant to grace the world, to have her life devoted to retirement. </p>
            <p> Surely Sir John Belmont, wretch as he has shewn himself, could never see his
               accomplished daughter, and not be proud to own her, and eager to se cure her the
               inheritance of his fortune. The ad miration she met with in town, though merely the
               effect of her external attractions, was such that Mrs. Mirvan assures me, she would
               have had the most splendid offers, had there not seemed to be some mystery in regard
               to her birth, which, she was well informed, was assiduously, though vainly,
               endeavoured to be discovered. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167"/> Can it be right, my dear Sir, that this promis ing young creature
               should be deprived of the for tune and rank of life, to which she is lawfully en
               titled, and which you have prepared her to sup port and to use her so nobly?—To
               despise riches, may, indeed, be philosophic, but to dispense them worthily, must
               surely be more beneficial to man kind. </p>
            <p> Perhaps a few years, or indeed, a much shorter time, may make this scheme
               impracticable: Sir John, though yet young, leads a life too dissipated for long
               duration; and, when too late, we may regret that something was not sooner done; for
               it will be next to impossible, after he is gone, to settle or prove any thing with
               his heirs and exe cutors. </p>
            <p> Pardon the earnestness with which I write my sense of this affair; but your charming
               ward has made me so warmly her friend, that I cannot be in different upon a subject
               of such importance to her future life. </p>
            <p> Adieu, my dear Sir;—send me speedily an an swer to this remonstrance, and believe me
               to be, &amp;c. </p>

               </dateline>
            </opener>
            <p> YOUR letter, Madam, has opened a source of anxiety to which I look forward with
               dread, and which to see closed, I scarcely dare expect. I am <pb n="168"/> unwilling
               to oppose my opinion to that of your Ladyship, nor, indeed, can I, but by arguments
               which, I believe, will rather rank me as a her mit, ignorant of the world, and fit
               only for my cell, than as a proper guardian, in an age such as this, for an
               accomplished young woman. Yet, thus called upon, it behoves me to explain, and en
               deavour to vindicate, the reasons by which I have been hitherto guided. </p>
            <p> The mother of this dear child,—who was led to destruction by her own imprudence, the
               hard ness of heart of Madame Duval, and the villainy of Sir John Belmont,—was once,
               what her daugh ter is now, the best beloved of my heart; and her memory, so long as
               my own holds, I shall love, mourn, and honour! On the fatal day that her gentle foul
               left its mansion, and not many hours ere she ceased to breathe, I solemnly plighted
               my faith, <hi> That her child, if it lived, should know no fa ther, but myself, or
                  her acknowledged husband. </hi>
            </p>
            <p> You cannot, Madam, suppose that I found much difficulty in adhering to this promise,
               and forbearing to make any <hi>claim</hi> upon Sir John Bel mont. Could I feel an
               affection the most paternal for this poor sufferer, and not abominate her de stroyer?
               Could I wish to deliver to <hi>him,</hi> who had so basely betrayed the mother, the
               helpless and innocent offspring, who, born in so much sorrow, seemed entitled to all
               the compassionate tenderness of pity? </p>
            <p> For many years, the <hi>name</hi> alone of that man, accidentally spoken in my
               hearing, almost divested me of my christianity, and scarce could I forbear to
               execrate him. Yet I sought not, neither did I desire, to deprive him of his child,
               had he, with any appearance of contrition, or indeed of huma nity, <pb n="169"/>
               endeavoured to become less unworthy such a blessing; but he is a stranger to all
               parental feel ings, and has, with a savage insensibility, forborne to enquire even
               into the existence of this sweet orphan, though the situation of his injured wife was
               but too well known to him. </p>
            <p> You wish to be acquainted with my intentions.—I must acknowledge, they were such as
               I now perceive would not be honoured with your Lady ship's approbation: for though I
               have sometimes thought of presenting Evelina to her father, and demanding the justice
               which is her due, yet, at other times, I have both disdained and feared the
               application; disdained, lest it should be refused, and feared, lest it should be
               accepted! </p>
            <p> Lady Belmont, who was firmly persuaded of her approaching dissolution, frequently
               and ear nestly besought me, that if her infant was a fe male, I would not abandon her
               to the direction of a man so wholly unfit to take the charge of her education; but,
               should she be importunately demanded, that I would retire with her abroad, and
               carefully conceal her from Sir John, till some apparent change in his sentiments and
               conduct should announce him less improper for such a trust. And often would she say,
                  <q rend="inline"> "Should the poor babe have any feelings correspondent with its
                  mother's, it will have no want, while under your protection." </q> Alas! she had
               no sooner quitted it herself, than she was plunged into a gulph of misery, that
               swallowed up her peace, reputation, and life. </p>
            <p> During the childhood of Evelina, I suggested a thousand plans for the security of
               her birth right;—but I as oftentimes rejected them. I was in a perpetual conflict,
               between the desire that she should have justice done her, and the appre hension <pb
                  n="170"/> that, while I improved her fortune, I should endanger her mind. However,
               as her character began to be formed, and her disposition to be displayed, my
               perplexity abated; the road before me seemed less thorny and intricate, and I thought
               I could perceive the right path from the wrong: for, when I observed the artless open
               ness, the ingenuous simplicity of her nature; when I saw that her guileless and
               innocent soul fancied all the world to be pure and disinterested as herself, and that
               her heart was open to every impression with which love, pity, or art might assail
               it;—then did I flatter myself, that to follow my own inclination, and to secure her
               welfare, was the same thing; since, to expose her to the snares and dangers
               inevitably encircling a house of which the master is dissipated and unprincipled,
               without the guidance of a mother, or any pru dent and sensible female, seemed to me
               no less than suffering her to stumble into some dreadful pit, when the sun was in its
               meridian. My plan, therefore, was not merely to educate and to che rish her as my
               own, but to adopt her the heiress of my small fortune, and to bestow her upon some
               worthy man, with whom she might spend her days in tranquillity, chearfulness, and
               good humour, untainted by vice, folly, or ambition. </p>
            <p> So much for the time past. Such have been the motives by which I have been governed;
               and I hope they will be allowed not merely to account for, but also to justify the
               conduct which has re sulted from them. It now remains to speak of the time to come. </p>
            <p> And here, indeed, I am sensible of difficulties which I almost despair of
               surmounting according to my wishes. I pay the highest deference to your <pb n="171"/>
               Ladyship's opinion, which it is extremely painful to me not to concur with; yet, I am
               so well acquainted with your goodness, that I presume to hope it would not be
               absolutely impossible for me to offer such arguments as might lead you to think with
               me, that this young creature's chance of happiness seems less doubtful in retirement,
               than it would be in the gay and dissipated world: but why should I perplex your
               Ladyship with reasoning that can turn to so little account? for, alas! what
               arguments, what persuasions can I make use of, with any prospect of success, to such
               a woman as Madame Duval? Her character, and the violence of her disposition,
               intimidate me from making the attempt: she is too ignorant for instruction, too
               obstinate for entreaty, and too weak for reason. </p>
            <p> I will not, therefore, enter into a contest from which I have nothing to expect but
               altercation and impertinence. As soon would I discuss the effect of sound with the
               deaf, or the nature of colours with the blind, as aim at illuminating with conviction
               a mind so warped by prejudice, so much the slave of unruly and illiberal passions.
               Unused as she is to controul, persuasion would but harden, and opposition incense
               her. I yield therefore, to the necessity which compels my reluctant acqui escence,
               and shall now turn all my thoughts upon considering of such methods for the
               conducting this enterprize as may be most conducive to the hap piness of my child,
               and least liable to wound her sensibility. </p>
            <p> The law-suit, therefore, I wholly and absolute ly disapprove. </p>
            <p> Will you, my dear Madam, forgive the free dom of an old man, if I own myself greatly
               sur prised, that you could, even for a moment, listen <pb n="172"/> to a plan so
               violent, so public, so totally repugnant to all female delicacy? I am satisfied your
               Lady ship has not weighed this project. There was a time, indeed, when, to assert the
               innocence of Lady Belmont, and to blazon to the world the <hi>wrongs,</hi> not
                  <hi>guilt,</hi> by which she suffered, I pro posed, nay attempted, a similar plan:
               but then, all assistance and encouragement was denied. How cruel to the remembrance I
               bear of her woes, is this tardy resentment of Madame Duval! She was deaf to the voice
               of Nature, though she has hearkened to that of Ambition. </p>
            <p> Never can I consent to have this dear and timid girl brought forward to the notice
               of the world by such a method; a method which will subject her to all the
               impertinence of curiosity, the sneers of conjecture, and the stings of ridicule. And
               for what!—the attainment of wealth, which she does not want, and the gratification of
               vanity, which she does not seel.—A child to appear against a father!—no, Madam, old
               and infirm as I am, I would even yet sooner convey her myself to some remote part of
               the world, though I were sure of dying in the expedition. </p>
            <p> Far different had been the motives which would have stimulated her unhappy mother to
               such a proceeding; all her felicity in this world was irre trievably lost; her life
               was become a burthen to her, and her fair fame, which she had early been taught to
               prize above all other things, had receiv ed a mortal wound: therefore to clear her
               own ho nour, and to secure from blemish the birth of her child, was all the good
               which Fortune had reserv ed herself the <hi>power</hi> of bestowing. But even this
               last consolation was with-held from her! </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="173"/> Let milder measures be adopted; and—since it must be so,—let
               application be made to Sir John Belmont; but as to a law-suit, I hope, upon this
               subject, never more to hear it mentioned. </p>
            <p> With Madame Duval, all pleas of delicacy would be ineffectual; her scheme must be
               opposed by arguments better suited to her understanding. I will not, therefore, talk
               of its impropriety, but endeavour to prove its inutility. Have the good ness, then,
               to tell her, that her own intentions would be frustrated by her plan, since, should
               the law-suit be commenced, and even should the cause be gained, Sir John Belmont
               would still have it in his power, and, if irritated, no doubt in his in clination, to
               cut off her grand-daughter with a shilling. </p>
            <p> She cannot do better, herself, than to remain quiet and inactive in the affair: the
               long and mu tual animosity between her and Sir John, will make her interference
               merely productive of debates and ill-will. Neither would I have Evelina ap pear till
               summoned. And as to myself, I must wholly decline <hi>acting,</hi> though I will,
               with unwea ried zeal, devote all my thoughts to giving coun sel: but, in truth, I
               have neither inclination nor spirits adequate to engaging personally with this man. </p>
            <p> My opinion is, that he would pay more respect to a letter from your Ladyship upon
               this subject, than from any other person. I therefore advise and hope, that you will
               yourself take the trouble of writing to him, in order to open the affair. When he
               shall be inclined to see Evelina, I have for him a posthumous letter, which his
               much-injured lady left to be presented to him, if ever such a meeting should take
               place. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174"/> The views of the Branghtons, in suggesting this scheme, are obviously
               interested; they hope, by securing to Evelina the fortune of her father, to induce
               Madame Duval to settle her own upon themselves. In this, however, they would proba
               bly be mistaken, for little minds have ever a pro pensity to bestow their wealth upon
               those who are already in affluence, and therefore, the less her grand-child requires
               her assistance, the more gladly she will give it. </p>
            <p> I have but one thing more to add, from which, however, I can by no means recede: my
               word so solemnly given to Lady Belmont, that her child should never be owned but with
               herself, must be inviolably adhered to. </p>

            <p> HOW sincerely do I sympathise in the uneasi ness and concern which my beloved

               To follow the dictates of my own heart, I should instantly recal you to myself, and
               never more consent to your being separated from me; but the manners and opinion of

            <p> THE die is thrown, and I attend the event in trembling. Lady Howard has written to
               Paris, and sent her letter to town, to be forwarded in the ambassador's packet, and
               in less than a fortnight, therefore, she expects an answer. O Si <gap

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> , with what anxious impatience shall I await its arrival! upon it seems to
               depend the fate of my future life. My solicitude is so great, and my suspense so pain
               ful, that I cannot rest a moment in peace, or turn my thoughts into any other
               channel. </p>
            <p> Deeply interested as I now am in the event, most sincerely do I regret that the plan
               was ever proposed: methinks it <hi>cannot</hi> end to my satisfacti on; for either I
               must be torn from the arms of my <hi>more</hi> than father,—or I must have the misery
               of being finally convinced, that I am cruelly rejected by him who has the natural
               claim to that dear ti tle; a title, which to write, mention, or think of, fills my
               whole soul with filial tenderness. </p>
            <p> The subject is discussed here eternally. Captain Mirvan and Madame Duval, as usual,
               quarrel when ever <pb n="176"/> it is started: but I am so wholly engrossed by my own
               reflections, that I cannot even listen to them. My imagination changes the scene
               perpe tually: at one moment, I am embraced by a kind and relenting parent, who takes
               me to that heart from which I have hitherto been benished, and supplicates, through
               me, peace and forgiveness from the ashes of my mother!—at another, he regards me with
               detestation, considers me as the living image of an injured saint, and repulses me
               with horror!—But I will not afflict you with the melancholy phantasms of my brain. I
               will endea vour to compose my mind to a more tranquil state, and forbear to write

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p> YOU will, doubtless, be surprised at receiving a letter from one who had for so
               short a period the honour of your acquaintance, and that at so great a distance of
               time; but the motive which has in duced me to take this liberty, is of so delicate a
               nature, that were I to commence making apologies <pb n="177"/> for my officiousness,
               I fear my letter would be too long for your patience. </p>
            <p> You have, probably, already conjectured the subject upon which I mean to treat. My
               regard for Mr. Evelyn and his amiable daughter, was well known to you: nor can I ever
               cease to be interested in whatever belongs to their memory or family. </p>
            <p> I must own myself somewhat distressed in what manner to introduce the purport of my
               writing; yet, as I think that, in affairs of this kind, frank ness is the first
               requisite to a good understanding be tween the parties concerned, I will neither
               torment you nor myself with punctilious ceremonies, but proceed instantly and openly
               to the business which occasions my giving you this trouble. </p>
            <p> I presume, Sir, it would be superfluous to tell you, that your child resides still
               in Dorsetshire, and is still under the protection of the Reverend Mr. Villars, in
               whose house she was born: for, though no enquiries concerning her have reached his
               ears, or mine, I can never suppose it possible you have forborne to make them. It
               only remains, therefore, to tell you, that your daughter is now grown up; that she
               has been educated with the utmost care, and the utmost success; and that she is now a
               most deserving, accomplished, and amia ble young woman. </p>
            <p> Whatever may be your view for her future destination in life, it seems time to
               declare it. She is greatly admired, and, I doubt not, will be very much sought after:
               it is proper, therefore, that her future expectations, and your pleasure concern ing
               her, should be made known. </p>
            <p> Believe me, Sir, she merits your utmost atten tion and regard. You could not see and
               know her, and remain unmoved by those sensations of affec tion <pb n="178"/> which
               belong to so near and tender a relation ship. She is the lovely resemblance of her
               lovely mother;—pardon me, Sir, that I mention that unfortunate lady, but I think it
               behoves me, upon this occasion, to shew the esteem I felt for her; allow me,
               therefore, to say, and be not offended at my freedom, that the memory of that
               excellent lady has but too long remained under the aspersions of calumny; surely it
               is time to vindicate her fame!—and how can that be done in a manner more eligible,
               more grateful to her friends, or more honourable to yourself, than by openly re
               ceiving as your child, <hi>the daughter of the late Lady Belmont?</hi>
            </p>
            <p> The venerable man who has had the care of her education, deserves your warmest
               acknowledgments, for the unremitting pains he has taken, and atten tion he has shewn
               in the discharge of his trust. Indeed she has been peculiarly fortunate in meeting
               with such a friend and guardian: a more worthy man, or one whose character seems
               nearer to per fection, does not exist. </p>
            <p> Permit me to assure you, Sir, she will amply repay whatever regard and favour you
               may hereaf ter shew her, by the comfort and happiness you cannot fail to find in her
               affection and duty. To be owned <hi>properly</hi> by you, is the first wish of her
               heart; and I am sure, that to merit your approba tion will be the first study of her
               life. </p>
            <p> I fear that you will think this address imperti nent; but I must rest upon the
               goodness of my in tention to plead my excuse. </p>

            <p> OUR house has been enlivened to-day, by the arrival of a London visitor; and the
               necessity I have been under of concealing the uneasiness of my mind, has made me
               exert myself so effectu ally, that I even think it is really diminished; or, at
               least, my thoughts are not so totally, so very anxiously occupied by one only
               subject, as they lately were. </p>
            <p> I was strolling this morning with Miss Mirvan, down a lane about a mile from the
               grove, when we heard the trampling of horses; and, fearing the narrowness of the
               passage, we were turning hastily back, but stopped upon hearing a voice call out, <q
                  rend="inline"> "Pray, Ladies, don't be frightened, for I will walk my horse." </q>
               We turned again, and then saw Sir Clement Willoughby. He dismounted, and approaching
               us, with the reins in his hand, presently recollected us. <q rend="inline">"Good
                  Heaven,"</q> cried he, with his usual quickness, <q rend="inline"> "do I see Miss
                  Anville?—and you, too, Miss Mirvan?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> He immediately ordered his servant to take charge of his horse, and then, advancing
               to us, took a hand of each, which he pressed to his lips, and said a thousand fine
               things concerning his good fortune, our improved looks, and the charms of the
               country, when inhabited by <hi>such</hi> rural deities. <q rend="inline"> "The town,
                  Ladies, has lan guished since your absence,—or, at least, I have so much
                  languished myself, as to be absolutely <pb n="180"/> insensible to all it had to
                  offer. One refreshing breeze, such as I now enjoy, awakens me to new vigour, life,
                  and spirit. But I never before had the good luck to see the country in such
                  perfection." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Has not almost every body left town, Sir?"</q> said Miss Mirvan. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "I am ashamed to answer you, Madam—but indeed it is as full as
                  ever, and will continue so, till after the birth-day. However, you ladies, were so
                  little seen, that there were but few who know what it has lost. For my own part, I
                  felt it too sensibly, to be able to endure the place any lon ger." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Is there any body remaining there, that we were acquainted with?"
               </q> cried I. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O yes, Ma'am."</q> And then he named two or three persons we had
               seen when with him; but he did not mention Lord Orville, and I would not ask him,
               lest he should think me curious. Perhaps, if he stays here some time, he may speak of
               him by accident. </p>
            <p> He was proceeding in this complimentary style, when we were met by the Captain; who
               no sooner perceived Sir Clement, than he hastened up to him, gave him a hearty shake
               of the hand, a cordial slap on the back, and some other equally gentle tokens of
               satisfaction, assuring him of his great joy at his visit, and declaring he was as
               glad to see him as if he had been a messenger who brought news that a French ship was
               sunk. Sir Clement, on the other side, expressed himself with equal warmth, and
               protested he had been so eager to pay his re spects to Captain Mirvan, that he had
               left Lon don in its full lustre, and a thousand engage ments <pb n="181"/>
               unanswered, merely to give himself that pleasure. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"We shall have rare sport,"</q> said the Captain, <q rend="inline">
                  "for do you know the old French-woman is among us? 'Fore George, I have scarce
                  made any use of her yet, by reason I have had no body with me that could enjoy a
                  joke: howsom ever, it shall go hard but we'll have some diver sion now." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Sir Clement very much approved of the pro posal; and we then went into the house,
               where he had a very grave reception from Mrs. Mirvan, who is by no means pleased with
               his visit, and a look of much discontent from Madame Duval, who said to me, in a low
               voice, <q rend="inline"> "I'd as soon have seen Old Nick as that man, for he's the
                  most imper tinentest person in the world, and is n't never of my side." </q>
            </p>
            <p> The Captain is now actually occupied in con triving some scheme which, he says, is
                  <hi>to play the old Dowager off;</hi> and so eager and delighted is he at the
               idea, that he can scarcely constrain his raptures sufficiently to conceal his design,
               even from herself. I wish, however, since I do not dare put Madame Duval upon her
               guard, that he had the delicacy not to acquaint me with his intention. </p>

            <p> THE Captain's operations are begun,—and, I hope, ended; for indeed poor Madame Duval
               has already but too much reason to regret Sir Cle ment's visit to Howard Grove. </p>
            <p> Yesterday morning, during breakfast, as the Captain was reading the news-paper, Sir
               Clement suddenly begged to look at it, saying he wanted to know if there was any
               account of a transaction, at which he had been present the evening before his journey
               thither, concerning a poor Frenchman, who had got into a scrape which might cost him
               his life. </p>
            <p> The Captain demanded particulars; and then Sir Clement told him a long story, of
               being with a party of country friends, at the Tower, and hearing a man call out for
               mercy in French; and that, when he enquired into the occasion of his dis tress, he
               was informed, that he had been taken up upon suspicion of treasonable practices
               against the government. <q rend="inline">"The poor fellow,"</q> continued he, <q
                  rend="inline"> "no sooner found that I spoke French, than he besought me to hear
                  him, protesting that he had no evil designs; that he had been but a short time in
                  England, and only waited the return of a Lady from the country, to quit it for
                  ever." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Madame Duval changed colour, and listened with the utmost attention. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Now, though I by no means approve of so many foreigners
                  continually flocking into our coun try," </q>
               <pb n="183"/> added he, addressing himself to the Captain, <q rend="inline"> "yet I
                  could not help pitying the poor wretch, because he did not know enough of English
                  to make his defence: however, I found it impossible to assist him, for the mob
                  would not suffer me to interfere. In truth I am afraid he was but roughly
                  handled." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why, did they duck him?"</q> said the Captain. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Something of that sort,"</q> answered he. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"So much the better! so much the better!"</q> cried the Captain, <q

               <q rend="inline"> "I wish you had been in his place, with all my soul!" </q> cried

            </p>

               <q rend="inline">"Why I did hear his name spoke,"</q> answered Sir Clement, <q

            </p>
            <p> Madame Duval's cup fell from her hand, as she repeated <q rend="inline">"Du Bois!
                  Monsieur Du Bois, did you say?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="184"/>
               <q rend="inline">"I thought at the time,"</q> said Sir Clement, very gravely, <q
                  rend="inline"> "that I had seen the gentleman be fore, and now I recollect, I
                  think it was in com pany with you, Madam." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "With <hi>me,</hi> Sir!" </q> cried Madame Duval. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Say you so!"</q> said the Captain, <q rend="inline"> "why then, it
                  must be he, as sure as you're alive!—Well but, my good friend, what will they do
                  with poor Mon sieur?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"It is difficult to say,"</q> answered Sir Clement, very
               thoughtfully, <q rend="inline"> "but, I should suppose, that if he has not good
                  friends to appear for him, he will be in a very unpleasant situation; for these
                  are serious sort of affairs.' </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why, do you think they'll hang him?"</q> de manded the Captain. </p>
            <p> Sir Clement shook his head, but made no an swer. </p>
            <p> Madame Duval could no longer contain her agitation; she started from her chair,
               repeating, with a voice half choaked, <q rend="inline"> "Hang him!—they can't,—they
                  sha'n't—let them at their peril!—however, 'tis all false, and I won't believe a
                  word of it;—but I'll go to town this very moment, and see M. Du Bois myself;—I
                  won't wait for no thing." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Mrs. Mirvan begged her not to be alarmed; but she flew out of the room, and up
               stairs into her own apartment. Lady Howard blamed both the gentle men for having been
               so abrupt, and followed her. I would have accompanied her, but the Captain stopped
               me; and, having first laughed very hear tily, said he was going to read his
               commission to his ship's company. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Now, do you see,"</q> said he, <q rend="inline"> "as to Lady
                  Howard, I sha'n't pretend for to enlist her into <pb n="185"/> my service, and so
                  I shall e'en leave her to make it out as well as she can; but as to all you, I ex
                  pect obedience and submission to orders; I am now upon a hazardous expedition,
                  having undertaken to convoy a crazy vessel to the shore of Mortifi cation; so,
                  d'ye see, if any of you have any thing to propose, that will forward the
                  enterprize,—why speak and welcome; but if any of you, that are of my chosen crew,
                  capitulate, or enter into any treaty with the enemy,—I shall look upon you as
                  mutinying, and turn you adrift." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Having finished this harangue, which was inter larded with many expressions, and
               sea-phrases, that I cannot recollect, he gave Sir Clement a wink of intelligence, and
               left us to ourselves. </p>
            <p> Indeed, notwithstanding the attempts I so fre quently make of writing some of the
               Captain's conversation, I can only give you a faint idea of his language; for almost
               every other word he ut ters is accompanied by an oath, which, I am sure, would be as
               unpleasant for you to read, as for me to write. And, besides, he makes use of a thou
               sand sea-terms, which are to me quite unintel ligible. </p>
            <p> Poor Madame Duval sent to enquire at all pro bable places, whether she could be
               conveyed to town in any stage-coach; but the Captain's ser vant brought her for
               answer, that no London stage would pass near Howard Grove till to-day. She then sent
               to order a chaise; but was soon as sured that no horses could be procured. She was so
               much inflamed by these disappointments, that she threatened to set out for town on
               foot, and it was with difficulty that Lady Howard dissuaded her from this mad scheme. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186"/> The whole morning was filled up with these en quiries. But, when we
               were all assembled to din ner, she endeavoured to appear perfectly uncon cerned, and
               repeatedly protested that she gave not any credit to the report, as far as it
               regarded M. Du Bois, being very certain that he was not the person in question. </p>
            <p> The Captain used the most provoking efforts to convince her that she deceived
               herself; while Sir Clement, with more art, though not less malice, affected to be of
               her opinion; but, at the same time that he pretended to relieve her uneasiness, by
               saying that he doubted not having mistaken the name, he took care to enlarge upon the
               dan ger to which the <hi>unknown gentleman</hi> was ex posed, and expressed great
               concern at his perilous situation. </p>
            <p> Dinner was hardly removed, when a letter was delivered to Madame Duval. The moment
               she had read it, she hastily demanded from whom it came? <q rend="inline">"A country
                  boy brought it,"</q> answered the servant, <q rend="inline">"but he would not
                  wait."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Run after him this instant!"</q> cried she, <q rend="inline"> "and
                  be sure you bring him back. <hi>Mon Dieu! quel avanture! que ferai-je?</hi> " </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"What's the matter? what's the matter?"</q> said the Captain. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why nothing,—nothing's the matter. <hi>O mon Dieu!</hi> " </q>
            </p>
            <p>And she rose, and walked about the room.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why, what—has Monsieur sent to you?"</q> continued the Captain: <q
                  rend="inline">"is that there letter from him?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "No,—it i'n't;—besides, if it is, it's nothing to you." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="187"/>
               <q rend="inline"> "O then, I'm sure it is! Pray now, Madame, don't be so close; come,
                  tell us all about it,—what does he say? how did he relish the horse pond?—which
                  did he find best, sousing <hi>single</hi> or <hi>double?</hi> —'Fore George, 'twas
                  plaguy unlucky you was not with him!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"It's no such a thing, Sir,"</q> cried she, very angrily, <q
                  rend="inline"> "and if you're so very fond of a horse pond, I wish you'd put
                  yourself into one, and not be always a thinking about other people's being served
                  so." </q>
            </p>
            <p> The man then came in, to acquaint her they could not overtake the boy. She scolded
               violently, and was in such perturbation, that Lady Howard interfered, and begged to
               know the cause of her uneasiness, and whether she could assist her? </p>
            <p> Madame Duval cast her eyes upon the Captain, and Sir Clement, and said she should be
               glad to speak to her Ladyship, without so many witnesses. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Well, then, Miss Anville,"</q> said the Cap tain, turning to me, <q
                  rend="inline"> "do you and Molly go into another room, and stay there till Mrs.
                  Duval has opened her mind to us." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"So you may think, Sir,"</q> cried she, <q rend="inline"> "but who's
                  fool then? no, no, you need n't trouble yourself to make a ninny of me, neither,
                  for I'm not so easily taken in I'll assure you." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Lady Howard then invited her into the dressing room, and I was desired to attend
               her. </p>
            <p> As soon as we had shut the door, <q rend="inline">"O my Lady,"</q> exclaimed Madame
               Duval, <q rend="inline"> "here's the most cruellest thing in the world has
                  happened!—but that Captain is such a beast, I can't say no thing before him,—but
                  it's all true! poor M. Du Bois is tooked up!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188"/> Lady Howard begged her to be comforted, say ing that as M. Du Bois was
               certainly innocent, there could be no doubt of his ability to clear him self. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"To be sure, my Lady,"</q> answered she, <q rend="inline"> "I know
                  he is innocent; and to be sure they'll never be so wicked as to hang him for
                  nothing?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Certainly not;"</q> replied Lady Howa:d, <q rend="inline"> "you
                  have no reason to be uneasy. This is not a coun try where punishment is inflicted
                  without proof." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Very true, my Lady; but the worst thing is this; I cannot bear
                  that that fellow, the Cap tain, should know about it; for if he does, I sha'n't
                  never hear the last of it;—no more won't poor M. Du Bois." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Well, well,"</q> said Lady Howard, <q rend="inline"> "shew me the
                  letter, and I will endeavour to advise you." </q>
            </p>
            <p> The letter was then produced. It was signed by the clerk of a country justice; who
               acquainted her, that a prisoner, then upon trial for suspicion of treasonable
               practices against the government, was just upon the point of being committed to jail,
               but having declared that he was known to her, this clerk had been prevailed upon to
               write, in order to enquire if she really could speak to the character and family of a
               Frenchman who called himself Pierre Du Bois. </p>
            <p> When I heard the letter, I was quite amazed at its success. So improbable did it
               seem, that a fo reigner should be taken before a <hi>country</hi> justice of peace,
               for a crime of so dangerous a nature, that I cannot imagine how Madame Duval could be
               alarmed, even for a moment. But, with all her violence of temper, I see that she is
               easily fright ened, and, in fact, more cowardly than many who <pb n="189"/> have not
               half her spirit; and so little does she re flect upon circumstances, or probability,
               that she is continually the dupe of her own—I ought not to say <hi>ignorance,</hi>
               but yet, I can think of no other word. </p>
            <p> I believe that Lady Howard, from the begin ning of the transaction, suspected some
               contrivance of the Captain, and this letter, I am sure, must confirm her suspicion:
               however, though she is not at all pleased with his frolick, yet she would not hazard
               the consequence of discovering his designs: her looks, her manner, and her character,
               made me draw this conclusion from her apparent perplex ity; for not a word did she
               say, that implied any doubt of the authenticity of the letter. Indeed there seems to
               be a sort of tacit agreement between her and the Captain, that she should not appear
               to be acquainted with his schemes; by which means she at once avoids quarrels, and
               supports her dig nity. </p>
            <p> While she was considering what to propose, Madame Duval begged to have the use of
               her Ladyship's chariot, that she might go immediate ly to the assistance of her
               friend. Lady Howard politely assured her that it would be extremely at her service;
               and then Madame Duval besought her not to own to the Captain what had happened,
               protesting that she could not endure he should know that poor M. Du Bois had met with
               so un fortunate an accident. Lady Howard could not help smiling, though she readily
               promised not to <hi>inform</hi> the Captain of the affair. As to me, she desired my
               attendance; which I was by no means rejoiced at, as I was certain she was going upon
               a fruitless errand. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="190"/> I was then commissioned to order the chariot. </p>
            <p> At the foot of the stairs I met the captain, who was most impatiently waiting the
               result of the conference. In an instant we were joined by Sir Clement. A thousand
               enquiries were then made concerning Madame Duval's opinion of the letter, and her
               intentions upon it: and when I would have left them, Sir Clement, pretending equal
               eagerness with the Captain, caught my hand, and repeatedly detained me, to ask some
               frivolous question, to the answer of which he must be to tally indifferent. At
               length, however, I broke from them; they retired into the parlour, and I executed my
               commission. </p>
            <p> The carriage was soon ready, and Madame Duval, having begged Lady Howard to say she
               was not well, stole softly down stairs, desiring me to follow her. The chariot was
               ordered at the garden door; and when we were seated, she told the man, according to
               the clerk's directions, to drive to Mr. Justice Tyrell's, asking, at the same time,
               how many miles off he lived? </p>
            <p> I expected he would have answered that he knew of no such person; but, to my great
               surprize, he said, <q rend="inline"> "Why 'Squire Tyrell lives about nine miles
                  beyond the park." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Drive fast, then,"</q> cried she, <q rend="inline">"and you sha'n't
                  be no worse for it."</q>
            </p>
            <p> During our ride, which was extremely tedious, she tormented herself with a thousand
               fears for M. Du Bois' safety; and piqued herself very much upon having escaped unseen
               by the Captain, not only that she avoided his triumph, but because she knew him to be
               so much M. Du Bois' enemy, that she was sure he would prejudice the Justice against
               him, and endeavour to take away his life. For <pb n="191"/> my part, I was quite
               ashamed of being engaged in so ridiculous an affair, and could only think of the
               absurd appearance we should make upon our arrival at Mr. Tyrell's. </p>
            <p> When we had been out near two hours, and expected every moment to stop at the place
               of our destination, I observed that Lady Howard's ser vant, who attended us on
               horseback, rode on for ward till he was out of sight, and soon after re turning, came
               up to the chariot-window, and de livering a note to Madame Duval, said he had met a
               boy, who was just coming with it to How ard Grove, from the clerk of Mr. Tyrell. </p>
            <p> While she was reading it, he rode round to the other window, and, making a sign for
               secrecy, put into my hand a slip of paper, on which was written, <q rend="inline">
                  "Whatever happens, be not alarmed,—for <hi>you</hi> are safe,—though you endanger
                  all man kind!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I readily imagined that Sir Clement must be the author of this note, which prepared
               me to expect some disagreeable adventure: but I had no time to ponder upon it, for
               Madame Duval had no sooner read her own letter, than, in an angry tone of voice, she
               exclaimed, <q rend="inline"> "Why now what a thing is this! here we're come all this
                  way for nothing!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> She then gave me the note, which informed her, that she need not trouble herself to
               go to Mr. Tyrell's, as the prisoner had had the address to escape. I congratulated
               her upon this fortunate incident; but she was so much concerned at having rode so far
               in vain, that she seemed less pleased than provoked. However, she ordered the man to
               make what haste he could home, as she hoped, <pb n="192"/> at least to return before
               the Captain should suspect what had passed. </p>
            <p> The carriage turned about, and we journeyed so quietly for near an hour, that I
               began to flatter myself we should be suffered to proceed to How ard Grove without
               further molestation, when, suddenly, the footman called out, <q rend="inline">"John,
                  are we going right?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why I a'n't sure,"</q> said the coachman, <q rend="inline">"but I'm
                  afraid we turned wrong."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"What do you mean by that, Sirrah?"</q> said Madame Duval, <q
                  rend="inline"> "why if you lose your way we shall be all in the dark." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I think we should turn to the left,"</q> said the footman. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"To the left!"</q> answered the other, <q rend="inline"> "No, no,
                  I'm partly sure we should turn to the right." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"You had better make some enquiry,"</q> said I. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> " <hi>Ma foi,</hi> " </q> cried Madame Duval, <q rend="inline">
                  "we're in a fine hole, here!—they neither of them know more than the post.
                  However, I'll tell my Lady, as sure as you're born, so you'd better find the way."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Let's try this lane,"</q> said the footman. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No,"</q> said the coachman, <q rend="inline"> "that's the road to
                  Canterbury; we had best go straight on." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why that's the direct London road,"</q> return ed the footman, <q
                  rend="inline">"and will lead us twenty miles about."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> " <hi>Pardie,</hi> " </q> cried Madame Duval, <q rend="inline">
                  "why they won't go one way nor t'other! and, now we're come all this jaunt for
                  nothing, I suppose we sha'n't get home to-night!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Let's go back to the public-house,"</q> said the footman, <q
                  rend="inline">"and ask for a guide."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="193"/>
               <q rend="inline">"No, no,"</q> said the other, <q rend="inline"> "if we stay here a
                  few minutes, somebody or other will pass by; and the horses are almost knocked up
                  already." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Well, I protest,"</q> cried Madame Duval, <q rend="inline"> "I'd
                  give a guinea to see them sots both horse-whipped! As sure as I'm alive, they're
                  drunk! Ten to one but they'll overturn us next!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> After much debating, they, at length, agreed to go on, till we came to some inn, or
               met with a passenger who could direct us. We soon arrived at a small farm-house, and
               the footman alighted, and went into it. </p>
            <p> In a few minutes he returned, and told us we might proceed, for that he had procured
               a directi on; <q rend="inline">"But,"</q> added he, <q rend="inline"> "it seems there
                  are some thieves hereabouts; and so the best way will be for you to leave your
                  watches and purses with the farmer, who I know very well, and who is an ho nest
                  man, and a tenant of my Lady's." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Thieves!"</q> cried Madame Duval, looking aghast, <q rend="inline">
                  "the Lord help us!—I've no doubt but we shall be all murdered!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> The farmer came to us, and we gave him all we were worth, and the servants followed
               our ex ample. We then proceeded, and Madame Duval's anger so entirely subsided, that,
               in the mildest manner imaginable, she intreated them to make haste, and promised to
               tell their Lady how diligent and obliging they had been. She perpetually stop ped
               them, to ask if they apprehended any danger; and was, at length, so much overpowered
               by her fears, that she made the footman fasten his horse to the back of the carriage,
               and then come and seat himself within it. My endeavours to encou rage her were
               fruitless; she sat in the middle, held the man by the arm, and protested that if he
               did <pb n="194"/> but save her life, she would make his fortune. Her uneasiness gave
               me much concern, and it was with the utmost difficulty I forbore to acquaint her that
               she was imposed upon; but the mutual fear of the Captain's resentment to me, and of
               her own to him, neither of which would have any moderation, deterred me. As to the
               footman, he was evidently in torture from restraining his laughter, and I ob served
               that he was frequently obliged to make hor rid grimaces, from pretended fear, in
               order to con ceal his risibility. </p>
            <p> Very soon after, <q rend="inline">"The robbers are coming!"</q> cried the coachman. </p>
            <p> The footman opened the door, and jumped out of the chariot. </p>
            <p>Madame Duval gave a loud scream.</p>
            <p> I could no longer preserve my silence, <q rend="inline">"For Heaven's sake, my dear
                  Madam,"</q> said I, <q rend="inline"> don't be alarmed,—you are in no danger—you
                  are quite safe, there is nothing but—" </q>
            </p>
            <p> Here the chariot was stopped, by two men in masks, who, at each side, put in their
               hands, as if for our purses. Madame Duval sunk to the bot tom of the chariot, and
               implored their mercy. I shrieked involuntarily, although prepared for the attack: one
               of them held me fast, while the other tore poor Madame Duval out of the carriage, in
               spite of her cries, threats, and resistance. </p>
            <p> I was really frightened, and trembled exceed ingly. <q rend="inline">"My angel!"</q>
               cried the man who held me, <q rend="inline"> "you cannot surely be alarmed,—do you
                  not know me?—I shall hold myself in eternal abhor rence, if I have really
                  terrified you." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Indeed, Sir Clement, you have,"</q> cried I,— <q rend="inline">
                  "but, for Heaven's sake, where is Madame Du val?—why is she forced away?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="195"/>
               <q rend="inline"> "She is perfectly safe; the Captain has her in charge: but suffer

            </p>
            <p> And then he hastily came into the chariot, and seated himself next to me. I would
               fain have disen gaged myself from him, but he would not let me; <q rend="inline"
                  >"Deny me not, most charming of women,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "deny me

               <q rend="inline"> "And will you,—can you command my ab sence?—When may I speak to

            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Wish you well!—O, Miss Anville, point but out to me how, in what

               <q rend="inline"> "I want <hi>nothing,</hi> Sir, that you can offer;—I beg you not to

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "The scheme was the Captain's; I even oppo sed it: though, I own, I

                  myself that the note I had charged the footman to give you would have prevented
                  the alarm you have received." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Well, Sir, you have now, I hope, said enough; and, if you will not

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"And when may I speak to you again?"</q>

               <q rend="inline">"Perhaps what, my angel?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Perhaps <hi>never,</hi> Sir,—if you torment me thus." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Never! O Miss Anville, how cruel, how pier cing to my soul is that

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> Then, Sir, you must not provoke it. Pray leave me directly." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "I will, Madam: but let me, at least, make a merit of my

                  your self for a few moments alone with me." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I was surprized at the freedom of this request; but while I hesitated how to answer
               it, the other mask came up to the chariot door, and in a voice almost stifled with
               laughter, said, <q rend="inline"> "I've done for her! the old buck is safe;—but we
                  must sheer off directly, or we shall be all a-ground." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="197"/> Sir Clement instantly left me, mounted his horse, and rode off. The
               Captain, having given some directions to the servants, followed him. </p>
            <p> I was both uneasy and impatient to know the fate of Madame Duval, and immediately
               got out of the chariot to seek her. I desired the footman to shew me which was she
               was gone; he pointed with his finger, by way of answer, and I saw that he dared not
               trust his voice to make any other. I walked on, a very quick pace, and soon, to my
               great consternation, perceived the poor lady, seated upright in a ditch. I flew to
               her, with unfeigned concern at her situation. She was sobbing, nay, almost roaring,
               and in the utmost agony of rage and terror. As soon as she saw me she redoubled her
               cries, but her voice was so broken, I could not un derstand a word she said. I was so
               much shocked, that it was with difficulty I forbore exclaiming against the cruelty of
               the Captain, for thus wan tonly ill-treating her; and I could not forgive my self for
               having passively suffered the deception. I used my utmost endeavours to comfort her,
               assuring her of our present safety, and begging her to rise, and return to the
               chariot. </p>
            <p> Almost bursting with passion, she pointed to her feet, and with frightful violence,
               she actually beat the ground with her hands. </p>
            <p> I then saw, that her feet were tied together with a strong rope, which was fastened
               to the upper branch of a tree, even with an hedge which ran along the ditch where she
               sat. I endeavoured to untie the knot, but soon sound it was infinitely be yond my
               strength. I was, therefore, obliged to apply to the footman; but being very unwilling
               to add to his mirth, by the sight of Madame Duval's situation, I desired him to lend
               me a knife; I <pb n="198"/> returned with it, and cut the rope. Her feet were soon
               disentangled, and then, though with great dif ficulty, I assisted her to rise. But
               what was my astonishment, when, the moment she was up, she hit me a violent slap on
               the face! I retreated from her with precipitation and dread, and she then loaded me
               with reproaches, which, though almost unintelligible, convinced me that she imagined
               I had voluntarily deserted her; but she seemed not to have the slightest suspicion
               that she had not been attacked by real robbers. </p>
            <p> I was so much surprized and confounded at the blow, that, for some time, I suffered
               her to rave, without making any answer; but her extreme agi tation, and real
               suffering, soon dispelled my an ger, which all turned into compassion. I then told
               her, that I had been forcibly detained from following her, and assured her of my real
               sorrow at her ill usage. </p>
            <p> She began to be somewhat appeased; and I again entreated her to return to the
               carriage, or give me leave to order that it should draw up to the place where we
               stood. She made no answer, till I told her, that the longer we remained still, the
               greater would be the danger of our ride home. Struck with this hint, she suddenly,
               and with hasty steps, moved forward. </p>
            <p> Her dress was in such disorder, that I was quite sorry to have her figure exposed to
               the servants, who all of them, in imitation of their master, hold her in derision:
               however, the disgrace was unavoidable. </p>
            <p> The ditch, happily, was almost quite dry, or she must have suffered still more
               severely; yet, so forlorn, so miserable a figure, I never before saw. Her head-dress
               had fallen off; her linen was torn; <pb n="199"/> her negligee had not a pin left in
               it; her petticoats she was obliged to hold on; and her shoes were perpetually
               slipping off. She was covered with dirt, weeds, and filth, and her face was really
               horrible, for the pomatum and powder from her head, and the dust from the road, were
               quite <hi>pasted</hi> on her skin by her tears, which, with her <hi>rouge,</hi> made
               so frightful a mixture, that she hardly looked hu man. </p>
            <p> The servants were ready to die with laughter, the moment they saw her; but not all
               my remon strances could prevail upon her to get into the car riage, till she had most
               vehemently reproached them both, for not rescuing her. The footman, fixing his eyes
               on the ground, as if fearful of again trusting himself to look at her, protested that
               the robbers had vowed they would shoot him, if he moved an inch, and that one of them
               had stay ed to watch the chariot, while the other carried her off; adding, that the
               reason of their behaving so barbarously, was to revenge our having secured our
               purses. Notwithstanding her anger, she gave immediate credit to what he said, and
               really ima gined that her want of money had irritated the pretended robbers to treat
               her with such cruelty. I determined, therefore, to be carefully upon my guard, not to
               betray the imposition, which could now answer no other purpose, than occasioning an
               irreparable breach between her and the Captain. </p>
            <p> Just as we were seated in the chariot, she dis covered the loss which her head had
               sustained, and called out, <q rend="inline"> "My God! what is become of my hair?—why
                  the villain has stole all my curls!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> She then ordered the man to run and see if he could find any of them in the ditch.
               He went, and presently returning, produced a great quantity <pb n="200"/> of hair, in
               such a nasty condition, that I was amazed she would take it; and the man as he de
               livered it to her, found it impossible to keep his countenance; which she had no
               sooner observed, than all her stormy passions were again raised. She flung the
               battered curls in his face, saying, <q rend="inline"> "Sirrah, what do you grin for?
                  I wish you'd been served so yourself, and you would n't have found it no such
                  joke: you are the impudentest fellow ever I see, and if I find you dare grin at me
                  any more, I shall make no ceremony of boxing your ears." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Satisfied with the threat, the man hastily retired, and we drove on. </p>
            <p> Her anger now subsiding into grief, she began most sorrowfully to lament her case.
                  <q rend="inline">"I believe,</q> she cried, <q rend="inline"> "never nobody was so
                  unlucky as I am! and so here, because I ha'n't had misfortunes enough already,
                  that puppy has made me lose my curls!—Why, I can't see nobody without them:—only
                  look at me,—I was never so bad off in my life before. <hi>Pardie,</hi> if I'd
                  know'd as much, I'd have brought two or three sets with me: but I'd never a
                  thought of such a thing as this." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Finding her now somewhat pacified, I ventured to ask an account of her adventure,
               which I will endeavour to write in her own words. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why, child, all this misfortune comes of that puppy making us
                  leave our money behind us; for as soon as the robber see I did not put nothing in
                  his hands, he lugged me out of the chariot, by main force, and I verily thought
                  he'd have mur dered me. He was as strong as a lion; I was no more in his hands
                  than a child. But I believe never nobody was so abused before, for he dragged me
                  down the road, pulling and hawling me all the way, as if I'd no more feeling than
                  a horse. I'm sure I <pb n="201"/> wish I could see that man cut up and quartered
                  alive! however, he'll come to the gallows, that's one good thing. So, as soon as
                  we'd got out of sight of the chariot,—though he need n't have been afraid, for if
                  he'd beat me to a mummy, those cowardly fellows would n't have said nothing to
                  it.—So, when I was got there, what does he do, but, all of a sudden, he takes me
                  by both the shoulders, and he gives me such a shake!— <hi>Mon Dieu!</hi> I shall
                  never forget it, if I live to be an hundred. I'm sure I dare say I'm out of joint
                  all over. And, though I made as much noise as ever I could, he took no more notice
                  of it than nothing at all, but there he stood, shaking me in that man ner, as if
                  he was doing it for a wager. I'm de termined, if it costs me all my fortune, I'll
                  see that villain hanged. He shall be found out, if there's e're a justice in
                  England. So when he had shooked me till he was tired, and I felt all over like a
                  jelly, without saying never a word, he takes and pops me into the ditch! I'm sure
                  I thought he'd have murdered me, as sure as I ever thought any thing in my life,
                  for he kept bumping me about, as if he thought nothing too bad for me. However,
                  I'm resolved I'll never leave my purse behind me again, the longest day I have to
                  live. So when he could n't stand over me no longer, he holds out his hands again
                  for my money; but he was as cunning as he could be, for he would n't speak a word,
                  because I should n't swear to his voice; however, that sha'nt save him, for I'll
                  swear to him any day in the year, if I can but catch him. So, when I told him I
                  had no money, he fell to jerking me again, just as if he had but that moment
                  begun! And, after that he got me close by a tree, and out of his pocket he pulls a
                     <pb n="202"/> great cord!—It's a wonder I did not swoon away, for as sure as
                  you're alive, he was going to hang me to that tree. I screamed like any thing mad,
                  and told him if he would but spare my life, I'd never prosecute him, nor tell
                  nobody what he'd done to me: so he stood some time quite in a brown study, a
                  thinking what he should do. And so, after that, he forced me to sit down in the
                  ditch, and he tied my feet together, just as you see them, and then, as if he had
                  not done enough, he twitched off my cap, and, without saying no thing, got on his
                  horse, and left me in that con dition, thinking, I suppose, that I might lie there
                  and perish." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Though this narrative almost compelled me to laugh, yet I was really irritated with
               the Captain, for carrying his love of tormenting,— <hi>sport,</hi> he calls it,—to
               such barbarous and unjustifiable ex tremes. I consoled and soothed her as well as I
               was able, and told her that, since M. Du Bois had escaped, I hoped, when she
               recovered from her fright, all would end well. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Fright, child!"</q> repeated she, <q rend="inline"> "why, that's
                  not half;—I promise you, I wish it was; but here I'm bruised from top to toe, and
                  it's well if ever I have the right use of my limbs again. How ever, I'm glad the
                  villain got nothing but his trouble for his pains. But here the worst is to come,
                  for I can't go out, because I have got no curls, and so he'll be escaped, before I
                  can get to the Justice to stop him. I'm resolved I'll tell Lady Howard how her man
                  served me, for if he had'nt made me fling 'em away, I dare say I could have pinned
                  them up well enough for the country." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Perhaps Lady Howard may be able to lend you a cap that will wear
                  without them." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="203"/>
               <q rend="inline"> "Lady Howard, indeed! why, do you think I'd wear one of her
                  dowdies? No, I'll promise you, I sha'nt put on no such disguisement. It's the
                  unluckiest thing in the world that I did not make the man pick up the curls again;
                  but he put me in such a passion, I could not think of nothing. I know I can't get
                  none at Howard Grove for love nor money, for of all the stupid places ever I see,
                  that Howard Grove is the worst! there's never no getting nothing one wants." </q>
            </p>
            <p> This sort of conversation lasted till we arrived at our journey's end; and then, a
               new distress occurred; Madame Duval was eager to speak to Lady Howard and Mrs.
               Mirvan, and to relate her misfortunes, but she could not endure that Sir Clement or
               the Captain should see her in such disor der, for she said they were so ill-natured,
               that in stead of pitying her, they would only make a jest of her disasters. She
               therefore sent me first into the house, to wait for an opportunity of their being out
               of the way, that she might steal up stairs un observed. In this I succeeded, as the
               gentlemen thought it most prudent not to seem watching for her; though they both
               contrived to divert them selves with peeping at her as she passed. </p>
            <p> She went immediately to bed, where she had her supper. Lady Howard and Mrs. Mirvan
               both of them very kindly sat with her, and listened to her tale with compassionate
               attention; while Miss Mirvan and I retired to our own room, where I was very glad to
               end the troubles of the day in a comfortable conversation. </p>
            <p> The Captain's raptures, during supper, at the success of his plan, were boundless. I
               spoke, afterwards, to Mrs. Mirvan, with the openness which her kindness encourages,
               and begged her to <pb n="204"/> remonstrate with him upon the cruelty of torment ing
               Madame Duval so causelessly. She promised to take the first opportunity of starting
               the subject, but said he was at present, so much elated that he would not listen to
               her with any patience. How ever should he make any new efforts to molest her, I can
               by no means consent to be passive. Had I imagined he would have been so violent, I
               would have risked his anger in her defence much sooner. </p>
            <p> She has kept her bed all day, and declares she is almost bruised to death. </p>
            <p> Adieu, dear Sir. What a long letter have I written! I could almost fancy I sent it
               you from London! </p>

         <div n="34" type="letter">
            <head>LETTER XXXIV</head>

            <p> THIS insatiable Captain, if left to himself, would not, I believe, rest, till he had
               tormented Madame Duval into a fever. He seems to have no de light but in terrifying
               or provoking her, and all his thoughts apparently turn upon inventing such me thods
               as may do it most effectually. </p>
            <p> She had her breakfast again in bed yesterday morning; but during ours, the Captain
               with a very significant look at Sir Clement, gave us to understand, that he thought
               she had now rested long enough to bear the hardships of a fresh cam paign. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="205"/> His meaning was obvious, and, therefore, I re solved to endeavour
               immediately to put a stop to his intended exploits. When breakfast was over, I
               followed Mrs. Mirvan out of the parlour, and begged her to lose no time in pleading
               the cause of Madame Duval with the Captain. <q rend="inline">"My love,"</q> answered
               she, <q rend="inline"> I have already expostulated with him; but all I can say is
                  fruitless, while his fa vourite Sir Clement contrives to urge him on." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Then I will go and speak to Sir Clement,"</q> said I, <q
                  rend="inline">"for I know he will desist, if I request him."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Have a care, my dear,"</q> said she, smiling, <q rend="inline"> "it
                  is sometimes dangerous to make requests to men, who are too desirous of receiving
                  them." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Well then, my dear Madam, will you give me leave to speak myself
                  to the Captain? </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Willingly; nay, I will accompany you to him."</q>
            </p>
            <p> I thanked her, and we went to seek him. He was walking in the garden with Sir
               Clement. Mrs. Mirvan most obligingly made anopening for my pur pose, by saying, <q
                  rend="inline">"Mr. Mirvan, I have brought a petitioner with me."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why, what's the matter now?"</q> cried he. </p>
            <p> I was fearful of making him angry, and stam mered very much, when I told him, I
               hoped he had no new plan for alarming Madame Duval. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> " <hi>New</hi> plan!" </q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "why, you
                  don't sup pose the <hi>old</hi> one would do again, do you? Not but what it was a
                  very good one, only I doubt she would n't bite." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Indeed, Sir,</q> said I, <q rend="inline"> "she has already suf
                  fered too much, and I hope you will pardon me, if I take the liberty of telling
                  you, that I think it <pb n="206"/> my duty to do all in my power to prevent her
                  being again so much terrified." </q>
            </p>
            <p> A sullen gloominess instantly clouded his face, and, turning short from me, he said,
               I might do as I pleased, but that I should much sooner repent than repair my
               officiousness. </p>
            <p> I was too much disconcerted at this rebuff, to attempt making any answer, and,
               finding that Sir Clement warmly espoused my cause, I walked away, and left them to
               discuss the point together. </p>
            <p> Mrs. Mirvan, who never speaks to the Captain when he is out of humour, was glad to
               follow me, and, with her usual sweetness, made a thousand apologies for her husband's
               ill-manners. </p>
            <p> When I left her, I went to Madame Duval, who was just risen, and employed in
               examining the cloaths she had on the day of her ill usage. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Here's a sight! cried she. Come here, child,—only look—
                     <hi>Pardie,</hi> so long as I've lived, I never see so much before! Why all my
                  things are spoilt, and, what's worse, my sacque was as good as new. Here's the
                  second negligee I've used in this man ner!—I am sure I was a fool to put it on, in
                  such a lonesome place as this; however, if I stay here these ten years, I'll never
                  put on another good gown, that I'm resolved." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Will you let the maid try if she can iron it out, or clean it,
                  Ma'am? </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "No, she'll only make bad worse.—But look here, now, here's a
                  cloak! <hi>Mon Dieu!</hi> why it looks like a dish-clout! Of all the unluckinesses
                  that ever I met, this is the worst! for, do you know, I bought it but the day
                  before I left Paris?—Besides, into the bargain, my cap's quite gone; where the
                  villain twitched it, I don't know, but I see no more of it from that time to this
                  Now you <pb n="207"/> must know this was the becomingest cap I had in the world,
                  for I've never another with pink ribbon in it; and, to tell you the truth, if I
                  had n't thought to have seen M. Du Bois, I'd no more have put it on than I'd have
                  flown; for as to what one wears in such a stupid place as this, it signifies no
                  more than nothing at all." </q>
            </p>
            <p> She then told me, that she had been thinking all night of a contrivance to hinder
               the Captain's finding out her loss of curls; which was, having a large gauze
               handkerchief pinned on her head as a hood, and saying she had the tooth-ach. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"To tell you the truth,"</q> added she, <q rend="inline"> "I be
                  lieve that Captain is one of the worst men in the world; he's always making a joke
                  of me; and as to his being a gentleman, he has no more manners than a bear, for
                  he's always upon the grin when one's in distress, and, I declare, I'd rather be
                  done any thing to than laughed at, for, to my mind, it's one or other the
                  disagreeablest thing in the world." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Mrs. Mirvan, I found, had been endeavouring to dissuade her from the design she had
               formed, of having recourse to the law, in order to find out the supposed robbers; for
               she dreads a discovery of the Captain, during Madame Duval's stay at Howard Grove, as
               it could not fail being productive of in finite commotion. She has, therefore, taken
               great pains to shew the inutility of applying to justice, unless she were more able
               to describe the offen ders against whom she would appear, and has as sured her, that
               as she neither heard their voices, nor saw their faces, she cannot possibly swear to
               their persons, or obtain any redress. </p>
            <p> Madame Duval, in telling me this, extremely lamented her hard fate, that she was
               thus pre vented <pb n="208"/> from revenging her injuries; which, how ever, she vowed
               she would not be persuaded to <hi>pocket tamely,</hi>
               <q rend="inline">"because,"</q> added she, <q rend="inline"> "if such vil lains as
                  these are let to have their own way, and nobody takes no notice of their
                  impudence, they'll make no more ado than nothing at all of tying people in
                  ditches, and such things as that: however, I shall consult with M. Du Bois, as
                  soon I can ferret out where he's hid himself. I'm sure I've a right to his advice,
                  for it's all along of his gaping about at the Tower that I've met with these
                  misfor tunes." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "M. Du Bois, said I, will, I am sure, be very sorry when he hears
                  what has happened." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "And what good will that do now?—that won't unspoil all my cloaths;
                  I can tell him, I a'n't much obliged to him, though it's no fault of his;—yet it
                  i'n't the less provokinger for that. I'm sure, if he had been there, to have seen
                  me served in that manner, and put neck and heels into a ditch, he'd no more have
                  thought it was me, than the Pope of Rome. I'll promise you, what ever you may
                  think of it, I sha'n't have no rest, night nor day, till I find out that rogue."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "I have no doubt, Madam, but you will soon discover him." </q>

            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> " <hi>Pardie,</hi> if I do, I'll hang him, as sure as fate!—but
                  what's the oddest, is that he should take such a 'special spite against
                     <hi>me,</hi> above all the rest! it was as much for nothing, as could be, for I
                  don't know what I have done, so particular bad, to be used in that manner: I'm
                  sure, I had n't given him no of fence, as I know of, for I never see his face all
                  the time; and as to screaming a little, I think it's very hard if one must n't do
                  such a thing as that, when one's put in fear of one's life." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="209"/> During this conversation, she endeavoured to ad just her head-dress,
               but could not at all please her self. Indeed, had I not been present, I should have
               thought it impossible for a woman at her time of life to be so very difficult in
               regard to dress. What she may have in view, I cannot imagine, but the labour of the
               toilette seems the chief business of her life. </p>
            <p> When I left her, in my way down stairs, I met with Sir Clement, who, with great
               earnestness, said he must not be denied the honour of a mo ment's conversation with
               me; and then, without waiting for an answer, he led me to the garden, at the door of
               which, however, I absolutely insisted upon stopping. </p>
            <p> He seemed very serious, and said, in a very grave tone of voice, <q rend="inline">
                  "At length, Miss Anville, I flat ter myself that I have hit upon an expedient that
                  will oblige you, and therefore, though it is death to myself, I will put it in
                  practice." </q>
            </p>
            <p>I begged him to explain himself.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "I saw your desire of saving Madame Duval, and scarce could I
                  refrain giving the brutal Captain my real opinion of his savage conduct; but I am
                  unwilling to quarrel with him, lest I should be de nied entrance into a house
                  which you inhabit: I have been endeavouring to prevail with him to give up his
                  absurd new scheme, but I find him im penetrable;—I have therefore determined to
                  make a pretence for suddenly leaving this place, dear as it is to me, and
                  containing all I most admire and adore;—and I will stay in town till the violence
                  of this boobyish humour is abated." </q>
            </p>
            <p> He ssopped; but I was silent, for I knew not what I ought to say. He took my hand,
               which he pressed to his lips, saying, <q rend="inline"> "And must I, then, <pb
                     n="210"/> Miss Anville, must I quit you—sacrifice voluntarily my greatest
                  felicity,—and yet not be honoured with one word, one look of approbation?"— </q>
            </p>
            <p> I withdrew my hand, and said, with a half laugh, <q rend="inline"> "You know so
                  well, Sir Clement, the value of the favours you confer, that it would be superflu
                  ous for me to point it out." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Charming, charming girl! how does your wit, your understanding
                  rise upon me daily! and must I, can I part with you?—will no other me thod—" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "O Sir, do you so soon repent the good office you had planned for
                  Madame Duval?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "For Madame Duval!—cruel creature, and will you not even suffer me
                  to place to your account the sacrifice I am about to make?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "You must place it, Sir, to what account you please; but I am too
                  much in haste now to stay here any longer." </q>
            </p>
            <p> And then I would have left him, but he held me, and, rather impatiently, said, <q
                  rend="inline"> "If, then, I cannot be so happy as to oblige <hi>you,</hi> Miss
                  Anville, you must not be surprised, should I seek to oblige myself. If my scheme
                  is not honoured with your approbation, for which alone it was formed, why should
                  I, to my own infinite dissatisfaction, pur sue it?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> We were then, for a few minutes, both silent; I was really unwilling he should give
               up a plan, which would so effectually break into the Captain's designs, and, at the
               same time, save me the pain of disobliging him; and I should instantly and thankfully
               have accepted his offered civility, had not Mrs. Mirvan's caution made me fearful.
               How ever, when he pressed me to speak, I said, in an ironical voice, <q rend="inline"
                  > "I had thought, Sir, that the very <pb n="211"/> strong sense you have yourself
                  of the favour you propose to me, would sufficiently have repaid you, but, as I was
                  mistaken, I must thank you myself. And now," </q> making a low courtesy, <q
                  rend="inline">"I hope, Sir, you are satisfied."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Loveliest of thy sex—"</q> he began, but I for ced myself from him,
               and ran up stairs. </p>
            <p> Soon after, Miss Mirvan told me that Sir Cle ment had just received a letter, which
               obliged him instantly to leave the Grove, and that he had actually ordered a chaise.
               I then acquainted her with the real state of the affair. Indeed, I con ceal nothing
               from her, she is so gentle and sweet tempered, that it gives me great pleasure to
               place an entire confidence in her. </p>
            <p> At dinner, I must own, we all missed him; for though the flightiness of his
               behaviour to me, when we are by ourselves, is very distressing, yet, in large
               companies, and general conversation, he is ex tremely entertaining and agreeable. As
               to the Captain, he has been so much chagrined at his de parture, that he has scarce
               spoken a word since he went: but Madame Duval, who made her first pub lic appearance
               since her accident, was quite in rap tures that she escaped seeing him. </p>
            <p> The money which we left at the farm-house, has been returned to us. What pains the
               Captain must have taken to arrange and manage the adven tures which he chose we
               should meet with! Yet he must certainly be discovered, for Madame Du val is already
               very much perplexed, at having re ceived a letter this morning from M. Du Bois, in
               which he makes no mention of his imprisonment. However, she has so little suspicion,
               that she im putes his silence upon the subject, to his fears that the letter might be
               intercepted. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="212"/> Not one opportunity could I meet with, while Sir Clement was here, to
               enquire after his friend Lord Orville: but I think it was strange he should never
               mention him unasked. Indeed, I rather won der that Mrs. Mirvan herself did not
               introduce the subject, for she always seemed particularly atten tive to him. </p>
            <p> And now, once more, all my thoughts involun tarily turn upon the letter I so soon
               expect from Pa ris. This visit of Sir Clement has, however, somewhat diverted my
               fears, and therefore I am ve ry glad he made it at this time. Adieu, my dear Sir.

            <p> I Have this moment the honour of your Lady ship's letter, and I will not wait
               another, before I return an answer. </p>
            <p> It seldom happens that a man, though extolled as a saint, is really without blemish;
               or that another, though reviled as a devil, is really with out humanity. Perhaps the
               time is not very dis tant, when I may have the honour to convince your Ladyship of
               this truth, in regard to Mr. Villars and myself. </p>
            <p> As to the young Lady, whom Mr. Villars so obligingly proposes presenting to me, I
               wish her all the happiness to which, by your Ladyship's account, she seems entitled;
               and if she has a third <pb n="213"/> part of the merit of <hi>her</hi> to whom you
               compare her, I doubt not but Mr. Villars will be more success ful in every other

               may be pleased to favour me. </p>

               </dateline>
            </opener>
            <p> WELL, my dear Sir, all is now over! the letter so anxiously expected, is at length
               arrived, and my doom is fixed. The various feelings which oppress me, I have not
               language to describe; nor need I,—you know my heart, you have yourself formed it,—and
               its sensations upon this occasion, you may but too readily imagine </p>
            <p> Outcast as I am; and rejected for ever by him to whom I of right belong,—shall I now
               implore <hi>your</hi> continual protection?—no, no,—I will not offend your generous
               heart (which, open to distress, has no wish but to relieve it) with an application
               that would seem to imply a doubt. I am more secure than ever of your kindness, since
               you now know upon that is my sole dependance. </p>
            <p> I endeavour to bear this stroke with composure, and in such a manner as if I had
               already received your counsel and consolation. Yet, at times, my <pb n="214"/>
               emotions are almost too much for me. O Sir, what a letter for a parent to write! must
               I not myself be deaf to the voice of Nature, if I could endure to be thus absolutely
               abandoned, without regret? I dare not, even to you, nor would I, could I help it, to
               myself, acknowledge all that I think; for, indeed, I have, sometimes, sentiments upon
               this rejection, which my strongest sense of duty can scarcely correct. Yet, suffer me
               to ask,—might not this answer have been softened?—was it not enough to disclaim me
               for ever, without treating me with contempt, and wounding me with de rision? </p>
            <p> But, while I am thus thinking of myself, I for get how much more <hi>he</hi> is the
               object of sorrow, than I am! Alas, what amends can he make him self, for the anguish
               he is hoarding up for time to come! My heart bleeds for him, whenever this re
               flection occurs to me. </p>
            <p> What is said of <hi>you,</hi> my protector, my friend, my benefactor!—I dare not
               trust myself to com ment upon. Gracious Heaven! what a return for goodness so
               unparalleled! </p>
            <p> I would fain endeavour to divert my thoughts from this subject, but even that is not
               in my pow er; for, afflicting as this letter is to me, I find that it will not be
               allowed to conclude the affair, though it does all my expectations: for Madame Duval
               has determined not to let it rest here. She heard the letter in great wrath, and
               protested she would not be so easily answered; she regretted her faci lity, in having
               been prevailed upon to yield the di rection of this affair to those who knew not how
               to manage it, and vowed she would herself undertake and conduct it in future. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="215"/> It is in vain that I have pleaded against her reso lution, and besought
               her to forbear an attack, where she has nothing to expect but resentment; especi ally
               as there seems to be a hint, that Lady Howard will one day be more openly dealt with:
               she will not hear me; she is furiously bent upon a project which is terrible to think
               of,—for she means to go go herself to Paris, take me with her, and there, <hi>face to
                  face,</hi> demand justice! </p>
            <p> How to appease or to persuade her, I know not; but for the universe would I not be
               dragged, in such a manner, to an interview so awful, with a parent I have never yet
               beheld! </p>
            <p> Lady Howard and Mrs. Mirvan are both of them infinitely shocked at the present
               situation of affairs, and they seem to be even more kind to me than ever; and my dear
               Maria, who is the friend of my heart, uses her utmost efforts to console me, and,
               when she fails in her design, with still greater kind ness, she sympathises in my
               sorrow. </p>
            <p> I very much rejoice, however, that Sir Clement Willoughby had left us before this
               letter arrived. I am sure the general confusion of the house would, otherwise, have
               betrayed to him the whole of a tale which I now, more than ever, wish to have buried
               in oblivion. </p>
            <p> Lady Howard thinks I ought not to disoblige Madame Duval, yet she acknowledges the
               impropri ety of my accompanying her abroad upon such an enterprize. Indeed I would
               rather die, than force myself into his presence. But so vehement is Ma dame Duval,
               that she would instantly have com pelled me to attend her to town, in her way to
               Paris, had not Lady Howard so far exerted herself, as to declare she could by no
               means consent to my <pb n="216"/> quitting her house, till she gave me up to you, by
               whose permission I had entered it. </p>
            <p> She was extremely angry at this denial; and the Captain, by his sneers and raillery,
               so much en creased her rage, that she has positively declared, should your next
               letter dispute her authority to guide me by her own pleasure, she will, without
               hesitation, make a journey to Berry Hill, and <hi>teach you to know who she is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p> Should she put this threat in execution, nothing could give me greater uneasiness,
               for her violence and volubility would almost distract you. </p>
            <p> Unable as I am to act for myself, or to judge what conduct I ought to pursue, how
               grateful do I feel myself, that I have such a guide and direc tor to counsel and
               instruct me as yourself! </p>
            <p> Adieu, my dearest Sir! Heaven, I trust, will never never let me live to be repulsed
               and derided by <hi>you,</hi> to whom I may now sign myself </p>

            <p> LET not my Evelina be depressed by a stroke of fortune for which she is not
               responsible. No breach of duty on your part, has incurred the unkind ness which has
               been shewn you, nor have you, by any act of imprudence, provoked either censure or
               reproach. Let me entreat you, therefore, my dearest child, to support yourself with
               that cou rage <pb n="217"/> which your innocency ought to inspire; and let all the
               affliction you allow yourself, be for him only, who not having that support, must one
               day be but too severely sensible how much he wants it. </p>
            <p> The hint thrown out concerning myself, is wholly unintelligible to me: my heart, I
               dare own, fully acquits me of vice, but <hi>without blemish,</hi> I have never
               ventured to pronounce myself. How ever, it seems his intention to be hereafter more
               explicit, and <hi>then,</hi> —should any thing appear, that has, on <hi>my</hi> part,
               contributed to those misfortunes we lament, let me, at least, say, that the most
               partial of my friends cannot be so much astonished as I shall myself be, at such a
               discovery. </p>
            <p> The mention, also, of any <hi>future applications</hi> I may make, is equally beyond
               my comprehension. But I will not dwell upon a subject which almost compels from me
               reflections that cannot but be wounding to a heart so formed for filial tenderness as
               my Evelina's. There is an air of mystery throughout the letter, the explanation of
               which I will await in silence. </p>
            <p> The scheme of Madame Duval is such as might be reasonably expected from a woman so
               little inured to disappointment, and so totally incapable of considering the delicacy
               of your situation. Your averseness to her plan gives me pleasure, for it exactly
               corresponds with my own. Why will she not make the journey she projects by herself?
               She would not have even the wish of an opposition to encounter. And then, once more,
               might my child and myself be left to the quiet enjoyment of that peaceful happiness,
               which she alone has inter rupted. As to her coming hither, I could, indeed, dispense
               with such a visit; but, if she will not be <pb n="218"/> satisfied with my refusal by
               letter, I must submit to the task of giving it her in person. </p>
            <p> My impatience for your return is encreased by your account of Sir Clement
               Willoughby's visit to Howard Grove. I am but little surprized at the perseverance of
               his assiduities to interest you in his favour; but I am very much hurt that you
               should be exposed to addresses, which, by their privacy, have an air that shocks me.
               You cannot, my love, be too circumspect; the slightest carelessness on your part,
               will be taken advantage of, by a man of his disposition. It is not sufficient for you
               to be reserved; his conduct even calls for your resent ment: and should he again, as
               will doubtless be his endeavour, contrive to solicit your favour in private, let your
               disdain and displeasure be so marked, as to constrain a change in his behaviour.
               Though, indeed, should his visit be repeated while you remain at the Grove, Lady
               Howard must pardon me if I shorten your's. </p>
            <p> Adieu, my child. You will always make my respects to the hospitable family to which

               </dateline>
               <salute>Dear Madam,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p> I BELIEVE your Ladyship will not be surprized at hearing I have had a visit from
               Madame Duval, as I doubt not her having made known her inten tion before she left
               Howard Grove. I would gladly <pb n="219"/> have excused myself this meeting, could I
               have avoided it decently; but, after so long a journey, it was not possible to refuse
               her admittance. </p>
            <p> She told me, that she came to Berry Hill, in consequence of a letter I had sent to
               her grand daughter, in which I had forbid her going to Pa ris. Very roughly, she then
               called me to account for the authority which I assumed! and, had I been disposed to
               have argued with her, she would very angrily have disputed the right by which I used
               it. But I declined all debating. I therefore listened very quietly, till she had so
               much fatigued herself with talking, that she was glad, in her turn, to be silent. And
               then I begged to know the pur port of her visit. </p>
            <p> She answered, that she came to make me re linquish the power I had usurped over her
               grand daughter, and assured me she would not quit the place till she succeeded. </p>
            <p> But I will not trouble your Ladyship with the particulars of this disagreeable
               conversation; nor should I, but on account of the result, have cho sen so unpleasant
               a subject for your perusal. How ever, I will be as concise as I possibly can, that
               the better occupations of your ladyship's time may be the less impeded. </p>
            <p> When she found me inexorable in refusing Eve lina's attending her to Paris, she
               peremptorily in sisted, that she should, at least, live with her in London, till Sir
               John Belmont's return. I re monstrated against this scheme with all the energy in my
               power; but the contest was vain; she lost her patience, and I my time. She declared
               that if I was resolute in opposing her, she would instantly make a will, in which she
               would leave all her <pb n="220"/> fortune to strangers, though, otherwise, she in
               tended her grand-daughter for her sole heiress. </p>
            <p> To me, I own, this threat seemed of little consequence; I have long accustomed
               myself to think, that, with a competency, of which she is sure, my child might be as
               happy as in the posses sion of millions: but the incertitude of her future fate,
               deters me from following implicitly the dic tates of my present judgment. The
               connections she may hereafter form, the style of life for which she may be destined,
               and the future family to which she may belong, are considerations which give but too
               much weight to the menaces of Ma dame Duval. In short, Madam, after a discourse
               infinitely tedious, I was obliged, though very re luctantly, to compromise with this
               ungovernable woman, by consenting that Evelina should pass one month with her. </p>
            <p> I never made a concession with so bad a grace, or so much regret. The violence and
               vulgarity of this woman, her total ignorance of propriety, the family to which she is
               related, and the compa ny she is likely to keep, are objections so forcible to her
               having the charge of this dear child, that nothing less than my diffidence of the
               right I have of depriving her of so large a fortune, would have induced me to listen
               to her proposal. Indeed we parted, at last, equally discontented, she, at what I had
               refused, I, at what I had granted. </p>
            <p> It now only remains for me to return your Lady ship my humble acknowledgments for
               the kind ness which you have so liberally shewn to my ward, and to beg you would have
               the goodness to part with her, when Madame Duval thinks proper <pb n="221"/> to claim
               the promise which she has extorted from me. I am, </p>

            <p> WITH a reluctance which occasions me inex pressible uneasiness, I have been almost
               compelled to consent that my Evelina should quit the protection of the hospitable and
               respectable Lady Howard, and accompany Madame Duval to a city to which I had hoped
               she had bid an eternal adieu. But alas, my dear child, we are the slaves of custom,
               the dupes of prejudice, and dare not stem the torrent of an opposing world, even
               though our judgments con demn our compliance! however, since the die is cast, we must
               endeavour to make the best of it. </p>
            <p> You will have occasion, in the course of the month you are to pass with Madame
               Duval, for all the circumspection and prudence you can call to your aid: she will
               not, I know, propose any thing to you which she thinks wrong herself; but you must
               learn not only to <hi>judge</hi> but to <hi>act</hi> for your self; if any schemes
               are started, any engagements made, which your understanding represents to you as
               improper, exert yourself resolutely in avoiding them, and do not, by a too passive
               facility, risk the censure of the world, or your own future regret. </p>
            <p> You cannot too assiduously attend to Madame Duval herself; but I would wish you to
               mix as lit tle <pb n="222"/> as possible with her associates, who are not like ly to
               be among those whose acquaintance would re flect credit upon you. Remember, my dear
               Eve lina, nothing is so delicate as the reputation of a woman: it is, at once, the
               most beautiful and most brittle of all human things. </p>
            <p> Adieu, my beloved child; I shall be but ill at ease till this month is elapsed. </p>

            <p> ONCE more, my dearest Sir, I write to you from this great city. Yesterday morning,
               with the truest concern, I quitted the dear inhabitants of Howard Grove, and most
               impatiently shall I count the days till I see them again. Lady Howard and Mrs. Mirvan
               took leave of me with the most flatter ing kindness; but indeed I knew not how to
               part with Maria, whose own apparent sorrow redoubled mine. She made me promise to
               send her a letter every post. And I shall write to her with the same fre <gap
                  reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> om, and almost the same confidence, you allow me to make use of to yourself. </p>
            <p> The Captain was very civil to me, but he wrangled with poor Madame Duval to the last
               mo ment; and, taking me aside, just before we got into the chaise, he said, <q
                  rend="inline"> "Hark'ee, Miss Anville, I've a favour for to ask of you, which is
                  this; that you will write us word how the old gentlewoman finds herself, when she
                  sees it was all a trick; and <pb n="223"/> what the French lubber says to it, and
                  all about it." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I answered that I would obey him, though I was very little pleased with the
               commission, which, to me, was highly improper: but he will either treat me as an
                  <hi>informer,</hi> or make me a party in his frolic. </p>
            <p> As soon as we drove away, Madame Duval, with much satisfaction, exclaimed <q
                  rend="inline"> " <hi>Dieu merci,</hi> we've got off at last! I'm sure I never
                  desire to see that place again. It's a wonder I've got away alive; for I believe
                  I've had the worst luck ever was known, from the time I set my foot upon the
                  threshold. I know I wish I'd never a gone. Besides, into the bargain, it's the
                  most dullest place in all Christen dom: there's never no diversions, nor nothing
                  at all." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Then she bewailed M. Du Bois, concerning whose adventures she continued to make
               various conjectures during the rest of our journey. </p>
            <p> When I asked her what part of London she should reside in, she told me that Mr.
               Branghton was to meet us at an inn, and would conduct us to a lodging. Accordingly,
               we proceeded to a house in Bishopsgate-street, and were led by a waiter in to a room
               where we found Mr. Branghton. </p>
            <p> He received us very civilly, but seemed rather surprised at seeing me, saying <q
                  rend="inline"> "Why I did n't think of your bringing Miss; however she's very
                  welcome." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I'll tell you how it was,"</q> said Madame Duval; <q rend="inline">
                  "you must know I've a mind to take the girl to Paris, that she may see something
                  of the world, and improve herself a little; besides, I've another rea son, that
                  you and I will talk more about; but do you know, that meddling old parson as I
                  told you of, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> ould not let her go: however, I'm resolved I'll <pb n="224"/> be even with
                  him, for I shall take her on with me, without saying never a word more to nobody."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p> I started at this intimation, which very much surprised me. But I am very glad she
               has discover ed her intention, as I shall be carefully upon my guard not to venture
               from town with her. </p>
            <p> Mr. Branghton then hoped we had passed our time agreeably in the country. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O Lord, Cousin,"</q> cried she, <q rend="inline"> "I've been the
                  miserablest creature in the world! I'm sure all the horses in London shan't drag
                  me into the country again of one while: why how do you think I've been
                  served?—only guess." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Indeed, Cousin, I can't pretend to do that."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why then I'll tell you. Do you know, I've been robbed!—that is,
                  the villain would have robbed me if he could, only I'd secured all my money." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why then, Cousin, I think your loss can't have been very great."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "O Lord, you don't know what you're a say ing; you're talking in
                  the unthinkingest manner in the world: why it was all along of not having no
                  money, that I met with that misfortune." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "How's that, Cousin? I don't see what great misfortune you can have
                  met with, if you'd se cured all your money." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "That's because you don't know nothing of the matter; for there the
                  villain came to the chaise, and because we had n't got nothing to give him, though
                  he'd no more right to our money than the man in the moon, yet, do you know, he
                  fell into the greatest passion ever you see, and abused me in such a manner, and
                  put me in a ditch, and got a rope, o' purpose to hang me,—and I'm sure, if that
                  was n't misfortune enough, why I don't know what is." </q>

            <p>
               <pb n="225"/>
               <q rend="inline"> "This is a hard case, indeed, Cousin. But why don't you go to
                  justice Fielding?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "O, as to that, I'm a going to him directly; but only I want first
                  to see poor M. Du Bois, for the oddest thing of all is, that he has wrote to me,
                  and never said nothing of where he is, nor what's become of him, nor nothing
                  else." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "M. Du Bois! why he's at my house at this very time." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "M. Du Bois at your house! well, I declare this is the
                  surprisingest part of all! however, I as sure you, I think he might have comed for
                  me, as well as you, considering what I have gone through on his account; for, to
                  tell you the truth, it was all along of him that I met with that accident; so I
                  don't take it very kind of him, I promise you." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Well but, Cousin, tell me some of the par ticulars of this
                  affair." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "As to the particulars, I'm sure they'd make your hair stand an end
                  to hear them; however, the beginning of it all was thro' the fault of M. Du Bois:
                  but, I'll assure you, he may take care of himself in future, since he don't so
                  much as come to see if I'm dead or alive;—but there I went for him to a justice of
                  peace, and rode all out of the way, and did every thing in the world, and was used
                  worser than a dog, and all for the sake of serv ing him, and now, you see, he
                  don't so much—well, I was a fool for my pains,—however, he may get somebody else
                  to be treated so another time, for if he's taken up every day in the week, I'll
                  never go after him no more." </q>
            </p>
            <p> This occasioned an explanation, in the course of which, Madame Duval, to her utter
               amazement, heard that M. Du Bois had never left London dur ing her absence! nor did
               Mr. Branghton believe <pb n="226"/> that he had ever been to the Tower, or met with
               any kind of accident. </p>
            <p> Almost instantly, the whole truth of the tran saction seemed to <hi>rush upon her
                  mind,</hi> and her wrath was inconceivably violent. She asked me a thou sand
               questions in a breath, but, fortunately, was too vehement to attend to my
               embarrassment, which must, otherwise, have betrayed my know ledge of the deceit.
               Revenge was her first wish, and she vowed she would go the next morning to Justice
               Fielding, and enquire what punishment she might lawfully inflict upon the Captain for
               his assault. </p>
            <p> I believe we were an hour in Bishopsgate-street, ere poor Madame Duval could allow
               any thing to be mentioned but her own story; at length, how ever, Mr. Branghton told
               her, that M. Du Bois, and all his own family, were waiting for her at his house. A
               hackney-coach was then called, and we proceeded to Snow-hill. </p>
            <p> Mr. Branghton's house is small and inconveni ent, though his shop, which takes in
               all the ground floor, is large and commodious. I believe I told you before that he is
               a silver-smith. </p>
            <p> We were conducted up two pair of stairs, for the dining-room, Mr. Branghton told us,
               was <hi>let.</hi> His two daughters, their brother, M. Du Bois, and a young man, were
               at tea. They had waited some time for Madame Duval, but I found they had not any
               expectation that I should accompany her; and the young ladies, I believe, were rather
               more surprised than pleased when I made my ap pearance; for they seemed hurt that I
               should see their apartment. Indeed I would willingly have saved them that pain, had
               it been in my power. </p>
            <p> The first person who saw me was M. Du Bois: <pb n="227"/>
               <q rend="inline"> " <hi>Ah, mon Dieu!</hi> " </q> exclaimed he, <q rend="inline">

               <q rend="inline">"Goodness,"</q> cried young Branghton, <q rend="inline">if there is

                  it's all your fault, for you know very well I wanted to borrow Mr. Smith's room,
                  only you were so <hi>grumty,</hi> you would not let me." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Lord, what signifies;"</q> said the brother, <q rend="inline"> "I
                  dare be sworn Miss has been up two pair of stairs before now;—Ha'n't you, Miss?"
               </q>
            </p>
            <p> I begged that I might not give them the least disturbance, and assured them that I
               had not any choice in regard to what room we sat in. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Well,"</q> said Miss Polly, <q rend="inline"> "when you come next,
                  Miss, we'll have Mr. Smith's room; and it's a very pretty one, and only up one
                  pair of stairs, and nicely furnished, and every thing." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"To say the truth,"</q> said Miss Branghton, <q rend="inline"> "I
                  thought that my cousin would not, upon any ac count, have come to town in the
                  summer time; for it's not at all the <hi>fashion,</hi> —so, to be sure, thinks I,
                  she'll stay till September, when the play-houses open." </q>
            </p>
            <p> This was my reception, which I believe you will not call a very <hi>cordial</hi>
               one. Madame Duval, who, after having severely reprimanded M. Du Bois for his
               negligence, was just entering upon the story of her misfortunes, now wholly engaged
               the company. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="228"/> M. Du Bois listened to her with a look of the utmost horror, repeatedly
               lifting up his eyes and hands, and exclaiming, <q rend="inline"> " <hi>O ciel! quel
                     barbare!</hi> " </q> The young ladies gave her the most earnest atten tion; but
               their brother, and the young man, kept a broad grin upon their faces during the whole
               reci tal. She was, however, too much engaged to observe them: but, when she mentioned
               having been tied in a ditch, young Branghton, no longer able to constrain himself,
               burst into a loud laugh, declaring that he had never heard any thing so <hi> fun ny
               </hi> in his life! His laugh was heartily re-echoed by his friend; the Miss
               Branghtons could not resist the example; and poor Madame Duval, to her extreme
               amazement, was absolutely overpowered and stopped by the violence of their mirth. </p>
            <p> For some minutes the room seemed quite in an uproar; the rage of Madame Duval, the
               astonish ment of M. Du Bois, and the angry interrogato ries of Mr. Branghton, on one
               side; the convul sive tittering of the sisters, and the loud laughs of the young men,
               on the other, occasioned such noise, passion, and confusion, that had any one stopped
               an instant on the stairs, he must have concluded himself in Bedlam. At length,
               however, the fa ther brought them to order; and, half laughing, half frightened, they
               made Madame Duval some very awkward apologies. But she would not be prevailed upon to
               continue her narrative, till they had protested they were laughing at the Captain,
               and not at her. Appeased by this, she resumed her story; which, by the help of
               stuffing hand kerchiefs into their mouths, the young people heard with tolerable
               decency. </p>
            <p> Every body agreed, that the ill usage the Cap tain had given her was
                  <hi>actionable,</hi> and Mr. Brangh ton <pb n="229"/> said he was sure she might
               recover what da mages she pleased, since she had been put in fear of her life. </p>
            <p> She then, with great delight, declared, that she would lose no time in satisfying
               her revenge, and vowed she would not be contented with less than half his fortune: <q
                  rend="inline">"For though,"</q> said she, <q rend="inline"> "I don't put no value
                  upon the money, because, <hi>Dieu merci,</hi> I ha'n't no want of it, yet I don't
                  wish for nothing so much as to punish that fellow; for, I'm sure, whatever's the
                  cause of it, he owes me a great <hi>grudge,</hi> and I know no more what it's for
                  than you do, but he's always been doing me one spite or other, ever since I knew
                  him." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Soon after tea, Miss Branghton took an oppor tunity to tell me, in a whisper, that
               the young man I saw was a lover of her sister's, that his name was Brown, and that he
               was a haberdasher, with many other particulars of his circumstances and family; and
               then she declared her utter aversion to the thoughts of such a match; but added, that
               her sister had no manner of spirit or ambition, though for her part, she would ten
               times rather die an old maid, than marry any person but a gen tleman. <q
                  rend="inline">And, for that matter,"</q> added she, <q rend="inline"> "I believe
                  Polly herself don't care much for him, only she's in such a hurry, because, I
                  suppose, she's a mind to be married before me; however, she's very welcome, for
                  I'm sure, I don't care a pin's point whether I ever marry at all;—it's all one to
                  me." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Some time after this, Miss Polly contrived to tell <hi>her</hi> story. She assured
               me, with much titter ing, that her sister was in a great fright, lest she should be
               married first, <q rend="inline">"So I make her believe that I will,"</q> continued
               she, <q rend="inline"> "for I love dearly to plague her a little; though, I declare,
                  I don't <pb n="230"/> intend to have Mr. Brown in reality; I'm sure I don't like
                  him half well enough,—do you, Miss?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "It is not possible for me to judge of his me rits, said I, as I am
                  entirely a stranger to him." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"But what do you think of him, Miss?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why, really, I—I don't know—"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "But do you think him handsome? Some peo ple reckon him to have a
                  good pretty person,—but, I'm sure, for my part, I think he's monstrous ugly:—don't
                     <hi>you,</hi> Miss?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "I am no judge,—but I think his person is very—very well—." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> " <hi>Very well!</hi> —Why, pray, Miss," </q> in a tone of
               vexation, <q rend="inline">"what fault can you find with it?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O, none at all!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "I'm sure you must be very ill-natured if you could. Now there's
                  Biddy says she thinks no thing of him,—but I know it's all out of spite. You must
                  know, Miss, it makes her as mad as can be, that I should have a lover before her,
                  but she's so proud, that nobody will court her, and I often tell her she'll die an
                  old maid. But, the thing is, she has taken it into her head, to have a liking for
                  Mr. Smith, as lodges on the first floor; but, Lord, he'll never have her, for he's
                  quite a fine gentleman; and besides, Mr. Brown heard him say, one day, that he'd
                  never marry as long as he lived, for he'd no opinion of matrimony." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"And did you tell your sister this?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "O, to be sure I told her directly; but she did not mind me;
                  however, if she will be a fool, she must." </q>
            </p>
            <p> This extreme want of affection, and good-na ture, increased the distaste I already
               felt for these unamiable sisters; and a confidence so entirely un solicited <pb
                  n="231"/> and unnecessary, manifested equally their folly and their want of
               decency. </p>
            <p> I was very glad when the time for our departing arrived. Mr. Branghton said our
               lodgings were in Holborn, that we might be near his house, and neighbourly. He
               accompanied us to them himself. </p>
            <p> Our rooms are large and not inconvenient; our landlord is an hosier. I am sure I
               have a thousand reasons to rejoice that I am so little known; for my present
               situation is, in every respect, very un enviable, and I would not, for the world, be
               seen by any acquaintance of Mrs. Mirvan. </p>
            <p> This morning Madame Duval, attended by all the Branghtons, actually went to a
               Justice in the neighbourhood, to report the Captain's ill usage of her. I had great
               difficulty in excusing myself from being of the party, which would have given me very
               serious concern. Indeed, I was extremely anxious, though at home, till I heard the
               result of the application; for I dread to think of the unea siness which such an
               affair would occasion the amiable Mrs. Mirvan. But, fortunately, Madame Duval has
               received very little encouragement to proceed in her design, for she has been
               informed that, as she neither heard the voice, nor saw the face of the person
               suspected, she will find it diffi cult to cast him upon <hi>conjecture,</hi> and will
               have but little probability of gaining her cause, unless she can procure witnesses of
               the transaction. Mr. Branghton, therefore, who has considered all the circumstances
               of the affair, is of opinion, that the law-suit will not only be expensive, but
               tedious and hazardous, and has advised against it. Ma dame Duval, though very
               unwillingly, has ac quiesced in his decision; but vows that if ever she is so
               affronted again, she will be revenged, even if <pb n="232"/> she ruins herself. I am
               extremeiy glad that this ridiculous adventure seems now likely to end with out more
               serious consequences. </p>
            <p> Adieu, my dearest Sir. My direction is at Mr. Dawkins's, a hosier, in High Holborn.

            <p> I HAVE no words, my sweet friend, to express the thankfulness I feel for the
               unbounded kindness which you, your dear mother, and the much-ho noured Lady Howard,
               have shewn me; and still less can I find language to tell you with what re luctance I
               parted from such dear and generous friends, whose goodness reflects, at once, so much
               honour on their own hearts, and on her to whom it has been so liberally bestowed. But
               I will not repeat what I have already written to the kind Mrs. Mirvan; I will
               remember your admonitions, and confine to my own breast that gratitude with which you
               have filled it, and teach my pen to dwell upon subjects less painful to my generous
               correspondent. </p>
            <p> O Maria, London now seems no longer the same place where I lately enjoyed so much
               happi ness; every thing is new and strange to me; even the town itself has not the
               same aspect:—my situ ation so altered! my home so different!—my com panions so
               changed!—But you well know my averseness to this journey. </p>
            <p> Indeed, to me, London now seems a desart; that gay and busy appearance it so lately
               wore, is now succeeded by a look of gloom, fatigue, and lassi tude; the air seems
               stagnant, the heat is intense, <pb n="233"/> the dust intolerable, and the
               inhabitants illiterate and under-bred. At least, such is the face of things in the
               part of the town where I at present reside. </p>
            <p> Tell me, my dear Maria, do you never re trace in your memory the time we past here
               when together? to mine, it recurs for ever! And yet, I think I rather recollect a
               dream, or some visionary fancy, than a reality.—That I should ever have been known to
               Lord Orville,—that I should have spoken to—have danced with him,—seems now a romantic
               illusion: and that elegant politeness, that flattering attention, that high-bred
               delicacy, which so much distinguished him above all other men, and which struck us
               with such admiration, I now re trace the remembrance of, rather as belonging to an
               object of ideal perfection, formed by my own imagination, than to a being of the same
               race and nature as those with whom I at present converse. </p>
            <p> I have no news for you, my dear Miss Mirvan, for all that I could venture to say of
               Madame Du val, I have already written to your sweet mother; and as to adventures, I
               have none to record. Si tuated as I now am, I heartily hope I shall not meet with
               any; my wish is to remain quiet and unnoticed. </p>

            <p> YESTERDAY morning, we received an invitation to dine and spend the day at Mr. Brangh
               ton's; <pb n="234"/> and M. Du Bois, who was also invited, called to conduct us to
               Snow-hill. </p>
            <p> Young Branghton received us at the door, and the first words he spoke were, <q
                  rend="inline">"Do you know, "Sisters a'n't dressed yet?"</q>
            </p>
            <p> Then, hurrying us into the house, he said to me, <q rend="inline"> "Come, Miss, you
                  shall go up stairs and catch 'em,—I dare say they're at the glass." </q>
            </p>
            <p> He would have taken my hand, but I declined his civility, and begged to follow
               Madame Duval. Mr. Branghton then appeared, and led the way himself. We went, as
               before, up two pair of stairs; but the moment the father opened the door, the
               daughters both gave a loud scream. We all stopped, and then Miss Branghton called
               out, <q rend="inline"> "Lord, Papa, what do you bring the company up here for? why,
                  Polly and I a'n't half dressed." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"More shame for you,"</q> answered he, <q rend="inline"> here's your
                  aunt, and cousin, and M. Du Bois, all wait ing, and ne'er a room to take them to."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Who'd have thought of their coming so soon?"</q> cried she: <q
                  rend="inline"> "I'm sure for my part I thought Miss was used to nothing but
                  quality hours." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why, I shan't be ready this half-hour yet,"</q> said Miss Polly; <q
                  rend="inline">"can't they stay in the shop till we're dressed?"</q>
            </p>
            <p> Mr. Branghton was very angry, and scolded them violently; however, we were obliged
               to de scend, and stools were procured for us in the shop, where we found the brother,
               who was highly de lighted, he said, that his sisters had been <hi>catched;</hi> and
               he thought proper to entertain me with a long account of their tediousness, and the
               many quar rels they all had together. </p>
            <p> When, at length, these ladies were equipped to their satisfaction, they made their
               appearance; but <pb n="235"/> before any conversation was suffered to pass between
               them and us, they had a long and most disagreeable dialogue with their father, to
               whose reprimands, though so justly incurred, they replied with the utmost pertness
               and rudeness, while their brother, all the time, laughed aloud. </p>
            <p> The moment they perceived this, they were so much provoked, that, instead of making
               any apologies to Madame Duval, they next began a quarrel with him. <q rend="inline">
                  "Tom, what do you laugh for? I wonder what business you have to be al ways a
                  laughing when Papa scolds us." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Then what business have you to be such a while getting on your
                  cloaths? You're never ready, you know well enough." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Lord, Sir, I wonder what that's to you! I wish you'd mind your own
                  affairs, and not trou ble yourself about ours. How should a boy like you know any
                  thing?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "A boy, indeed! not such a boy, neither; I'll warrant you'll be
                  glad to be as young, when you come to be old maids." </q>
            </p>
            <p> This sort of dialogue we were amused with till dinner was ready, when we again
               mounted up two pair of stairs. </p>
            <p> In our way, Miss Polly told me that her sister had asked Mr. Smith for his room to
               dine in, but he had refused to lend it; <q rend="inline">"because,"</q> she said, <q
                  rend="inline"> "one day it happened to be a little greased: how ever, we shall
                  have it to drink tea in, and then, perhaps, you may see him, and I assure you he's
                  quite like one of the quality, and dresses as fine, and goes to balls and dances,
                  and every thing quite in taste;—and besides, Miss, he keeps a foot-boy of his own,
                  too." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="236"/> The dinner was ill-served, ill-cooked, and ill managed. The maid who
               waited had so often to go down stairs for something that was forgotten, that the
               Branghtons were perpetually obliged to rise from table themselves, to get plates,
               knives and forks, bread, or beer. Had they been with out <hi>pretensions,</hi> all
               this would have seemed of no consequence; but they aimed at appearing to ad vantage,
               and even fancied they succeeded. How ever, the most disagreeable part of our fare
               was, that the whole family continually disputed whose turn it was to rise, and whose
               to be allowed to sit still. </p>
            <p> When this meal was over, Madame Duval, Mr. Branghton, and, in broken English. M. Du
               Bois, entered into an argument concerning the French nation; and Miss Polly, then
               addressing herself to me, said, <q rend="inline"> "Don't you think, Miss, it's very
                  dull sitting up stairs here? we'd better go down <hi>to shop,</hi> and then we
                  shall see the people go by." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Lord, Poll,"</q> said the brother, <q rend="inline"> "you're al
                  ways wanting to be staring and gaping; and I'm sure you need n't be so fond of
                  shewing yourself, for you're ugly enough to frighten a horse." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Ugly, indeed! I wonder which is best, you or me. But, I tell you
                  what, Tom, you've no need to give yourself such airs, for if you do, I'll tell
                  Miss of you know what—." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Who cares if you do? You may tell what you will; I don't mind—"
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Indeed,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline">"I do not desire to hear any
                  secrets."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "O, but I'm resolved I'll tell you, because Tom's so very spiteful.
                  You must know, Miss, t'other night—" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="237"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Poll,"</q> cried the brother, <q rend="inline"> "if you tell of
                  that, Miss shall know all about your meeting young Brown,—you know when!—So I'll
                  be quits with you, one way or another." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Miss Polly coloured, and again proposed our go ing down stairs till Mr. Smith's room
               was ready for our reception. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Aye, so we will,"</q> said Miss Branghton; <q rend="inline"> "I'll
                  assure you, Cousin, we have some very gen teel people pass by our shop sometimes.
                  Polly and I always go and sit there, when we've cleaned ourselves." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Yes, Miss,"</q> cried the brother, <q rend="inline"> "they do
                  nothing else all day long, when father don't scold them. But the best fun is, when
                  they've got all their dirty things on, and all their hair about their ears,
                  sometimes I send young Brown up stairs to them; and then, there's such a
                  fuss!—there they hide themselves, and run away, and squeal and squall like any
                  thing mad: and so then I puts the two cats into the room, and I gives 'em a good
                  whip ping, and so that sets them a squalling too; so there's such a noise, and
                  such an uproar!—Lord, you can't think, Miss, what fun it is!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> This occasioned a fresh quarrel with the sisters; at the end of which, it was, at
               length, decided that we should go to the shop. </p>
            <p> In our way down stairs, Miss Branghton said aloud, <q rend="inline">"I wonder when
                  Mr. Smith's room will be ready."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"So do I,"</q> answered Polly; <q rend="inline">"I'm sure we should
                  not do any harm to it now."</q>
            </p>
            <p> This hint had not the desired effect; for we were suffered to proceed very quietly. </p>
            <p> As we entered the shop, I observed a young man, in deep mourning, leaning against
               the wall, with <pb n="238"/> his arms folded, and his eyes fixed on the ground,
               apparently in profound and melancholy meditation: but the moment he perceived us, he
               started, and, making a passing bow, very abruptly retired. As I found he was
               permitted to go quite unnoticed, I could not forbear enquiring who he was. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Lord!"</q> answered Miss Branghton, <q rend="inline"> "he's no
                  thing but a poor Scotch poet." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"For my part,"</q> said Miss Polly, <q rend="inline"> "I believe
                  he's just starved, for I don't find he has any thing to live upon." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Live upon!"</q> cried the brother, <q rend="inline"> "why he's a
                  poet, you know, so he may live upon learning." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Aye, and good enough for him too,"</q> said Miss Branghton, <q
                  rend="inline">"for he's as proud as he's poor."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Like enough,"</q> replied the brother, <q rend="inline"> "but, for
                  all that, you won't find he will live without meat and drink: no, no, catch a
                  Scotchman at that if you can! why, they only come here for what they can get."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I'm sure,"</q> said Miss Branghton, <q rend="inline"> "I wonder
                  Papa 'll be such a fool as to let him stay in the house, for I dare say he'll
                  never pay for his lodging." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why, no more he would, if he could get another Lodger: you know
                  the bill's been put up this fortnight. Miss, if you should hear of a per son that
                  wants a room, I assure you it is a very good one, for all it's up three pair of
                  stairs." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I answered, that as I had no acquaintance in London, I had not any chance of
               assisting them: but both my compassion and my curiosity were ex cited for this poor
               young man: and I asked them some further particulars concerning him. </p>
            <p> They then acquainted me, that they had only known him three months. When he first
               lodged <pb n="239"/> with them, he agreed to board also; but had late ly told them,
               he would eat by himself, though they all believed he had hardly ever tasted a morsel
               of meat since he left their table. They said, that he had always appeared very
               low-spirited, but, for the last month, he had been <hi>duller</hi> than ever, and,
               all of a sudden, had put himself into mourning, though they knew not for whom, nor
               for what, but they supposed it was only for convenience, as no person had ever been
               to see or enquire for him since his residence amongst them: and they were sure he was
               very poor, as he had not paid for his lodgings the last three weeks: and finally,
               they concluded he was a poet, or else half-crazy, be cause they had, at different
               times, found scraps of poetry in his room. </p>
            <p> They then produced some unfinished verses, written on small pieces of paper,
               unconnected, and of a most melancholy cast. Among them was the fragment of an ode,
               which, at my re quest, they lent me to copy; and, as you may perhaps like to see it,
               I will write it now. </p>
            <q>
               <l>O LIFE! thou lingering dream of grief, of pain,</l>
               <l>And every ill that nature can sustain,</l>
               <l>Strange, mutable, and wild!</l>
               <l>Now flattering with Hope most fair,</l>
               <l>Depressing now with fell Despair,</l>
               <l>The nurse of Guilt, the slave of Pride,</l>
               <l>That, like a wayward child,</l>
               <l>Who, to himself a foe,</l>
               <l>Sees joy alone in what's denied,</l>
               <l>In what is granted, woe!</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="240"/> O thou poor, feeble, fleeting pow'r, </l>
               <l>By Vice seduc'd, by Folly woo'd,</l>
               <l>By Mis'ry, Shame, Remorse pursu'd!</l>
               <l>And as thy toilsome steps proceed,</l>
               <l>Seeming to Youth the fairest flow'r,</l>
               <l>Proving to Age the rankest weed,</l>
               <l>A gilded, but a bitter pill,</l>
               <l>Of varied, great, and complicated ill!</l>
            </q>
            <p> These lines are harsh, but they indicate an in ternal wretchedness which, I own,
               affects me. Surely this young man must be involved in misfor tunes of no common
               nature: but I cannot imagine what can induce him to remain with this unfeel ing
               family, where he is, most unworthily, de spised for being poor, and, most
               illiberally, de tested for being a Scotchman. He may, indeed, have motives which he
               cannot surmount, for sub mitting to such a situation. Whatever they are, I most
               heartily pity him, and cannot but wish it were in my power to afford him some relief. </p>
            <p> During this conversation, Mr. Smith's foot boy came to Miss Branghton, and informed
               her, that his master said she might have the room now when she liked it, for that he
               was presently going out. </p>
            <p> This very genteel message, though it perfectly satisfied the Miss Branghtons, by no
               means added to my desire of being introduced to this gentle man: and upon their
               rising, with intention to ac cept his offer, I begged they would excuse my at tending
               them, and said I would sit with Madame Duval till the tea was ready. </p>
            <p> I therefore once more went up two pair of stairs, with young Branghton, who insisted
               upon accom panying me; and there we remained, till Mr. <pb n="241"/> Smith's foot-boy
               summoned us to tea, when I fol lowed Madame Duval into the dining-room. </p>
            <p> The Miss Branghtons were seated at one win dow, and Mr. Smith was lolling indolently
               out of the other. They all approached us at our en trance, and Mr. Smith, probably,
               to shew he was master of the apartment, most officiously hand ed me to a great chair,
               at the upper end of the room, without taking any notice of Madame Du val, till I
               rose, and offered her my own seat. </p>
            <p> Leaving the rest of the company to entertain themselves, he, very abruptly, began to
               address himself to me, in a style of gallantry, equally new and disagreeable to me.
               It is true, no man can possibly pay me greater compliments, or make more fine
               speeches, than Sir Clement Willoughby, yet his language, though too flowery, is
               always that of a gentleman, and his address and manners are so very superior to those
               of the inhabitants of this house, that to make any comparison between him and Mr.
               Smith would be extremely unjust. This latter seems very desirous of appearing a man
               of gaiety and spirit; but his vivacity is so low bred, and his whole behaviour so
               forward and dis agreeable, that I should prefer the company of <hi>dullness</hi>
               itself, even as that goddess is described by Pope, to that of this <hi>sprightly</hi>
               young man. </p>
            <p> He made many apologies, that he had not lent his room for our dinner, which, he
               said, he should certainly have done, had he seen me first; and he assured me, that
               when I came again, he should be very glad to oblige me. </p>
            <p> I told him, with sincerity, that every part of the house was equally indifferent to
               me. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why, Ma'am, the truth is, Miss Biddy and Polly take no care of any
                  thing else. I'm sure, <pb n="242"/> they should be always welcome to my room; for
                  I'm never so happy as in obliging the ladies,—that's my character, Ma'am;—but,
                  really, the last time they had it, every thing was made so greasy and so nasty,
                  that, upon my word, to a man who wishes to have things a little genteel, it was
                  quite cruel. Now, as to you, Ma'am, its quite another thing; for I should not mind
                  if every thing I had was spoilt, for the sake of having the pleasure to oblige
                  you; and, I assure you, Ma'am, it makes me quite happy, that I have a room good
                  enough to receive you." </q>
            </p>
            <p> This elegant speech was followed by many others, so much in the same style, that to
               write them would be superfluous; and, as he did not allow me a moment to speak to any
               other person, the rest of the evening was consumed in a painful attention to this
               irksome young man, who seemed to intend appearing before me to the utmost advan tage. </p>
            <p> Adieu, my dear Sir. I fear you will be sick of reading about this family; yet I must
               write of them, or not of any, since I mix with no other. Happy shall I be, when I
               quit them all, and again return to Berry Hill! </p>

            <p> THIS morning, Mr. Smith called, <hi>on purpose,</hi> he said, to offer me a ticket
               for the next Hamp stead assembly. I thanked him, but desired to be <pb n="243"/>
               excused accepting it; he would not, however, be denied, nor answered, and in a manner
               both ve hement and free, pressed and urged his offer till I was wearied to death:
               but, when he found me resolute, he seemed thunderstruck with amazement, and thought
               proper to desire I would tell him my reasons. </p>
            <p> Obvious as they must, surely, have been to any other person, they were such as I
               knew not how to repeat to him; and, when he found I he sitated, he said, <q
                  rend="inline"> "Indeed, Ma'am, you are too modest; I assure you the ticket is
                  quite at your service, and I shall be very happy to dance with you; so pray don't
                  be so coy." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Indeed, Sir,"</q> returned I, <q rend="inline"> "you are mistaken;
                  I never supposed you would offer a ticket, with out wishing it should be accepted;
                  but it would answer no purpose to mention the reasons which make me decline it,
                  since they cannot possibly be removed." </q>
            </p>
            <p> This speech seemed very much to mortify him, which I could not be concerned at, as I
               did not chuse to be treated by him with so much freedom. When he was, at last,
               convinced that his appli cation to me was ineffectual, he addressed himself to Madame
               Duval, and begged she would interfere in his favour, offering, at the same time, to
               pro cure another ticket for herself. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> " <hi>Ma foi,</hi> Sir," </q> answered she, angrily, <q
                  rend="inline"> "you might as well have had the complaisance to ask me before, for,
                  I assure you, I don't approve of no such rudeness: however, you may keep your tick
                  ets to yourself, for we don't want none of 'em. </q>
            </p>
            <p> This rebuke almost over set him; he made many apologies, and said that he should
               certainly have first applied to her, but that he had no notion the <pb n="244"/>
               <hi>young</hi> lady would have refused him, and, on the contrary, had concluded that
               she would have assist ed him to persuade Madame Duval herself. </p>
            <p> This excuse appeased her; and he pleaded his cause so successfully, that, to my
               great chagrin, he gained it; and Madame Duval promised that she would go herself, and
               take me to the Hamp stead assembly whenever he pleased. </p>
            <p> Mr. Smith then, approaching me with an air of triumph, said, <q rend="inline">
                  "Well, Ma'am, now, I think, you can't possibly keep to your denial." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I made no answer, and he soon took leave, though not till he had so wonderfully
               gained the favour of Madame Duval, that she declared, when he was gone, he was the
               prettiest young man she had seen since she came to England. </p>
            <p> As soon as I could find an opportunity, I ven tured, in the most humble manner, to
               entreat Ma dame Duval would not insist upon my attending her to this ball; and
               represented to her, as well as I was able, the impropriety of my accepting any
               present from a young man so entirely unknown to me: but she laughed at my scruples,
               called me a foolish, ignorant, country girl, and said she should make it her business
               to teach me something of the world. </p>
            <p> This ball is to be next week. I am sure it is not more improper for, than unpleasant
               to me, and I will use every possible endeavour to avoid it. Perhaps I may apply to
               Miss Branghton for advice, as I believe she will be willing to assist me, from
               disliking, equally with myself, that I should dance with Mr. Smith. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="245"/> July 11th. </p>
            <p> O, my dear Sir! I have been shocked to death,—and yet, at the same time, delighted
               beyond ex pression, in the hope that I have happily been the instrument of saving a
               human creature from destruc tion! </p>
            <p> This morning, Madame Duval said she would invite the Branghton family to return our
               visit to morrow; and, not chusing to rise herself,—for she generally spends the
               morning in bed,—she desi red me to wait upon them with her message. M. Du Bois, who
               just then called, insisted upon attend ing me. </p>
            <p> Mr. Branghton was in the shop, and told us that his son and daughters were out; but
               desired me to step up stairs, as he very soon expected them home. This I did, leaving
               M. Du Bois below. I went into the room where they had dined the day before, and, by a
               wonderful chance, I happended so to seat myself, that I had a view of the stairs, and
               yet could not be seen from them. </p>
            <p> In about ten minutes time, I saw, passing by the door, with a look perturbed and
               affrighted, the same young man I mentioned in my last letter. Not heeding, as I
               suppose, how he went, in turn ing the corner of the stairs, which are narrow and
               winding, his foot slipped, and he fell, but, almost instantly rising, I plainly
               perceived the end of a pistol, which started from his pocket, by hitting against the
               stairs. </p>
            <p> I was inexpressibly shocked. All that I had heard of his misery occurring to my
               memory, made me conclude, that he was, at that very moment, meditating suicide!
               Struck with the dreadful idea, all my strength seemed to fail me;—I sat motion less;
                  <pb n="246"/> —I lost all power of action,—and grew almost stiff with horror. </p>
            <p> He moved on slowly,—yet I soon lost sight of him. I then trembled so violently, that
               my chair actually shook under me; till, recollecting that it was yet possible to
               prevent the fatal deed, all my faculties seemed to return, with the hope of saving
               him. </p>
            <p> My first thought was to fly to Mr. Branghton, but I feared that an instant of time
               lost, might for ever be rued; and therefore, guided by the im pulse of my
               apprehensions, as well as I was able, I followed him up stairs, stepping very softly,
               and obliged to support myself by the banisters. </p>
            <p> When I came within a few stairs of the landing place, I stopped, for I could then
               see into his room, as he had not yet shut the door. </p>
            <p> He had put the pistol upon a table, and had his hand in his pocket, whence, in a few
               moments, he took out another: He then emptied something on the table from a small
               leather bag; after which, taking up both the pistols, one in each hand, he dropt
               hastily upon his knees, and called out <q rend="inline">"O God!—Forgive me!"</q>
            </p>
            <p> In a moment, strength and courage seemed lent me as by inspiration: I started, and
               rushing pre cipitately into the room, just caught his arm, and then, overcome by my
               own fears, I fell down at his side, breathless and senseless. My recovery, however,
               was, I believe, almost instantaneous; and then the sight of this unhappy man,
               regarding me with a look of unutterable astonishment, mixed with concern, presently
               restored to me my recollecti on. I arose, though with difficulty; he did the same;
               the pistols, as I soon saw, were both on the floor. </p>
            <p> Unwilling to leave them, and, indeed, too weak <pb n="247"/> to move, I leant one
               hand on the table, and then stood perfectly still: while he, his eyes cast wildly
               towards me, seemed too infinitely amazed to be ca pable of either speech or action. </p>
            <p> I believe we were some minutes in this extraor dinary situation; but, as my strength
               returned, I felt myself both ashamed and awkward, and ma king a slight courtesie, I
               moved towards the door. Pale, and motionless, he suffered me to pass, with out
               changing his posture, or uttering a syllable; and, indeed, <q>
                  <l> He looked a bloodless image of despair! <note n="*" place="bottom">Pope's
                        Iliad.</note>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p> When I reached the door, I turned round; I looked fearfully at the pistols, and,
               impelled by an emotion I could not repress, I hastily stepped back, with an intention
               of carrying them away: but their wretched owner, perceiving my design, and reco
               vering from his astonishment, darting suddenly down, seized them both himself. </p>
            <p> Wild with fright, and scarce knowing what I did, I caught, almost involuntarily,
               hold of both his arms, and exclaimed <q rend="inline">"O Sir! have mercy on
                  yourself!"</q>
            </p>
            <p> The guilty pistols fell from his hands, which, disengaging from me, he fervently
               clasped, and cried, <q rend="inline">"Sweet Heaven! is this thy angel?"</q>
            </p>
            <p> Encouraged by such gentleness, I again attempted to take the pistols, but, with a
               look half frantic, he again prevented me, saying, <q rend="inline">"What would you
                  do?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Awaken you,"</q> I cried, with a courage I now wonder at, <q
                  rend="inline"> "to worthier thoughts, and rescue you from perdition." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="248"/> I then seized the pistols; he said not a word,—he made no effort to
               stop me;—I glided quick by him, and tottered down stairs, ere he had recovered from
               the extremest amazement. </p>
            <p> The moment I reached again the room I had so fearfully left, I threw away the
               pistols, and flinging myself on the first chair, gave free vent to the feelings I had
               most painfully stifled, in a violent burst of tears, which, indeed, proved a happy re
               lief to me. </p>
            <p> In this situation I remained some time; but when, at length, I lifted up my head,
               the first object I saw, was the poor man who had occasioned my terror, standing, as
               if petrified, at the door, and gazing at me with eyes of wild wonder. </p>
            <p> I started from the chair, but trembled so exces sively, that I almost instantly sunk
               again into it. He then, though without advancing, and in a fal tering voice, said, <q
                  rend="inline"> "Whoever or whatever you are, relieve me, I pray you, from the
                  suspense un der which my soul labours—and tell me if indeed I do not dream?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> To this address, so singular and so solemn, I had not then the presence of mind to
               frame any an swer; but, as I presently perceived that his eyes turned from me to the
               pistols, and that he seemed to intend regaining them, I exerted all my strength, and
               saying <q rend="inline">"O for Heaven's sake, forbear!"</q> I rose and took them
               myself. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Do my senses deceive me!"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "do
                     <hi>I</hi> live—? and do you—?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> As he spoke, he advanced towards me, and I, still guarding the pistols, retreated,
               saying <q rend="inline">"No, no,—you must not—must not have them!"—</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why—for what purpose, tell me!—do you withhold them?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="249"/>
               <q rend="inline"> "To give you time to <hi>think,</hi> to save you from eternal
                  misery,—and, I hope, to reserve you for mercy and forgiveness." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Wonderful!"</q> cried he, with uplifted hands and eyes, <q
                  rend="inline">"most wonderful!"</q>
            </p>
            <p> For some time, he seemed wrapped in deep thought, till a sudden noise of tongues
               below, an nouncing the approach of the Branghtons, made him start from his reverie:
               he sprung hastily for ward,—dropt on one knee,—caught hold of my gown, which he
               pressed to his lips, and then, quick as lightning, he rose, and flew up stairs to his
               own room. </p>
            <p> There was something in the whole of this ex traordinary and shocking adventure,
               really too af fecting to be borne; and so entirely had I spent my spirits and
               exhausted my courage, that, before the Branghtons reached me, I had sunk on the
               ground, without sense or motion. </p>
            <p> I believe I must have been a very horrid sight to them, on their entrance into the
               room; for, to all appearance, I seemed to have suffered a violent death, either by my
               own rashness, or the cruelty of some murderer; as the pistols were fallen close by my
               side. </p>
            <p> How soon I recovered, I know not, but, pro bably, I was more indebted to the
               loudness of their cries, than to their assistance; for they all con cluded that I was
               dead, and, for some time, did not make any effort to revive me. </p>
            <p> Scarcely could I recollect <hi>where</hi> or, indeed, <hi>what</hi> I was, ere they
               poured upon me such a tor rent of questions and enquiries, that I was almost stunned
               with their vociferation. However, as soon and as well as I was able, I endeavoured
                  <pb n="250"/> to satisfy their curiosity, by recounting what had happened as
               clearly as was in my power. They all looked aghast at the recital, but, not being
               well enough to enter into any discussions, I beg ged to have a chair called, and to
               return instantly home. </p>
            <p> Before I left them, I recommended, with great earnestness, a vigilant observance of
               their unhappy lodger, and that they would take especial care to keep from him, if
               possible, all means of self-de struction. </p>
            <p> M. Du Bois, who seemed extremely concerned at my indisposition, walked by the side
               of the chair, and saw me safe to my own apartment. </p>
            <p> The rashness and the misery of this ill-fated young man, engross all my thoughts.
               If, indeed, he is bent upon destroying himself, all efforts to save him will be
               fruitless. How much do I wish it were in my power to discover the nature of the
               malady which thus maddens him, and to offer or to procure alleviation to his
               sufferings! I am sure, my dearest Sir, you will be much concerned for this poor man,
               and were you here, I doubt not but you would find some method of awakening him from
               the error which blinds him, and of pour ing the balm of peace and comfort into his
               afflicted soul! </p>

            <p> YESTERDAY all the Branghtons dined here. Our conversation was almost wholly
               concerning the adventure of the day before. Mr. Branghton said, that his first
               thought was instantly to turn his lodger out of doors, <q rend="inline">"Lest,"</q>
               continued he, <q rend="inline"> "his killing himself in my house, should bring me
                  into any trouble; but then, I was afraid I should never get the money he owes me,
                  whereas, if he dies in my house, I have a right to all he leaves be hind him, if
                  he goes off in my debt. Indeed, I would put him in prison—but what should I get by
                  that? he could not earn any thing there to pay me. So I considered about it some
                  time, and then I determined to ask him, point-blank, for my money out of hand. And
                  so I did, but he told me he'd pay me next week: however, I gave him to understand,
                  that though I was no Scotch man, yet I did not like to be over-reached any more
                  than he; so then, he gave me a ring, which, to my certain knowledge, must be worth
                  ten gui neas, and told me he would not part with it for his life, and a good deal
                  more such sort of stuff, but that I might keep it till he could pay me." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "It is ten to one, Father, said young Branghton, if he came fairly
                  by it." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Very likely not,"</q> answered he, <q rend="inline"> "but that will
                  make no great difference; for I shall be able to prove my right to it all one."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>What principles! I could hardly stay in the room.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="252"/>
               <q rend="inline">"I'm determined,"</q> said the son, <q rend="inline"> "I'll take
                  some opportunity to affront him soon, now I know how poor he is, because of the
                  airs he gave him self to me when he first came." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"And pray how was that, child?"</q> said Madame Duval. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why you never knew such a fuss in your life as he made, because,
                  one day at dinner, I only happened to say, that I supposed he had never got such a
                  good meal in his life, before he came to England: there he fell in such a passion
                  as you can't think; but, for my part, I took notice of it, for to be sure, thinks
                  I, he must needs be a gentle man, or he'd never go to be so angry about it.
                  However, he won't put his tricks upon me again, in a hurry." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Well, said Miss Polly, he's grown quite an other creature to what
                  he was, and he does n't run away from us, nor hide himself, nor any thing: and
                  he's as civil as can be, and he's always in the shop, and he saunters about the
                  stairs, and he looks at every body who comes in." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why you may see what's after plain enough, said Mr. Branghton; he
                  wants to see Miss again." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Ha, ha, ha! Lord, how I should laugh,"</q> said the son, <q
                  rend="inline">"if he should have fell in Love with Miss!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I'm sure,"</q> said Miss Branghton, <q rend="inline"> "Miss is
                  welcome; but, for my part, I should be quite ashamed of such a beggarly conquest."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p> Such was the conversation till tea time, when the appearance of Mr. Smith gave a new
               turn to the discourse. </p>
            <p> Miss Branghton desired me to remark with what a <hi>smart air</hi> he entered the
               room, and asked me if he had not very much a <hi>quality look?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="253"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Come,"</q> cried he, advancing to us, <q rend="inline"> "you ladies
                  must not sit together; wherever I go, I always make it a rule to part the ladies."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p> And then, handing Miss Branghton to the next chair, he seated himself between us. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Well, now, ladies, I think we sit very well. What say you? for my
                  part, I think it was a very good motion." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"If my Cousin likes it,"</q> said Miss Branghton, <q rend="inline"
                  >"I'm sure I've no objection."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "I always study what the ladies
                  like,—that's my first thought. And, indeed, it is but natural that you should like
                  best to sit by the gentlemen, for what can you find to say to one another?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Say!"</q> cried young Branghton, <q rend="inline"> "O, never you
                  think of that, they'll find enough to say, I'll be sworn. You know the women are
                  never tired of talking." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Come, come, Tom,"</q> said Mr. Smith, <q rend="inline"> "don't be
                  severe upon the ladies; when I'm by; you know I always take their part." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Soon after, when Miss Branghton offered me some cake, this man of gallantry said, <q
                  rend="inline"> "Well, if I was that lady, I'd never take any thing from a woman."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why not, Sir?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Because I should be afraid of being poisoned for being so
                  handsome." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Who is severe upon the ladies <hi>now?</hi> " </q> said I. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why, really, Ma'am, it was a slip of the tongue; I did not intend
                  to say such a thing; but one can't always be on one's guard." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Soon after, the conversation turning upon pub lic places, young Branghton asked if I
               had ever been to <hi>George</hi> 's at Hampstead? </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="254"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Indeed I never heard the place mentioned."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Did n't you, Miss?"</q> cried he, eagerly, <q rend="inline"> "why
                  then you've a deal of fun to come, I'll promise you; and, I tell you what, I'll
                  treat you there some Sunday soon. So now, Bid and Poll, be sure you don't tell
                  Miss about the chairs, and all that, for I've a mind to surprise her; and if I
                  pay, I think I've a right to have it my own way." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"George's at Hampstead!"</q> repeated Mr. Smith, contemptuously, <q
                  rend="inline"> "how came you to think the young Lady would like to go to such a
                  low place as that? But, pray, Ma'am, have you ever been to Don Saltero's at
                  Chelsea?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No, Sir"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "No!—No!—nay, then, I must insist on hav ing the pleasure of
                  conducting you there before long. I assure you, Ma'am, many genteel people go, or
                  else, I give you my word, <hi>I</hi> should not re commend it." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Pray, Cousin,"</q> said Mr. Branghton, <q rend="inline">"have you
                  been to Sadler's Wells, yet?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No, Sir."</q>

               <q rend="inline">"No! why then you've seen nothing!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Pray, Miss,"</q> said the Son, <q rend="inline">"how do you like
                  the Tower of London?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I have never been to it, Sir."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Goodness!"</q> exclaimed he, <q rend="inline"> "not seen the
                  Tower!—why may be you ha'n't been o' top of the Monument, neither?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No, indeed, I have not."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why then you might as well not have come to London, for aught I
                  see, for you've been no where." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Pray, Miss,"</q> said Polly, <q rend="inline">"have you been all
                  over Paul's Church, yet?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No, Ma'am."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="255"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Well, but, Ma'am,"</q> said Mr. Smith, <q rend="inline">"how do you
                  like Vauxhall and Marybone?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I never saw either, Sir."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "No!—God bless me!—you really surprise me,—why Vauxhall is the
                  first pleasure in life!—I know nothing like it.—Well, Ma'am, you must have been
                  with staange people, indeed, not to have taken you to Vauxhall. Why you have seen
                  nothing of London yet.—However, we must try if <hi>we</hi> can't make you amends."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p> In the course of this <hi>catechism,</hi> many other places were mentioned of which
               I have forgotten the names; but the looks of surprise and contempt that my repeated
               negatives incurred, were very di verting. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Come,"</q> said Mr. Smith, after tea, <q rend="inline"> "as this
                  Lady has been with such a queer set of people, let's shew her the difference;
                  suppose we go somewhere to night?—I love to do things with spirit!—Come, Ladies,
                  where shall we go? For my part I should like Foote's,—but the Ladies must chuse; I
                  never speak myself." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Well, Mr. Smith is always in such spirits!"</q> said Miss
               Branghton. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why yes, Ma'am, yes, thank G—, pretty good spirits;—I have not yet

            </p>
            <p> No objection being made, to my great relief, we all proceeded to the little theatre
               in the Hay market, where I was extremely entertained by the performance of the Minor

            <p> YESTERDAY morning, Madame Duval again sent me to Mr. Branghton's, attended by M. Du
               Bois, to make some party for the evening; be cause she had had the vapours the
               preceding day, from staying at home. </p>
            <p> As I entered the shop, I perceived the unfortu nate North Briton, seated in a
               corner, with a book in his hand. He cast his melancholy eyes up, as we came in, and,
               I believe, immediately recol lected my face, for he started and changed colour. I
               delivered Madame Duval's message to Mr. Branghton; who told me I should find Polly up
               stairs, but that the others were gone out. </p>
            <p> Up stairs, therefore, I went; and, seated on a window, with Mr. Brown at her side,
               sat Miss Polly. I felt a little awkward at disturbing them, and much more so, at
               their behaviour afterwards: for, as soon as the common enquiries were over, Mr. Brown
               grew so fond, and so foolish, that I was extremely disgusted. Polly, all the time, on
               ly rebuked him with <q rend="inline"> "La, now, Mr. Brown, do be quiet, can't
                  you?—you should not behave so before company.—Why now what will Miss think of
                  me?"— </q> while her looks plainly shewed not merely the pleasure, but the pride
               which she took in his caresses. </p>
            <p> I did not, by any means, think it necessary to punish myself by witnessing their
               tenderness, and, <pb n="257"/> therefore, telling them I would see if Miss Brangh ton
               was returned home, I soon left them, and again descended into the shop. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"So, Miss, you've come again,"</q> said Mr. Branghton, <q
                  rend="inline"> "what, I suppose, you've a mind to sit a little in the shop, and
                  see how the world goes, hay, Miss?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I made no answer; and M. Du Bois instantly brought me a chair. </p>
            <p> The unhappy stranger, who had risen at my en trance, again seated himself; and,
               though his head leant towards his book, I could not help ob serving, that his eyes
               were most intently and ear nestly turned towards me. </p>
            <p> M. Du Bois, as well as his broken English would allow him, endeavoured to entertain
               us, till the return of Miss Branghton and her brother. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Lord, how tired I am!"</q> cried the former, <q rend="inline">"I
                  have not a foot to stand upon."</q> And then, without any ceremony, she flung
               herself into the chair from which I had risen to receive her. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"You tired!"</q> said the brother, <q rend="inline"> "why then what
                  I must be, that have walked twice as far?" </q> And with equal politeness, he paid
               the same com pliment to M. Du Bois which his sister had done to me. </p>
            <p> Two chairs and three stools compleated the fur niture of the shop, and Mr.
               Branghton, who chose to keep his own seat himself, desired M. Du Bois to take
               another; and then, seeing that I was with out any, called out to the stranger, <q
                  rend="inline">"Come, Mr. Macartney, lend us your stool."</q>
            </p>
            <p> Shocked at their rudeness, I declined the offer, and approaching Miss Branghton,
               said, <q rend="inline"> "If you will be so good as to make room for me on your <pb
                     n="258"/> chair, there will be no occasion to disturb that gentleman." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Lord, what signifies that?"</q> cried the brother, <q rend="inline"
                  >"he has had his share of sitting, I'll be sworn."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"And if he has not,"</q> said the sister, <q rend="inline"> he has a
                  chair up stairs; and the shop is our own, I hope." </q>
            </p>
            <p> This grossness so much disgusted me, that I took the stool, and carrying it back to
               Mr. Macartney myself, I returned him thanks, as civilly as I could, for his
               politeness, but said that I had rather stand. </p>
            <p> He looked at me as if unaccustomed to such at tention, bowed very respectfully, but
               neither spoke, nor yet made use of it. </p>
            <p> I soon found that I was an object of derision to all present, except M. Du Bois,
               and, therefore, I begged Mr. Branghton would give me an answer for Madame Duval, as I
               was in haste to return. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Well, then, Tom,—Biddy,—where have you a mind to go to-night? your
                  Aunt and Miss want to be abroad and amongst them." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why then, Papa,"</q> said Miss Branghton, <q rend="inline"> "we'll
                  go to Don Saltero's. Mr. Smith likes that place, so may be he'll go along with
                  us." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No, no,"</q> said the son, <q rend="inline">"I'm for White-Conduit
                  House; so let's go there."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"White-Conduit House, indeed!"</q> cried his sister, <q
                  rend="inline">"no, Tom, that I won't."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why then let it alone; nobody wants your company;—we shall do as
                  well without you, I'll be sworn, and better too." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "I'll tell you what, Tom, if you don't hold your tongue, I'll make
                  you repent it,—that I as sure you." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Just then, Mr. Smith came into the shop, which he seemed to intend passing through;
               but when he saw me, he stopped and began a most courteous <pb n="259"/> enquiry after
               my health, protesting that, had he known I was there, he should have come down
               sooner. <q rend="inline">"But, bless me, Ma'am,"</q> added he, <q rend="inline">"what
                  is the reason you stand?"</q> and then he flew to bring me the seat from which I
               had just parted. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Mr. Smith, you are come in very good time,"</q> said Mr. Branghton,
                  <q rend="inline"> "to end a dispute between my son and daughter, about where they
                  shall all go to-night." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O fie, Tom,—dispute with a lady!"</q> cried Mr. Smith, <q
                  rend="inline"> "Now, as for me, I'm for where you will, provided this young Lady
                  is of the party,—one place is the same as another to me, so that it be but
                  agreeable to the ladies,—I would go any where with you, Ma'am," </q> (to me) <q
                  rend="inline"> "unless, indeed, it were to <hi>church;</hi> —ha, ha, ha,—you'll
                  excuse me, Ma'am, but, really, I never could conquer my fear of a parson;—ha, ha,
                  ha,—really, ladies, I beg your pardon, for being so rude, but I can't help
                  laughing for my life!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I was just saying, Mr. Smith,"</q> said Miss Branghton, <q
                  rend="inline"> "that I should like to go to Don Sal tero's;—now pray where should
                     <hi>you</hi> like to go?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why really, Miss Biddy, you know I always let the ladies decide; I
                  never fix any thing myself; but I should suppose it would be rather hot at the
                  coffee-house,—however, pray, Ladies, settle it among yourselves,—I'm agreeable to
                  whatever you chuse." </q>
            </p>
            <p> It was easy for me to discover, that this man, with all his parade of
                  <hi>conformity,</hi> objects to every thing that is not proposed by himself: but
               he is so much admired, by this family, for his <hi>gentility,</hi> that he thinks
               himself a complete fine gentleman! </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Come,"</q> said Mr. Branghton, <q rend="inline"> "the best way will
                  be to put it to the vote, and then every body <pb n="260"/> will speak their
                  minds. Biddy, call Poll down stairs. We'll start fair." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Lord, Papa,"</q> said Miss Branghton, <q rend="inline"> "why can't
                  you as well send Tom?—you're always send ing me of the errands." </q>
            </p>
            <p> A dispute then ensued, but Miss Branghton was obliged to yield. </p>
            <p> When Mr. Brown and Miss Polly made their appearance, the latter uttered many
               complaints of having been called, saying she did not want to come, and was very well
               where she was. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Now, Ladies, your votes;"</q> cried Mr. Smith, <q rend="inline"
                  >"and so, Ma'am,"</q> (to me) <q rend="inline"> "we'll begin with you. What place
                  shall you like best?" </q> and then, in a whisper, he added, <q rend="inline"> "I
                  assure you, I shall say the same as you do, whether I like it or not." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I said, that as I was ignorant what choice was in my power, I must beg to hear their
               decisions first. This was reluctantly assented to; and then Miss Branghton voted for
               Saltero's Coffee-house; her sister, for a party to <hi>Mother Red Cap's;</hi> the bro
               ther, for White-Conduit House; Mr. Brown, for Bagnigge Wells; Mr. Branghton for
               Sadler's Wells; and Mr. Smith for Vauxhall. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Well now, Ma'am,"</q> said Mr. Smith, <q rend="inline"> "we have
                  all spoken, and so you must give the casting vote. Come, what will you fix upon?"
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Sir,"</q> answered I, <q rend="inline"> "I was to speak
                     <hi>last.</hi> " </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Well, so you will,"</q> said Miss Branghton, <q rend="inline">"for
                  we've all spoke first."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Pardon me,"</q> returned I, <q rend="inline">"the voting has not
                  yet been quite general."</q>
            </p>
            <p> And I looked towards Mr. Macartney, to whom I wished extremely to shew that I was
               not of the same brutal nature with those by whom he was treated so grossly. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="261"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Why pray,"</q> said Mr. Branghton, <q rend="inline"> "who have we
                  left out? would you have the cats and dogs vote?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No, Sir,"</q> cried I, with some spirit, <q rend="inline"> "I would
                  have <hi>that gentleman</hi> vote,—if, indeed, he is not su perior to joining our
                  party." </q>
            </p>
            <p> They all looked at me, as if they doubted whe ther or not they had heard me right:
               but, in a few moments, their surprise gave way to a rude burst of laughter. </p>
            <p> Very much displeased, I told M. Du Bois that if he was not ready to go, I would have
               a coach called for myself. </p>
            <p>O yes, he said, he was always ready to attend me.</p>
            <p> Mr. Smith then advancing, attempted to take my hand, and begged me not to leave them
               till I had settled the evening's plan. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I have nothing, Sir,"</q> said I, <q rend="inline"> "to do with it,
                  as it is my intention to stay at home; and therefore Mr. Branghton will be so good
                  as to send Madame Duval word what place is fixed upon, when it is convenient to
                  him." </q>
            </p>
            <p>And then, making a slight courtesie, I left them.</p>
            <p> How much does my disgust for these people en crease my pity for poor Mr. Macartney!
               I will not see them when I can avoid so doing; but I am de termined to take every
               opportunity in my power, to shew civility to this unhappy man, whose mis fortunes,
               with this family, only render him an object of scorn. I was, however, very well pleas
               ed with M. Du Bois, who, far from joining in their mirth, expressed himself extremely
               shocked at their ill-breeding. </p>
            <p> We had not walked ten yards, ere we were fol lowed by Mr. Smith, who came to make
               excuses, and to assure me they were <hi>only joking,</hi> and hoped <pb n="262"/> I
               took nothing ill, for, if I did, he would make a quarrel of it himself with the
               Branghtons, rather than I should receive any offence. </p>
            <p> I begged him not to take any trouble about so immaterial an affair, and assured him
               I should not myself. He was so officious, that he would not be prevailed upon to
               return home, till he had walk ed with us to Mr. Dawkin's. </p>
            <p> Madame Duval was very much displeased that I brought her so little satisfaction.
               White-Conduit House was, at last, fixed upon; and, notwith standing my great dislike
               of such parties and such places, I was obliged to accompany them. </p>
            <p> Very disagreeable, and much according to my expectations, the evening proved. There
               were many people all smart and gaudy, and so pert and low-bred, that I could hardly
               endure being amongst them; but the party to which, unfortunately, I belonged, seemed
               all <hi>at home.</hi>

               </dateline>
            </opener>
            <p> YESTERDAY Mr. Smith carried his point, of making a party for Vauxhall, consisting of
               Ma dame Duval, M. Du Bois, all the Branghtons, Mr. Brown, himself,—and me!—for I find
               all en deavours vain to escape any thing which these peo ple desire I should not. </p>
            <p> There were twenty disputes previous to our set ting out; first, as to the
                  <hi>time</hi> of our going: Mr. Branghton, his son, and young Brown, were for <pb
                  n="263"/> six o'clock; and all the ladies and Mr. Smith were for eight;—the
               latter, however, con quered. </p>
            <p> Then, as to the <hi>way</hi> we should go; some were for a boat, others for a coach,
               and Mr. Branghton himself was for walking: but the boat, at length, was decided upon.
               Indeed this was the only part of the expedition that was agreeable to me, for the
               Thames was delightfully pleasant. </p>
            <p> The Garden is very pretty, but too formal; I should have been better pleased, had it
               consisted less of strait walks, where <q>
                  <l>Grove nods at grove, each alley has its brother.</l>
               </q> the trees, the numerous lights, and the company in the circle around the
               orchestra make a most bril liant and gay appearance; and, had I been with a party
               less disagreeable to me, I should have thought it a place formed for animation and
               plea sure. There was a concert, in the course of which the hautbois concerto was so
               charmingly played, that I could have thought myself upon enchanted ground, had I had
               spirits more gentle to associate with. The hautboy in the open air is heavenly. </p>
            <p> Mr. Smith endeavoured to attach himself to me, with such officious assiduity, and
               impertinent free dom, that he quite sickened me. Indeed, M. Du Bois was the only man
               of the party to whom, vo luntarily, I ever addressed myself. He is civil and
               respectful, and I have found nobody else so since I left Howard Grove. His English is
               very bad, but I prefer it to speaking French myself, which I dare not venture to do.
               I converse with him frequently, both to disengage myself from others, and to oblige
                  <pb n="264"/> Madame Duval, who is always pleased when he is attended to. </p>
            <p> As we were walking about the orchestra, I heard a bell ring, and, in a moment, Mr.
               Smyth, flying up to me, caught my hand, and, with a motion too quick to be resisted,
               ran away with me many yards before I had breath to ask his meaning, tho' I struggled
               as well as I could to get from him. At last, however, I insisted upon stopping; <q
                  rend="inline"> "Stop ping, Ma'am!" </q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "why, we must
                  run on, or we shall lose the cascade! </q>
            </p>
            <p> And then again, he hurried me away, mixing with a crowd of people, all running with
               so much ve locity, that I could not imagine what had raised such an alarm. We were
               soon followed by the rest of the party; and my surprise and ignorance proved a source
               of diversion to them all, that was not exhausted the whole evening. Young Brangh ton,
               in particular, laughed till he could hardly stand. </p>
            <p> The scene of the cascade I thought extremely pretty, and the general effect striking
               and lively. </p>
            <p> But this was not the only surprise which was to divert them at my expence; for they
               led me about the garden, purposely to enjoy my first sight of va rious other
               deceptions. </p>
            <p> About ten o'clock, Mr. Smith having chosen a <hi>box</hi> in a very conspicuous
               place, we all went to sup per. Much fault was found with every thing that was
               ordered, though not a morsel of any thing was left; and the dearness of the
               provisions, with con jectures upon what profit was made by them, sup plied discourse
               during the whole meal. </p>
            <p> When wine and cyder were brought, Mr. Smith said, <q rend="inline"> "Now let's enjoy
                  ourselves; now is the <pb n="265"/> time, or never. Well, Ma'am, and how do you
                  like Vauxhall?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Like it!"</q> cried young Branghton, <q rend="inline"> "why, how
                  can she help liking it? she has never seen such a place before, that I'll answer
                  for." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"For my part,"</q> said Miss Branghton, <q rend="inline">I like it,
                  because it is not vulgar."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"This must have been a fine treat for you, Miss,"</q> said Mr.
               Branghton; <q rend="inline"> "why, I suppose, you was never so happy in all your life
                  before?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I endeavoured to express my satisfaction with some pleasure, yet I believe they were
               much ama zed at my coldness. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Miss ought to stay in town till the last night,"</q> said young
               Branghton, <q rend="inline"> "and then, it's my belief, she'd say something to it!
                  Why, Lord, it's the best night of any; there's always a riot,—and there the folks
                  run about,—and then there's such squealing and squalling!—and there all the lamps
                  are broke,—and the women run skimper scamper;—I declare I would not take five
                  guineas to miss the last night!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I was very glad when they all grew tired of sit ting, and called for the waiter to
               pay the bill. The Miss Branghtons said they would walk on, while the gentlemen
               settled the account, and asked me to accompany them; which, however, I de clined. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"You girls may do as you please,"</q> said Madame Duval, <q
                  rend="inline"> "but as to me, I promise you, I sha'n't go no where without the
                  gentlemen." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "No more, I suppose, will my <hi>Cousin,</hi> " </q> said Miss
               Branghton, looking reproachfully towards Mr. Smith. </p>
            <p> This reflection, which, I feared, would slatter his vanity, made me, most
               unfortunately, request <pb n="266"/> Madame Duval's permission to attend them. She
               granted it, and away we went, having promised to meet in the room. </p>
            <p> To the room, therefore, I would immediately have gone; but the sisters agreed that
               they would first have a <hi>little pleasure,</hi> and they tittered, and talked so
               loud, that they attracted universal no tice. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Lord, Polly,"</q> said the eldest, <q rend="inline"> "suppose we
                  were to take a turn in the dark walks!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Ay, do,"</q> answered she, <q rend="inline"> "and then we'll hide
                  ourselves, and then Mr. Brown will think we are lost." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I remonstrated very warmly against this plan, telling them, that it would endanger
               our missing the rest of the party all the evening. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O dear,"</q> cried Miss Branghton, <q rend="inline"> "I thought how
                  uneasy Miss would be, without a beau!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> This impertinence I did not think worth answer ing; and, quite by compulsion, I
               followed them down a long alley, in which there was hardly any light. </p>
            <p> By the time we came near the end, a large party of gentlemen, apparently very
               riotous, and who were hallowing, leaning on one another, and laugh ing immoderately,
               seemed to rush suddenly from behind some trees, and, meeting us face to face, put
               their arms at their sides, and formed a kind of circle, that first stopped our
               proceeding, and then our retreating, for we were presently entirely in closed. The
               Miss Branghtons screamed aloud, and I was frightened exceedingly: our screams were
               answered with bursts of laughter, and, for some minutes, we were kept prisoners,
               till, at last, one of them, rudely, seizing hold of me, said I was a pretty little
               creature. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="267"/> Terrified to death, I struggled with such vehe mence to disengage
               myself from him, that I suc ceeded, in spite of his efforts to detain me; and
               immediately, and with a swiftness which fear only could have given me, I flew rather
               than ran up the walk, hoping to secure my safety by return <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"
               /> ing to the lights and company we had so foolishly left: but, before I could
               possibly accomplish my purpose, I was met by another party of men, one of whom placed
               himself so directly in my way, calling out, <q rend="inline">"Whither so fast, my
                  love?"—</q> that I could only have proceeded, by running into his arms. </p>
            <p> In a moment both my hands, by different per sons, were caught hold of; and one of
               them, in a most familiar manner, desired to accompany me in a race, when I ran next;
               while the rest of the party stood still and laughed. </p>
            <p> I was almost distracted with terror, and so breathless with running, that I could
               not speak, till another advancing, said, I was as handsome as an angel, and desired
               to be of the party. I then just articulated <q rend="inline">"For Heaven's sake,
                  Gentlemen, let me pass!"</q>
            </p>
            <p> Another then, rushing suddenly forward, ex claimed, <q rend="inline">"Heaven and
                  earth! what voice is that?—"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "The voice of the prettiest little actress I have seen this age,"
               </q> answered one of my persecutors. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No,—no,—no,—"</q> I <hi>panted</hi> out, <q rend="inline"> "I am no
                  actress,—pray let me go,—pray let me pass—." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"By all that's sacred,"</q> cried the same voice, which I then knew
               for Sir Clement Willoughby's, <q rend="inline">"'tis herself!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Sir Clement Willoughby!"</q> cried I. <q rend="inline"> "O Sir,
                  assist—assist me—or I shall die with terror!—" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="268"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Gentlemen,"</q> cried he, disengaging them all from me in an
               instant, <q rend="inline">"pray leave this lady to me."</q>
            </p>
            <p> Loud laughs proceeded from every mouth, and two or three said, <q rend="inline"> "
                     <hi>Willoughby has all the luck!</hi> " </q> But one of them, in a passionate
               manner, vowed he would not give me up, for that he had the first right to me, and
               would support it. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"You are mistaken,"</q> said Sir Clement, <q rend="inline"> "this
                  lady is—I will explain myself to you another time; but, I assure you, you are all
                  mistaken." </q>
            </p>
            <p> And then, taking my willing hand, he led me off, amidst the loud acclamations,
               laughter, and gross merriment of his impertinent companions. </p>
            <p> As soon as we had escaped from them, Sir Cle ment with a voice of surprise,
               exclaimed, <q rend="inline"> "My dearest creature, what wonder, what strange revo
                  lution, has brought you to such a spot as this?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> Ashamed of my situation, and extremely morti fied to be thus recognized by him, I
               was for some time silent, and when he repeated his question, only stammered out, <q
                  rend="inline"> "I have,—I hardly know how,—lost myself from my party.—" </q>
            </p>
            <p> He caught my hand, and eagerly pressing it, in a passionate voice, said, <q
                  rend="inline">"O that I had sooner met with thee!"</q>
            </p>
            <p> Surprised at a freedom so unexpected, I angrily broke from him, saying, <q
                  rend="inline">"Is this the protection you give me, Sir Clement?"</q>
            </p>
            <p> And then I saw what the perturbation of my mind had prevented my sooner noticing,
               that he had led me, though I know not how, into an other of the dark alleys, instead
               of the place whi ther I meant to go. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Good God!"</q> I cried, <q rend="inline">"where am I?—what way are
                  you going?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="269"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Where,"</q> answered he, <q rend="inline">"we shall be least
                  observed."</q>
            </p>
            <p> Astonished at this speech, I stopped short, and declared I would go no further. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"And why not, my angel?"</q> again endeavour ing to take my hand. </p>
            <p> My heart beat with resentment; I pushed him away from me with all my strength, and
               demanded how he dared treat me with such insolence? </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Insolence!"</q> repeated he. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Yes, Sir Clement, <hi>insolence;</hi> from you, who know me, I had
                  a claim for protection,—not to such treatment as this." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"By Heaven,"</q> cried he with warmth, <q rend="inline"> "you
                  distract me,—why, tell me,—why do I see you here?—Is this a place for Miss
                  Anville?—these dark walks!—no party!—no companion!—by all that's good, I can
                  scarce believe my senses!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> Extremely offended at this speech, I turned an grily from him, and, not deigning to
               make any an swer, walked on towards that part of the garden whence I perceived the
               lights and company. </p>
            <p>He followed me; but we were both some time silent.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"So you will not explain to me your situation?"</q> said he, at
               length. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No, Sir,"</q> answered I, disdainfully. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Nor yet—suffer me to make my own inter pretation—?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I could not bear this strange manner of speak ing; it made my very soul shudder,—and
               I burst into tears. </p>
            <p> He flew to me, and actually flung himself at my feet, as if regardless who might see
               him, saying, <q rend="inline"> "O Miss Anville—loveliest of women—forgive my—my—I
                  beseech you forgive me;—if I have <pb n="270"/> offended,—if I have hurt you I
                  could kill myself at the thought!—" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No matter, Sir, no matter,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline"> "if I
                  can but find my friends,—I will never speak to—never see you again!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Good God!—good Heaven!—my dearest life, what is it I have
                  done?—What is it I have said?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "You best know, Sir, <hi>what</hi> and <hi>why;</hi> —but don't
                  hold me here,—let me be gone, and do <hi>you!</hi> " </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Not till you forgive me!—I cannot part with you in anger." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"For shame, for shame, Sir!"</q> cried I indig nantly, <q
                  rend="inline"> "do you suppose I am to be thus com pelled?—do you take advantage
                  of the absence of my friends, to affront me?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No, Madam,"</q> cried he, rising, <q rend="inline"> "I would sooner
                  forfeit my life than act so mean a part. But you have flung me into amazement
                  unspeakable, and you will not condescend to listen to my request of giving me some
                  explanation." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"The manner, Sir,"</q> said I, <q rend="inline"> "in which you spoke
                  that request, made and will make me scorn to answer it." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Scorn!—I will own to you, I expected not such displeasure from
                  Miss Anville." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Perhaps, Sir, if you had, you would less vo luntarily have merited
                  it." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "My dearest life, surely it must be known to you, that the man does
                  not breathe, who adores you so passionately, so fervently, so tenderly as I
                  do!—why then will you delight in perplexing me?—in keeping me in suspence—in
                  torturing me with doubt?"— </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "I, Sir, delight in perplexing you!—You are much mistaken.—Your
                  suspence, your doubts, your perplexities,—are of your own creating; and, <pb
                     n="271"/> believe me, Sir, they may <hi>offend</hi> but they can never
                     <hi>delight</hi> me:—but, as you have yourself raised, you must yourself
                  satisfy them." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Good God!—that such haughtiness and such sweetness can inhabit the
                  same mansion!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I made no answer, but quickening my pace, I walked on silently and sullenly; till
               this most im petuous of men, snatching my hand, which he grasped with violence,
               besought me to forgive him, with such earnestness of supplication, that merely to
               escape his importunities, I was forced to speak, and, in some measure to grant the
               pardon he re quested: though it was accorded with a very ill grace; but, indeed, I
               knew not how to resist the humility of his entreaties: yet never shall I recol lect
               the occasion he gave me of displeasure, with out feeling it renewed. </p>
            <p> We now soon arrived in the midst of the general crowd, and my own safety being then
               insured, I grew extremely uneasy for the Miss Branghtons, whose danger, however
               imprudently incurred by their own folly, I too well knew how to tremble for. To this
               consideration all my pride of heart yielded, and I determined to seek my party with
               the utmost speed; though not without a sigh did I recollect the fruitless attempt I
               had made, after the opera, of concealing from this man my unfortunate connections,
               which I was now obliged to make known. </p>
            <p> I hastened therefore, to the room, with a view of sending young Branghton to the aid
               of his sisters. In a very short time, I perceived Madame Duval, and the rest, looking
               at one of the paintings. I must own to you honestly, my dear Sir, that an involun
               tary repugnance seized me, at presenting such a set to Sir Clement,—he, who had been
               used to see <pb n="272"/> me in parties so different!—My pace slackened as I
               approached them,—but they presently perceived me. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> " <hi>Ah, Mademoiselle!</hi> " </q> cried M. Du Bois, <q
                  rend="inline"> " <hi>Que je suis charme de vous voir!</hi> " </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Pray, Miss,"</q> cried Mr. Brown, <q rend="inline">"where's Miss
                  Polly?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why, Miss, you've been a long while gone,"</q> said Mr. Branghton;
                  <q rend="inline"> "we thought you'd been lost. But what have you done with your
                  cousins?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I hesitated,—for Sir Clement regarded me with a look of wonder. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> " <hi>Pardie,</hi> " </q> cried Madame Duval, <q rend="inline"> "I
                  sha'n't let you leave me again in a hurry. Why, here we've been in such a
                  fright!—and all the while, I suppose you've been thinking nothing about the
                  matter." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Well,"</q> said young Branghton, <q rend="inline"> "as long as Miss
                  is come back, I don't mind, for as to Bid and Poll, they can take care of
                  themselves. But the best joke is, Mr. Smith is gone all about a looking for you."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p> These speeches were made almost all in a breath: but when, at last, they waited for
               an answer, I told them, that in walking up one of the long al leys, we had been
               frightened and separated. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"The long alleys!"</q> repeated Mr. Brangh ton, <q rend="inline">
                  "and, pray, what had you to do in the long alleys? why, to be sure, you must all
                  of you have had a mind to be affronted!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> This speech was not more impertinent to me, than surprising to Sir Clement, who
               regarded all the party with evident astonishment. However, I told young Branghton
               that no time ought to be lost, for that his sisters might require his immediate
               protection. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"But how will they get it?"</q> cried this brutal brother; <q
                  rend="inline"> "if they've a mind to behave in such a <pb n="273"/> manner as
                  that, they ought to protect themselves; and so they may for me." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Well,"</q> said the simple Mr. Brown, <q rend="inline"> "whe ther
                  you go or no, I think I may as well see after Miss Polly." </q>
            </p>
            <p> The father then, interfering, insisted that his son should accompany him; and away
               they went. </p>
            <p> It was now that Madame Duval first perceived Sir Clement; to whom turning with a
               look of great displeasure, she angrily said, <q rend="inline"> " <hi>Ma foi,</hi> so
                  you are comed here, of all the people in the world!—I wonder, child, you would let
                  such a—such a <hi>person</hi> as that keep company with you." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I am very sorry, Madam,"</q> said Sir Clement, in a tone of
               surprise, <q rend="inline"> "if I have been so unfor tunate as to offend you; but I
                  believe you will not regret the honour I now have of attending Miss Anville, when
                  you hear that I have been so happy as to do her some service." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Just as Madame Duval, with her usual <hi>Ma foi,</hi> was beginning to reply, the
               attention of Sir Cle ment was wholly drawn from her, by the appear ance of Mr. Smith,
               who suddenly coming behind me, and freely putting his hands on my shoulders, cried,
                  <q rend="inline"> "O ho, my little runaway, have I found you at last? I have been
                  scampering all over the gardens for you; for I was determined to find you, if you
                  were above ground.—But how could you be so cruel as to leave us?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I turned round to him, and looked with a degree of contempt that I hoped would have
               quieted him; but he had not the sense to understand me; and, attempting to take my
               hand, he added, <q rend="inline"> "Such a demure looking lady as you are, who'd have
                  thought of your leading one such a dance?—Come, now, <pb n="274"/> don't be so
                  coy,—only think what a trouble I have had in running after you!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"The trouble, Sir,"</q> said I, <q rend="inline">"was of your own
                  choice—not mine."</q> And I walked round to the other side of Madame Duval. </p>
            <p> Perhaps I was too proud,—but I could not en dure that Sir Clement, whose eyes
               followed him with looks of the most surprized curiosity, should witness his unwelcome
               familiarity. </p>
            <p> Upon my removal, he came up to me, and, in a low voice, said, <q rend="inline">"You
                  are not, then, with the Mirvans?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No, Sir."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"And pray—may I ask,—have you left them long?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No, Sir,"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "How unfortunate I am!—but yesterday I sent to acquaint the Captain
                  I should reach the Grove by to-morrow noon! However I shall get away as fast as
                  possible. Shall you be long in town?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I believe not, Sir."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> And then, when you leave it,—which way—will you allow me to ask,
                  which way you shall travel?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Indeed,—I don't know."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Not know!—But do you return to the Mir vans any more?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I—I can't tell, Sir."</q>
            </p>
            <p> And then, I addressed myself to Madame Duval, with such a pretended earnestness,
               that he was ob liged to be silent. </p>
            <p> As he cannot but observe the great change in my situation, which he knows not how to
               account for, there is something in all these questions, and this unrestrained
               curiosity, that I did not expect from a man, who when he pleases can be so well bred,
               as Sir Clement Willoughby. He seems dis posed <pb n="275"/> to think that the
               alteration in my compa nions authorizes an alteration in his manners. It is true, he
               has always treated me with uncom mon freedom, but never before with so disrespect ful
               an abruptness. This observation, which he has given me cause to make, of his
                  <hi>changing with the tide,</hi> has sunk him more in my opinion, than any other
               part of his conduct. </p>
            <p> Yet I could almost have laughed, when I looked at Mr. Smith, who no sooner saw me
               addressed by Sir Clement, than, retreating aloof from the company, he seemed to lose
               at once all his happy self-sufficiency and conceit; looking now at the baronet, now
               at himself, surveying, with sorrow ful eyes, his dress, struck with his air, his ges
               tures, his easy gaiety; he gazed at him with en vious admiration, and seemed himself,
               with con scious inferiority, to shrink into nothing. </p>
            <p> Soon after, Mr. Brown, running up to us, called out, <q rend="inline">"La, what,
                  i'n't Miss Polly come yet?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Come!"</q> said Mr. Branghton, <q rend="inline"> "why, I thought
                  you went to fetch her yourself did n't you?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Yes, but I could n't find her;—yet I dare say I've been over half
                  the garden." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Half! but why did not you go over it all?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why, so I will: but only I thought I'd just come and see if she
                  was here first?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"But where's Tom?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why, I don't know; for he would not stay with me, all as ever I
                  could say; for we met some young gentlemen of his acquaintance, and so he bid me
                  go and look by myself, for he said, says he, I can divert myself better another
                  way, says he." </q>
            </p>
            <p> This account being given, away again went this silly young man; and Mr. Branghton,
               extremely <pb n="276"/> incensed, said he would go and see after them him self. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"So now,"</q> cried Madame Duval, <q rend="inline"> "he's gone too!
                  why, at this rate we shall have to wait for one or other of them all night!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> Observing that Sir Clement seemed disposed to renew his enquiries, I turned towards
               one of the paintings, and, pretending to be very much occu pied in looking after it,
               asked M. Du Bois some questions concerning the figures. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "O, <hi>Mon Dieu!</hi> " </q> cried Madame Duval, <q rend="inline">
                  "don't ask him; your best way is to ask Mr. Smith, for he's been here the
                  oftenest. Come, Mr. Smith, I dare say you can tell us all about them." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why, yes, Ma'am,"</q> said Mr. Smith, who, brightening up at this
               application, advanced to wards us, with an air of assumed importance (which, however,
               sat very uneasily upon him) and begged to know what he should explain first; <q
                  rend="inline">"For I have attended,"</q> said he, <q rend="inline"> "to all these
                  paintings, and know every thing in them perfectly well; for I am rather fond of
                  pictures, Ma'am; and, really, I must say, I think a picture is a—a very—is real ly
                  a very—is something very pretty—" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"So do I too,"</q> said Madame Duval, <q rend="inline"> "but pray
                  now, Sir, tell us who that is meant for," </q> pointing to a figure of Neptune. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "That!—why that, Ma'am, is,—Lord bless me, I can't think how I come
                  to be so stupid, but really I have forgot his name,—and yet, I know it as well as
                  my own, too,—however, he's a <hi>general,</hi> Ma'am, they are all generals." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I saw Sir Clement bite his lips; and, indeed, so did I mine. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Well,"</q> said Madame Duval, <q rend="inline">"it's the oddest
                  dress for a general ever I see!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="277"/>
               <q rend="inline">"He seems so capital a figure,"</q> said Sir Cle ment to Mr. Smith,
                  <q rend="inline"> "that I imagine he must be <hi>generalissimo</hi> of the whole
                  army." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir, yes,"</q> answered Mr. Smith, respect fully bowing, and
               highly delighted at being thus referred to, <q rend="inline"> "you are perfectly
                  right,—but I can not for my life think of his name;—perhaps, Sir, you may remember
                  it?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No really,"</q> replied Sir Clement, <q rend="inline"> "my ac
                  quaintance among the generals is not so exten sive." </q>
            </p>
            <p> The ironical tone of voice in which Sir Cle ment spoke, entirely disconcerted Mr.
               Smith; who, again retiring to an humble distance, seemed sen sibly mortified at the
               failure of his attempt to reco ver his consequence. </p>
            <p> Soon after, Mr. Branghton returned with his youngest daughter, whom he had rescued
               from a party of insolent young men; but he had not yet been able to find the eldest.
               Miss Polly was really frightened, and declared she would never go into the dark walks
               again. Her father, leaving her with us, went in quest of her sister. </p>
            <p> While she was relating her adventures, to which nobody listened more attentively
               than Sir Clement, we saw Mr. Brown enter the room. <q rend="inline">"O la!"</q> cried
               Miss Polly, <q rend="inline">"let me hide myself, and don't tell him I'm come."</q>
            </p>
            <p> She then placed herself behind Madame Duval, in such a manner that she could not be
               seen. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"So Miss Polly is not come yet!"</q> said the sim ple swain; <q
                  rend="inline"> "well, I can't think where she can be! I've been a looking, and
                  looking, and looking all about, and I can't find her, all I can do." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Well but, Mr. Brown,"</q> said Mr. Smith, <q rend="inline">"sha'n't
                  you go and look for the lady again?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="278"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir,"</q> said he, sitting down, <q rend="inline"> "but I must
                  rest me a little bit first. You can't think how tired I am." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O fie, Mr. Brown, fie,"</q> cried Mr. Smith, winking at us, <q
                  rend="inline">"tired of looking for a lady! Go, go, for shame!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "So I will, Sir, presently; but you'd be tired too, if you'd walked
                  so far: besides, I think she's gone out of the garden, or else I must have seen
                  something or other of her." </q>
            </p>
            <p> A <hi>he, he, he!</hi> of the tittering Polly, now be trayed her, and so ended this
               ingenious little arti fice. </p>
            <p> At last appeared Mr. Branghton and Miss Biddy, who, with a face of mixed anger and
               confusion, addressing herself to me, said, <q rend="inline"> "So Miss, so you ran
                  away from me! Well, see if I don't do as much by you, some day or other! But I
                  thought how it would be, you'd no mind to leave the <hi> gen tlemen, </hi> though
                  you'd run away from <hi>me.</hi> " </q>
            </p>
            <p> I was so much surprised at this attack, that I could not answer her for very
               amazement; and she proceeded to tell us how ill she had been used, and that two young
               men had been making her walk up and down the dark walks by absolute force, and as
               fast as ever they could tear her along; and many other particulars, which I will not
               tire you with relating. In conclusion, looking at Mr. Smith, she said, <q
                  rend="inline"> "But, to be sure, thought I, at least all the company will be
                  looking for me; so I little expected to find you all here, talking as comfortably
                  as ever you can. However, I know I may thank my cousin for it!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "If you mean <hi>me,</hi> Madam," </q> said I, very much shocked,
                  <q rend="inline"> "I am quite ignorant in what manner I can have been accessary to
                  your distress." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="279"/>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why, by running away so. If you'd stayed with us, I'll answer for
                  it, Mr. Smith and M. Du Bois would have come to look for us; but I suppose they
                  could not leave your ladyship." </q>
            </p>
            <p> The folly and unreasonableness of this speech would admit of no answer. But what a
               scene was this for Sir Clement! his surprise was evi dent; and, I must acknowledge,
               my confusion was equally great. </p>
            <p> We had now to wait for young Branghton, who did not appear for some time; and,
               during this in terval, it was with difficulty that I avoided Sir Clement, who was on
               the rack of curiosity, and dying to speak to me. </p>
            <p> When, at last, the hopeful youth returned, a long and frightful quarrel ensued
               between him and his father, in which his sisters occasionally joined, concerning his
               neglect; and he defended himself only by a brutal mirth, which he indulged at their
               expence. </p>
            <p> Every one, now, seemed inclined to depart,—when, as usual, a dispute arose, upon the
                  <hi>way</hi> of our going, whether in a coach or a boat. After much debating, it
               was determined that we should make two parties, one by the water and the other by
               land; for Madame Duval declared she would not, upon any account, go into a boat at
               night. </p>
            <p> Sir Clement then said, that if she had no car riage in waiting, he should be happy
               to see her and me safe home, as his was in readiness. </p>
            <p> Fury started into her eyes, and passion inflamed every feature, as she answered, <q
                  rend="inline"> " <hi>Pardie,</hi> no,—you may take care of yourself, if you
                  please; but as to me, I promise you I sha'n't trust myself with no such person."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="280"/> He pretended not to comprehend her meaning, yet, to wave a discussion,
               acquiesced in her refu sal. The coach party fixed upon consisted of Ma dame Duval, M.
               Du Bois, Miss Branghton, and myself. </p>
            <p> I now began to rejoice, in private, that, at least, our lodgings would be neither
               seen, nor known, by Sir Clement. We soon met with an hackney-coach, into which he
               handed me, and then took leave. </p>
            <p> Madame Duval, having already given the coach man her direction, he mounted the box,
               and we were just driving off, when Sir Clement exclaim ed, <q rend="inline"> "By
                  Heaven, this is the very coach I had in waiting for myself!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"This coach, your honour!"</q> said the man, <q rend="inline">"no,
                  that it i'nt."</q>
            </p>
            <p> Sir Clement, however, swore that it was, and, presently, the man, begging his
               pardon, said he had really forgotten that he was engaged. </p>
            <p> I have no doubt but that this scheme occurred to him at the moment, and that he made
               some sign to the coachman, which induced him to support it: for there is not the
               least probability that the acci dent really happened, as it is most likely his own
               chariot was in waiting. </p>
            <p> The man then opened the coach-door, and Sir Clement advancing to it, said, <q
                  rend="inline"> "I don't believe there is another carriage to be had, or I would
                  not incommode you: but, as it may be disagreeable to you to wait here any longer,
                  I beg you will not get out, for you shall be set down before I am car ried home,
                  if you will be so good as to make a lit tle room." </q>
            </p>
            <p> And so saying, in he jumpt, and seated himself between M. Du Bois and me, while our
               astonish ment <pb n="281"/> at the whole transaction was too great for speech. He
               then ordered the coachman to drive on, according to the directions he had already re
               ceived. </p>
            <p> For the first ten minutes, no one uttered a word; and then, Madame Duval, no longer
               able to con tain herself, exclaimed, <q rend="inline"> " <hi>Ma foi,</hi> if this is
                  n't one of the impudentest things ever I see!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> Sir Clement, regardless of this rebuke, attended only to me; however, I answered
               nothing he said, when I could possibly avoid so doing. Miss Brangh ton made several
               attempts to attract his notice, but in vain, for he would not take the trouble of pay
               ing her any regard. </p>
            <p> Madame Duval, during the rest of the ride, ad dressed herself to M. Du Bois in
               French, and in that language exclaimed with great vehemence against boldness and
               assurance. </p>
            <p> I was extremely glad when I thought our jour ney must be nearly at an end, for my
               situation was very uneasy to me, as Sir Clement perpetually en deavoured to take my
               hand. I looked out of the coach-window, to see if we were near home; Sir Clement,
               stooping over me did the same, and then, in a voice of infinite wonder, called out,
                  <q rend="inline"> "Where the d—l is the man driving to?—why we are in Broad St.
                  Giles's!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O, he's very right,"</q> cried Madame Duval, <q rend="inline"> "so
                  never trouble your head about that, for I shan't go by no directions of yours, I
                  promise you." </q>
            </p>
            <p> When, at last, we stopped, at <hi>an Hosier's</hi> in <hi>High Holborn,</hi> —Sir
               Clement said nothing, but his <hi>eyes,</hi> I saw, were very busily employed in view
               ing the place, and the situation of the house. The coach he insisted upon settling
               himself, as he said it belonged to him; and then he took leave. M. Du <pb n="282"/>
               Bois walked home with Miss Branghton, and Ma dame Duval and I retired to our
               apartments. </p>
            <p> How disagreeable an evening's adventure! not one of the party seemed satisfied,
               except Sir Cle ment, who was in high spirits: but Madame Du val was enraged at
               meeting with him; Mr. Brangh ton, angry with his children; the frolick of the Miss
               Branghtons had exceeded their plan, and end ed in their own distress; their brother
               was provo ked that there had been no riot; Mr. Brown was tired; and Mr. Smith
               mortified. As to myself, I must acknowledge, nothing could be more disagree able to
               me, than being seen by Sir Clement Wil loughby with a party at once so vulgar in them
               selves, and so familiar to me. </p>
            <p> And you, too, my dear Sir, will, I know, be sorry that I have met him; however,
               there is no apprehension of his visiting here, as Madame Du val is far too angry to
               admit him. </p>

            <p> MADAME Duval rose very late this morn ing, and at one o'clock, we had but just break
               fasted, when Miss Branghton, her brother, Mr. Smith, and Monsieur du Bois, called to
               enquire after our healths. </p>
            <p> This civility in young Branghton, I much sus pect, was merely the result of his
               father's com mands; but his sister and Mr. Smith, I soon found, had motives of their
               own. Scarce had they spoken to Madame Duval, when, advancing eagerly to me, <q
                  rend="inline">"Pray, Ma'am,"</q> said Mr. Smith, <q rend="inline">"who was that
                  gentleman?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Pray, Cousin,"</q> cried Miss Branghton, was <q rend="inline"> "not
                  he the same gentleman you ran away with that night at the opera?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Goodness! that he was,"</q> said young <pb n="4"/> Branghton; <q
                  rend="inline"> "and I declare, as soon as ever I saw him, I thought I knew his
                  face." </q>

            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I'm sure I'll defy you to forget him,"</q> an swered his sister, <q
                  rend="inline"> "if once you had seen him: he is the finest gentleman I ever saw in
                  my life; don't you think so, Mr. Smith? </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why, you won't give the Lady time to speak,"</q> said Mr. Smith.—
                  <q rend="inline">"Pray, Ma'am, what is the gentleman's name?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Willoughby, Sir."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Willoughby! I think I have heard the name. Pray, Ma'am, is he
                  married?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Lord, no, that he is not,"</q> cried Miss Branghton; <q
                  rend="inline"> "he looks too smart, by a great deal, for a married man. Pray,
                  Cousin, how did you get acquainted with him?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Pray, Miss,"</q> said young Branghton, in the same breath, <q
                  rend="inline">"what's his business?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Indeed I don't know,"</q> answered I. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Something very genteel, I dare say,"</q> added Miss Branghton, <q
                  rend="inline">"because he dresses so fine."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "It ought to be something that brings in a good income." </q> said
               Mr. Smith, <q rend="inline"> "for I'm sure he did not get that suit of cloaths he had
                  on, un der thirty or forty pounds; for I know the price of Cloaths pretty well;
                  pray, Ma'am, can you tell me what he has a year?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Don't talk no more about him;"</q> cried Ma dame Duval, <q
                  rend="inline"> "for I don't like to hear his name; I believe he's one of the worst
                  persons in the world; for, though I never did him no manner of harm, nor so much
                  as hurt a hair of his head, I know he was an accomplice with that fellow, Captain
                  Mirvan, to take away my life." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Every body, but myself, now crowding around her for an explanation, a violent
               rapping at the street-door was unheard; and, without any pre vious notice, in the
               midst of her narration, Sir <pb n="5"/> Clement Willoughby entered the room. They all
               started, and, with looks of guilty confusion, as if they feared his resentment for
               having listened to Madame Duval, they scrambled for Chairs, and, in a moment, were
               all formally seated. </p>
            <p> Sir Clement, after a general bow, singling out Madame Duval, said, with his usual
               easiness, <q rend="inline"> "I have done myself the honour of waiting on you, Madam,
                  to enquire if you have any commands to Howard Grove, whither I am going to-mor-row
                  morning." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Then, seeing the storm that gathered in her eyes, before he allowed her time to
               answer, he addressed himself to me;— <q rend="inline"> "And, if you, Ma dam, have any
                  with which you will honour me, I shall be happy to execute them." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"None at all, Sir."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "None! not to Miss Mirvan!—no message! no letter!—" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I wrote to Miss Mirvan yesterday by the post."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "My application should have been earlier, had I sooner known your
                  address." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> " <hi>Ma foi,</hi> " </q> cried Madame Duval, recovering from her
               surprize, <q rend="inline">"I believe never nobody saw the like of this!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Of what! Madam!"</q> cried the undaunted Sir Clement, turning quick
               towards her, <q rend="inline">"I hope no one has offended you!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"You don't hope no such a thing!"</q> cried she, half choaked with
               passion, and rising from her chair. This motion was followed by the rest, and, in a
               moment, every body stood up. </p>
            <p> Still Sir Clement was not abashed; affecting to make a bow of
                  <hi>acknowledgment</hi> to the company in general, he said <q rend="inline">
                  "Pary—I beg—Ladies,—pray Gentlemen,—don't let me disturb you, pray keep your
                  seats." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Pray, Sir,"</q> said Miss Branghton, moving a chair towards him, <q
                  rend="inline"> "won't you sit down your self?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "You are extremely good, Ma'am: rather than make any disturbance—"
               </q>
            </p>
            <p> And so saying, this strange man seated himself, as did, in an instant, every body
               else, even Ma dame Duval herself, who, overpowered by his boldness, seemed too full
               for utterance. </p>
            <p> He then, and with as much composure as if he had been an expected guest, began to
               discourse on the weather,—its uncertainty, the heat of the public places in summer,
               the emptiness of the town, and other such common topics. </p>
            <p> Nobody, however, answered him; Mr. Smith seemed afraid, young Branghton ashamed, M.
               Du Bois amazed, Madame Duval enraged, and myself determined not to interfere. All
               that he could obtain, was the notice of Miss Branghton, whose nods, smiles, and
               attention, had some ap pearance of entering into conversation with him. </p>
            <p> At length, growing tired, I suppose of engag ing every body's eyes, and nobody's
               tongue, ad dressing himself to Madame Duval and to me, he said, <q rend="inline"> "I
                  regard myself as peculiarly unfortunate, Ladies, in having fixed upon a time for
                  my visit to Howard Grove, when you are absent from it." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"So I suppose, Sir, so I suppose,"</q> cried Madame Duval, hastily
               rising, and the next mo ment as hastily seating herself, <q rend="inline"> "you'll be
                  a want ing of somebody to make your game of, and so you may think to get
                     <hi>me</hi> there again;—but I pro mise you, Sir, you won't find it so easy a
                  matter to make me a fool: and besides that," </q> raising her voice, <q
                  rend="inline"> "I've found you out, I assure you; so if ever you go to play your
                  tricks upon me again, I'll make no more ado, but go directly to a justice of
                  peace; so, Sir, if you can't think of <pb n="7"/> nothing but making people ride
                  about the Coun try, at all hours of the night, just for your di version, why
                  you'll find I know some justices, as well as Justice Tyrrel." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Sir Clement was evidently embarrassed at this attack; yet he affected a look of
               surprize, and protested he did not understand her meaning. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Well"</q> cried she, <q rend="inline"> "if I don't wonder where
                  people can get such impudence! if you'll say that, you'll say any thing; however,
                  if you swear till you're black in the face, I shan't be lieve you; for nobody
                  shan't persuade me out of my senses, that I'll promise you." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Doubtless not, Madam,"</q> answered he, with some hesitation, <q
                  rend="inline"> "and I hope you do not suspect I ever had such an intention; my
                  respect for you—" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "O Sir, you're vastly polite, all of a sud den! but I know what
                  it's all for;—it's only for what you can get!—you cou'd treat me like no body at
                  Howard Grove—but now you see I've a house of my own, you've a mind to wheedle
                  yourself into it; but I sees your design, so you need n't trouble yourself to take
                  no more trouble about that, for you shall never get nothing at my house,—not so
                  much as a dish of tea:—so now, Sir, you see I can play you trick for trick." </q>
            </p>
            <p> There was something so extremely gross in this speech, that it even disconcerted Sir
               Clement, who was too much confounded to make any an swer. </p>
            <p> It was curious to observe the effect which his embarrassment added to the freedom
               with which Madame Duval addressed him, had upon the rest of the company: every one,
               who, before, seem ed at a loss how, or if at all, to occupy a chair, now filled it
               with the most easy composure: and <pb n="8"/> Mr. Smith, whose countenance had
               exhibited the most striking picture of mortified envy, now be gan to recover his
               usual expression of satisfied con ceit. </p>
            <p> Young Branghton, too, who had been appa rently awed by the presence of so fine a
               gentle man, was again himself, rude and familiar, while his mouth was wide distended
               into a broad grin, at hearing <hi> his Aunt give the beau such a trim ming. </hi>
            </p>
            <p> Madame Duval, encouraged by this success, looked around her with an air of triumph,
               and continued her harangue: <q rend="inline"> "And so, Sir, I sup pose you thought to
                  have had it all your own way, and to have comed here as often as you pleased, and
                  to have got me to Howard Grove again, on purpose to have served me as you did
                  before; but you shall see I'm as cunning as you, so you may go and find somebody
                  else to use in that manner, and to put your mask on, and to make a fool of; for as
                  to me, if you go to tell me your stories about the Tower again, for a month toge
                  ther, I'll never believe 'em no more; and I'll promise you, Sir, if you think I
                  like such jokes, you'll find I'm no such person." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "I assure you, Ma'am,—upon my honour—I really don't comprehend—I
                  fancy there is some misunderstanding—" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "What, I suppose you'll tell me next you don't know nothing of the
                  matter?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Not a word, upon my honour."</q>
            </p>
            <p> O Sir Clement! thought I, is it thus you prize your honour! </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> " <hi>Pardie,</hi> " </q> cried Madame Duval, <q rend="inline">
                  "this is the most provokingest part of all! why you might as well tell me I don't
                  know my own name." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9"/>
               <q rend="inline"> "Here is certainly some mistake; for I assure you, Ma'am—" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Don't assure me nothing,"</q> cried Madame Duval, raising her
               voice, <q rend="inline"> "I know what I'm saying, and so do you too; for did not you
                  tell me all that about the Tower; and about M. Du Bois?—why M. Du Bois was n't
                  never there, nor nigh it, and so it was all your own invention." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "May there not be two persons of the same name? the mistake was but
                  natural—" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Don't tell me of no mistake, for it was all on purpose; besides,
                  did not you come, all in a mask, to the chariot door, and help to get me put in
                  that ditch?—I'll promise you, I've had the greatest mind in the world to take the
                  law of you, and if ever you do as much again, so I will, I assure you!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> Here Miss Branghton tittered; Mr. Smith smiled contemptuously, and young Branghton
               thrust his handkerchief into his mouth to stop his laughter. </p>
            <p> The situation of Sir Clement, who saw all that passed, became now very awkward, even
               to him self, and he stammered very much in saying, <q rend="inline"> "surely,
                  Madam—surely you—you cannot do me the—the injustice to think—that I had any share
                  in the—the—the misfortune which—" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> " <hi>Ma foi,</hi> Sir," </q> cried Madame Duval, with encreasing
               passion, <q rend="inline"> "you'd best not stand talking to me at that rate; I know
                  it <hi>was</hi> you,—and if you stay there, provoking me in such a manner, I'll
                  send for a Constable this minute." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Young Branghton, at these words, in spite of all his efforts, burst into a loud
               laugh; nor could either his sister, or Mr. Smith, though with more moderation,
               forbear joining in his mirth. </p>
            <p> Sir Clement darted his eyes towards them, with looks of the most angry contempt, and
               then <pb n="10"/> told Madame Duval, that he would not now detain her, to make his
               vindication, but would wait on her some time when she was alone. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "O <hi>pardie,</hi> Sir," </q> cried she, <q rend="inline"> "I
                  don't desire none of your company; and if you was n't the most impudentest person
                  in the world, you would not dare look me in the face." </q>
            </p>
            <p> The ha, ha, ha's, and he, he, he's, grew more and more uncontroulable, as if the
               restraint from which they had burst, had added to their vi olence. Sir Clement could
               no longer endure be ing the object who excited them, and, having no answer ready for
               Madame Duval, he hastily stalked towards Mr. Smith and young Branghton, and sternly
               demanded what they laughed at? </p>
            <p> Struck by the air of Importance which he as sumed, and alarmed at the angry tone of
               his voice, their merriment ceased, as instantaneously as if it had been directed by
               clock-work, and they stared foolishly, now at him, now at each other, without making
               any answer but a simple <q rend="inline"> " <hi> No thing, </hi> Sir!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "O <hi>pour le coup,</hi> " </q> cried Madame Duval, <q
                  rend="inline"> "this is too much! pray, Sir, what business have you to come here a
                  ordering people that comes to see me? I suppose, next, nobody must laugh but
                  yourself!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"With me, Madam,"</q> said Sir Clement, bowing, <q rend="inline"> "a
                     <hi>lady</hi> may do any thing, and, conse quently, there is no liberty in
                  which I shall not be happy to indulge <hi>you:</hi> —but it has never been my
                  custom to give the same licence to <hi>gentlemen.</hi> " </q>
            </p>
            <p> Then, advancing to me, who had sat very qui etly, on a window, during this scene, he
               said," <q rend="inline"> Miss Anville, I may at least acquaint our friends at Howard
                  Grove, that I had the honour of leav ing you in good health," </q> and then,
               lowering his voice, he added, <q rend="inline"> "For Heaven's sake, my <pb n="11"/>
                  dearest creature, who are these people? and how came you so strangely situated?"
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I beg my respects to all the family, Sir,"</q> answered I, aloud,
                  <q rend="inline">"and I hope you will find them well."</q>
            </p>
            <p> He looked at me reproachfully, but kissed my hand; and then, bowing to Madame Duval
               and Miss Branghton, passed hastily by the men, and made his exit. </p>
            <p> I fancy he will not be very eager to repeat his visits, for I should imagine he has
               rarely, if ever, been before in a situation so awkward and disa greeable. </p>
            <p> Madame Duval has been all spirits and exulta tion ever since he went, and only
               wishes Captain Mirvan would call, that she might <hi>do the same by him.</hi> Mr.
               Smith, upon hearing that he was a baronet, and seeing him drive off in a very beau
               tiful chariot, declared that he would not have laughed upon any account, had he known
               his rank, and regretted extremely having missed such an opportunity of making so
                  <hi>genteel</hi> an <hi> acquaint ance. </hi> Young Branghton vowed, that, if he

            <head type="sub">Evelina in continuation.</head>
            <p> THE last three evenings have passed tolerably quiet, for the Vauxhall adventures had
               given Madame Duval a surfeit of public places: home <pb n="12"/> however, soon
               growing tiresome, she determined to night, she said, to relieve her <hi>ennui,</hi>
               by some amusement; and it was therefore settled that we should call upon the
               Branghtons, at their house, and thence proceed to Marybone Gardens. </p>
            <p> But, before we reached Snow-Hill, we were caught in a shower of rain: we hurried
               into the shop, where the first object I saw was Mr. Ma cartney, with a book in his
               hand, seated in the same corner where I saw him last; but his looks were still more
               wretched than before, his face yet thinner, and his eyes sunk almost hollow into his
               head. He lifted them up as we entered, and I even thought that they emitted a gleam
               of joy: involuntarily, I made to him my first courtesy; he rose and bowed, with a
               precipitation that ma nifested surprize and confusion. </p>
            <p> In a few minutes, we were joined by all the family, except Mr. Smith, who,
               fortunately, was engaged. </p>
            <p> Had all the future prosperity of our lives de pended upon the good or bad weather of
               this evening, it could not have been treated as a sub ject of greater importance. <q
                  rend="inline">"Sure never any thing was so unlucky!—"</q>
               <q rend="inline"> "Lord, how provok ing!—" </q>
               <q rend="inline"> "It might rain for ever, if it would hold up now!—" </q> These, and
               such expressions, with many anxious observations upon the kennels, filled up all the
               conversation till the shower was over. </p>
            <p> And then a very warm debate arose, whether we should pursue our plan, or defer it to
               some finer evening; Miss Branghtons were for the for mer; their father was sure it
               would rain again; Madame Duval, though she detested returning home, yet dreaded the
               dampness of the gardens. </p>
            <p> M. Du Bois then proposed going to the top of <pb n="13"/> the house, to examine
               whether the clouds looked threatening or peaceable; Miss Branghton starting at this
               proposal, said they might go to Mr. Ma cartney's room, if they would, but not to
               her's. </p>
            <p> This was enough for the brother; who, with a loud laugh, declared he would have some
                  <hi>fun,</hi> and immediately led the way, calling to us all to follow. His
               sisters both ran after him, but no one else moved. </p>
            <p> In a few minutes, young Branghton, coming half way down stairs, called out, <q
                  rend="inline"> "Lord, why don't you all come? why here's Poll's things all about
                  the room! </q>
            </p>
            <p> Mr. Branghton then went, and Madame Du val, who cannot bear to be excluded from
               whate ver is going forward, was handed up stairs by M. Du Bois. </p>
            <p> I hesitated a few moments whether or not to join them; but, soon perceiving that Mr.
               Ma cartney had dropped his book, and that I en grossed his whole attention, I
               prepared, from mere embarrassment, to follow them. </p>
            <p> As I went, I heard him move from his chair, and walk slowly after me. Believing that
               he wished to speak to me, and earnestly desiring my self to know if, by your means, I
               could possibly be of any service to him, I first slackened my pace, and then turned
               back. But, though I thus met him half-way, he seemed to want courage or resolution to
               address me; for, when he saw me returning, with a look extremely disordered, he
               retreated hastily from me. </p>
            <p> Not knowing what I ought to do, I went to the street-door, where I stood some time,
               hoping he would be able to recover himself: but, on the con trary, his agitation
               encreased every moment; he walked up and down the room; in a quick, but <pb n="14"/>
               unsteady pace, seeming equally distressed and irresolute: and, at length, with a deep
               sigh, he flung himself into a chair. </p>
            <p> I was so much affected by the appearance of such extreme anguish, that I could
               remain no lon ger in the room; I therefore glided by him, and went up stairs; but,
               ere I had gone five steps, he precipitately followed me, and, in a broken voice,
               called out, <q rend="inline">"Madam!—for Heaven's sake—"</q>
            </p>
            <p> He stopped, but I instantly descended, restrain ing, as well as I was able, the
               fullness of my own concern. I waited some time in painful expectati on, for his
               speaking: all that I had heard of his poverty, occurring to me, I was upon the point
               of presenting him my purse, but the fear of mistak ing or offending him, deterred me.
               Finding, however, that he continued silent, I ventured to say, <q rend="inline">"Did
                  you—Sir, wish to speak to me?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I did!"</q> cried he, with quickness, <q rend="inline">"but now—I
                  cannot!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Perhaps, Sir, another time,—perhaps if you recollect yourself—"
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Another time!"</q> repeated he mournfully, <q rend="inline"> "alas!
                  I look not forward but to misery and de spair!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O Sir,"</q> cried I, extremely shocked, <q rend="inline"> "you must
                  not talk thus!—if you forsake <hi>yourself,</hi> how can you expect—" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I stopped. <q rend="inline">"Tell me, tell me,</q> "cried he, with eagerness, <q
                  rend="inline"> "who you are?—whence you come?—and by what strange means you seem
                  to be arbitress and ruler of the destiny of such a wretch as I am?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Would to Heaven,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline">"I could serve
                  you!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"You can!"</q>

            <p>
               <pb n="15"/>
               <q rend="inline">"And how? pray tell me how?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "To tell you—is death to me! yet I <hi>will</hi> tell you,—I have a
                     <hi>right</hi> to your assistance,—you have deprived me of the only resource to
                  which I could apply,—and therefore—" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Pray, pray, speak;"</q> cried I, putting my hand into my pocket, <q
                  rend="inline">"they will be down stairs in a moment!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "I will, Madam.—Can you—will you—I think you will!—may I then—"
               </q> he stopped and paused, <q rend="inline">"say, will you—"</q> then suddenly
               turning from me, <q rend="inline">"Great Heaven! I cannot speak!"</q> and he went
               back to the shop. </p>
            <p> I now put my purse in my hand, and following him, said, <q rend="inline"> "If
                  indeed, Sir, I can assist you, why should you deny me so great a satisfaction?
                  Will you permit me to—" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I dared not go on; but with a countenance ve ry much softened, he approached me, and
               said, <q rend="inline"> "Your voice, Madam, is the voice of Com passion!—such a voice
                  as these ears have long been strangers to!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> Just then, young Branghton called out vehe mently to me, to come up stairs; I seized
               the op portunity of hastening away: and therefore say ing, <q rend="inline">"Heaven,
                  Sir, protect and comfort you!—"</q> I let fall my purse upon the ground, not
               daring to present it to him, and ran up stairs with the utmost swiftness. </p>
            <p> Too well do I know you, my ever honoured Sir, to fear your displeasure for this
               action: I must, however, assure you I shall need no fresh supply during my stay in
               town, as I am at little expence, and hope soon to return to Howard Grove. </p>
            <p> Soon, did I say! when not a fortnight is yet <pb n="16"/> expired, of the long and
               tedious month I must linger out here! </p>
            <p> I had many witticisms to endure from the Branghtons, upon account of my staying so
               long with the <hi>Scotch mope,</hi> as they call him; but I at tend to them very
               little, for my whole heart was filled with pity and concern. I was very glad to find
               the Marybone scheme was deferred, another shower of rain having put a stop to the
               dissention upon this subject; the rest of the evening was employed in most violent
               quarrelling between Miss Polly and her brother, on account of the discovery made by
               the latter, of the state of her apartment. </p>
            <p> We came home early; and I have stolen from Madame Duval and M. Du Bois, who is here
               for ever, to write to my best friend. </p>
            <p> I am most sincerely rejoiced that this opportu nity has offered for my contributing
               what little re lief was in my power, to this unhappy man; and I hope it will be
               sufficient to enable him to pay his debts to this pitiless family. </p>

            <opener>
               <dateline>Berry Hill.</dateline>
            </opener>
            <p> DISPLEASURE? my Evelina!—you have but done your duty; you have but shewn that
               humanity without which I should blush to own my child. It is mine, however, to see
               that your generosity be not repressed by your suffering from indulging it; I remit to
               you, therefore, not merely a token of my approbation, but an ac knowledgment of my
               desire to participate in your charity. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17"/> O my child, were my fortune equal to my con fidence in thy benevolence,
               with what transport should I, through thy means, devote it to the re lief of indigent
               virtue! yet let us not repine at the limitation of our power, for, while our boun ty
               is proportioned to our ability, the difference of the greater or less donation, can
               weigh but little in the scale of Justice. </p>
            <p> In reading your account of the misguided man, whose misery has so largely excited
               your compas sion, I am led to apprehend, that his unhappy si tuation is less the
               effect of misfortune, than of misconduct. If he is reduced to that state of poverty
               represented by the Branghtons, he should endeavour by activity and industry to
               retrieve his affairs; and not pass his time in idle reading in the very shop of his
               creditor. </p>
            <p> The pistol scene made me shudder: the cou rage with which you pursued this desperate
               man, at once delighted and terrified me. Be ever thus, my dearest Evelina, dauntless
               in the cause of dis tress! let no weak fears, no timid doubts, deter you from the
               exertion of your duty, according to the fullest sense of it that Nature has implanted
               in your mind. Though gentleness and Modesty are the peculiar attributes of your sex,
               yet fortitude and firmness, when occasion demands them, are vir tues as noble and as
               becoming in women as in men: the right line of conduct is the same for both sex es,
               though the manner in which it is pursued, may somewhat vary, and be accommodated to
               the strength or weakness of the different travellers. </p>
            <p> There is, however, something so mysterious in all you have yet seen or heard of this
               wretched man, that I am unwilling to stamp a bad impres sion of his character, upon
               so slight and partial a knowledge of it. Where any thing is doubtful, the ties of
               society, and the laws of humanity, <pb n="18"/> claim a favourable interpretation;
               but remember, my dear child, that those of discretion have an equal claim to your
               regard. </p>
            <p> As to Sir Clement Willoughby, I know not how to express my indignation at his
               conduct. Insolence so unsufferable, and the implication of suspicions so shocking,
               irritate me to a degree of wrath, which I hardly thought my almost worn out passions
               were capable of again experiencing. You must converse with him no more; he ima gines,
               from the pliability of your temper, that he may offend you with impunity; but his
               beha viour justifies, nay, calls for, your avowed re sentment: do not, therefore,
               hesitate in forbid ding him your sight. </p>
            <p> The Branghtons, Mr. Smith, and young Brown, however ill-bred and disagreeable, are
               objects too contemptible for serious displeasure: yet I grieve much that my Evelina
               should be ex posed to their rudeness and impertinence. </p>
            <p> The very day that this tedious month expires, I shall send Mrs. Clinton to town, who
               will ac company you to Howard Grove. Your stay there will, I hope, be short, for I
               feel daily an encreasing impatience to fold my beloved child to my bosom! </p>

               <p> I HAVE just received, my dearest Sir, your kind present, and still kinder letter.
                  Surely never had orphan so little to regret as your grateful <pb n="19"/> Evelina!
                  though motherless, though worse than fatherless, bereft from infancy of the two
                  first and greatest blessings of life, never has she had cause to deplore their
                  loss; never has she felt the omis sion of a parent's tenderness, care, or
                  indulgence; never, but from sorrow for <hi>them,</hi> had reason to grieve at the
                  separation! Most thankfully do I receive the token of your approbation, and most
                  studiously will I endeavour so to dispose of it, as may merit your generous
                  confidence in my con duct. </p>
               <p> Your doubts concerning Mr. Macartney give me some uneasiness. Indeed, Sir, he has
                  not the appearance of a man whose sorrows are the effect of guilt. But I hope, ere
                  I leave town, to be better acquainted with his situation, and enabled with more
                  certainty of his worth, to recommend him to your favour. </p>
               <p> I am very willing to relinquish all acquaintance with Sir Clement Willoughby, as
                  far as it may de pend upon myself so to do; but indeed, I know not how I should be
                  able to absolutely <hi>forbid him my sight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p> Miss Mirvan, in her last letter, informs me that he is now at Howard Grove, where
                  he continues in high favour with the Captain, and is the life and spirit of the
                  house. My time, since I wrote last, has passed very quietly; Madame Duval having
                  been kept at home by a bad cold, and the Branghtons by bad weather. The young man,
                  indeed, has called two or three times, and his behaviour, though equally absurd,
                  is more unaccountable than ever: he speaks very little, takes hardly any notice of
                  Madame Duval, and never looks at me, without a broad grin. Some times he
                  approaches me, as if with intention to <pb n="20"/> communicate intelligence of
                  importance, and then, suddenly stopping short, laughs rudely in my face. </p>
               <p> O how happy shall I be, when the worthy Mrs. Clinton arrives! </p>

                  <q rend="inline">"If you were determined, Sir,"</q> said I, <q rend="inline"> "in
                     making me this offer, to allow me no choice of re fusal or acceptance, I must
                     think myself less oblig ed to your intention, than I was willing to do. </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Dear Ma'am,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "you're so smart,
                     there is no speaking to you;—indeed, you are monstrous smart, Ma'am! but come,
                     your Grandmama shall ask you, and then I know you'll not be so cruel." </q>
               </p>
               <p> Madame Duval was very ready to interfere; she desired me to make no further
                  opposition, said she should go herself, and insisted upon my accompanying her. It
                  was in vain that I remon strated; I only incurred her anger, and Mr. Smith, having
                  given both the tickets to Madame Duval, with an air of triumph, said he should
                  call early in the evening, and took leave. </p>
               <p> I was much chagrined at being thus compelled to owe even the shadow of an
                  obligation to so for ward <pb n="21"/> a young man; but I determined that nothing
                  should prevail upon me to dance with him, how ever my refusal might give offence. </p>
               <p> In the afternoon, when he returned, it was evident that he purposed to both charm
                  and asto nish me by his appearance; he was dressed in a very shewy manner, but
                  without any taste, and the inelegant smartness of his air and deport ment, his
                  visible struggle, against education, to put on the fine gentleman, added to his
                  frequent conscious glances at a dress to which he was but little accustomed, very
                  effectually destroyed his aim of <hi>figuring,</hi> and rendered all his efforts
                  use less. </p>
               <p> During tea, entered Miss Branghton and her brother. I was sorry to observe the
                  consternation of the former, when she perceived Mr. Smith. I had intended applying
                  to her for advice upon this occasion, but been always deterred by her disa
                  greeable abruptness. Having cast her eyes seve ral times from Mr. Smith to me,
                  with manifest displeasure, she seated herself sullenly in the win dow, scarce
                  answering Madame Duval's enqui ries, and, when I spoke to her, turning abso lutely
                  away from me. </p>
               <p> Mr. Smith, delighted at this mark of his im portance, sat indolently quiet on his
                  chair, endea vouring by his looks rather to display, than to conceal, his inward
                  satisfaction. </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Good gracious!"</q> cried young Branghton, <q rend="inline">
                     "why, you're all as fine as five-pence! Why, where are you going?" </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"To the Hampstead Ball,"</q> answered Mr. Smith. </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"To a ball!"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline">"Why, what, is Aunt
                     going to a ball? Ha, ha, ha!"</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22"/>
                  <q rend="inline">"Yes, to be sure,"</q> cried Madame Duval; <q rend="inline">"I
                     don't know nothing need hinder me."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"And pray, Aunt, will you dance too?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "Perhaps I may; but I suppose, Sir, that's none of your
                     business, whether I do or not." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "Lord! well, I should like to go! I should like to see Aunt
                     dance, of all things! But the joke is, I don't believe she'll get ever a
                     partner. </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"You're the most rudest boy ever I see,"</q> cried Madame Duval,
                  angrily: <q rend="inline"> "but, I promise you, I'll tell your father what you
                     say, for I've no notion of such rudeness." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "Why, Lord, Aunt, what are you so angry for? there's no speaking
                     a word, but you fly in to a passion: you're as bad as Biddy or Poll for that,
                     for you're always a scolding." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"I desire, Tom,"</q> cried Miss Branghton, <q rend="inline">
                     "you'd speak for yourself, and not make so free with my name." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "There, now, she's up! there's nothing but quarrelling with the
                     women: it's my belief they like it better than victuals and drink." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Fie, Tom,"</q> cried Mr. Smith, <q rend="inline"> "you ne ver
                     remember your manners before the ladies: I'm sure you never heard me speak so
                     rude to them." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "Why, Lord, <hi>you</hi> are a beau; but that's nothing to me.
                     So, if you've a mind, you may be so polite as to dance with Aunt yourself."
                  </q> Then with a loud laugh, he declared it would be <hi>good fun</hi> to see
                  them. </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Let it be never so good, or never so bad,"</q> cried Madame
                  Duval, <q rend="inline"> "you won't see nothing of it, I promise you; so pray
                     don't let me hear no more of such vulgar pieces of fun; for, I as sure you, I
                     don't like it. And as to my dancing <pb n="23"/> with Mr. Smith, you may see
                     wonderfuller things than that any day in the week." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Why, as to that, Ma'am,"</q> said Mr. Smith, looking much
                  surprised, <q rend="inline"> "I always thought you intended to play at cards, and
                     so I thought to dance with the young lady." </q>
               </p>
               <p> I gladly seized this opportunity to make my declaration, that I should not dance
                  at all. </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Not dance at all!"</q> repeated Miss Brangh ton; <q
                     rend="inline"> "yes, that's a likely matter truly, when peo ple go to balls."
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"I wish she mayn't,"</q> said the brother; <q rend="inline">
                     "cause then Mr. Smith will have nobody but Aunt for a partner. Lord, how mad
                     he'll be!" </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"O, as to that,"</q> said Mr. Smith, <q rend="inline"> "I do'nt
                     at all fear prevailing with the young lady, if once I get her to the room."
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Indeed, Sir,"</q> cried I, much offended by his conceit, <q
                     rend="inline"> "you are mistaken; and therefore I beg leave to undeceive you,
                     as you may be assur ed my resolution will not alter." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Then pray, Miss, if it is not impertinent,"</q> cried Miss
                  Branghton, sneeringly, <q rend="inline">"What do you go for?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Merely and solely,"</q> answered I, <q rend="inline"> "to com
                     ply with the request of Madame Duval." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Miss,</q> cried young Branghton, <q rend="inline"> "Bid only
                     wishes it was she, for she has cast a sheep's-eye at Mr. Smith this long
                     while." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Tom,"</q> cried the sister, rising, <q rend="inline"> "I've the
                     greatest mind in the world to box your ears! How dare you say such a thing of
                     me?" </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"No, hang it, Tom, no, that's wrong,"</q> said Mr. Smith,
                  simpering, <q rend="inline"> "it is indeed, to tell the lady's secrets.—But never
                     mind him, Miss Biddy, for I won't believe him." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "Why, I know Bid would give her ears to <pb n="24"/> go," </q>
                  returned the brother; <q rend="inline"> "but only Mr. Smith likes Miss best,—so
                     does every body else." </q>
               </p>
               <p> While the sister gave him a very angry answer, Mr. Smith said to me, in a low
                  voice, <q rend="inline"> "Why now, Ma'am, how can you be so cruel as to be so much
                     handsomer than your cousins? Nobody can look at them when you are by." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Miss,"</q> cried young Branghton, <q rend="inline"> "what ever
                     he says to you, don't mind him, for he means no good; I'll give you my word for
                     it, he'll never marry you, for he has told me again and again, he'll never
                     marry as long as he lives; besides, if he'd any mind to be married, there's Bid
                     would have had him long ago, and thanked him too." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "Come, come, Tom, don't tell secrets; you'll make the ladies
                     afraid of me: but I assure you," </q> lowering his voice, <q rend="inline"> "if
                     I <hi>did</hi> marry, it should be your cousin." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Should</hi> be!—did you ever, my dear Sir, hear such unauthorised freedom? I
                  looked at him with a contempt I did not wish to express, and walked to the other
                  end of the room. </p>
               <p> Very soon after, Mr. Smith sent for a hackney coach. When I would have taken
                  leave of Miss Branghton, she turned angrily from me, without making any answer.
                  She supposes, perhaps, that I have rather sought, than endeavoured to a void, the
                  notice and civilities of this conceited young man. </p>
               <p> The ball was at the <hi>long room</hi> at Hampstead. </p>
               <p> This room seems very well named, for I be lieve it would be difficult to find any
                  other epi thet which might, with propriety, distinguish it, as it is without
                  ornament, elegance, or any sort of singularity, and merely to be marked by its
                  length. </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25"/> I was saved from the importunities of Mr. Smith, the beginning of the
                  evening, by Madame Duval's declaring her intention to dance the two first dances
                  with him herself. Mr. Smith's chagrin was very evident, but as she paid no regard
                  to it, he was necessitated to lead her out. </p>
               <p> I was, however, by no means pleased, when she said she was determined to dance a
                  minuet. Indeed I was quite astonished, not having had the least idea she would
                  have consented to, much less proposed, such an exhibition of her person. </p>
               <p> She had some trouble to make her intentions known, as Mr. Smith was rather averse
                  to speak ing to the Master of the ceremonies. </p>
               <p> During this minuet, how much did I rejoice in being surrounded only with
                  strangers! She danced in a style so uncommon; her age, her showy dress, and an
                  unusual quantity of <hi>rouge,</hi> drew upon her the eyes, and, I fear, the
                  derision of the whole company. Who she danced with, I know not; but Smith was so
                  ill-bred as to laugh at her very openly, and to speak of her with as much ridi
                  cule as was in his power. But I would neither look at, nor listen to him; nor
                  would I suffer him to proceed with a speech which he began, expressive of his
                  vexation at being forced to dance with her. I told him, very gravely, that
                  complaints upon such a subject might, with less impropriety, be made to every
                  person in the room, than to me. </p>
               <p> When she returned to us, she distressed me ve ry much, by asking what I thought
                  of her minu et. I spoke as civilly as I could, but the coldness of my compliment
                  evidently disappointed reh. She then called upon Mr. Smith to secure a good <pb
                     n="26"/> place among the country-dancers; and away they went, though not before
                  he had taken the liberty to say to me in a low voice, <q rend="inline"> "I protest
                     to you, Ma'am, I shall be quite out of counte nance, if any of my acquaintance
                     should see me dancing with the old lady!" </q>
               </p>
               <p> For a few moments I very much rejoiced at be ing relieved from this troublesome
                  man; but scarce had I time to congratulate myself, ere I was accosted by another,
                  who <hi>begged the favour of hopping a dance</hi> with me. </p>
               <p> I told him that I should not dance at all; but he thought proper to importune me,
                  very freely, not to be so cruel; and I was obliged to assume no little haughtiness
                  ere I could satisfy him I was serious. </p>
               <p> After this, I was addressed, much in the same manner, by several other young men,
                  of whom the appearance and language were equally inele gant and low-bred: so that
                  I soon found my situ ation was both disagreeable and improper; since, as I was
                  quite alone, I fear I must seem rather to invite, than to forbid, the offers and
                  notice I re ceived. And yet, so great was my apprehension of this interpretation,
                  that I am sure, my dear Sir, you would have laughed had you seen how proud ly
                  grave I appeared. </p>
               <p> I knew not whether to be glad or sorry, when Madame Duval and Mr. Smith returned.
                  The latter instantly renewed his tiresome entreaties, and Madame Duval said she
                  would go to the card table: and, as soon as she was accommodated, she desired us
                  to join the dancers. </p>
               <p> I will not trouble you with the arguments that followed. Mr. Smith teazed me till
                  I was weary of resistance; and I should at last have been ob liged to submit, had
                  I not fortunately recollected <pb n="27"/> the affair of Mr. Lovel, and told my
                  persecutor, that it was impossible I should dance with him, even if I wished it,
                  as I had refused several persons in his absence. </p>
               <p> He was not contented with being extremely chagrined, but took the liberty, openly
                  and warm ly, to expostulate with me upon not having said I was engaged. </p>
               <p> The total disregard with which, involuntarily, I heard him, made him soon change
                  the subject. In truth, I had no power to attend to him, for all my thoughts were
                  occupied in re-tracing the trans actions of the two former balls at which I had
                  been present. The party—the conversation—the com pany—O how great the contrast! </p>
               <p> In a short time, however, he contrived to draw my attention to himself, by his
                  extreme imperti nence; for he chose to express what he called his
                     <hi>admiration</hi> of me, in terms so open and familiar, that he forced me to
                  express my displeasure with equal plainness. </p>
               <p> But how was I surprised, when I found he had the temerity—what else can I call
                  it?—to impute my resentment to doubts of his honour; for he said, <q rend="inline"
                     > "My dear Ma'am, you must be a little pa tient; I assure you I have no bad
                     designs, I have not, upon my word; but, really, there is no re solving upon
                     such a thing as matrimony all at once; what with the loss of one's liberty, and
                     what with the ridicule of all one's acquaintance,—I assure you, Ma'am, you are
                     the first lady who ever made me even demur upon this subject; for, after all,
                     my dear Ma'am, marriage is the devil!" </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Your opinion, Sir,"</q> answered I, <q rend="inline"> "of either
                     the married or the single life, can be of no man ner of consequence to me, and
                     therefore I would <pb n="28"/> by no means trouble you to discuss their
                     different merits." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "Why, really, Ma'am, as to your being a lit tle out of sorts, I
                     must own I can't wonder at it, for, to be sure, marriage is all in all with the
                     la dies; but with us gentlemen it's quite another thing! Now only put yourself
                     in my place,—sup pose you had such a large acquaintance of gentle men as I
                     have,—and that you had always been used to appear a little—a little smart among
                     them,—why now, how should you like to let yourself down all at once into a
                     married man?" </q>
               </p>
               <p> I could not tell what to answer; so much con ceit, and so much ignorance, both
                  astonished and silenced me. </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"I assure you, Ma'am,"</q> added he, <q rend="inline"> "there is
                     not only Miss Biddy,—though I should have scorned to mention her, if her
                     brother had not blab'd, for I'm quite particular in keeping ladies secrets,—but
                     there are a great many other ladies that have been proposed to me,—but I never
                     thought twice of any of them,—that is, not in a <hi>serious</hi> way,—so you
                     may very well be proud," </q> offering to take my hand, <q rend="inline"> "for
                     I assure you, there is nobody so likely to catch me at last as yourself." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Sir,"</q> cried I, drawing myself back as haugh tily as I could,
                     <q rend="inline"> "you are totally mistaken, if you imagine you have given me
                     any pride I felt not be fore, by this conversation; on the contrary, you must
                     allow me to tell you, I find it too humilia ting to bear with it any longer."
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p> I then placed myself behind the chair of Madame Duval; who, when she heard of the
                  partners I had refused, pitied my ignorance of the world, but no longer insisted
                  upon my dancing. </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29"/> Indeed, the extreme vanity of this man makes me exert a spirit which
                  I did not, till now know that I possessed: but I cannot endure that he should
                  think me at his disposal. </p>
               <p> The rest of the evening passed very quietly, as Mr. Smith did not attempt again
                  to speak to me; except, indeed, after we had left the room, and while Madame Duval
                  was seating herself in the coach, he said, in a voice of <hi>pique,</hi>
                  <q rend="inline"> "Next time I take the trouble to get any tickets for a young
                     lady, I'll make a bargain beforehand that she sha'n't turn me over to her
                     grandmother." </q>
               </p>
               <p> We came home very safe; and thus ended this so long projected, and most
                  disagreeable affair. </p>

            <p> I HAVE just received a most affecting letter from Mr. Macartney. I will inclose it,

                  <head>Mr. Macartney to Miss Anville.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>Madam,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p> IMPRESSED with the deepest, the most heart-felt sense of the exalted humanity
                     with which you have rescued from destruction an un happy stranger, allow me,
                     with the humblest gra titude, to offer you my fervent acknowledgments, and to
                     implore your pardon for the terror I have caused you. </p>
                  <p> You bid me, Madam, live: I have now, in deed, a motive for life, since I
                     should not willing ly <pb n="30"/> quit the world, while I withhold from the
                     needy and distressed any share of that charity which a disposition so noble
                     would, otherwise, bestow up on them. </p>
                  <p> The benevolence with which you have interest ed yourself in my concerns,
                     induces me to suppose you would wish to be acquainted with the cause of that
                     desperation from which you snatched me, and the particulars of that misery of
                     which you have, so wonderfully, been a witness. Yet, as this ex planation will
                     require that I should divulge secrets of a nature the most delicate, I must
                     entreat you to regard them as sacred, even though I forbear to mention the
                     names of the parties concerned. </p>
                  <p> I was brought up in Scotland, though my mo ther, who had the sole care of me,
                     was an Eng lishman, and had not one relation in that country. She devoted to me
                     her whole time. The retirement in which we lived, and the dis tance from our
                     natural friends, she often told me were the effect of an unconquerable
                     melancholy with which she was seized, upon the sudden loss of my father, some
                     time before I was born. </p>
                  <p> At Aberdeen, where I finished my education, I formed a friendship with a young
                     man of fortune, which I considered as the chief happiness of my life;—but, when
                     he quitted his studies, I consider ed it as my chief misfortune, for he
                     immediately prepared, by direction of his friends, to make the tour of Europe.
                     For my part, designed for the church, and with no prospect even of maintenance
                     but from my own industry, I scarce dared permit even a wish of accompanying
                     him. It is true, he would joyfully have borne my expences; but my affection was
                     as free from meanness as his own, and I made a determination the most solemn
                     never <pb n="31"/> to lessen its dignity, by submitting to pecuniary
                     obligations. </p>
                  <p> We corresponded with great regularity, and the most unbounded confidence, for
                     the space of two years, when he arrived at Lyons in his way home. He wrote me,
                     thence, the most pressing invitation to meet him at Paris, where he intended to
                     remain for some time. My desire to comply with his re quest, and shorten our
                     absence, was so earnest, that my mother, too indulgent to controul me, lent me
                     what assistance was in her power, and, in an ill-fated moment I set out for
                     that capital. </p>
                  <p> My meeting with this dear friend was the hap piest event of my life: he
                     introduced me to all his acquaintance; and so quickly did time seem to pass at
                     that delightful period, that the six weeks I had allotted for my stay were
                     gone, ere I was sen sible I had missed so many days. But I must now own, that
                     the company of my friend was not the sole subject of my felicity: I became
                     acquainted with a young lady, daughter of an Englishman of distinction, with
                     whom I formed an attachment which I have a thousand times vowed, a thousand
                     times sincerely thought would be lasting as my life. She had but just quitted a
                     convent, in which she had been placed when a child, and though English by
                     birth, she could scarcely speak her na tive language. Her person and
                     disposition were equally engaging; but chiefly I adored her for the greatness
                     of the expectations which, for my sake, she was willing to resign. </p>
                  <p> When the time for my residence in Paris expir ed, I was almost distracted at
                     the idea of quitting it; yet I had not the courage to make our attach ment
                     known to her father, who might reasonably form for her such views as would make
                     him re ject, with a contempt which I could not bear to <pb n="32"/> think of,
                     such an offer as mine. Yet I had free access to the house, where she seemed to
                     be left almost wholly to the guidance of an old servant, who was my fast
                     friend. </p>
                  <p> But, to be brief, the sudden and unexpected re turn of her father, one fatal
                     afternoon, proved the beginning of the misery which has ever since de voured
                     me. I doubt not but he had listened to our conversation, for he darted into the
                     room with the rage of a madman. Heavens! what a scene followed!—what abusive
                     language did the shame of a clandestine affair, and the consciousness of acting
                     ill, induce me to brook! At length, how ever, his fury exceeded my patience,—he
                     called me a beggarly, cowardly Scotchman. Fired at the words, I drew my sword;
                     he, with equal alertness, drew his; for he was not an old man, but, on the
                     contrary, strong and able as myself. In vain his daughter pleaded;—in vain did
                     I, re pentant of my anger, retreat;—his reproaches continued; myself, my
                     country, were loaded with infamy,—till, no longer constraining my rage,—we
                     fought,—and he fell! </p>
                  <p> At that moment I could almost have destroyed myself! The young lady fainted
                     with terror; the old servant, drawn to us by the noise of the scuf fle,
                     entreated me to escape, and promised to bring intelligence of what should pass
                     to my apartment. The disturbance which I heard raised in the house obliged me
                     to comply, and, in a state of mind in conceivably wretched, I tore myself away. </p>
                  <p> My friend, who I found at home, soon discover ed the whole affair. It was near
                     midnight ere the woman came. She told me that her master was living, and her
                     young mistress restored to her sen ses. The absolute necessity for my leaving
                     Paris, while any danger remained, was forcibly urged by <pb n="33"/> my friend:
                     the servant promised to acquaint him of whatever passed, and he, to transmit to
                     me her information. Thus circumstanced, with the as sistance of this dear
                     friend, I effected my depar ture from Paris, and, not long after, I returned to
                     Scotland. I would fain have stopped by the way, that I might have been nearer
                     the scene of all my concerns, but the low state of my finances denied me that
                     satisfaction. </p>
                  <p> The miserable situation of my mind was soon discovered by my mother; nor would
                     she rest till I communicated the cause. She heard my whole story with an
                     agitation which astonished me;—the <hi>name</hi> of the parties concerned,
                     seemed to strike her with horror;—but when I said, <hi>We fought, and he
                        fell;</hi> — <q rend="inline">"My son,"</q> cried she, <q rend="inline">"you
                        have then murdered your father!"</q> and she sunk breathless at my feet.
                     Comments, Madam, upon such a scene as this, would to you be super fluous, and
                     to me agonizing: I cannot, for both our sakes, be too concise. When she
                     recovered, she confessed all the particulars of a tale which she had hoped
                     never to have revealed.—Alas! the loss she had sustained of my father was not
                     by death!—bound to her by no ties but those of ho nour, he had voluntarily
                     deserted her!—Her set tling in Scotland was not the effect of choice,—she was
                     banished thither by a family but too justly in censed;—pardon, Madam, that I
                     cannot be more explicit! </p>
                  <p> My senses, in the greatness of my misery, actu ally forsook me, and for more
                     than a week I was wholly delirious. My unfortunate mother was yet more to be
                     pitied, for she pined with unmitigated sorrow, eternally reproaching herself
                     for the dan ger to which her too strict silence had exposed me. When I
                     recovered my reason, my impatience to <pb n="34"/> hear from Paris almost
                     deprived me of it again; and though the length of time I waited for letters
                     might justly be attributed to contrary winds, I could not bear the delay, and
                     was twenty times upon the point of returning thither at all hazards. At length,
                     however, several letters arrived at once, and from the most insupportable of my
                     af flictions I was then relieved, for they acquainted me that the horrors of
                     parricide were not in reserve for me. They informed me also, that as soon as
                     the wound was healed, a journey would be made to England, where my unhappy
                        <hi>sister</hi> was to be received by an aunt with whom she was to live. </p>
                  <p> This intelligence somewhat quieted the violence of my sorrows. I instantly
                     formed a plan of meet ing them in London, and, by revealing the whole dreadful
                     story, convincing this irritated parent that he had nothing more to apprehend
                     from his daugh ter's unfortunate choice. My mother consented, and gave me a
                     letter to prove the truth of my as sertions. As I could but ill afford to make
                     this journey, I travelled in the cheapest way that was possible. I took an
                     obscure lodging, I need not, Madam, tell you where,—and boarded with the people
                     of the house. </p>
                  <p> Here I languished, week after week, vainly hoping for the arrival of my
                        <hi>family;</hi> but my im petuosity had blinded me to the imprudence of
                     which I was guilty in quitting Scotland so hastily. My wounded father, after
                     his recovery, relapsed; and when I had waited in the most comfortless si
                     tuation for six weeks, my friend wrote me word, that the journey was yet
                     deferred for some time longer. </p>
                  <p> My finances were then nearly exhausted, and I was obliged, though most
                     unwillingly, to beg fur ther assistance from my mother, that I might re turn
                        <pb n="35"/> to Scotland. Oh! Madam!—my answer was not from herself,—it was
                     written by a lady who had long been her companion, and acquainted me that she
                     had been taken suddenly ill of a fever,—and was no more! </p>
                  <p> The compassionate nature of which you have given such noble proofs, assures me
                     I need not, if I could, paint to you the anguish of a mind over whelmed with
                     such accumulated sorrows. </p>
                  <p> Inclosed was a letter to a near relation which she had, during her illness,
                     with much difficulty, written, and in which, with the strongest mater nal
                     tenderness, she described my deplorable situati on, and entreated his interest
                     to procure me some preferment. Yet so sunk was I by misfortune, that a
                     fortnight elapsed ere I had the courage or spirit to attempt delivering this
                     letter. I was then compelled to it by want. To make my appear ance with some
                     decency, I was necessitated, my self, to the melancholy task of changing my co
                     loured cloaths for a suit of mourning;—and then I proceeded to seek my
                     relation. </p>
                  <p>I was informed that he was not in town.</p>
                  <p> In this desperate situation, the pride of my heart, which hitherto had not
                     bowed to adversity, gave way, and I determined to entreat the assis tance of my
                     friend, whose offered services I had a thousand times rejected. Yet, Madam, so
                     hard is it to root from the mind its favourite princi ples, or prejudices, call
                     them which you please, that I lingered another week ere I had the resolu tion
                     to send away a letter which I regarded as the death of my independence. </p>
                  <p> At length, reduced to my last shilling, dunned insolently by the people of the
                     house, and almost famished, I sealed this fatal letter, and, with a heavy
                     heart, determined to take it to the post-office. <pb n="36"/> But Mr. Branghton
                     and his son suffered me not to pass through their shop with impunity; they
                     insulted me grossly, and threatened me with im prisonment, if I did not
                     immediately satisfy their demands. Stung to the soul, I bid them have but a
                     day's patience, and flung from them, in a state of mind too terrible for
                     description. </p>
                  <p> My letter, which I now found would be receiv ed too late to save me from
                     disgrace, I tore into a thousand pieces, and scarce could I refrain from put
                     ting an instantaneous, an unlicensed period to my existence. </p>
                  <p> In this disorder of my senses, I formed the hor rible plan of turning
                     foot-pad; for which purpose I returned to my lodging, and collected whatever of
                     my apparel I could part with, which I immediately sold, and with the profits
                     purchased a brace of pis tols, powder and shot. I hope, however, you will
                     believe me, when I most solemnly assure you, my sole intention was to
                        <hi>frighten</hi> the passengers I should assault, with these dangerous
                     weapons, which I had not loaded, but from a resolution,—a dreadful one, I
                     own,—to save <hi>myself</hi> from an ig nominious death if seized. And, indeed,
                     I thought if I could but procure money sufficient to pay Mr. Branghton, and
                     make a journey to Scotland, I should soon be able, by the public papers, to dis
                     cover whom I had injured, and to make private retribution. </p>
                  <p> But, Madam, new to every species of villany, my perturbation was so great that
                     I could with dif ficulty support myself: yet the Branghtons observ ed it not as
                     I passed through the shop. </p>
                  <p> Here I stop: what followed is better known to yourself. But no time can ever
                     efface from my memory that moment, when in the very action of preparing for my
                     own destruction, or the lawless <pb n="37"/> seizure of the property of others,
                     you rushed in to the room, and arrested my arm!—It was, in deed, an awful
                     moment!—the hand of Providence seemed to intervene between me and eternity; I
                     beheld you as an angel!—I thought you dropt from the clouds;—the earth, indeed,
                     had never before presented to my view a form so celestial!—What wonder, then,
                     that a spectacle so astonish ing should, to a man disordered as I was, appear
                     too beautiful to be human? </p>
                  <p> And now, Madam, that I have performed this painful task, the more grateful one
                     remains of re warding, as far as is in my power, your generous goodness, by
                     assuring you it shall not be thrown away. You have awakened me to a sense of
                     the false pride by which I have been actuated,—a pride which, while it scorned
                     assistance from a friend, scrupled not to compel it from a stranger, though at
                     the hazard of reducing that stranger to a situation as destitute as my own.
                     Yet, Oh! how violent was the struggle which tore my con flicting soul, ere I
                     could persuade myself to profit by the benevolence which you were so evidently
                     disposed to exert in my favour! </p>
                  <p> By means of a ring, the gift of my much-re gretted mother, I have for the
                     present satisfied Mr. Branghton; and by means of your compassion, I hope to
                     support myself, either till I hear from my friend, to whom, at length, I have
                     written, or till the relation of my mother returns to town. </p>
                  <p> To talk to you, Madam, of paying my debt, would be vain; I never can! the
                     service you have done me exceeds all power of return; you have restored me to
                     my senses, you have taught me to curb those passions which bereft me of them,
                     and, since I cannot avoid calamity, to bear it as a man! An interposition so
                     wonderfully circumstanced can <pb n="38"/> never be recollected without
                     benefit. Yet allow me to say, the pecuniary part of my obligation must be
                     settled by my first ability. </p>
                  <p> I am, Madam, with the most profound respect, and heart-felt gratitude, </p>
                  <closer>
                     <signed> Your obedient, and devoted humble servant, J. MACARTNEY. </signed>

               </dateline>
            </opener>
            <p> O SIR, what an adventure have I to write!—all night it has occupied my thoughts, and
               I am now risen thus early, to write it to you. </p>
            <p> Yesterday it was settled that we should spend the evening in Marybone-gardens, where
               M. Torre, a celebrated foreigner, was to exhibit some fireworks. The party consisted
               of Madame Du val, all the Branghtons, M. Du Bois, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Brown. </p>
            <p> We were almost the first persons who entered the Gardens, Mr. Branghton having
               declared he would have <hi>all he could get for his money,</hi> which, at best, was
               only fooled away, at such silly and idle places. </p>
            <p> We walked in parties, and very much detached from one another; Mr. Brown and Miss
               Polly led the way by themselves; Miss Branghton and Mr. Smith followed, and the
               latter seemed determined to be revenged for my behaviour at the ball, by transferring
               all his former attention for me, to Miss Branghton, who received it with an air of
               exulta tion: <pb n="39"/> and very frequently they each of them, though from
               different motives, looked back, to discover whether I observed their good
               intelligence. Madame Duval walked with M. Du Bois; and Mr. Branghton by himself; but
               his son would wil lingly have attached himself wholly to me, saying frequently, <q
                  rend="inline"> "Come, Miss, let's you and I have a little fun together; you see
                  they have all left us, so now let us leave them." </q> But I begged to be excused,
               and went to the other side of Madame Duval. </p>
            <p> This Garden, as it is called, is neither striking for magnificence nor for beauty;
               and we were all so dull and languid, that I was extremely glad when we were summoned
               to the orchestra, upon the opening of a concert; in the course of which, I had the
               pleasure of hearing a concerto on the violin by Mr. Barthelemon, who, to me, seems a
               player of exquisite fancy, feeling, and variety. </p>
            <p> When notice was given us, that the fire-works were preparing, we hurried along to
               secure good places for the sight: but, very soon, we were so encircled and incommoded
               by the crowd, that Mr. Smith proposed the <hi>ladies</hi> should make interest for a
               form to stand upon; this was soon effected, and the men then left us, to accommodate
               themselves better, saying they would return the moment the exhibition was over. </p>
            <p> The firework was really beautiful, and told, with wonderful ingenuity, the story of
               Orpheus and Eurydice: but, at the moment of the fatal look, which separated them for
               ever, there was such an explosion of fire, and so horrible a noise, that we all, as
               of one accord, jumpt hastily from the form, and ran away some paces, fearing that we
               were in danger of mischief, from the innume rable sparks of fire which glittered in
               the air. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40"/> For a moment or two, I neither knew nor con sidered whither I had run;
               but my recollection was soon awakened by a stranger's addressing me with, <q
                  rend="inline"> "Come along with me, my dear, and I'll take care of you." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I started, and then, to my great terror, per ceived that I had out-run all my
               companions, and saw not one human being I knew! with all the speed in my power, and
               forgetful of my first fright, I hastened back to the place I had left;—but found the
               form occupied by a new set of people. </p>
            <p> In vain, from side to side, I looked for some face I knew; I found myself in the
               midst of a crowd, yet without party, friend, or acquain tance. I walked, in
               disordered haste, from place to place, without knowing which way to turn, or whither
               I went. Every other moment, I was spoken to, by some bold and unfeeling man, to whom
               my distress, which, I think, must be very apparent, only furnished a pretence for
               impertinent witticisms, or free gallantry. </p>
            <p> At last, a young officer, marching fiercely up to me, said, <q rend="inline"> "You
                  are a sweet pretty creature, and I enlist you in my service;" </q> and then, with
               great violence, he seized my hand. I screamed aloud with fear, and, forcibly
               snatching it away, I ran hastily up to two ladies, and cried, <q rend="inline"> "For
                  Heaven's sake, dear ladies, afford me some pro tection!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> They heard me with a loud laugh, but very readily said, <q rend="inline">"Ay, let
                  her walk between us;"</q> and each of them took hold of an arm. </p>
            <p> Then, in a drawling, ironical tone of voice, they asked <hi>what had frightened my
                  little Ladyship?</hi> I told them my adventure very simply, and en treated <pb
                  n="41"/> they would have the goodness to assist me in finding my friends. </p>
            <p> O yes, to be sure, they said, I should not want for friends, whilst I was with them.
               Mine, I said, would be very grateful for any civilities with which they might favour
               me. But imagine, my dear Sir, how I must be confounded, when I observed, that every
               other word I spoke produced a loud laugh! However, I will not dwell upon a
               conversation, which soon, to my inexpressible horror, convinced me I had sought
               protection from insult, of those who were themselves most likely to offer it! You, my
               dearest Sir, I well know, will both feel for, and pity my terror, which I have no
               words to describe. </p>
            <p> Had I been at liberty, I should have instantly run away from them, when I made the
               shocking discovery; but, as they held me fast, that was utterly impossible: and such
               was my dread of their resentment or abuse, that I did not dare to make any open
               attempt to escape. </p>
            <p> They asked me a thousand questions, accom panied by as many hallows, of who I was,
               what I was, and whence I came. My answers were very incoherent,—but what, good
               Heaven! were my emotions, when a few moments afterwards, I perceived advancing our
               way, Lord Orville! </p>
            <p> Never shall I forget what I felt at that instant: had I, indeed, been sunk to the
               guilty state, which such companions might lead him to suspect, I could scarce have
               had feelings more cruelly de pressing. </p>
            <p> However, to my infinite joy, he passed us without distinguishing me; though I saw
               that, in a careless manner, his eyes surveyed the party, </p>
            <p> As soon as he was gone, one of these unhappy women said, <q rend="inline">"Do you
                  know that young fellow?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42"/> Not thinking it possible she should mean Lord Orville by such a term, I
               readily answered, <q rend="inline">""No, Madam."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why then,"</q> answered she, <q rend="inline"> "you have a
                  monstrous good stare, for a little country Miss." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I now found I had mistaken her, but was glad to avoid an explanation. </p>
            <p> A few minutes after, what was my delight, to hear the voice of Mr. Brown, who called
               out, <q rend="inline">"Lord, i'n't that Miss what's her name?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Thank God,"</q> cried I, suddenly springing from them both, <q
                  rend="inline">"thank God, I have found my party!</q>
            </p>
            <p> Mr. Brown, was, however, alone, and, with out knowing what I did, I took hold of his
               arm. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Lord, Miss, cried he, we've had such a hunt you can't think! some
                  of them thought you was gone home; but I says, says I, I don't think says I, that
                  she'll like to go home all alone, says I." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"So that gentleman belongs to you, Miss, does he?"</q> said one of
               the women. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">Yes, Madam,"</q> answered I, <q rend="inline"> "and I now thank you
                  for your civility; but as I am safe, will not give you any further trouble." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I courtsied slightly, and would have walked away; but, most unfortunately, Madame Du
               val and the two Miss Branghtons just then joined us. </p>
            <p> They all began to make a thousand enquiries, to which I briefly answered, that I had
               been obliged to these two ladies for walking with me, and would tell them more
               another time: for, though I felt great <hi>comparative</hi> courage, I was yet too
               much intimidated by their presence, to dare be explicit. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43"/> Nevertheless, I ventured, once more, to wish them good night, and
               proposed seeking Mr. Branghton. These unhappy women listened to all that was said
               with a kind of callous curiosity, and seemed determined not to take any hint. But my
               vexation was terribly augmented, when, after having whispered something to each
               other, they very cavalierly declared, that they intended join ing our party! and
               then, one of them, very bold ly took hold of my arm, while the other, going round,
               seized that of Mr. Brown; and thus, al most forcibly, we were moved on between them,
               and followed by Madame Duval and the Miss Branghtons. </p>
            <p> It would be very difficult to say which was greatest, my fright, or Mr. Brown's
               consternati on; who ventured not to make the least resist ance, though his uneasiness
               made him tremble al most as much as myself. I would instantly have withdrawn my arm;
               but it was held so tight, I could not move it; and poor Mr. Brown was cir cumstanced
               in the same manner on the other side; for I heard him say, <q rend="inline"> "Lord,
                  Ma'am, there's no need to squeeze one's arm so!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> And this was our situation,—for we had not taken three steps, when,—O Sir,—we again
               met Lord Orville!—but not again did he pass quietly by us,—unhappily I caught his
               eye;—both mine, immediately, were bent to the ground; but he approached me, and we
               all stopped. </p>
            <p> I then looked up. He bowed. Good God, with what expressive eyes did he regard me! Ne
               ver were surprise and concern so strongly marked,—yes, my dear Sir, he looked
                  <hi>greatly</hi> concerned; and that, the remembrance of that, is the only
               consolation I feel, for an evening the most pain ful of my life. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44"/> What he first said, I know not; for, indeed, I seemed to have neither
               ears nor understanding; but I recollect that I only courtsied in silence. He paused
               for an instant, as if—I believe so,—as if unwilling to pass on; but then, finding the
               whole party detained, he again bowed, and took leave. </p>
            <p> Indeed, my dear Sir, I thought I should have fainted, so great was my emotion from
               shame, vexation, and a thousand other feelings, for which I have no expressions. I
               absolutely tore myself from the woman's arm, and then, disengaging myself from that
               of Mr. Brown, I went to Ma dame Duval, and besought that she would not suf fer me to
               be again parted from her. </p>
            <p> I fancy—that Lord Orville saw what passed; for scarcely was I at liberty, ere he
               returned. Methought, my dear Sir, the pleasure, the sur prise of that moment,
               recompensed me for all the chagrin I had before felt: for do you not think, that this
               return, manifests, from a character so quiet, so reserved as Lord Orville's,
               something like solicitude in my concerns?—such at least, was the interpretation I
               involuntarily made upon again seeing him. </p>
            <p> With a politeness to which I have been some time very little used, he apologised for
               returning, and then enquired after the health of Mrs. Mirvan, and the rest of the
               Howard Grove family. The flattering conjecture which I have just acknow ledged, had
               so wonderfully restored my spirits, that I believe I never answered him so readily,
               and with so little constraint. Very short, however, was the duration of this
               conversation: for we were soon most disagreeably interrupted. </p>
            <p> The Miss Branghtons, though they saw almost immediately the characters of the women
               to whom I had so unfortunately applied, were, never theless, <pb n="45"/> so weak and
               foolish, as merely to <hi>titter</hi> at their behaviour. As to Madame Duval, she was
               really for some time so strangely imposed upon, that she thought they were two real
               fine ladies. Indeed it is wonderful to see how easily and how frequently she is
               deceived: our disturb ance, however, arose from young Brown, who was now between the
               two women, by whom his arms were absolutely pinioned to his sides: for a few minutes,
               his complaints had been only mur mured; but he now called out aloud, <q rend="inline"
                  > "Good ness, Ladies, you hurt me like any thing! why I can't walk at all, if you
                  keep pinching my arms so!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> This speech raised a loud laugh in the women, and redoubled the tittering of the
               Miss Brangh ton's. For my own part, I was most cruelly con fused; while the
               countenance of Lord Orville manifested a sort of indignant astonishment; and, from
               that moment, he spoke to me no more, till he took leave. </p>
            <p> Madame Duval who now began to suspect her company, proposed our taking the first box
               we saw empty, bespeaking a supper, and waiting till Mr. Branghton should find us. </p>
            <p> Miss Polly mentioned one she had remarked, to which we all turned; Madame Duval
               instantly seated herself; and the two bold women, forcing the frightened Mr. Brown to
               go between them, fol lowed her example. </p>
            <p> Lord Orville, with an air of gravity that wound ed my very soul, then wished me good
               night. I said not a word; but my face, if it had any con nection with my heart, must
               have looked melan choly indeed: and so, I have some reason to be lieve, it did; for
               he added, with much more soft ness, though not less dignity, <q rend="inline"> "Will
                  Miss Anville <pb n="46"/> allow me to ask her address, and to pay my re spects to
                  her before I leave town?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> O how I changed colour at this unexpected re quest!—yet what was the mortification I
               suffered, in answering, <q rend="inline">"My Lord, I am—in Holborn!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>He then bowed and left us.</p>
            <p> What, what can he think of this adventure! how strangely, how cruelly have all
               appearances turned against me! Had I been blessed with any presence of mind, I should
               instantly have explain ed to him the accident which occasioned my being in such
               terrible company;—but I have none! </p>
            <p> As to the rest of the evening, I cannot relate the particulars of what passed; for,
               to you, I only write of what I think, and I can think of nothing but this
               unfortunate, this disgraceful meeting. These two poor women continued to torment us
               all, but especially poor Mr. Brown, who seemed to afford them uncommon diversion,
               till we were discovered by Mr. Branghton, who very soon found means to release us
               from their persecutions, by frightening them away. We stayed but a short time after
               they left us, which was all employed in explanations. </p>
            <p> Whatever may be the construction which Lord Orville may put upon this affair, to me
               it cannot fail of being unfavourable; to be seen—gracious Heaven!—to be seen in
               company with two women of such character!—How vainly, how proudly have I wished to
               avoid meeting him when only with the Branghtons and Madame Duval,—but now, how joyful
               should I be had he seen me to no greater disadvantage!—Holborn, too! what a di
               rection!—he who had always—but I will not tor ment you, my dearest Sir, with any more
               of my mortifying conjectures and apprehensions: perhaps he may call,—and then I shall
               have an opportunity <pb n="47"/> of explaining to him all the most shocking part of
               the adventure. And yet, as I did not tell him at whose house I lived, he may not be
               able to disco ver me; I merely said <hi>in Holborn,</hi> and he, who I suppose saw my
               embarrassment, forbore to ask any other direction. </p>
            <p>Well, I must take my chance!</p>
            <p> Yet let me, in justice to Lord Orville, and in justice to the high opinion I have
               always enter tained of his honour and delicacy,—let me observe the difference of his
               behaviour, when nearly in the same situation to that of Sir Clement Wil loughby. He
               had at least equal cause to depreci ate me in his opinion, and to mortify and sink me
               in my own: but far different was his conduct;—perplexed, indeed, he looked, and much
               surpris ed,—but it was benevolently, not with insolence. I am even inclined to think,
               that he could not see a young creature whom he had so lately known in a higher
               sphere, appear so suddenly, so strangely, so disgracefully altered in her situation,
               without some pity and concern. But, whatever might be his doubts and suspicions, far
               from suffering them to influence his behaviour, he spoke, he looked, with the same
               politeness and attention with which he had always honoured me when countenanced by
               Mrs. Mirvan. </p>
            <p>Once again, let me drop this subject.</p>
            <p> In every mortification, every disturbance, how grateful to my heart, how sweet to my
               recollecti on, in the certainty of your never-failing tender ness, sympathy, and
               protection! Oh Sir, could I, upon this subject, could I write as I feel,—how animated
               would be the language of </p>

            <head type="sub">Evelina to the Rev. Mr. Villars.</head>
            <opener>
               <dateline> Holborn, <date>July 1.</date>
               </dateline>
            </opener>
            <p> LISTLESS, uneasy, and without either spirit or courage to employ myself, from the
               time I had finished my last letter, I indolently seated myself at the window, where,
               while I waited Madame Duval's summons to breakfast, I perceived, among the carriages
               which passed by, a coronet coach, and, in a few minutes, from the window of it, Lord
               Orville! I instantly retreated, but not, I believe, unseen; for the coach immediately
               drove up to our door. </p>
            <p> Indeed, my dear Sir, I must own I was greatly agitated; the idea of receiving Lord
               Orville by myself,—the knowledge that his visit was entirely to <hi>me,</hi> —the
               wish of explaining the unfortunate adventure of yesterday,—and the mortification of
               my present circumstances,—all these thoughts, oc curring to me nearly at the same
               time, occasioned me more anxiety, confusion, and perplexity, than I can possibly
               express. </p>
            <p> I believe he meant to send up his name; but the maid, unused to such a ceremony,
               forgot it by the way, and only told me, that a great Lord was below, and desired to
               see me: and, the next moment he appeared himself. </p>
            <p> If formerly when in the circle of high life, and accustomed to its manners, I so
               much admired and distinguished the grace, the elegance of Lord Orville, think, Sir,
               how they must strike me now,—now, when, far removed from that splendid circle, I live
               with those to whom even civility is unknown, and decorum a stranger! </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49"/> I am sure I received him very awkwardly; de pressed by a situation so
               disagreeable, could I do otherwise? When his first enquiries were made, <q
                  rend="inline">"I think myself very fortunate,"</q> he said, <q rend="inline"> "in
                  meeting with Miss Anville at home, and still more so, in finding her disengaged."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p> I only courtsied. He then talked of Mrs. Mir van; asked how long I had been in town,
               and other such general questions, which, happily, gave me time to recover from my
               embarrassment. After which, he said, <q rend="inline"> "If Miss Anville will al low
                  me the honour of sitting by her a few minutes "(for we were both standing)" I will
                  venture to tell her the motive which, next to enquiring after her health, has
                  prompted me to wait on her thus early." </q>
            </p>
            <p> We were then both seated, and, after a short pause, he said, <q rend="inline"> "How
                  to apologize for so great a liberty as I am upon the point of taking, I know not;
                  shall I, therefore, rely wholly upon your goodness, and not apologize at all?"
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I only bowed.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "I should be extremely sorry to appear imper tinent,—yet hardly
                  know how to avoid it. </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Impertinent! O my Lord,"</q> cried I, eagerly, <q rend="inline"
                  >"that, I am sure, is impossible!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"You are very good,"</q> answered he, <q rend="inline">"and
                  encourage me to be ingenuous—"</q>
            </p>
            <p> Again he stopped; but my expectation was too great for speech: at last, without
               looking at me, in a low voice and hesitating manner, he said, <q rend="inline"> "Were
                  those Ladies with whom I saw you last night, ever in your company before?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No, my Lord,"</q> cried I, rising, and colour ing violently, <q
                  rend="inline">"nor will they ever be again."</q>
            </p>
            <p> He rose too, and, with an air of the most con descending concern, said, <q
                  rend="inline"> "Pardon, Madam, the <pb n="50"/> abruptness of a question which I
                  knew not how to introduce as I ought, and for which I have no excuse to offer, but
                  my respect for Mrs. Mirvan, joined to the sincerest wishes for your happiness: yet
                  I fear I have gone too far!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "I am very sensible of the honour of your Lordship's attention,"
               </q> said I, <q rend="inline">"but—"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Permit me to assure you,"</q> cried he, finding I hesitated, <q
                  rend="inline"> "that officiousness is not my charac teristic, and that I would by
                  no means have risked your displeasure, had I not been fully satisfied you were too
                  generous to be offended, without a real cause of offence." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Offended!"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline"> no, my Lord, I am on ly
                  grieved,—grieved, indeed! to find myself in a situation so unfortunate, as to be
                  obliged to make explanations which cannot but mortify and shock me." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"It is I alone,"</q> cried he, with some eagerness, <q rend="inline"
                  > "who am shocked, as it is I who deserve to be mortified; I seek no explanation,
                  for I have no doubt; but, in mistaking me, Miss Anville in jures herself: allow
                  me, therefore, frankly and openly to tell you the intention of my visit." </q>
            </p>
            <p>I bowed, and we both returned to our seats.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "I will own myself to have been greatly sur prised," </q> continued
               he, <q rend="inline"> "when I met you yes terday evening, in company with two persons
                  who I was sensible merited not the honour of your notice; nor was it easy for me
                  to conjec ture the cause of your being so situated; yet, be lieve me, my
                  incertitude did not for a moment do you injury; I was satisfied that their
                  characters must be unknown to you, and I thought with con cern of the shock you
                  would sustain, when you discovered their unworthiness. I should not, however, upon
                  so short an acquaintance, have <pb n="51"/> usurped the privilege of intimacy, in
                  giving my unasked sentiments upon so delicate a subject, had I not known that
                  credulity is the sister of in nocence, and therefore feared you might be de
                  ceived. A something, which I could not resist, urged me to the freedom I have
                  taken to caution you; but I shall not easily forgive myself, if I have been so
                  unfortunate as to give you pain." </q>
            </p>
            <p> The pride which his first question had excited, now subsided into delight and
               gratitude, and I in stantly related to him, as well as I could, the accident which
               had occasioned my joining the un happy women with whom he had met me. He listened
               with an attention so flattering, seemed so much interested during the recital, and,
               when I had done, thanked me, in terms so polite, for what he was pleased to call my
               condescension, that I was almost ashamed either to look at, or hear him. </p>
            <p> Soon after, the maid came to tell me, that Madame Duval desired to have breakfast
               made in her own room. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I fear,"</q> cried Lord Orville, instantly rising, <q rend="inline"
                  > "that I have intruded upon your time,—yet who, so situated, could do otherwise?"
               </q> Then, taking my hand, <q rend="inline"> "Will Miss Anville allow me thus to seal
                  my peace?" </q> He pressed it to his lips, and took leave. </p>
            <p> Generous, noble Lord Orville! how disinte rested his conduct! how delicate his whole
               beha viour! willing to advise, yet afraid to wound me!—Can I ever, in future, regret
               the adventure I met with at Marybone, since it has been product ive of a visit so
               flattering? Had my mortificati ons been still more humiliating, my terrors still more
               alarming, such a mark of esteem—may I <pb n="52"/> not call it so?—from Lord Orville,
               would have made me ample amends. </p>
            <p> And indeed, my dear Sir, I require some con solation in my present very disagreeable
               situation; for, since he went, two incidents have happened, that, had not my spirits
               been particularly elated, would greatly have disconcerted me. </p>
            <p> During breakfast, Madame Duval, very abrupt ly, asked if I should like to be
               married? and ad ded, that Mr. Branghton had been proposing a match for me with his
               son. Surprised, and, I must own, provoked, I assured her that, in think ing of me,
               Mr. Branghton would very vainly lose his time. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why,"</q> cried she, <q rend="inline"> "I have had grander views
                  for you, myself, if once I could get you to Paris, and make you be owned; but, if
                  I can't do that, and you can do no better, why, as you are both my relations, I
                  think to leave my fortune between you, and then, if you marry, you never need want
                  for nothing." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I begged her not to pursue the subject, as, I assured her, Mr. Branghton was totally
               disagree able to me: but she continued her admonitions and reflections, with her
               usual disregard of what ever I could answer. She charged me, very pe remptorily,
               neither wholly to discourage, nor yet to accept Mr. Branghton's offer, till she saw
               what could be done for me: the young man, she ad ded, had often intended to speak to
               me himself, but, not well knowing how to introduce the sub ject, he had desired her
               to pave the way for him. </p>
            <p> I scrupled not, warmly and freely to declare my aversion to this proposal; but it
               was to no effect, as she concluded, just as she had begun, by saying, that I should
               not <hi>have him, if I could do better.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53"/> Nothing, however, shall persuade me to listen to any other person
               concerning this odious affair. </p>
            <p> My second cause of uneasiness arises, very un expectedly, from M. Du Bois, who, to
               my infi nite surprise, upon Madame Duval's quitting the room after dinner, put into
               my hand a note, and immediately left the house. </p>
            <p> This note contains an open declaration of an attachment to me, which, he says, he
               should ne ver have presumed to have acknowledged, had he not been informed that
               Madame Duval destined my hand to young Branghton,—a match which he cannot endure to
               think of. He beseeches me, earnestly, to pardon his temerity, professes the most
               inviolable respect, and commits his fate to time, patience, and pity. </p>
            <p> This conduct in M. Du Bois gives me real con cern, as I was disposed to think very
               well of him. It will not, however, be difficult to discourage him, and therefore I
               shall not acquaint Madame Duval of his letter, as I have reason to believe it would
               greatly displease her. </p>

            <p> O SIR, how much uneasiness must I suffer, to counterbalance one short morning of
               happiness! </p>
            <p> Yesterday, the Branghtons proposed a party to Kensington-gardens, and, as usual,
               Madame Du val insisted upon my attendance. </p>
            <p> We went in a hackney-coach to Piccadilly, and then had a walk through Hyde Park,
               which in any other company, would have been delightful. I <pb n="54"/> was much
               pleased with Kensington-gardens, and think them infinitely preferable to those of
               Vauxhall. </p>
            <p> Young Branghton was extremely troublesome; he insisted upon walking by my side, and
               talked with me almost by compulsion: however, my re serve and coldness prevented his
               entering upon the hateful subject which Madame Duval had prepa red me to apprehend.
               Once, indeed, when I was, accidentally, a few yards before the rest, he said, <q
                  rend="inline"> "I suppose, Miss, aunt has told you about you know what?—ha'n't
                  she, Miss?" </q> —But I turned from him without making any answer. Neither Mr.
               Smith nor Mr. Brown were of the party; and poor M. Du Bois, when he found that I
               avoided him, looked so melancholy, that I was really sorry for him. </p>
            <p> While we were strolling round the garden, I perceived, walking with a party of
               ladies at some distance, Lord Orville! I instantly retreated be hind Miss Branghton,
               and kept out of sight till we had passed him: for I dreaded being seen by him again,
               in a public walk, with a party of which I was ashamed. </p>
            <p> Happily I succeeded in my design, and saw no more of him; for a sudden and violent
               shower of rain made us all hasten out of the gardens. We ran till we came to a small
               green-shop, where we begged shelter. Here we found ourselves in com pany with two
               footmen, whom the rain had dri ven into the shop. Their livery, I thought, I had
               before seen; and upon looking from the window, I perceived the same upon a coachman
               belonging to a carriage, which I immediately recollected to be Lord Orville's. </p>
            <p> Fearing to be known, I whispered Miss Brangh ton not to speak my name. Had I
               considered but <pb n="55"/> a moment, I should have been sensible of the in utility
               of such a caution, since not one of the party call me by any other appellation than
               that of <hi>Cousin,</hi> or of <hi>Miss;</hi> but I am perpetually in volved in some
               distress or dilemma from my own heedlessness. </p>
            <p> This request excited very strongly her curiosi ty; and she attacked me with such
               eagerness and bluntness of enquiry, that I could not avoid telling her the reason of
               my making it, and, consequent ly, that I was known to Lord Orville: an acknow
               ledgment which proved the most unfortunate in the world; for she would not rest till
               she had drawn from me the circumstances attending my first making the acquaintance.
               Then, calling to her sister, she said, <q rend="inline"> "Lord, Polly only think!
                  Miss has danced with a Lord!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Well,"</q> cried Polly, <q rend="inline"> "that's a thing I should
                  never have thought of! And pray, Miss, what did he say to you?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> This question was much sooner asked than an swered; and they both became so very
               inquisitive and earnest, that they soon drew the attention of Madame Duval and the
               rest of the party, to whom, in a very short time, they repeated all they had gathered
               from me. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Goodness, then,"</q> cried young Branghton, <q rend="inline"> "if I
                  was Miss, if I would not make free with his Lordship's coach to take me to town."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why ay,"</q> said the father, <q rend="inline"> "there would be
                  some sense in that; that would be making some use of a Lord's acquaintance, for it
                  would save us coach-hire." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Lord, Miss,"</q> cried Polly, <q rend="inline"> "I wish you would,
                  for I should like of all things to ride in a coronet coach!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56"/>
               <q rend="inline">"I promise you,"</q> said Madame Duval, <q rend="inline"> "I'm glad
                  you've thought of it, for I don't see no ob jection;—so let's have the coach-man
                  called." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Not for the world,"</q> cried I, very much alarmed, <q
                  rend="inline">"indeed it is utterly impossible."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why so?"</q> demanded Mr. Branghton; <q rend="inline"> "pray
                  where's the good of your knowing a Lord, if you're never the better for him?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> " <hi>Ma foi,</hi> child," </q> said Madame Duval, <q rend="inline"
                  > "you don't know no more of the world than if you was a baby. Pray, Sir, (to one
                  of the footmen,) tell that coachman to draw up, for I wants to speak to him." </q>
            </p>
            <p> The man stared, but did not move. <q rend="inline">"Pray, pray, Madam,"</q> said I,
                  <q rend="inline"> "pray, Mr. Branghton, have the goodness to give up this plan; I
                  know but very little of his Lordship, and cannot, upon any account, take so great
                  a liberty." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Don't say nothing about it,"</q> said Madame Duval, <q
                  rend="inline"> "for I shall have it my own way: so if <hi>you</hi> won't call the
                  coachman, Sir, I'll promise you I'll call him myself." </q>
            </p>
            <p> The footman, very impertinently, laughed and turned upon his heel. Madame Duval,
               extremely irritated, ran out in the rain, and beckoned the coachman, who instantly
               obeyed her summons. Shocked beyond all expression, I flew after her, and entreated
               her with the utmost earnestness, to let us return in a hackney-coach:—but oh!—she is
               impenetrable to persuasion! She told the man she wanted him to carry her directly to
               town, and that she would answer for him to Lord Orville. The man, with a sneer,
               thanked her, but said he should answer for himself; and was driving off, when another
               footman came up to him, with informati on that his Lord was gone into Kensington
               palace, and would not want him for an hour or two. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Why then, friend,</q> "said Mr. Branghton, (for we were followed by
               all the party) <q rend="inline"> "where will be the great harm of your taking us to
                  town?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Besides,"</q> said the son, <q rend="inline">"I'll promise you a
                  pot of beer for my own share."</q>
            </p>
            <p> These speeches had no other answer from the coachman than a loud laugh, which was
               echoed by the insolent footmen. I rejoiced at their re sistance, though I was
               certain, that if their Lord had witnessed their impertinence, they would have been
               instantly dismissed his service. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> " <hi>Pardie,</hi> " </q> cried Madame Duval, <q rend="inline"> "if
                  I don't think all the footmen are the most impu dentest fellows in the kingdom!
                  But I'll promise you I'll have your master told of your airs, so you'll get no
                  good by 'em." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why pray,"</q> said the coachman, rather alarmed, <q rend="inline"
                  >"did my Lord give you leave to use the coach?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"It's no matter for that,"</q> answered she; <q rend="inline"> "I'm
                  sure if he's a gentleman he'd let us have it sooner than we should be wet to the
                  skin: but I'll promise you he shall know how saucy you've been, for this young
                  lady knows him very well." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Ay, that she does,"</q> said Miss Polly; <q rend="inline">"and
                  she's danced with him too.</q>
            </p>
            <p> "Oh how I repented my foolish misma nagement! The men bit their lips, and looked at
               one another in some confusion. This was per ceived by our party, who, taking
               advantage of it, protested they would write Lord Orville word of their ill behaviour
               without delay. This quite startled them, and one of the footmen offered to run to the
               palace, and ask his Lord's permission for our having the carriage. </p>
            <p> This proposal really made me tremble; and the Branghtons all hung back upon it: but
               Madame <pb n="58"/> Duval is never to be dissuaded from a scheme she has once formed.
                  <q rend="inline">"Do so,"</q> cried she, <q rend="inline"> "and give this child's
                  compliments to your Master, and tell him, as we ha'n't no coach here, we should be
                  glad to go just as far as Holborn in his." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No, no, no,!"</q> cried I; <q rend="inline"> "don't go,—I know
                  nothing of his Lordship,—I send no mes sage,—I have nothing to say to him!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> The men, very much perplexed, could with difficulty restrain themselves from
               resuming their impertinent mirth. Madame Duval scolded me very angrily, and then
               desired them to go direct ly, <q rend="inline">"Pray, then,"</q> said the coachman,
                  <q rend="inline">"what name is to be given to my Lord?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Anville,"</q> answered Madame Duval, <q rend="inline"> "tell him
                  Miss Anville wants the coach; the young la dy he danced with once." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I was really in an agony: but the winds could not have been more deaf to me, than
               those to whom I pleaded! and therefore the footman, urg ed by the repeated threats of
               Madame Duval, and perhaps recollecting the name himself, actu ally went to the palace
               with this strange message! </p>
            <p> He returned in a few minutes, and bowing to me with the greatest respect, said, <q
                  rend="inline"> "My Lord desires his compliments, and his carriage will be always
                  at Miss Anville's service." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I was so much affected by this politeness, and chagrined at the whole affair, that I
               could scarce refrain from tears. Madame Duval and the Miss Branghtons eagerly jumped
               into the coach, and desired me to follow. I would rather have sub mitted to the
               severest punishment;—but all resist ance was vain. </p>
            <p> During the whole ride, I said not a word; how ever, the rest of the party were so
               talkative, that my silence was very immaterial. We stopped <pb n="59"/> at our
               lodgings; but when Madame Duval and I alighted, the Branghtons asked if they could
               not be carried on to Snow-Hill? The servants, now all civility, made no objection.
               Remonstrances from me, would, I too well kn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF"

               left them to their own direction. </p>
            <p> Seldom have I passed a night in greater uneasi ness:—so lately to have cleared
               myself in the good opinion of Lord Orville,—so soon to forfeit it!—to give him reason
               to suppose I presumed to boast of his acquaintance,—to publish his having danced with
               me!—to take with him a liberty I should have blushed to have taken with the most
               intimate of my friends!—to treat with such im pertinent freedom one who has honoured
                  <hi>me</hi> with such distinguished respect!—indeed, Sir, I could have met with no
               accident that would so cruelly have tormented me! </p>
            <p> If such were, then, my feelings, imagine,—for I cannot describe, what I suffered
               during the scene I am now going to write. </p>
            <p> This morning, while I was alone in the dining room, young Branghton called. He
               entered with a most important air, and strutting up to me, said, <q rend="inline">
                  "Miss, <hi>Lord Orville</hi> sends his compliments to you." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Lord Orville!"</q> —repeated I, much amazed. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Yes, Miss, Lord Orville; for <hi>I</hi> know his Lordship now, as
                  well as you,—And a very civil gentleman he is, for all he's a Lord." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"For Heaven's sake,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline">"explain
                  yourself."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why you must know, Miss, after we lest you, we met with a little
                  misfortune; but I don't mind it now, for it's all turned out for the best: but,
                  just as we were a going up Snow-Hill, plump <pb n="60"/> we comes against a cart,
                  with such a jog it almost pulled the coach-wheel off; however, that i'n't the
                  worst, for as I went to open the door in a hurry, a thinking the coach would be
                  broke down, as ill-luck would have it, I never minded that the glass was up, and
                  so I poked my head fairly through it. Only see, Miss, how I've cut my forehead!"
               </q>
            </p>
            <p> A much worse accident to himself, would not I believe, at that moment, have given me
               any concern for him: however, he proceeded with his account, for I was too much
               confounded to in terrupt him. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Goodness, Miss, we were in such a stew, us, and the servants, and
                  all, as you can't think, for besides the glass being broke, the coachman said how
                  the coach would'n't be safe to go back to Kensington. So we did n't know what to
                  do; however, the footmen said they'd go and tell his Lordship what had happened.
                  So then father grew quite uneasy, like, for fear of his Lord ship's taking
                  offence, and prejudicing us in our business: so he said I should go this morning
                  and ask his pardon, 'cause of having broke the glass. So then I asked the footman
                  the direction, and they told me he lived in Berkley-square; so this morning I
                  went, and I soon found out the house." </q>

            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"You did!"</q> cried I, quite out of breath with apprehension. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Yes, Miss, and a very fine house it is. Did you ever see it?" </q>

               <q rend="inline"> "No!—why then, Miss, I know more of his Lordship than you do, for
                  all you knew him first. So, when I came to the door, I was in a peck of troubles,
                  a thinking what I should say to him; however, the servants had no mind I should
                  see <pb n="61"/> him, for they told me he was busy, but I might leave my message.
                  So I was just coming away, when I bethought myself to say I come from you." </q>

               <q rend="inline"> "Yes, Miss,—for you know why should I have such a long walk as that
                  for nothing? So I says to the porter, says I, tell his Lordship, says I, one wants

               <q rend="inline">"Good God,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline"> "and by what au thority

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Goodness, Miss, don't be in such a hurry, for you'll be as glad as

                  said his Lordship would see me di rectly; and there I was led through such a heap
                  of servants, and so many rooms, that my heart quite misgave me; for I thought,
                  thinks I, he'll be so proud he'll hardly let me speak; but he's no more proud than
                  I am, and he was as civil at if I'd been a lord myself. So then I said, I ho ped
                  he would n't take it amiss about the glass, for it was quite an accident: but he
                  bid me not men tion it, for it did n't signify. And then he said he hoped you got
                  safe home, and was n't frightened; and so I said yes, and I gave your duty to
                  him." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"My duty to him!"</q> exclaimed I,— <q rend="inline">"and who gave

            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "O, I did it of my own head, just to make him think I came from

                  obligated to you, I'm sure." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"You'll drive me wild,"</q> (cried I, starting from my seat) <q
                  rend="inline"> "you have done me an irrepara ble injury;—but I will hear no more!"
               </q> —and then I ran into my own room. </p>
            <p> I was half frantic, I really raved; the good opinion of Lord Orville seemed now
               irretrievably lost: a faint hope, which in the morning I had vainly encouraged, that
               I might see him again, and explain the transaction, wholly vanished, now I found he
               was so soon to leave town: and I could not but conclude that, for the rest of my
               life, he would regard me as an object of utter contempt. </p>
            <p> The very idea was a dagger to my heart!—I could not support it, and—but I blush to
               proceed—I fear your disapprobation, yet I should not be conscious of having merited
               it, but that the repug nance I feel to relate to you what I have done, makes me
               suspect I must have erred. Will you forgive me, if I own that I have <hi>first</hi>
               written an account of this transaction to Miss Mirvan?—and that I even thought of
                  <hi>concealing</hi> it from you?—Short-lived, however, was the ungrateful idea,
               and sooner will I risk the justice of your displea sure, than unworthily betray your
               generous confi dence. </p>
            <p> You are now probably prepared for what fol lows—which is a letter,—a hasty letter,
               that, in the height of my agitation, I wrote to Lord Orville. </p>

                  <p> I am so infinitely ashamed of the application made yesterday for your
                     Lordship's carriage in my name, and so greatly shocked at hearing how much it
                     was injured, that I cannot forbear writing a few lines, to clear myself from
                     the imputation of an impertinence which I blush to be suspected of, and to
                     acquaint you, that the request for your carriage was made against my consent,
                     and the visit with which you were importuned this morning, with out my
                     knowledge. </p>
                  <p> I am inexpressibly concerned at having been the instrument, however
                     innocently, of so much trouble to your Lordship; but I beg you to be lieve,

            <p> I applied to the maid of the house to get this note conveyed to Berkeley-square; but
               scarce had I parted with it, ere I regretted having writ ten at all, and I was flying
               down stairs to recover it, when the voice of Sir Clement Willoughby stopped me. As
               Madame Duval had ordered we should be denied to him, I was obliged to return up
               stairs; and after he was gone, my appli cation was too late, as the maid had given it
               to a porter. </p>
            <p> My time did not pass very serenely while he was gone; however, he brought me no
               answer, but that Lord Orville was not at home. Whe ther <pb n="64"/> or not he will
               take the trouble to send any;—or whether he will condescend to call;—or whether the

            <p> YOU may now, my dear Sir, send Mrs. Clin ton for your Evelina with as much speed as
               she can conveniently make the journey, for no fur ther opposition will be made to her
               leaving this town; happy had it perhaps been for her had she never entered it! </p>
            <p> This morning Madame Duval desired me to go to Snow-hill, with an invitation to the
               Branghtons and Mr. Smith, to spend the evening with her: and she desired M. Du Bois,
               who breakfasted with us, to accompany me. I was very unwil ling to obey her, as I
               neither wished to walk with M. Du Bois, nor yet to meet young Branghton. And, indeed,
               another, a yet more powerful rea son, added to my reluctance,—for I thought it
               possible that Lord Orville might send some an swer, or perhaps might call, during my
               ab sence; however, I did not dare dispute her com mands. </p>
            <p> Poor M. Du Bois spoke not a word during our walk, which was, I believe, equally
               unpleasant to us both. We found all the family assembled in the shop. Mr. Smith, the
               moment he per ceived <pb n="65"/> me, addressed himself to Miss Branghton, whom he
               entertained with all the gallantry in his power. I rejoice to find that my conduct at
               the Hampstead ball has had so good an effect. But young Branghton was extremely
               troublesome, he repeatedly laughed in my face, and looked so im pertinently
               significant, that I was obliged to give up my reserve to M. Du Bois, and enter into
               conversation with him, merely to avoid such bold ness. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Miss,"</q> said Mr. Branghton, <q rend="inline"> "I'm sorry to hear
                  from my son that you was n't pleased with what we did about that Lord Orville; but
                  I should like to know what it was you found fault with, for we did all for the
                  best." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Goodness!"</q> cried the son, <q rend="inline"> "why if you'd seen
                  Miss, you'd have been surprised,—she went out of the room quite in a huff, like."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"It is too late, now,"</q> said I, <q rend="inline"> "to reason up
                  on this subject; but, for the future, I must take the liberty to request, that my
                  name may never be made use of without my knowledge. May I tell Madame Duval that
                  you will do her the favour to accept her invitation?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"As to me, Ma'am,"</q> said Mr. Smith, <q rend="inline"> "I am much
                  obliged to the old lady, but I've no mind to be taken in by her again; you'll
                  excuse me, Ma'am." </q>
            </p>
            <p> All the rest promised to come, and I then took leave: but as I left the shop, I
               heard Mr. Branghton say, <q rend="inline">"Take courage, Tom, she's only coy."</q>
               And, before I had walked ten yards, the youth followed. </p>
            <p> I was so much offended that I would not look at him, but began to converse with M.
               Du Bois, who was now more lively than I had ever before <pb n="66"/> seen him; for,
               most unfortunately, he misinter preted the reason of my attention to him. </p>
            <p> The first intelligence I received when I came home, was that two gentlemen had
               called, and left cards. I eagerly enquired for them, and read the names of Lord
               Orville and Sir Clement Wil loughby. I by no means regretted that I missed seeing the
               latter, but perhaps I may all my life regret that I missed seeing the former, for
               proba bly he has now left town,—and I may see him no more! </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"My goodness!"</q> cried young Branghton, rudely looking over me, <q
                  rend="inline"> "only think of that Lord's coming all this way! It's my belief he'd
                  got some order ready for father, and so he'd a mind to call and ask you if I'd
                  told him the truth." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Pray, Betty,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline">"how long has he been
                  gone?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Not two minutes, Ma'am."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why then I'll lay you any wager,"</q> said young Branghton, <q
                  rend="inline">"he saw you and I a-walking up Holborn Hill!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"God forbid!"</q> cried I, impatiently; and too much chagrined to
               bear with any more of his remarks, I ran up stairs: but I heard him say to M. Du
               Bois, <q rend="inline"> "Miss is so <hi>uppish</hi> this morning, that I think I had
                  better not speak to her again." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I wish M. Du Bois had taken the same resolu tion; but he chose to follow me into the
               dining room, which we found empty. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> " <hi> Vous ne l'aimez donc pas ce garcon, Made moiselle! </hi> "
               </q> cried he. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Me!"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline">"no, I detest him!"</q> for I
               was quite sick at heart. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> " <hi>Ah, tu me rends la vie!</hi> " </q> cried he, and slinging
               himself at my feet, he had just caught <pb n="67"/> my hand, as the door was opened
               by Madame Duval. </p>
            <p> Hastily, and with marks of guilty confusion in his face, he arose; but the rage of
               that lady quite amazed me! advancing to the retreating M. Du Bois, she began, in
               French, an attack which her extreme wrath and wonderful volubili ty almost rendered
               unintelligible; yet I under stood but too much, since her reproaches convin ced me
               she had herself proposed being the object of his affection. </p>
            <p> He defended himself in a weak and evasive manner, and upon her commanding him from
               her sight, very readily withdrew: and then, with yet greater violence, she upbraided
               me with having <hi>seduced</hi> his heart, called me an ungrateful, design ing girl,
               and protested she would neither take me to Paris, nor any more interest herself in my
               con cerns, unless I would instantly agree to marry young Branghton. </p>
            <p> Frightened as I had been at her vehemence, this proposal restored all my courage;
               and I frank ly told her that in this point I never could obey her. More irritated
               than ever, she ordered me to quit the room. </p>
            <p> Such is the present situation of affairs. I shall excuse myself from seeing the
               Branghtons this af ternoon: indeed, I never wish to see them again. I am sorry,
               however innocently, that I have dis pleased Madame Duval, yet I shall be very glad to
               quit this town, for I believe it does not, now, contain one person I ever wish to
               again meet. Had I but seen Lord Orville, I should regret no thing: I could then have
               more fully explained what I so hastily wrote; yet it will always be a pleasure to me
               to recollect that he called, since I <pb n="68"/> flatter myself it was in
               consequence of his being satisfied with my letter. </p>
            <p> Adieu, my dear Sir; the time now approaches when I hope once more to receive your
               bles sing, and to owe all my joy, all my happiness to your kindness. </p>

            <p> MY sweet Maria will be much surprised, and, I am willing to flatter myself,
               concerned, when, instead of her friend, she receives this letter;—this cold, this
               inanimate letter, which will but ill express the feelings of the heart which in dites
               it. </p>
            <p> When I wrote to you last Friday, I was in hourly expectation of seeing Mrs. Clinton,
               with whom I intended to have set out for Howard Grove; Mrs. Clinton came, but my plan
               was necessarily altered, for she brought me a letter,—the sweetest that ever was
               penned, from the best and kindest friend that ever orphan was blest with, requiring
               my immediate attendance at Ber ry Hill. </p>
            <p> I obeyed,—and pardon me if I own I obeyed without reluctance; after so long a
               separation, should I not else have been the most ungrateful of mortals?—And yet,—oh
               Maria! though I <hi>wished</hi> to leave London, the gratification of my wish
               afforded me no happiness! and though I felt an impatience inexpressible to return
               hither, no words, no language can explain the heaviness <pb n="70"/> of heart with
               which I made the journey. I be lieve you would hardly have known me;—in deed, I
               hardly know myself. Perhaps had I first seen <hi>you,</hi> in your kind and
               sympathising bosom I might have ventured to have reposed every secret of my soul; and
               then—but let me pursue my journal. </p>
            <p> Mrs. Clinton delivered Madame Duval a let ter from Mr. Villars, which requested her
               leave for my return, and indeed it was very readily accorded: yet, when she found, by
               my wil lingness to quit town, that M. Du Bois was re ally indifferent to me, she
               somewhat softened in my favour, and declared that, but for punishing his folly in
               thinking of such a child, she would not have consented to my being again buried in
               the country. </p>
            <p> All the Branghtons called to take leave of me: but I will not write a word more
               about them; indeed I cannot with any patience think of that family, to whose
               forwardness and impertinence is owing all the uneasiness I at this moment suf fer! </p>
            <p> So great was the depression of my spirits up on the road, that it was with
               difficulty I could persuade the worthy Mrs. Clinton I was not ill: but alas, the
               situation of my mind was such as would have rendered any mere bodily pain, by
               comparison, even enviable! </p>
            <p> And yet, when we arrived at Berry Hill,—when the chaise stopped at this place,—how
               did my heart throb with joy! and when, through the window, I beheld the dearest, the
               most ve nearble of men, with uplifted hands, returning, as I doubt not, thanks for my
               safe arrival,—good God! I thought it would have burst my bosom!—I opened the
               chaise-door myself, I <pb n="71"/> flew,—for my feet did not seem to touch the
               ground,—into the parlour; he had risen to meet me, but the moment I appeared, he sunk
               into his chair, uttering with a deep sigh, though his face <hi>beamed</hi> with
               delight, <q rend="inline">"My God, I thank thee!"</q>
            </p>
            <p> I sprung forward, and with a pleasure that bordered upon agony, I embraced his
               knees, I kissed his hands, I wept over them, but could not speak: while he, now
               raising his eyes in thankfulness towards heaven, now bowing down his reverend head,
               and folding me in his arms, could scarce articulate the blessings with which his kind
               and benevolent heart overflowed. </p>
            <p> O Miss Mirvan, to be so beloved by the best of men,—should I not be happy?—Should I
               have one wish save that of meriting his good ness?—Yet think me not ungrateful;
               indeed I am not, although the internal sadness of my mind unfits me, at present, for
               enjoying as I ought, the bounties of Providence. </p>
            <p> I cannot journalise; cannot arrange my ideas into order. </p>
            <p> How little has situation to do with happi ness! I had flattered myself that, when
               restor ed to Berry Hill, I should be restored to tran quility: far otherwise have I

            <p> I blush for what I have written: Can you, Maria, forgive my gravity? but I restrain
               it so much, and so painfully, in the presence of Mr. Villars, that I know not how to
               deny myself the consolation of indulging it to you. </p>
            <p>Adieu, my dear Miss Mirvan.</p>
            <p> Yet one thing I must add; do not let the seriousness of this letter deceive you: do
               not im pute <pb n="72"/> to a wrong cause the melancholy I confess, by supposing that
               the heart of your friend mourns a too great susceptibility; no, indeed! believe me it
               never was, never can be, more assuredly her own, than at this moment. So witness in

            <p> YOU accuse me of mystery, and charge me with reserve: I cannot doubt but I must have
               merited the accusation;—yet, to clear myself,—you know not how painful will be the
               task. But I cannot resist your kind entreaties,—indeed, I do not wish to resist them,
               for your friendship and affection will soothe my chagrin. Had it ari sen from any
               other cause, not a moment would I have deferred the communication you ask;—but, as it
               is, I would, were it possible, not only conceal it from all the world, but endeavour
               to disbelieve it myself. Yet, since I <hi>must</hi> tell you, why trifle with your
               impatience? </p>
            <p> I know not how to come to the point; twenty times have I attempted it in vain;—but I
               will <hi>force</hi> myself to proceed. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73"/> Oh, Miss Mirvan, could you ever have believ ed, that one who seemed
               formed as a pattern for his fellow-creatures, as a model of perfection,—one whose
               elegance surpassed all description,—whose sweetness of manners disgraced all compari
               son,—Oh, Miss Mirvan, could you ever have believed that <hi>Lord Orville</hi> would
               have treated me with indignity? </p>
            <p> Never, never again will I trust to appearances,—never confide in my own weak
               judgment,—ne ver believe that person to be good, who seems to be amiable! What cruel
               maxims are we taught by a knowledge of the world!—But while my own reflections absorb
               me, I forget you are still in suspence. </p>
            <p> I had just finished the last letter which I wrote to you from London, when the maid
               of the house brought me a note. It was given to her, she said, by a footman, who told
               her he would call the next day for an answer. </p>
            <p>This note,—but let it speak for itself.</p>

                  <head>To Miss Anville.</head>
                  <p> With transport, most charming of thy sex, did I read the letter with which you
                     yesterday morning favoured me. I am sorry the affair of the carriage should
                     have given you any concern, but I am highly flattered by the anxiety you ex
                     press so kindly. Believe me, my lovely girl, I am truly sensible of the honour
                     of your good opi nion, and feel myself deeply penetrated with love and
                     gratitude. The correspondence you have so sweetly commenced I shall be proud of
                     continu ing, and I hope the strong sense I have or the fa vour you do me, will
                     prevent your withdrawing it. Assure yourself that I desire nothing more ar
                     dently, than to pour forth my thanks at your feet, <pb n="74"/> and to offer
                     those vows which are so justly the tri bute of your charms and accomplishments.
                     In your next, I entreat you to acquaint me how long you shall remain in town.
                     The servant whom I shall commission to call for an answer, has orders to ride
                     post with it to me. My impatience for his arrival will be very great, though
                     inferior to that with which I burn, to tell you, in person, how much I am, my
                     sweet girl, </p>

            <p> What a letter! how has my proud heart swelled every line I have copied! What I wrote
               to him you know; tell me then, my dear friend, do you think it merited such an
               answer?—and that I have deservedly incurred the liberty he has taken? I meant nothing
               but a simple apology, which I thought as much due to my own character, as to his;
               yet, by the construction he seems to have put upon it, should you not have imagined
               it con tained the avowal of sentiments which might, in deed, have provoked his
               contempt? </p>
            <p> The moment the letter was delivered to me, I retired to my own room to read it, and
               so eager was my first perusal, that,—I am ashamed to own it gave me no sensation but
               of delight. Unsuspi cious of any impropriety from Lord Orville, I perceived not
               immediately the impertinence it im plied,—I only marked the expressions of his own
               regard; and I was so much surprised, that I was unable, for some time, to compose
               myself, or read it again,—I could only walk up and down the room, repeating to
               myself, <q rend="inline"> "Good God, is it possible?—am I, then, loved by Lord
                  Orville?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> But this dream was soon over, and I awoke to far different feelings; upon a second
               reading I thought every word changed,—it did not seem the <pb n="75"/> same letter,—I
               could not find one sentence that I could look at without blushing: my astonishment
               was extreme, and it was succeeded by the utmost indignation. </p>
            <p> If, as I am very ready to acknowledge, I erred in writing to Lord Orville, was it
               for <hi>him</hi> to pu nish the error? If he was offended, could he not have been
               silent? If he thought my letter ill judged, should he not have pitied my ignorance?
               have considered my youth, and allowed for my inexperience. </p>
            <p> Oh Maria, how have I been deceived in this man! Words have no power to tell the high
               opi nion I had of him; to that was owing the unfor tunate solicitude which prompted
               my writing,—a solicitude I must for ever repent! </p>
            <p> Yet perhaps I have rather reason to rejoice than to grieve, since this affair has
               shewn me his real disposition, and removed that partiality, which, covering his every
               imperfection, left only his vir tues and good qualities exposed to view. Had the
               deception continued much longer, had my mind re ceived any additional prejudice in
               his favour, who knows whither my mistaken ideas might have led me? Indeed I fear I
               was in greater danger than I apprehended, or can now think of without trembling,—for
               oh, if this weak heart of mine had been penetrated with too deep an impression of his
               merit,—my peace and happiness had been lost for ever! </p>
            <p> I would fain encourage more chearful thoughts, fain drive from my mind the
               melancholy that has taken possession of it,—but I cannot succeed; for, added to the
               humiliating feelings which so power fully oppress me, I have yet another cause of con
               cern;—alas, my dear Maria, I have broken the tranquility of the best of men! </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76"/> I have never had the courage to shew him this cruel letter: I could not
               bear so greatly to depre ciate in his opinion, one whom I had, with infinite anxiety,
               raised in it myself. Indeed, my first determination was to confine my chagrin totally
               to my own bosom; but your friendly enquiries have drawn it from me; and now I wish I
               had made no concealment from the beginning, since I know not how to account for a
               gravity which not all my endeavours can entirely hide or re press. </p>
            <p> My greatest apprehensions is, lest he should imagine that my residence in London has
               given me a distaste to the country. Every body I see takes notice of my being
               altered, and looking pale and ill. I should be very indifferent to all such
               observations, did I not perceive that they draw upon me the eyes of Mr. Villars,
               which glisten with affectionate concern. </p>
            <p> This morning, in speaking of my London ex pedition, he mentioned Lord Orville. I
               felt so much disturbed, that I would instantly have changed the subject; but he would
               not allow me, and, very unexpectedly, he began his panegyric, extolling, in strong
               terms, his manly and honou rable behaviour in regard to the Marybone ad venture. My
               cheeks glowed with indignation every word he spoke;—so lately as I had myself fancied
               him the noblest of his sex, now that I was so well convinced of my mistake, I could
               not bear to hear his undeserved praises uttered by one so really good, so
               unsuspecting, so pure of heart! </p>
            <p> What he thought of my silence and uneasiness I fear to know, but I hope he will
               mention the subject no more. I will not, however, with un grateful indolence, give
               way to a sadness which <pb n="77"/> I find infectious to him who merits the most
               chearful exertion of my spirits. I am thankful that he has forborne to probe my
               wound, and I will endeavour to heal it by the consciousness that I have not deserved
               the indignity I have received. Yet I cannot but lament to find myself in a world so
               deceitful, where we must suspect what we see, distrust what we hear, and doubt even
               what we feel! </p>

            <p> I MUST own myself somewhat distressed how to answer your raillery: yet believe me,
               my dear Maria, your suggestions are those of <hi>fancy,</hi> not of <hi>truth.</hi> I
               am unconscious of the weakness you suspect; yet, to dispel your doubts, I will
               animate myself more than ever to conquer my chagrin, and to recover my spirits. </p>
            <p> You wonder, you say, since my <hi>heart</hi> takes no part in this affair, why it
               should make me so unhappy? And can you, acquainted as you are with the high opinion I
               entertained of Lord Or ville, can you wonder that so great a disappoint ment in his
               character should affect me? indeed, had so strange a letter been sent to me from
                  <hi>any</hi> body, it could not have failed shocking me; how much more sensibly,
               then, must I feel such an affront, when received from the man in the <pb n="78"/>
               world I had imagined least capable of giving it? </p>
            <p> You are glad I made no reply; assure yourself, my dear friend, had this letter been
               the most re spectful that could be written, the clandestine air given to it, by his
               proposal of sending his ser vant for my answer, instead of having it directed to his
               house, would effectually have prevented my writing. Indeed, I have an aversion the
               most sincere to all mysteries, all private actions; however foolishly and blameably,
               in regard to this letter, I have deviated from the open path which, from my earliest
               infancy, I was taught to tread. </p>
            <p> He talks of my having <hi> commenced a correspon dence </hi> with him; and could
               Lord Orville indeed believe I had such a design? believe me so for ward, so bold, so
               strangely ridiculous? I know not if his man called or not, but I rejoice that I
               quitted London before he came, and without leaving any message for him. What indeed,
               could I have said? it would have been a conde scension very unmerited, to have taken
               any, the least notice of such a letter. </p>
            <p> Never shall I cease to wonder how he could write it. Oh, Maria, what, what could
               induce him so causelessly to wound and affront one who would sooner have died than
               wilfully offend <hi>him?</hi> —How mortifying a freedom of style! how cruel an
               implication conveyed by his <hi>thanks,</hi> and expressions of gratitude! Is it not
               astonishing, that any man can <hi>appear</hi> so modest, who is so vain? </p>
            <p> Every hour I regret the secrecy I have observ ed with my beloved Mr. Villars; I know
               not what bewitched me, but I felt, at first, a repug nance to publishing this affair
               that I could not sur mount, <pb n="79"/> —and now, I am ashamed of confessing that I
               have any thing to confess! Yet I deserve to be punished for the false delicacy which
               occasi oned my silence; since, if Lord Orville him self was contented to forfeit his
               character, was it for me, almost at the expence of my own, to support it? </p>
            <p> Yet I believe I should be very easy, now the first shock is over, and now that I see
               the whole affair with the resentment it merits, did not all my good friends in this
               neighbourhood, who think me extremely altered, teaze me about my gravity, and torment
               Mr. Villars with observations upon my dejection, and falling away. The subject is no
               sooner started, than a deep gloom overspreads his venerable countenance, and he looks
               at me with a tenderness so melancholy, that I know not how to endure the
               consciousness of exci ting it. </p>
            <p> Mrs. Selwyn, a lady of large fortune, who lives about three miles from Berry Hill,
               and who has always honoured me with very distinguishing marks of regard, is going, in
               a short time, to Bristol, and has proposed to Mr. Villars to take me with her, for
               the recovery of my health. He seemed very much distressed whether to consent or
               refuse; but I, without any hesitation, warmly opposed the scheme, protesting my
               health could no where be better than in this pure air. He had the goodness to thank
               me for this readiness to stay with him: but he is all goodness! Oh that it were in my
               power to be, indeed, what in the kindness of his heart he has called me, the comfort
               of his age, and solace of his infir mities! </p>
            <p> Never do I wish to be again separated from him. If here I am grave, elsewhere I
               should be <pb n="80"/> unhappy. In his presence, with a very little ex ertion, all
               the chearfulness of my disposition seems ready to return; the benevolence of his
               counte nance reanimates, the harmony of his temper com poses, the purity of his
               character edifies me! I owe to him every thing; and, far from finding my debt of
               gratitude a weight, the first pride, first pleasure of my life is the recollection of
               the obligations conferred upon me by a goodness so unequalled. </p>
            <p> Once, indeed, I thought there existed another,—who, when <hi>time had wintered o'er
                  his locks,</hi> would have shone forth among his fellow-crea tures, with the same
               brightness of worth which dignifies my honoured Mr. Villars; a brightness, how
               superior in value to that which results from mere quickness of parts, wit, or
               imagination! a brightness, which, not contented with merely diffusing smiles, and
               gaining admiration from the sallies of the spirits, reflects a real and a glorious
               lustre upon all mankind! Oh how great was my error! how ill did I judge! how cruelly
               have I been deceived! </p>
            <p> I will not go to Bristol, though Mrs. Selwyn is very urgent with me;—but I desire
               not to see any more of the world; the few months I have already passed in it, have
               sufficed to give me a dis gust even to its name. </p>
            <p> I hope, too, I shall see Lord Orville no more; accustomed, from my first knowledge
               of him, to regard him as a <hi>being superior to his race,</hi> his pre sence,
               perhaps, might banish my resentment, and I might forget his ill conduct,—for oh,
               Maria!—I should not know how to see <hi>Lord Orville</hi> —and to think of
               displeasure! </p>
            <p> As a sister I loved him,—I could have entrust ed him with every thought of my heart,
               had he <pb n="81"/> deigned to wish my confidence; so steady did I think his honour,
               so <hi>feminine</hi> his delicacy, and so amiable his nature! I have a thousand times
               ima gined that the whole study of his life, and whole purport of his reflections,
               tended solely to the good and happiness of others:—but I will talk,—write,—think of
               him no more! </p>

            <p> YOU complain of my silence, my dear Miss Mirvan,—but what have I to write? Narrative
               does not offer, nor does a lively imagination sup ply the deficiency. I have,
               however, at present, sufficient matter for a letter, in relating a conver sation I
               had yesterday with Mr. Villars. </p>
            <p> Our breakfast had been the most chearful we have had since my return hither; and,
               when it was over, he did not, as usual, retire to his study, but continued to
               converse with me while I work ed. We might, probably, have passed all the morning
               thus sociably, but for the entrance of a farmer, who came to solicit advice
               concerning some domestic affairs. They withdrew together into the study. </p>
            <p> The moment I was alone, my spirits failed me; the exertion with which I had
               supported them, had fatigued my mind: I flung away my work, <pb n="82"/> and, leaning
               my arms on the table, gave way to a train of disagreeable reflections, which, burst
               ing from the restraint that had smothered them, filled me with unusual sadness. </p>
            <p> This was my situation, when, looking towards the door, which was open, I perceived
               Mr. Vil lars, who was earnestly regarding me, <q rend="inline"> "Is Far mer Smith
                  gone, Sir?" </q> cried I, hastily rising, and snatching up my work. </p>

               <q rend="inline">"Don't let me disturb you,"</q> said he, grave ly; <q rend="inline"
                  >"I will go again to my study."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Will you, Sir?—I was in hopes you were coming to sit here." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"In hopes!—and why, Evelina, should you hope it?"</q>
            </p>
            <p> This question was so unexpected, that I knew not how to answer it; but, as I saw he
               was mov ing away, I followed, and begged him to re turn. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No, my dear, no,"</q> said he, with a forced smile, <q
                  rend="inline">"I only interrupt your meditations."</q>
            </p>
            <p> Again I knew not what to say; and while I he sitated, he retired. My heart was with
               him, but I had not the courage to follow. The idea of an explanation, brought on in
               so seri ous a manner, frightened me. I recollected the suspicion <hi>you</hi> had
               drawn from my uneasiness, and I feared that he might make a similar interpre tation. </p>
            <p> Solitary and thoughtful, I passed the rest of the morning in my own room. At dinner
               I a gain attempted to be chearful; but Mr. Villars himself was grave, and I had not
               sufficient spirits to support a conversation merely by my own efforts. As soon as
               dinner was over, he took a book, and I walked to the window. I believe I remained
               near an hour in this situation. All <pb n="83"/> my thoughts were directed to
               considering how I might dispel the doubts which I apprehended Mr. Villars had formed,
               without acknowledging a circumstance which I had suffered so much pain merely to
               conceal. But while I was thus planning for the future, I forgot the present; and so
               in tent was I upon the subject which occupied me, that the strange appearance of my
               unusual in activity, and extreme thoughtfulness, never oc curred to me. But when, at
               last, I recollected myself, and turned round, I saw that Mr. Vil lars had parted with
               his book, and was wholly engrossed in attending to me. I started from my reverie,
               and, hardly knowing what I said, asked if he had been reading? </p>
            <p> He paused a moment, and then said, <q rend="inline"> "Yes, my child;—a book that
                  both afflicts and perplex es me!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> He means <hi>me,</hi> thought I; and therefore I made no answer. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"What if we read it together?"</q> continu ed he, <q rend="inline">
                  "will you assist me to clear its obscur ity?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I knew not what to say, but I sighed, invo luntarily, from the bottom of my heart.
               He rose, and, approaching me, said, with emotion, <q rend="inline"> "My child, I can
                  no longer be a silent wit ness of thy sorrow,—is not <hi>thy</hi> sorrow
                     <hi>my</hi> sor row?—and ought I to be a stranger to the cause, when I so
                  deeply sympathise in the ef fect?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Cause, Sir,"</q> cried I, greatly alarmed,— <q rend="inline">"what
                  cause?—I don't know, I can't tell,—I—"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Fear not,"</q> said he, kindly, <q rend="inline"> "to unbo som
                  thyself to me, my dearest Evelina; open to me thy whole heart,—it can have no
                  feelings <pb n="84"/> for which I will not make allowance. Tell me, therefore,
                  what it is that thus afflicts us both, and who knows but I may suggest some means
                  of relief?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"You are too, too good,"</q> cried I, greatly embarrassed; <q
                  rend="inline">"but indeed I know not what you mean."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I see,"</q> said he, <q rend="inline"> "it is painful to you to
                  speak: suppose, then, I endeavour to save you by guessing?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Impossible! impossible!"</q> cried I, eagerly, <q rend="inline">
                  "no one living could ever guess, ever sup pose—" </q> I stopped abruptly; for I
               then recol lected, I was acknowledging something <hi>was</hi> to be guessed: however,
               he noticed not my mis take. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"At least let me try,"</q> answered he, mild ly; <q rend="inline">
                  "perhaps I may be a better diviner than you imagine: if I guess every thing that
                  is pro bable, surely I must approach near the real rea son. Be honest, then, my
                  love, and speak without reserve,—does not the country, after so much gaiety, so
                  much variety, does it not appear insipid and tiresome?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "No, indeed!" I love it more than ever, and more than ever do I
                  wish I had never, never quitted it!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Oh, my child! that I had not permitted the journey! My judgment
                  always opposed it, but my resolution was not proof against persua sion." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I blush, indeed,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline"> "to recollect my
                  earnestness;—but I have been my own pu nisher!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"It is too late, now,"</q> answered he, <q rend="inline"> "to re
                  flect upon this subject; let us endeavour to a void repentance for the time to
                  come, and we <pb n="85"/> shall not have erred without reaping some in struction."
               </q> Then seating himself, and making me sit by him, he continued: <q rend="inline">
                  "I must now guess again; perhaps you regret the loss of those friends you knew in
                  town,—perhaps you miss their so ciety, and fear you may see them no more?—perhaps
                  Lord Orville—" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I could not keep my seat, but rising hastily, said, <q rend="inline"> "Dear Sir, ask
                  me nothing more!—for I have nothing to own,—nothing to say;—my gravity has been
                  merely accidental, and I can give no reason for it at all. Shall I fetch you ano
                  ther book?—or will you have this again?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> For some minutes he was totally silent, and I pretended to employ myself in looking
               for a book. At last, with a deep sigh, <q rend="inline">"I see,"</q> said he, <q
                  rend="inline"> "I see, but too plainly, that though Evelina is returned,—I have
                  lost my child!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No, Sir, no,"</q> cried I, inexpressibly shock ed, <q rend="inline"
                  > "she is more yours than ever! Without you, the world would be a desart to her,
                  and life a burthen;—forgive her then, and—if you can,—condescend to be, once more,
                  the confident of all her thoughts." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "How highly I value, how greatly I wish for her confidence," </q>
               returned he, <q rend="inline"> "she cannot but know;—yet to extort, to tear it from
                  her,—my justice, my affection, both revolt at the idea. I am sorry that I was so
                  earnest with you;—leave me, my dear, leave me and compose yourself;—we will meet
                  again at tea." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Do you then refuse to hear me?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "No, but I abhor to compel you. I have long seen that your mind has
                  been ill at ease, and mine has largely partaken of your concern: I forbore to
                  question you, for I hoped that time, and absence from whatever excited your uneasi
                  ness, <pb n="86"/> might best operate in silence: but, alas! your affliction seems
                  only to augment,—your health declines,—your look alters.—Oh, Evelina, my aged
                  heart bleeds to see the change!—bleeds to behold the darling it had cherished, the
                  prop it had reared for its support, when bowed down by years and infirmities,
                  sinking itself under the pressure of internal grief!—struggling to hide, what it
                  should seek to participate!—But go, my dear, go to your own room,—we both want com
                  posure, and we will talk of this matter some other time." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Oh Sir,"</q> cried I, penetrated to the soul, <q rend="inline">
                  "bid me not leave you!—think me not so lost to feeling, to gratitude—" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Not a word of that,"</q> interrupted he; <q rend="inline"> "it
                  pains me you should think upon that subject; pains me you should ever remember
                  that you have not a natural, an hereditary right to every thing within my power. I
                  meant not to affect you thus,—I hoped to have soothed you!—but my anxiety betrayed
                  me to an urgency that has distressed you. Comfort yourself, my love, and doubt not
                  but that time will stand your friend, and all will end well." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I burst into tears: with difficulty had I so long restrained them; for my heart,
               while it glowed with tenderness and gratitude, was oppressed with a sense of its own
               unworthiness. <q rend="inline">"You are all, all goodness!"</q> cried I, in a voice
               scarce audi ble, <q rend="inline"> "little as I deserve,—unable as I am to re pay,
                  such kindness,—yet my whole soul feels,—thanks you for it!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"My dearest child,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "I cannot bear
                  to see thy tears;—for <hi>my</hi> sake dry them,—such a sight is too much for me:
                  think of that, Evelina, and take comfort, I charge thee!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Say then,"</q> cried I, kneeling at his feet, <q rend="inline">
                  "say then that you forgive me! that you par don my reserve,—that you will again
                  suffer me to tell you my most secret thoughts, and rely up on my promise never
                  more to forfeit your con fidence!—my father!—my protector!—my ever honoured,—ever
                  loved,—my best and only friend!—say you forgive your Evelina, and she will study
                  better to deserve your goodness!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> He raised, he embraced me; he called me his sole joy, his only earthly hope, and the
               child of his bosom! He folded me to his heart, and, while I wept from the fulness of
               mine, with words of sweetest kindness and consolation, he soothed and tranquilised
               me. </p>
            <p> Dear to my remembrance will ever be that moment, when, banishing the reserve I had
               so foolishly planned, and so painfully supported, I was restored to the confidence of
               the best of men! </p>
            <p> When, at length, we were again quietly and composedly seated by each other, and Mr.
               Vil lars waited for the explanation I had begged him to hear, I found myself
               extremely embarrassed how to introduce the subject which must lead to it. He saw my
               distress, and, with a kind of benevolent pleasantry, asked me if I would let him
                  <hi>guess</hi> any more? I assented in silence. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Shall I, then, go back to where I left off?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"If—if you please;—I believe so,—"</q> said I, stammering. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Well then, my love, I think, I was speak ing of the regret it was
                  natural you should feel upon quitting those from whom you had received civility
                  and kindness, with so little certainty of ever seeing them again, or being able to
                  return <pb n="88"/> their good offices? These are circumstances that afford but
                  melancholy reflections to young minds; and the affectionate disposition of my
                  Evelina, open to all social feelings, must be hurt more than usual by such
                  considerations.—You are silent, my dear?—Shall I name those whom I think most
                  worthy the regret I speak of? We shall then see if our opinions coincide." </q>
            </p>
            <p>Still I said nothing, and he continued.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "In your London journal, nobody appears in a more amiable, a more

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I knew what you would say,"</q> cried I, hast ily, <q rend="inline"
                  > "and I have long feared where your suspi cions would fall; but indeed, Sir, you

            </p>
            <p> I stopped; for Mr. Villars looked at me with such infinite surprise, that my own
               warmth made me blush. <q rend="inline"> "You <hi>hate</hi> Lord Orville!" </q> re
               peated he. </p>
            <p> I could make no answer, but took from my pocket-book the letter, and, giving it to
               him, <q rend="inline">"See, Sir,"</q> said I, <q rend="inline"> "how differently the
                  same man can <hi>talk,</hi> and <hi>write!</hi> " </q>
            </p>
            <p> He read it three times ere he spoke; and then said, <q rend="inline"> "I am so much
                  astonished, that I know not what I read. When had you this let ter?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I told him. Again he read it; and, after con sidering its contents some time, said,
                  <q rend="inline"> "I can form but one conjecture concerning this most ex
                  traordinary performance: he must certainly have been intoxicated when he wrote
                  it." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Lord Orville intoxicated!"</q> repeated I; <q rend="inline"> "once
                  I thought him a stranger to all intempe rance, <pb n="89"/> —but it is very
                  possible, for I can believe any thing now." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "That a man who had behaved with so strict a regard to delicacy,"
               </q> continued Mr. Villars, <q rend="inline"> "and who, as far as occasion had
                  allowed, manifested sentiments the most honourable, should thus insolently, thus
                  wantonly, insult a modest young woman, in his perfect senses, I cannot think
                  possible. But, my dear, you should have inclosed this letter in an empty cover,
                  and have returned it to him again: such a resentment would at once have become
                     <hi>your</hi> character, and have given him an opportunity, in some mea sure,
                  of clearing his own. He could not well have read this letter the next morning,
                  without being sensible of the impropriety of having writ ten it." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Oh Maria! why had not I this thought? I might then have received some apology; the
               mortification would then have been <hi>his,</hi> not <hi>mine.</hi> It is true, he
               could not have reinstated himself so highly in my opinion as I had once ignorantly
               placed him, since the conviction of such intem perance would have levelled him with
               the rest of his imperfect race; yet, my humbled pride might have been consoled by his
               acknowledg ments. </p>
            <p> But why should I allow myself to be humbled by a man who can suffer his reason to be
               thus ab jectly debased, when I am exalted by one who knows no vice, and scarcely a
               failing,—but by hearsay? To think of his kindness, and reflect upon his praises,
               might animate and comfort me even in the midst of affliction. <q rend="inline"> "Your

                  guileless yourself, how could you prepare against the duplicity of another? Your
                  disappointment has but been proportioned to your expectations, and you have
                  chiefly owed its severity to the in nocence which hid its approach." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I will bid these words dwell ever in my memo ry, and they shall chear, comfort, and

               foe of tranquility: however I may err in future, I will never be disingenu ous in
               acknowledging my errors. To you, and to Mr. Villars, I vow an unremitting confi
               dence. </p>
            <p> And yet, though I am more at ease, I am far from well: I have been some time writing
               this letter; but I hope I shall send you, soon, a more chearful one. </p>
            <p> Adieu, my sweet friend. I entreat you not to acquaint even your dear mother with
               this affair; Lord Orville is a favourite with her, and why should I publish that he
               deserves not that ho nour? </p>

            <p> YOU will be again surprised, my dear Maria, at seeing whence I date my letter: but I
               have been very ill, and Mr. Villars was so much alarmed, that he not only insisted
               upon my accompanying <pb n="91"/> Mrs. Selwyn hither, but earnestly desired she would
               hasten her intended journey. </p>
            <p> We travelled very slowly, and I did not find myself so much fatigued as I expected.
               We are situated upon a most delightful spot; the prospect is beautiful, the air pure,
               and the weather very favourable to invalids. I am already better, and I doubt not but
               I shall soon be well; as well, in regard to mere health, as I wish to be. </p>
            <p> I cannot express the reluctance with which I parted from my reverend Mr. Villars: it
               was not like that parting which, last April, preceded my journey to Howard Grove,
               when, all expectati on and hope, tho' I wept, I rejoiced, and though I sincerely
               grieved to leave him, I yet wished to be gone: the sorrow I now felt was unmixed with
               any livelier sensation; expectation was vanished, and hope I had none! All that I
               held most dear upon earth, I quitted, and that upon an errand to the success of which
               I was totally indifferent, the re-establishment of my health. Had it been to have
               seen my sweet Maria, or her dear mo ther, I should not have repined. </p>
            <p> Mrs. Selwyn is very kind and attentive to me. She is extremely clever; her
               understanding, in deed, may be called <hi>masculine;</hi> but, unfortu nately, her
               manners deserve the same epithet; for, in studying to acquire the knowledge of the
               other sex, she has lost all the softness of her own. In regard to myself, however, as
               I have neither courage nor inclination to argue with her, I have never been
               personally hurt at her want of gentle ness; a virtue which, nevertheless, seems so es
               sential a part of the female character, that I find myself more awkward, and less at
               ease, with a woman who wants it, than I do with a man. She is not a favourite with
               Mr. Villars, who has often <pb n="92"/> been disgusted at her unmerciful propensity
               to sa tire: but his anxiety that I should try the effect of the Bristol waters,
               overcame his dislike of committing me to her care. Mrs. Clinton is also here; so that
               I shall be as well attended as his ut most partiality could desire. </p>
            <p> I will continue to write to you, my dear Miss Mirvan, with as much constancy as if I
               had no other correspondent; tho', during my absence from Berry Hill, my letters may,
               perhaps, be shortened on account of the minuteness of the journal which I must write
               to my beloved Mr. Villars: but you, who know his expectations, and how many ties bind
               me to fulfil them, will, I am sure, rather excuse any omission to yourself, than any
               negligence to him. </p>

            <p> THE first fortnight that I passed here, was so quiet, so serene, that it gave me
               reason to expect a settled calm during my stay; but if I may now judge of the time to
               come, by the present state of my mind, the calm will be succeeded by a storm, of
               which I dread the violence! </p>
            <p> This morning, in my way to the pump-room, with Mrs. Selwyn, we were both very much
               in commoded by three gentlemen, who were saun tering by the side of the Avon,
               laughing and talking very loud, and lounging so disagreeably that we knew not how to
               pass them. They all three fixed their eyes very boldly upon me, al ternately <pb
                  n="93"/> looking under my hat, and whispering one another. Mrs. Selwyn assumed an
               air of un common sternness, and said, <q rend="inline"> "You will please, gentlemen,
                  either to proceed yourselves, or to suffer us." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Oh! Ma'am,"</q> cried one of them, <q rend="inline"> "we will
                  suffer <hi>you,</hi> with the greatest pleasure in life." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "You will suffer us <hi>both,</hi> " </q> answered she, <q
                  rend="inline"> "or I am much mistaken; you had better, therefore, make way
                  quietly, for I should be sor ry to give my servant the trouble of teaching you
                  better manners." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Her commanding air struck them, yet they all chose to laugh, and one of them wished
               the fellow would begin his lesson, that he might have the pleasure of rolling him
               into the Avon; while ano ther, advancing to me with a freedom that made me start,
               said, <q rend="inline"> "By my soul, I did not know you!—but I am sure I cannot be
                  mistaken;—had not I the honour of seeing you, once, at the Pantheon?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I then recollected the nobleman who, at that place, had so much embarrassed me. I
               courtsied without speaking. They all bowed, and making, though in a very easy manner,
               an apology to Mrs. Selwyn, they suffered us to pass on, but chose to accompany us. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"And where,"</q> continued this Lord, <q rend="inline"> "can you so
                  long have hid yourself? do you know I have been in search of you this age? I could
                  nei ther find you out, nor hear of you; not a crea ture could inform me what was
                  become of you. I cannot imagine where you could be immured. I went to two or three
                  public places every night, in hopes of meeting you. Pray did you leave town?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Yes, my Lord."</q>

               <q rend="inline"> "So early in the season!—what could possibly induce you to go
                  before the birth-day?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "I had nothing, my Lord, to do with the birth-day." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "By my soul, all the women who <hi>had,</hi> may rejoice you were
                  away. Have you been here any time?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Not above a fortnight, my Lord."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "A fortnight!—how unlucky that I did not meet you sooner! but I
                  have had a run of ill luck ever since I came. How long shall you stay?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Indeed, my Lord, I don't know."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Six weeks, I hope; for I shall wish the place at the devil when
                  you go." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Do you, then, flatter yourself, my Lord,"</q> said Mrs. Selwin, who
               had hitherto listened in si lent contempt, <q rend="inline"> "that you shall see such
                  a beauti ful spot as this when you visit the dominions of the devil?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Ha, ha, ha! Faith, my Lord,</q> "said one of his companions, who
               still walked with us, though the other had taken leave; <q rend="inline">"the lady is
                  rather hard upon you."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Not at all,"</q> answered Mrs. Selwyn; <q rend="inline"> "for as I
                  cannot doubt but his Lordship's rank and interest will secure him a place there,
                  it would be reflect ing on his understanding, to suppose he should not wish to
                  enlarge and beautify his dwelling." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Much as I was disgusted with this Lord, I must own Mrs. Selwyn's severity rather
               surprised me; but you, who have so often observed it, will not wonder she took so
               fair an opportun <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "As to <hi>places,</hi> " </q> returned he, totally unmov ed, <q
                  rend="inline"> "I am so indifferent to them, that the devil take me, if I care

            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"What, my Lord!"</q> cried Mrs. Selwyn, <q rend="inline"> "would you

            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "What do you do with yourself this even ing?" </q> said his

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Young ladies, my Lord,"</q> said Mrs. Selwyn, <q rend="inline">

            </p>
            <p>Good Heavens, Sir, what words for such a question!</p>

            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Has not your Lordship too much gallantry,"</q> cried Mrs. Selwyn,

            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "The devil a word can I speak for that wo man," </q> said he, in a

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Excuse me, my Lord!"</q> answered Mr. Coverley. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"When shall I see you again?"</q> continued his Lordship; <q
                  rend="inline">"do you go to the pump-room every morning?"</q>
            </p>

               <q rend="inline">"No, my Lord."</q>
            </p>
            <p> Just then we arrived at the pump-room, and an end was put to our conversation, if it
               is not an abuse of words to give such a term to a string of rude questions and free
               compliments. </p>
            <p> He had not opportunity to say much more to me, as Mrs. Selwyn joined a large party,
               and I walked home between two ladies. He had how ever, the curiosity to see us to the
               door. </p>
            <p> Mrs. Selwyn was very eager to know how I had made acquaintance with this nobleman,
               whose manners so evidently announced the character of a confirmed libertine: I could
               give her very lit tle satisfaction, as I was ignorant even of his name. But, in the
               afternoon, Mr. Ridgeway, the apo thecary, gave us very ample information. </p>
            <p> As his person was easily described, for he is remarkably tall, Mr. Ridgeway told us
               he was Lord Merton, a nobleman but lately come to his title, though he had already
               dissipated more than half his fortune: a professed admirer of beauty, but a man of
               most licentious character: that among men, his companions consisted chiefly of
               gamblers and jockies, and among women, he was rarely admitted. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Well, Miss Anville,"</q> said Mrs. Selwyn, <q rend="inline"> "I am
                  glad I was not more civil to him. You may depend upon <hi>me</hi> for keeping him
                  at a dis tance." </q>
            </p>

                  it has been some time in agitation, but the friends of the Lady have ob liged her

                  match, now that she is near being at her own disposal, is tolerably quiet. She is
                  very pretty, and will have a large fortune. We expect her at the Wells every day."

            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"What is her name?"</q> said Mrs. Selwyn. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Larpent,"</q> answered he, <q rend="inline">"Lady Louisa Larpent,

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Lord Orville!"</q> repeated I, all amazement. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> Yes, Ma'am; his Lordship is coming with her. I have had certain
                  information. They are to be at the honourable Mrs. Beaumont's. She is a re lation
                  of my Lord's, and has a very fine house upon Clifton Hill." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Lordship is coming with her!</hi> —Good God, what an emotion did those words
               give me! How strange, my dear Sir, that, just at this time, he should visit Bristol!
               It will be impossible for me to avoid seeing him, as Mrs. Selwyn is very well
               acquainted with Mrs. Beaumont. Indeed, I have had an escape in not being under the
               same roof with him, for Mrs. Beaumont invited us to her house immediately upon our
               arrival; but the in conveniency of being so distant from the pump room made Mrs.
               Selwyn decline her civility. </p>
            <p> Oh that the first meeting was over!—or that I could quit Bristol without seeing
               him!—inexpres sibly do I dread an interview: should the same impertinent freedom be
               expressed by his looks, which dictated his cruel letter, I shall not know how to
               endure either him or myself. Had I but returned it, I should be easier, because my
               senti ments of it would then be known to him; but <pb n="99"/> now, he can only
               gather them from my behavi our, and I tremble lest he should mistake my in dignation
               for confusion!—lest he should miscon strue my reserve into embarrassment!—for how, my
               dearest Sir, how shall I be able totally to di vest myself of the respect with which
               I have been used to think of him?—the pleasure with which I have been used to see
               him? </p>
            <p> Surely he, as well as I, must think of the letter at the moment of our meeting, and
               he will, pro bably, mean to gather my thoughts of it from my looks;—oh that they
               could but convey to him my real detestation of impertinence and vanity! then would he
               see how much he had mis taken my disposition when he imagined them my due. </p>
            <p> There was a time, when the very idea that such a man as Lord Merton would ever be
               con nected with Lord Orville, would have both surprised and shocked me, and even yet
               I am pleased to hear of his repugnance to the mar riage. </p>
            <p> But how strange, that a man of so abandoned a character should be the choice of a
               sister of Lord Orville! and how strange that, almost at the moment of the union, he
               should be so im portunate in gallantry to another woman! What a world is this we live
               in! how corrupt, how de generate! well might I be contented to see no more of it! If
               I find that the <hi>eyes</hi> of Lord Orville agree with his <hi>pen,</hi> —I shall
               then think, that of all mankind, the only virtuous individual resides at Berry Hill!

            <head>LETTER XVII.</head>
            <head type="sub">Evelina in continuation.</head>
            <opener>
               <dateline> Bristol Hotwells, <date>Sept. 16.</date>
               </dateline>
            </opener>
            <p> OH Sir, Lord Orville is still himself! still, what from the moment I beheld, I
               believed him to be, all that was amiable in man! and your hap py Evelina, restored at
               once to spirits and tran quility, is no longer sunk in her own opinion, nor
               discontented with the world;—no longer, with dejected eyes, sees the prospect of
               passing her fu ture days in sadness, doubt, and suspicion!—with revived courage she
               now looks forward, and ex pects to meet with goodness, even among man kind;—though
               still she feels, as strongly as ever, the folly of hoping, in any <hi>second</hi>
               instance, to meet with <hi>perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p> Your conjecture was certainly right; Lord Orville, when he wrote that letter, could
               not be in his senses. Oh that intemperance should have power to degrade so low, a man
               so noble! </p>
            <p> This morning I accompanied Mrs. Selwyn to Clifton Hill, where, beautifully situated,
               is the house of Mrs. Beaumont. Most uncomfortable were my feelings during our walk,
               which was very slow, for the agitation of my mind made me more than usually sensible
               how weak I still conti nue. As we entered the house, I summoned all my resolution to
               my aid, determined rather to die than give Lord Orville reason to attribute my
               weakness to a wrong cause. I was happily reliev ed from my perturbation, when I saw
               Mrs. Beau mont was alone. We sat with her for, I believe, <pb n="101"/> an hour
               without interruption, and then we saw a phaeton drive up to the gate, and a lady and
               gen tleman alight from it. </p>
            <p> They entered the parlour with the ease of peo ple who were at home. The gentleman, I
               soon saw, was Lord Merton; he came shuffling into the room with his boots on, and his
               whip in his hand; and, having made something like a bow to Mrs. Beaumont, he turned
               towards me. His sur prise was very evident, but he took no manner of notice of me. He
               waited, I believe, to discover, first, what chance had brought me to that house,
               where he did not look much rejoiced at meeting me. He seated himself very quietly at
               the win dow, without speaking to any body. </p>
            <p> Mean time, the lady, who seemed very young, hobbling rather than walking into the
               room, made a passing courtsie to Mrs. Beaumont, saying, <q rend="inline">"How are
                  you, Ma'am?"</q> and then, without noticing any body else, with an air of languor,
               she flung herself upon a sofa, protesting, in a most affected voice, and speaking so
               softly she could hardly be heard, that she was fatigued to death. <q rend="inline">
                  "Really, Ma'am, the roads are so monstrous dusty,—you can't imagine how
                  troublesome the dust is to one's eyes!—and the sun, too, is mon strous
                  disagreeable!—I dare say I shall be so tanned I sha'n't be fit to be seen this
                  age. Indeed, my Lord, I won't go out with you any more, for you don't care where
                  you take one." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Upon my honour,"</q> said Lord Merton, <q rend="inline"> "I took
                  you the pleasantest ride in England; the fault was in the sun not me." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Your Lordship is in the right,"</q> said Mrs. Selwyn, <q
                  rend="inline"> "to transfer the fault to the <hi>sun,</hi> because it has so many
                  excellencies to counterbalance par tial <pb n="102"/> inconveniencies, that a
                     <hi>little</hi> blame will not in jure <hi>that</hi> in our estimation." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Lord Merton looked by no means delighted at this attack; which I believe she would
               not so readily have made, but to revenge his neglect of us. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Did you meet your brother, Lady Louisa?"</q> said Mrs. Beaumont. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "No, Ma'am. Is he rode out this morn ing?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I then found, what I had before suspected, that this Lady was Lord Orville's sister:
               how strange, that such near relations should be so different to each other! There is,
               indeed, some resemblance in their features, but in their manners, not the least. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Yes,"</q> answered Mrs. Beaumont, <q rend="inline">"and I believe
                  he wished to see you."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"My Lord drove so monstrous fast,"</q> said Lady Louisa, <q
                  rend="inline"> "that perhaps we passed him. He frighted me out of my senses; I
                  declare my head is quite giddy. Do you know, Ma'am, we have done nothing but
                  quarrel all the morning?—You can't think how I've scolded;—have not I, my Lord?"
               </q> and she smiled expressively at Lord Merton. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"You have been, as you always are,"</q> said he, twisting his whip
               with his fingers, <q rend="inline">"all sweetness."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O fie, my Lord,"</q> cried she, <q rend="inline"> "I know you don't
                  think so; I know you think me very ill natured;—don't you, my Lord?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "No, upon my honour;—how can your Ladyship ask such a question?
                  Pray how goes time? my watch stands." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"It is almost three,"</q> answered Mrs. Beau mont. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Lord, Ma'am, you frighten me!"</q> cried Lady Louisa; and then
               turning to Lord Merton, <q rend="inline"> "why now, you wicked creature, you, did not
                  you tell me it was but one?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> Mrs. Selwyn then rose to take leave; but Mrs. Beaumont asked if she would look at
               the shrubbery. <q rend="inline">"I should like it much,"</q> answered she, <q
                  rend="inline">"but that I fear to fatigue Miss Anville."</q>
            </p>
            <p> Lady Louisa then, raising her head from her hand, on which it had leant, turned
               round to look at me, and, having fully satisfied her curiosity, without any regard to
               the confusion it gave me, turned about, and, again leaning on her hand, took no
               further notice of me. </p>
            <p> I declared myself very able to walk, and begged that I might accompany them. <q
                  rend="inline"> "What say <hi>you,</hi> Lady Louisa," </q> cried Mrs. Beaumont, <q
                  rend="inline">"to a strole in the garden?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Me, Ma'am!—I declare I can't stir a step; the heat is so
                  excessive, it would kill me. I'm half dead with it already; besides, I shall have
                  no time to dress. Will any body be here to day, Ma'am?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "I believe not, unless Lord Merton will fa vour us with his
                  company." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"With great pleasure, Madam."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Well, I declare you don't deserve to be ask ed," </q> cried Lady
               Louisa, <q rend="inline"> "you wicked creature, you!—I <hi>must</hi> tell you one
                  thing, Ma'am,—you can't think how abominable he was! do you know we met Mr. Lovel
                  in his new phaeton, and my Lord was so cruel as to drive against it?—we real ly
                  flew. I declare I could not breathe. Upon my word, my Lord, I'll never trust
                  myself with you again,—I won't indeed!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> We then went into the garden, leaving them to discuss the point at their leisure. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104"/> Do you remember a <hi> pretty but affected young la dy </hi> I
               mentioned to have seen, in Lord Orville's party, at the Pantheon? How little did I
               then imagine her to be his sister! yet Lady Louisa Lar pent is the very person. I can
               now account for the piqued manner of her speaking to Lord Mer ton that evening, and I
               can now account for the air of displeasure with which Lord Orville mark ed the undue
               attention of his future brother-in-law to me. </p>
            <p> We had not walked long, ere, at a distance, I perceived Lord Orville, who seemed
               just dis mounted from his horse, enter the garden, All my perturbation returned at
               the sight of him!—yet I endeavoured to repress every feel ing but resentment. As he
               approached us, he bowed to the whole party; but I turned away my head, to avoid
               taking any share in his civi lity. Addressing himself immediately to Mrs. Beaumont,
               he was beginning to enquire after his sister, but upon seeing my face, he sudden ly
               exclaimed <q rend="inline">"Miss Anville!—"</q> and then he advanced, and made his
               compliments to me,—not with an air of vanity or impertinence, nor yet with a look of
               consciousness or shame,—but with a countenance open, manly, and charm ing!—with a
               smile that indicated pleasure, and eyes that sparkled with delight! on <hi>my</hi>
               side was all the consciousness, for by him, I really believe, the letter was, at that
               moment, entirely forgot ten. </p>
            <p> With what politeness did he address me! with what sweetness did he look at me! the
               very tone of his voice seemed flattering! he congra tulated himself upon his good
               fortune in meet ing with me,—hoped I should spend some time at Bristol, and enquired,
               even with anxiety en quired, <pb n="105"/> if my health was the cause of my journey,
               in which case his satisfaction would be converted into apprehension. </p>
            <p> Yet, struck as I was with his manner, and charmed to find him such as he was wont to
               be, imagine not, my dear Sir, that I forgot the resentment I owe him, or the cause he
               has given me of displeasure; no, my behaviour was such as, I hope, had you seen, you
               would not have disapproved: I was grave and distant, I scarce looked at him when he
               spoke, or answered him when he was silent. </p>
            <p> As he must certainly observe this alteration in my conduct, I think it could not
               fail making him both recollect and repent the provocation he had so causelessly given
               me: for surely he was not so wholly lost to reason, as to be now ignorant he had ever
               offended me. </p>
            <p> The moment that, without absolute rudeness, I was able, I turned entirely from him,
               and asked Mrs. Selwyn if we should not be late home. How Lord Orville looked I know
               not, for I avoided meeting his eyes, but he did not speak another word as we
               proceeded to the garden-gate. Indeed I believe my abruptness surprised him, for he
               did not seem to expect I had so much spirit. And, to own the truth, convinced as I
               was of the propriety, nay, ne cessity of shewing my displeasure, I yet almost hated
               myself for receiving his politeness so un graciously. </p>
            <p> When we were taking leave, my eyes accident ally meeting his, I could not but
               observe that his gravity equalled my own, for it had entirely tak en place of the
               smiles and good-humour with which he had met me. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106"/>
               <q rend="inline">"I am afraid this young Lady,"</q> said Mrs. Beaumont, <q
                  rend="inline"> "is too weak for another long walk till she is again rested." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"If the Ladies will trust to my driving,"</q> said Lord Orville, <q
                  rend="inline"> "and are not afraid of a phaeton, mine shall be ready in a moment."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"You are very good, my Lord,"</q> said Mrs. Selwyn, <q rend="inline"
                  > "but my will is yet unsigned, and I don't chuse to venture in a phaeton with a
                  young man while that is the case." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O,"</q> cried Mrs. Beaumont, <q rend="inline"> "you need not be
                  afraid of my Lord Orville, for he is remark ably careful." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Well, Miss Anville,"</q> answered she, <q rend="inline">"what say
                  you?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Indeed,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline">"I had much rather
                  walk.—"</q> But then, looking at Lord Orville, I perceived in his face a surprise
               so serious at my abrupt refusal, that I could not forbear adding, <q rend="inline">
                  "for I should be sorry to occasion so much trou ble." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Lord Orville brightening at these words, came forward, and pressed his offer in a
               manner not to be denied;—so the phaeton was ordered! And in deed, my dear Sir,—I know
               not how it was,—but, from that moment, my coldness and reserve insensibly wore away!
               You must not be angry;—it was my intention, nay, my endeavour, to sup port them with
               firmness; but, when I formed the plan, I thought only of the letter,—not of Lord
               Orville;—and how is it possible for resentment to subsist without provocation? yet,
               believe me, my dearest Sir, had he sustained the part he began to act when he wrote
               the ever-to-be regretted letter, your Evelina would not have forfeited her title to
               your esteem, by contentedly submitting to be treat ed with indignity. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107"/> We continued in the garden till the phaeton was ready. When we parted
               from Mrs. Beau mont, she repeated her invitation to Mrs. Selwyn to accept an
               apartment in her house, but the same reasons made it be again declined. </p>
            <p> Lord Orville drove very slow, and so cautious ly, that, notwithstanding the height
               of the phae ton, fear would have been ridiculous. I support ed no part in the
               conversation, but Mrs. Selwyn extremely well supplied the place of two. Lord Orville
               himself did not speak much, but the ex cellent sense and refined good-breeding which
               ac company every word he utters, give a <hi>zest</hi> to whatever he says. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I suppose, my Lord,"</q> said Mrs. Selwyn, <q rend="inline"> "when
                  we stopped at our lodgings, you would have been extremely confused had we met any
                  gentlemen who have the honour of knowing you." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"If I had,"</q> answered he, gallantly, <q rend="inline"> "it would
                  have been from mere compassion at their envy." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No, my Lord,"</q> answered she, <q rend="inline"> "it would have
                  been from mere shame, that, in an age so daring, you alone should be such a coward
                  as to forbear to frighten women." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O,"</q> cried he, laughing, <q rend="inline"> "when a man is in a
                  fright for himself, the ladies cannot but be in security; for you have not had
                  half the appre hension for the safety of your persons, that I have for that of my
                  heart." </q>
            </p>
            <p> He then alighted, handed us out, took leave, and again mounting the phaeton, was out
               of sight in a minute. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Certainly,"</q> said Mrs. Selwyn, when he was gone, <q
                  rend="inline"> "there must have been some mistake in the birth of that young man;
                  he was, undoubt edly, <pb n="108"/> designed for the last age; for, if you ob
                  served, he is really polite." </q>
            </p>
            <p> And now, my dear Sir, do not you think, ac cording to the present situation of
               affairs, I may give up my resentment, without imprudence or impropriety? I hope you
               will not blame me. In deed, had you, like me, seen his respectful beha viour, you
               would have been convinced of the im practicability of supporting any further indigna
               tion. </p>

               <dateline> Bristol Hotwells, <date>Sept. 19th.</date>
               </dateline>
            </opener>
            <p> YESTERDAY morning, Mrs. Selwyn receiv ed a card from Mrs. Beaumont, to ask her to
               din ner to-day; and another, to the same purpose, came to me. The invitation was
               accepted, and we are but just arrived from Clifton-Hill. </p>
            <p> We found Mrs. Beaumont alone in the parlour. I will write you that lady's character,
               as I heard it from our satirical friend Mrs. Selwyn, and in her own words. <q
                  rend="inline"> "She is an absolute <hi>Court Calendar bigot;</hi> for, chancing
                  herself to be born of a no ble and ancient family, she thinks proper to be of
                  opinion, that <hi>birth</hi> and <hi>virtue</hi> are one and the same thing. She
                  has some good qualities, but they rather originate from pride than principle, as
                  she piques herself upon being too high born to be capable of an unworthy action,
                  and thinks it incumbent upon her to support the dignity of her ancestry.
                  Fortunately for the world in general, <pb n="109"/> she has taken it into her
                  head, that condescension is the most distinguishing virtue of high life; so that
                  the same pride of family which renders others imperious, is with her the motive of
                  affability. But her civility is too formal to be comfortable, and too mechanical
                  to be flattering. That she does <hi>me</hi> the honour of so much notice, is
                  merely owing to an accident which, I am sure, is very painful to her remembrance;
                  for it so happened that I once did her some service, in regard to an apartment, at
                  Southampton; and I have since been informed, that, at the time she accepted my
                  assistance, she thought I was a woman of quality: and I make no doubt but she was
                  miserable when she discovered me to be a mere country gentlewo man: however, her
                  nice notions of decorum have made her load me with favours ever since. But I am
                  not much flattered by her civilities, as I am convinced I owe them neither to
                  attachment nor gratitude, but solely to a desire of cancelling an obligation which
                  she cannot brook being under, to one whose name is no where to be found in the
                  Court Calendar." </q>
            </p>
            <p> You well know, my dear Sir, the delight this lady takes in giving way to her
               satirical humour. </p>
            <p> Mrs. Beaumont received us very graciously, though she somewhat distressed me by the
               ques tions she asked concerning my family,—such as, whether I was related to the
               Anvilles in the North?—Whether some of my name did not live in Lincolnshire? and many
               other enquiries, which much embarrassed me. </p>
            <p> The conversation, next, turned upon the in tended marriage in her family. She
               treated the subject with reserve, but it was evident she disap proved Lady Louisa's
               choice. She spoke in terms of the highest esteem of Lord Orville, calling <pb n="110"
               /> him, in Marmontel's words, <hi>Un jeune homme comme il y en a peu.</hi>
            </p>
            <p> I did not think this conversation very agreeably interrupted by the entrance of Mr.
               Lovel. Indeed I am heartily sorry he is now at the Hot-wells. He made his compliments
               with the most obsequi ous respect to Mrs. Beaumont, but took no sort of notice of any
               other person. </p>
            <p> In a few minutes Lady Louisa Larpent made her appearance. The same manners
               prevailed; for courtsying, <q rend="inline">"I hope you are well, Ma'am,"</q> to Mrs.
               Beaumont, she passed straight forward to her seat on the sofa, where leaning her head
               on her hand, she cast her languishing eyes round the room, with a vacant stare, as if
               determined, though she looked, not to see who was in it. </p>
            <p> Mr. Lovel, presently approaching her with re verence the most profound, hoped her
               Ladyship was not indisposed. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Mr. Lovel,"</q> cried she, raising her head, <q rend="inline"> "I
                  declare I did not see you: Have you been here long?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "By my <hi>watch,</hi> Madam," </q> said he, <q rend="inline">
                  "only five minutes,—but by your ladyship's absence, as many hours." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O! now I think of it,"</q> cried she, <q rend="inline"> "I am very
                  angry with you,—so go along, do, for I shan't speak to you all day." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Heaven forbid your La'ship's displeasure should last so long! in
                  such cruel circumstances, a day would seem an age. But in what have I been so
                  unfortunate as to offend?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "O, you half-killed me, the other morning, with terror! I have not
                  yet recovered from my fright. How could you be so cruel as to drive your phaeton
                  against my Lord Merton's?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111"/>
               <q rend="inline"> "'Pon honour, Ma'am, your La'ship does me wrong; it was all owing
                  to the horses,—there was no curbing them. I protest I suffered more than your
                  Ladyship from the terror of alarming you." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Just then entered Lord Merton; stalking up to Mrs. Beaumont, to whom alone he bowed;
               he hoped he had not made her wait; and then ad vancing to Lady Louisa, said, in a
               careless man ner, <q rend="inline">"How is your Ladyship this morning?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Not well at all,"</q> answered she; <q rend="inline"> "I have been
                  dying with the head-ach ever since I got up." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Indeed!"</q> cried he, with a countenance wholly unmoved, <q
                  rend="inline"> "I am very unhappy to hear it. But should not your Ladyship have
                  some advice?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I am quite sick of advice,"</q> answered she; <q rend="inline">
                  "Mr. Ridgeway has but just left me,—but he has done me no good. Nobody here knows
                  what is the matter with me, yet they all see how indif ferent I am." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Your Ladyship's constitution,"</q> said Mr. Lo vel, <q
                  rend="inline">"is infinitely delicate."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Indeed it is,"</q> cried she, in a low voice, <q rend="inline"> I
                  am <hi>nerve</hi> all over!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I am glad, however,"</q> said Lord Merton, <q rend="inline"> "that
                  you did not take the air this morning, for Coverly has been driving against me as
                  if he was mad: he has got two of the finest spirited horses I ever saw." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Pray, My Lord,"</q> cried she, <q rend="inline"> "why did not you
                  bring Mr. Coverly with you? he's a droll creature; I like him monstrously." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why, he promised to be here as soon as me. I suppose he'll come
                  before dinner's over." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112"/> In the midst of this trifling conversation, Lord Orville made his
               appearance. O how dif ferent was his address! how superior did he look, and move, to
               all about him! Having paid his respects to Mrs. Beaumont, and then to Mrs. Selwyn, he
               came up to me, and said, <q rend="inline"> "I hope Miss Anville has not suffered from
                  the fatigue of Monday morning!" </q> Then turning to Lady Louisa, who seemed
               rather surprised at his speak ing to me, he added, <q rend="inline"> "give me leave,
                  sister, to introduce Miss Anville to you." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Lady Louisa, half-rising, said, very coldly, that she should be glad of the honour
               of know ing me; and then, very abruptly turning to Lord Merton and Mr. Lovel,
               continued, in a half-whisper, her conversation. </p>
            <p> For my part, I had risen and courtsied, and now, feeling very foolish, I seated
               myself again; first I had blushed at the unexpected politeness of Lord Orville, and
               immediately afterwards, at the contemptuous failure of it in his sister. How can that
               young Lady see her brother so universally admired for his manners and deport ment,
               and yet be so unamiably opposite to him in her's! </p>
            <p> Lord Orville, I am sure, was hurt, and dis pleased: he bit his lips, and turning
               from her, addressed himself wholly to me, till we were summoned to dinner. Do you
               think I was not grateful for his attention? yes, indeed, and every angry idea I had
               entertained, was totally obli terated. </p>
            <p> As we were seating ourselves at the table, Mr. Coverly came into the room: he made a
               thousand apologies in a breath for being so late, but said he had been retarded by a
               little accident, for that he had overturned his phaeton, and broke <pb n="113"/> it
               all to pieces. Lady Louisa screamed at this intelligence, and looking at Lord Merton,
               declar ed she would never go into a phaeton again. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "never mind Jack Coverly, for
                  he does not know how to drive." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q> cried Mr. Coverly, <q rend="inline"> "I'll drive
                  against <hi>you</hi> for a thousand pounds." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Done!"</q> returned the other; <q rend="inline">"Name your day, and
                  we'll each chuse a judge."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"The sooner the better,"</q> cried Mr. Coverly; <q rend="inline"
                  >"to-morrow, if the carriage can be repaired."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"These enterprises,"</q> said Mrs. Selwyn, <q rend="inline"> "are
                  very proper for men of rank, since 'tis a million to one but both parties will be
                  incapacitated for any better employment." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"For Heaven's sake,"</q> cried Lady Louisa, changing colour, <q
                  rend="inline"> "don't talk so shockingly! Pray, my Lord, pray, Mr. Coverly, don't
                  alarm me in this manner." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Compose yourself, Lady Louisa,"</q> said Mrs. Beaumont, <q
                  rend="inline"> "the gentlemen will think bet ter of the scheme; they are neither
                  of them in earnest." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"The very mention of such a scheme,"</q> said Lady Louisa, taking
               out her salts, <q rend="inline"> "makes me tremble all over! Indeed, my Lord, you
                  have frightened me to death! I shan't eat a morsel of dinner." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Permit me,"</q> said Lord Orville, <q rend="inline"> "to pro pose
                  some other subject for the present, and we will discuss this matter some other
                  time." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Pray, Brother, excuse me; my Lord must give me his word to drop
                  this project,—for, I declare it has made me sick as death." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"To compromise the matter,"</q> said Lord Orville, <q rend="inline">
                  "suppose, if both parties are unwil ling to give up the bet, that, to make the
                  ladies <pb n="114"/> easy, we change its object to something less dan gerous?"
               </q>
            </p>
            <p> This proposal was so strongly seconded by all the party, that both Lord Merton, and
               Mr. Co verly, were obliged to comply with it: and it was then agreed that the affair
               should be finally set tled in the afternoon. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "I shall now be entirely out of conceit with phaetons again," </q>
               said Mrs. Selwyn, <q rend="inline"> "though Lord Orville had almost reconciled me to
                  them." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"My Lord Orville,</q> "cried the witty Mr. Coverly, <q rend="inline"
                  > "why, my Lord Orville is as careful,—egad, as careful as an old woman! Why, I'd
                  drive a one-horse cart against my Lord's phaeton for a hundred guineas!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> This sally occasioned much laughter; for Mr. Coverly, I find, is regarded as a man
               of infinite humour. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Perhaps, Sir,"</q> said Mrs. Selwyn, <q rend="inline"> "you have
                  not discovered the <hi>reason</hi> my Lord Orville is so careful?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why, no, Ma'am; I must own, I never heard any particular reason
                  for it." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why then, Sir, I'll tell you; and I believe you will confess it to
                  be <hi>very</hi> particular; his Lordship's friends are not yet tired of him."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p> Lord Orville laughed and bowed. Mr. Cover ly, a little confused, turned to Lord
               Merton, and said, <q rend="inline"> "No foul play, my Lord! I remember your Lordship
                  recommended me to the notice of this Lady the other morning, and, egad, I be lieve
                  you have been doing me the same office to-day." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Give you joy, Jack!"</q> cried Lord Merton, with a loud laugh. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115"/> After this, the conversation turned wholly up on eating, a subject
               which was discussed with the utmost delight; and, had I not known they were men of
               rank and fashion, I should have imagined that Lord Merton, Mr. Lovel, and Mr.
               Coverly, had all been professed cooks; for they displayed so much knowledge of sauces
               and made dishes, and of the various methods of dres sing the same things, that I am
               persuaded they must have given much time, and much study, to make themselves such
               adepts in this <hi>art.</hi> It would be very difficult to determine, whether they
               were most to be distinguished as <hi>gluttons</hi> or <hi>epicures;</hi> for they
               were, at once, dainty and vo racious, understood the right and the wrong of every
               dish, and alike emptied the one and the other. I should have been quite sick of their
               remarks, had I not been entertained by seeing that Lord Orville, who, I am sure, was
               equally disgusted, not only read my sentiments, but, by his countenance, communicated
               to me his own. </p>
            <p> When dinner was over, Mrs. Beaumont re commended the gentlemen to the care of Lord
               Orville, and then attended the ladies to the draw ing-room. </p>
            <p> The conversation, till tea-time, was extreme ly insipid; Mrs. Selwyn reserved
               herself for the gentlemen, Mrs. Beaumont was grave, and Lady Louisa languid. </p>
            <p> But, at tea, every body revived; we were joined by the gentlemen, and gaiety took
               place of dulness. </p>
            <p> Since I, as Mr. Lovel says, am <hi>Nobody</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. I. p. 37.</note> , I seated myself quietly on a
               window, and not very <pb n="116"/> near to any body: Lord Merton, Mr. Coverly, and
               Mr. Lovel, severally passed me without no tice, and surrounded the chair of Lady
               Louisa Larpent. I must own, I was rather piqued at the behaviour of Mr. Lovel, as he
               had formerly known me. It is true, I most sincerely despised his foppery, yet I
               should be grieved to meet with <hi>contempt</hi> from any body. But I was by no means
               sorry to find that Lord Merton was determined not to know me before Lady Louisa, as
               his ne glect relieved me from much embarrassment. As to Mr. Coverly, his attention or
               disregard were equally indifferent to me. Yet, altogether, I felt extremely
               uncomfortable, in finding myself considered in a light very inferior to the rest of
               the company. </p>
            <p> But, when Lord Orville appeared, the scene changed: he came up stairs last, and
               seeing me sit alone, not only spoke to me directly, but drew a chair next mine, and
               honoured me with his entire attention. </p>
            <p> He enquired very particularly after my health, and hoped I had already found benefit
               from the Bristol air. <q rend="inline">"How little did I imagine,"</q> ad ded he, <q
                  rend="inline"> "when I had last the pleasure of seeing you in town, that ill
                  health would, in so short a time, have brought you hither! I am ashamed of myself
                  for the satisfaction I feel at seeing you,—yet how can I help it!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> He then enquired after the Mirvan family, and spoke of Mrs. Mirvan in terms of the
               most just praise. <q rend="inline">"She is gentle and amiable,"</q> said he, <q
                  rend="inline">"a true feminine character."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Yes, indeed,"</q> answered I, <q rend="inline"> "and her sweet
                  daughter, to say every thing of her at once, is just the daughter such a mother
                  deserves." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117"/>
               <q rend="inline">"I am glad of it,"</q> said he, <q rend="inline"> "for both their
                  sakes, as such near relations must always reflect credit or disgrace on each
                  other." </q>
            </p>
            <p> After this, he began to speak of the beauties of Clifton; but, in a few moments, was
               interrupt ed by a call from the company, to discuss the af fair of the wager. Lord
               Merton and Mr. Co verley, though they had been discoursing upon the subject some
               time, could not fix upon any thing that satisfied them both. </p>
            <p> When they asked the assistance of Lord Orville, he proposed that every body present
               should vote something, and that the two gentlemen should draw lots which, from the
               several votes, should decide the bet. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"We must then begin with the ladies,"</q> said Lord Orville; and
               applied to Mrs. Selwyn. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"With all my heart,"</q> answered she, with her usual readiness; <q
                  rend="inline"> "and, since the gentlemen are not allowed to risk their
                     <hi>necks,</hi> suppose we decide the bet by their <hi>heads?</hi> " </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"By our heads?"</q> cried Mr. Coverly; Egad, <q rend="inline">"I
                  dont understand you."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "I will then explain myself more fully. As I doubt not but you are
                  both excellent classics, sup pose, for the good of your own memories, and the
                  entertainment and surprise of the company, the thousand pounds should fall to the
                  share of him who can repeat by heart the longest ode of Horace?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> Nobody could help laughing, the two gentle men applied to, excepted; who seemed,
               each of them, rather at a loss in what manner to receive this unexpected proposal. At
               length Mr. Lovel, bowing low, said, <q rend="inline">"Will your Lordship please to
                  begin?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Devil take me if I do!"</q> answered he, turn ing on his heel, and
               stalking to the window. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Come, Gentlemen,"</q> said Mrs. Selwyn, <q rend="inline"> "why do
                  you hesitate? I am sure you cannot be afraid of a weak <hi>woman?</hi> Besides, if
                  you should chance to be out, Mr. Lovel, I dare say, will have the goodness to
                  assist you." </q>
            </p>
            <p> The laugh, now, turned against Mr. Lovel, whose change of countenance manifested no
               great pleasure at the transition. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Me, Madam!"</q> said he, colouring, <q rend="inline">"no, "really I
                  must beg to be excused."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why so, Sir?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why so, Ma'am?—Why, really,—as to that,—'pon honour, Ma'am, you
                  are rather—a little severe;—for how is it possible for a man who is in the House,
                  to study the classics? I as sure you, Ma'am," </q> (with an affected shrug) <q
                  rend="inline"> "I find quite business enough for <hi>my</hi> poor head, in
                  studying politics." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "But, did you study politics at school, and at the university?"
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"At the university!"</q> repeated he with an embarrassed look; <q
                  rend="inline"> "why, as to that, Ma'am,—no, I can't say I did; but then, what with
                  riding,—and—and—and so forth,—really, one has not much time, even at the
                  university, for mere reading." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "But to be sure, Sir, you <hi>have</hi> read the classics?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "O dear, yes, Ma'am!—very often,—but not very—not very lately."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Which of the odes do you recommend to these gentlemen to begin
                  with?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Which of the odes!—Really, Ma'am, as to that, I have no very
                  particular choice,—for, <pb n="119"/> to own the truth, that Horace was never a
                  very great favourite with me." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"In truth I believe you!"</q> said Mrs. Selwyn, very drily. </p>
            <p> Lord Merton, again advancing into the circle, with a nod and a laugh, said, <q
                  rend="inline">"Give you joy, Lovel!"</q>
            </p>
            <p> Lord Orville next applied to Mrs. Beaumont for her vote. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"It would very agreeably remind me of past times,"</q> said she, <q
                  rend="inline"> when <hi>bowing</hi> was in fashion, if the bet was to depend upon
                  the best-made bow." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Egad, my Lord!"</q> cried Mr. Coverley, <q rend="inline"> "there I
                  should beat you hollow, for your Lord ship never bows at all. </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "And, pray Sir, do <hi>you?</hi>
               </q> said Mrs. Selwyn. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> Do <hi>I,</hi> Ma'am?" </q> cried he, <q rend="inline">"Why, only
                  see!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I protest,"</q> cried she, <q rend="inline"> "I should have taken
                     <hi>that</hi> for a <hi>shrug,</hi> if you had not told me 'twas a bow." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q> cried Mr. Coverly, <q rend="inline"> "let's prac
                  tise;" </q> and then, most ridiculously, they pranced about the room, making bows. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"We must now,"</q> said Lord Orville, turning to me, <q
                  rend="inline">"call upon Miss Anville."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O no, my Lord,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline">"indeed I have
                  nothing to propose."</q> He would not, however, be refused, but urged me so much
               to say <hi>something,</hi> that at last, not to make him wait any longer, I ventured
               to propose an extempore couplet upon some given subject. </p>
            <p> Mr. Coverley instantly made me a bow, or, ac cording to Mrs. Selwyn, a
                  <hi>shrug,</hi> crying, <q rend="inline"> "Thank you, Ma'am; egad, that's my
                     <hi>fort!</hi> —Why, my Lord, the Fates seem against you." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120"/> Lady Louisa was then applied to; and every body seemed eager to hear
               her opinion. <q rend="inline">"I don't know what to say, I declare,"</q> cried she,
               affected ly; <q rend="inline">"can't you pass me?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"By no means!"</q> said Lord Merton. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Is it possible your Ladyship can make so cruel a request?" </q>
               said Mr. Lovel. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Egad,"</q> cried Mr. Coverley, <q rend="inline"> "if your La dyship
                  does not help us in this dilemma, we shall be forced to return to our phaetons."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Oh,"</q> cried Lady Louisa, screaming, <q rend="inline"> "you
                  frightful creature, you, how can you be so abo minable!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I believe this trifling lasted near half an hour; when at length, every body being
               tired, it was given up, and she said she would consider against another time. </p>
            <p> Lord Orville now called upon Mr. Lovel, who, after about ten minutes deliberation,
               proposed, with a most important face, to determine the wager by who should draw the
               longest straw! </p>
            <p> I had much difficulty to refrain laughing at this unmeaning scheme; but saw, to my
               great sur prise, not the least change of countenance in any other person: and, since
               we came home, Mrs. Selwyn has informed me, that to <hi>draw straws</hi> is a fashion
               of betting by no means uncommon! Good God! my dear Sir, does it not seem as if money
               were of no value or service, since those who possess squander it away in a manner so
               infi nitely absurd! </p>
            <p> It now only remained for Lord Orville to speak; and the attention of the company
               shewed the ex pectations he had raised; yet, I believe, they by no means prevented
               his proposal from being heard with amazement; for it was no other, than that <pb
                  n="121"/> the money should be his due, who, according to the opinion of two
               judges, should bring the wor thiest object with whom to share it! </p>
            <p> They all stared, without speaking. Indeed, I believe every one, for a moment at
               least, expe rienced something like shame, from having either proposed or countenanced
               an extravagance so use less and frivolous. For my part, I was so much struck and
               affected by a rebuke so noble to these spendthrifts, that I felt my eyes filled with
               tears. </p>
            <p> The short silence, and momentary reflection into which the company was surprised,
               Mr. Co verly was the first to dispel, by saying, <q rend="inline"> "Egad, my Lord,
                  your Lordship has a most remarkable odd way of taking things." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Faith,"</q> said the incorrigible Lord Merton, <q rend="inline">
                  "if this scheme takes, I shall fix upon my Swiss to share with me; for I dont know
                  a worthier fel low breathing." </q>
            </p>
            <p> After a few more of these attempts at wit, the two gentlemen agreed that they would
               settle the affair the next morning. </p>
            <p> The conversation then took a different turn, but I did not give it sufficient
               attention to write any account of it. Not long after, Lord Orville resuming his seat
               next mine, said, <q rend="inline">"Why is Miss Anville so thoughtful?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I am sorry, my Lord,"</q> said I, <q rend="inline"> "to consi der
                  myself one among those who have so justly in curred your censure." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"My censure!—you amaze me!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Indeed, my Lord, you have made me quite ashamed of myself, for
                  having given my vote so foolishly; when an opportunity offered, had I but, like
                  your Lordship, had the sense to use it, of shewing some humanity." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122"/>
               <q rend="inline">"You treat this too seriously,"</q> said he, smil ing; <q
                  rend="inline"> "and I hardly know if you do not now mean a rebuke to <hi>me.</hi>
                  " </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"To you, my Lord!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Nay, which deserves it most, the one who adapts the conversation
                  to the company, or the one who chooses to be above it?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "O, my Lord, who else would do you so little justice?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I flatter myself,"</q> answered he, <q rend="inline"> "that in
                  fact, your opinion and mine, in this point, were the same, though you condescended
                  to comply with the humour of the company. It is for me, therefore, to apologize
                  for so unseasonable a gra vity, which but for a particular interest which I now
                  take in the affairs of Lord Merton, I should not have been so officious to
                  display." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Such a compliment as this could not fail to re concile me to myself; and with
               revived spirits, I entered into a conversation, which he supported with me till Mrs.
               Selwyn's carriage was announc ed, and we returned home. </p>
            <p> During our ride, Mrs. Selwyn very much sur prised me, by asking if I thought my
               health would now permit me to give up my morning walks to the pump-room, for the
               purpose of spend ing a week at Clifton? <q rend="inline"> "for this poor Mrs. Beau
                  mont," </q> added she, <q rend="inline"> "is so eager to have a dis charge in full
                  of her debt to me, that, out of mere compassion, I am induced to listen to her. Be
                  sides, she has always a house full of people, and though they are chiefly fools
                  and coxcombs, yet there is some pleasure in cutting them up." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I begged I might not, by any means, prevent her following her inclination, as my
               health was now very well established. And so, my dear Sir, to morrow <pb n="123"/> we
               are to be, actually, the guests of Mrs. Beaumont. </p>
            <p> I am not much delighted at this scheme; for, flattered as I am by the attention of
               Lord Orville, it is not very comfortable to be neglected by every body else. Besides,
               as I am sure I owe the parti cularity of his civility to a generous feeling for my
               situation, I cannot expect him to support it so long as a week. </p>
            <p> How often do I wish, since I am absent from you, that I was under the protection of
               Mrs. Mirvan! It is true, Mrs. Selwyn is very obliging, and, in every respect, treats
               me as an equal; but she is contented with behaving well herself, and does not, with a
               distinguishing politeness, raise and support me with others. Yet I mean not to blame
               her, for I know she is sincerely my friend; but the fact is, she is herself so much
               occupied in conversation, when in company, that she has neither leisure nor thought
               to attend to the silent. </p>
            <p> Well, I must take my chance! But I knew not, till now, how requisite are birth and
               fortune to the attainment of respect and civility. </p>

               <p> HERE I am, my dear Sir, under the same roof, and inmate of the same house, as
                  Lord Or ville! Indeed, if this were not the case, my situ ation <pb n="124"/>
                  would be very disagreeable, as you will easi ly believe, when I tell you the light
                  in which I am generally considered. </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"My dear,"</q> said Mrs. Selwyn, <q rend="inline"> "did you ever
                     before meet with that egregious fop, Lovel?" </q>
               </p>
               <p> I very readily satisfied her as to my acquain tance with him. </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"O then,"</q> said she, <q rend="inline"> "I am the less sur
                     prised at his ill-nature, since he has already inju red you." </q>
               </p>
               <p> I begged her to explain herself; and then she told me, that while Lord Orville
                  was speaking to me, Lady Louisa said to Mr. Lovel, <q rend="inline">"Do you know
                     who that is?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Why, Ma'am, no, 'pon honour,"</q> answer ed he, <q rend="inline"
                     > "I can't absolutely say I do; I only know she is a kind of a toad-eater. She
                     made her first appearance in that capacity last Spring, when she attended Miss
                     Mirvan, a young lady of Kent." </q>
               </p>
               <p> How cruel is it, my dear Sir, to be thus expos ed to the impertinent suggestions
                  of a man who is determined to do me ill offices! Lady Louisa may well despise a
                     <hi>tood-eater;</hi> but, thank Heaven, her brother had not heard, or does not
                  credit, the mortifying appellation. Mrs. Selwyn said, she would advise me to
                     <hi>pay my court</hi> to this Mr. Lo vel; <q rend="inline">"for,"</q> said she,
                     <q rend="inline"> "though he is malicious, he is fashionable, and may do you
                     some harm in the great world." </q> But I should disdain myself as much as I do
                  him, were I capable of such du plicity, as to flatter a man whom I scorn and des
                  pise. </p>
               <p> We were received by Mrs. Beaumont with great civility, and by Lord Orville with
                  something more. As to Lady Louisa, she scarcely perceived that we were in the
                  room. </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125"/> There has been company here all day; part of which I have spent most
                  happily; for after tea, when the ladies played at cards, Lord Orville, who does
                  not, and I who cannot, play, were con sequently at our own disposal; and then his
                  Lord ship entered into a conversation with me, which lasted till supper-time. </p>
               <p> Almost insensibly, I find the constraint, the re serve, I have been wont to feel
                  in his presence, wear away; the politeness, the sweetness, with which he speaks to
                  me, restore all my natural chearfulness, and make me almost as easy as he is
                  himself; and the more so, as, if I may judge by his looks, I am rather raised,
                  than sunk, of late in his opinion. </p>
               <p> I asked him, how the bet was, at last, to be decided? He told me, that, to his
                  great satis faction, the parties had been prevailed upon to lower the sum from one
                  thousand to one hundred pounds; and that they had determined it should be settled
                  by a race between two old women, one chose by each side, and both of them to be
                  proved more than eighty, though, in other respects, strong and healthy as
                  possible. </p>
               <p> When I expressed my surprise at this extraordi nary method of spending so much
                  money, <q rend="inline">"I am charmed,"</q> said he, <q rend="inline"> "at the
                     novelty of meeting with one so unhackneyed in the world, as not to be yet
                     influenced by custom to forget the use of reason: for certain it is, that the
                     prevalence of fa shion makes the greatest absurdities pass uncensur ed, and the
                     mind naturally accommodates itself even to the most ridiculous improprieties,
                     if they occur frequently." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"I should have hoped,"</q> said I, <q rend="inline"> "that the
                     humane proposal made yesterday by your Lord ship, would have had more effect."
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126"/>
                  <q rend="inline">"O,"</q> cried he, laughing, <q rend="inline"> "I was so far from
                     expecting any success, that I shall think my self very fortunate if I escape
                     the wit of Mr. Co verley in a lampoon! yet I spoke openly, because I do not
                     wish to conceal that I am no friend to ga ming." </q>
               </p>
               <p> After this, he took up the New Bath Guide, and read it with me till supper time.
                  In our way down stairs, Lady Louisa said, <q rend="inline"> "I thought, Brother,
                     you were engaged this evening?" </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sister,"</q> answered he, <q rend="inline"> "and I
                        <hi>have</hi> been engaged." </q> And he bowed to me with an air of
                  gallantry that rather confused me. </p>

               <p> Almost insensibly have three days glided on since I wrote last, and so serenely,
                  that, but for your absence, I could not have formed a wish. My residence here is
                  much happier than I had dared expect. The attention with which Lord Orville
                  honours me is as uniform as it is flatter ing, and seems to result from a
                  benevolence of heart that proves him as much a stranger to ca price as to pride;
                  for, as his particular civilities arose from a generous resentment at seeing me ne
                  glected, so will they, I trust, continue as long as I shall, in any degree,
                  deserve them. I am now not merely easy, but even gay in his presence: such is the
                  effect of true politeness, that it banish es all restraint and embarrassment. When
                  we walk out, he condescends to be my companion, and keeps by my side all the way
                  we go. When we read, he marks the passages most worthy to be noticed, draws out my
                  sentiments, and favours me with his own. At table, where he always sits next to
                  me, he obliges me by a thousand nameless attentions, while the distinguishing
                  good-breeding <pb n="127"/> with which he treats me, prevents my repining at the
                  visibly-felt superiority of the rest of the com pany. A thousand occasional
                  meetings could not have brought us to that degree of social freedom, which four
                  days spent under the same roof have, insensibly, been productive of: and, as my
                  only friend in this house, Mrs. Selwyn, is too much engrossed in perpetual
                  conversation to attend much to me, Lord Orville seems to regard me as a help less
                  stranger, and, as such, to think me entitled to his good offices and protection.
                  Indeed, my dear Sir, I have reason to hope, that the depreciating opinion he
                  formerly entertained of me is suc ceeded by one infinitely more partial.—It may be
                  that I flatter myself, but yet his looks, his atten tions, his desire of drawing
                  me into conversation, and his solicitude to oblige me, all conspire to make me
                  hope I do not. In short, my dearest Sir, these last four happy days would repay me
                  for months of sorrow and pain! </p>

               <p> THIS morning I came down stairs very early, and, supposing that the family would
                  not assemble for some time, I strolled out, purposing to take a long walk, in the
                  manner I was wont to do at Ber ry Hill, before breakfast. But I had scarce shut
                  the garden gate, ere I was met by a gentleman, who, immediately bowing to me, I
                  recollected <pb n="128"/> to be the unhappy Mr. Macartney. Very much surprised, I
                  courtsied, and stopped till he came up to me. He was still in mourning, but looked
                  bet ter than when I saw him last, though he had the same air of melancholy which
                  so much struck me at first sight of him. </p>
               <p> Addressing me with the utmost respect, <q rend="inline">"I am happy, Madam,"</q>
                  said he, <q rend="inline"> "to have met with you so soon. I came to Bristol but
                     yesterday, and have had no small difficulty in tracing you to Clifton." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Did you know, then, of my being here?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "I did, Madam; the sole motive of my jour ney was to see you. I
                     have been to Berry Hill, and there I had my intelligence, and, at the same
                     time, the unwelcome information of your ill health." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "Good God! Sir,—and can you possibly have taken so much trouble?
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "Trouble! Oh, Madam, could there be any, to return you, the
                     moment I had the pow er, my personal acknowledgments for your good ness?" </q>
               </p>
               <p> I then enquired after Madame Duval, and the Snow-Hill family. He told me they
                  were all well, and that Madame Duval proposed soon re turning to Paris. When I
                  congratulated him up on looking better, <q rend="inline"> "It is
                        <hi>yourself,</hi> Madam," </q> said he, <q rend="inline"> "you should
                     congratulate, for to your hu manity alone it may now be owing that I exist at
                     all." </q> He then told me, that his affairs were now in a less desperate
                  situation, and that he hoped, by the assistance of time and reason, to accommo
                  date his mind to a more chearful submission to his fate. <q rend="inline"> "The
                     interest you so generously took in my affliction," </q> added he, <q
                     rend="inline"> "assures me you will not be displeased to hear of my better
                     fortune: I <pb n="129"/> was therefore eager to acquaint you with it." </q> He
                  then told me, that his friend, the moment he had received his letter, quitted
                  Paris, and flew to give him his personal assistance and consolation. With a heavy
                  heart, he acknowledged, he ac cepted it; <q rend="inline">"but yet,"</q> he added,
                     <q rend="inline"> "I <hi>have</hi> ac cepted it, and therefore, as bound
                     equally by du ty and honour, my first step was to hasten to the benefactress of
                     my distress, and to return" </q> (pre senting me something in a paper) <q
                     rend="inline"> "the only part of my obligations that <hi>can</hi> be returned;
                     for the rest, I have nothing but my gratitude to offer, and must always be
                     contented to consider myself her debtor." </q>
               </p>
               <p> I congratulated him most sincerely upon his dawning prosperity, but begged he
                  would not de prive me of the pleasure of being his friend, and declined receiving
                  the money, till his affairs were more settled. </p>
               <p> While this point was in agitation, I heard Lord Orville's voice, enquiring of the
                  gardener if he had seen me? I immediately opened the garden gate, and his
                  Lordship, advancing to me with quickness, said, <q rend="inline"> "Good God, Miss
                     Anville, have you been out alone? Breakfast has been ready some time, and I
                     have been round the garden in search of you." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Your Lordship has been very good,"</q> said I; <q rend="inline"
                     >"but I hope you have not waited."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Not waited!"</q> repeated he smiling, <q rend="inline"> "Do you
                     think we could sit down quietly to breakfast, with the idea that you had run
                     away from us? But come," </q> (offering to hand me) <q rend="inline"> "if we do
                     not return, they will suppose <hi>I</hi> am run away too; and they very
                     naturally may, as they know the attrac tion of the magnet that draws me." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130"/>
                  <q rend="inline">"I will come, my Lord,"</q> said I, rather em barrassed, <q
                     rend="inline">"in two minutes."</q> Then, turning to Mr. Macartney, with yet
                  more embarrassment, I wished him good morning. </p>
               <p> He advanced towards the garden, with the pa per still in his hand. </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"No, no,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline">"some other time."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "May I then, Madam, have the honour of seeing you again? </q>
               </p>
               <p> I did not dare take the liberty of inviting any body to the house of Mrs.
                  Beaumont, nor yet had I the presence of mind to make an excuse; and therefore, not
                  knowing how to refuse him, I said, <q rend="inline"> "Perhaps you may be this way
                     again to-morrow morning,—and I believe I shall walk out before breakfast." </q>
               </p>
               <p> He bowed, and went away; while I, turning again to Lord Orville, saw his
                  countenance so much altered, that I was srightened at what I had so hastily said.
                  He did not again offer me his hand, but walked, silent and slow, by my side. Good
                  Heaven! thought I, what may he not sup pose from this adventure? May he not, by my
                  desire of meeting Mr. Macartney to-morrow, imagine it was by design I walked out
                  to meet him to-day? Tormented by this apprehension, I de termined to avail myself
                  of the freedom which his behaviour since I came hither has encouraged; and, since
                  he would not ask any questions, begin an explanation myself. I therefore slackened
                  my peace, to gain time, and then said, <q rend="inline"> "Was not your Lordship
                     surprised to see me speaking with a stranger?" </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"A stranger!'</q> repeated he; <q rend="inline"> "is it possible
                     that gentleman can be a stranger to you?" </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"No, my Lord,"</q> —said I, stammering, <q rend="inline"> "not to
                        <hi>me,</hi> —but only it might look—he might seem—" </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131"/>
                  <q rend="inline">"No, believe me,"</q> said he, with a forced smile, <q
                     rend="inline"> "I could never believe Miss Anville would make an appointment
                     with a stranger." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"An appointment, my Lord!"</q> repeated I, colouring violently. </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Pardon me, Madam,"</q> answered he, <q rend="inline">"but I
                     thought I heard one."</q>
               </p>
               <p> I was so much confounded, that I could not speak; yet, finding he walked quietly
                  on, I could not endure he should make his own interpretation of my silence; and
                  therefore, as soon as I reco vered from my surprise, I said, <q rend="inline">
                     "Indeed, my Lord, you are much mistaken,—Mr. Macartney had particular business
                     with me,—and I could not,—I knew not how to refuse seeing him,—but indeed, my
                     Lord,—I had not,—he had not,—" </q> I stammered so terribly that I could not go
                  on. </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"I am very sorry,"</q> said he, gravely, <q rend="inline"> "that
                     I have been so unfortunate as to distress you; but I should not have followed
                     you, had I not imagined you were merely walked out for the air." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"And so I was!"</q> cried I, eagerly, <q rend="inline"> "indeed,
                     my Lord, I was! My meeting with Mr. Ma cartney was quite accidental; and if
                     your Lord ship thinks there is any impropriety in my see ing him to-morrow, I
                     am ready to give up that intention." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "If <hi>I</hi> think!" </q> said he, in a tone of surprise; <q
                     rend="inline"> "surely Miss Anville must best judge for herself! surely she
                     cannot leave the arbitration of a point so delicate, to one who is ignorant of
                     all the cir cumstances which attend it? </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"If,"</q> said I, <q rend="inline"> "it was worth your Lordship's
                     time to hear them,—you should <hi>not</hi> be ignorant of the circumstances
                     which attend it." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132"/>
                  <q rend="inline"> "The sweetness of Miss Anville's dispositi on," </q> said he, in
                  a softened voice, <q rend="inline"> "I have long admired, and the offer of a
                     communication which does me so much honour, is too grateful to me not to be
                     eagerly caught at." </q>
               </p>
               <p> Just then, Mrs. Selwyn opened the parlour-win dow, and our conversation ended. I
                  was rallied upon my passion for solitary walking, but no questions were asked me. </p>
               <p> When breakfast was over, I hoped to have had some opportunity of speaking with
                  Lord Orville: but Lord Merton and Mr. Coverly came in, and insisted upon his
                  opinion of the spot they had fixed upon for the old women's race. The ladies de
                  clared they would be of the party, and, accord ingly, we all went. </p>
               <p> The race is to be run in Mrs. Beaumont's gar den; the two gentlemen are as
                  anxious as if their joint lives depended upon it. They have, at length fixed upon
                  objects, but have found great difficulty in persuading them to practise running,
                  in order to try their strength. This grand affair is to be decided next Thursday. </p>
               <p> When we returned to the house, the entrance of more company still prevented my
                  having any conversation with Lord Orville. I was very much chagrined, as I knew he
                  was engaged at the Hotwells in the afternoon. Seeing, therefore, no probability of
                  speaking to him before the time of my meeting Mr. Macartney arrived, I determin ed
                  that, rather than risk his ill opinion, I would leave Mr. Macartney to his own
                  suggestions. </p>
               <p> Yet, when I reflected upon his peculiar situati on, his misfortunes, his sadness,
                  and, more than all the rest, the idea I knew he entertained of what he calls his
                  obligations to me, I could not re solve upon a breach of promise, which might be
                     <pb n="133"/> attributed to causes of all others the most offensive to one whom
                  sorrow has made extremely suspici ous of slights and contempt. </p>
               <p> After the most uneasy consideration, I at length determined upon writing an
                  excuse, which would, at once, save me from either meeting or affront ing him. I
                  therefore begged Mrs. Selwyn's leave to send her man to the Hotwells, which she in
                  stantly granted; and then I wrote the following note. </p>
               <floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <head>To Mr. Macartney.</head>

                     </opener>
                     <p> AS it will not be in my power to walk out to morrow morning, I would by no
                        means give you the trouble of coming to Clifton. I hope, how ever, to have
                        the pleasure of seeing you before you quit Bristol. I am, </p>
                     <closer>
                        <salute>Sir,</salute>

                  </body>
               </floatingText>
               <p> I desired the servant to enquire at the pump room where Mr. Macartney lived, and
                  returned to the parlour. </p>
               <p> As soon as the company dispersed, the ladies retired to dress. I then,
                  unexpectedly, found myself alone with Lord Orville; who, the mo ment I rose to
                  follow Mrs. Selwyn, advanced to me, and said, <q rend="inline"> "Will Miss Anville
                     pardon my impatience, if I remind her of the promise she was so good as to make
                     me this morning?" </q>
               </p>
               <p> I stopped, and would have returned to my seat, but, before I had time, the
                  servants came to lay the cloth. He retreated, and went towards the window; and
                  while I was considering in what <pb n="134"/> manner to begin, I could not help
                  asking myself what <hi>right</hi> I had to communicate the affairs of Mr.
                  Macartney; and I doubted whether, to clear myself from one act of imprudence, I
                  had not commited another. </p>
               <p> Distressed by this reflection, I thought it best to quit the room, and give
                  myself some time for consideration before I spoke; and therefore, only saying I
                  must hasten to dress, I ran up stairs: ra ther abruptly, I own, and so, I fear,
                  Lord Or ville must think, yet what could I do? unused to the situations in which I
                  find myself, and embar rassed by the slightest difficulties, I seldom, till too
                  late, discover how I ought to act </p>
               <p> Just as we were all assembled to dinner, Mrs. Selwyn's man, coming into the
                  parlour, presented to me a letter, and said, <q rend="inline"> "I can't find out
                     Mr. Macartney, Madam; but the post-office people will let you know if they hear
                     of him." </q>
               </p>
               <p> I was extremely ashamed of this public mes sage; and meeting the eyes of Lord
                  Orville, which were earnestly fixed on me, my confusion redoubled, and I knew not
                  which way to look. All dinner-time, he was as silent as myself, and, the moment it
                  was in my power, I left the table, and went to my own room. Mrs. Selwyn presently
                  followed me, and her questions obliged me to own almost all the particulars of my
                  acquaintance with Mr. Macartney, in order to excuse my writing to him. She said it
                  was a most romantic affair, and spoke her sentiments with great severity,
                  declaring that she had no doubt but he was an adventurer and an impostor. </p>
               <p> And now, my dear Sir, I am totally at a loss what I ought to do: the more I
                  reflect, the more sensible I am of the utter impropriety, nay, treachery, of
                  revealing the story, and publishing <pb n="135"/> the misfortunes and poverty of
                  Mr. Macartney; who has an undoubted right to my secrecy and discretion, and whose
                  letter charges me to regard his communication as sacred.—And yet, the ap pearance
                  of mystery,—perhaps something worse, which this affair must have to Lord
                  Orville,—his seriousness,—and the promise I have made him, are inducements scarce
                  to be resisted, for trusting him, with the openness he has reason to expect from
                  me. </p>
               <p> I am equally distressed, too, whether or not I should see Mr. Macartney to-morrow
                  morning. </p>
               <p> Oh Sir, could I now be enlightened by your counsel, from what anxiety and
                  perplexity should I be relieved! </p>
               <p> But no,—I ought not to betray Mr. Macartney, and I will not forfeit a confidence
                  which would never have been reposed in me, but from a reli ance upon my honour
                  which I should blush to find myself unworthy of. Desirous as I am of the good
                  opinion of Lord Orville, I will endeavour to act as if I was guided by your
                  advice, and, making it my sole aim to <hi>deserve</hi> it, leave to time and to
                  fate my success or disappointment. </p>
               <p> Since I have formed this resolution, my mind is more at ease, but I will not
                  finish my letter till the affair is decided. </p>

               <p> I rose very early this morning, and, after a thousand different plans, not being
                  able to resolve upon giving poor Mr. Macartney leave to suppose I neglected him, I
                  thought it incumbent upon me to keep my word, since he had not received my letter;
                  I therefore determined to make my own <pb n="136"/> apologies, not to stay with
                  him two minutes, and to excuse myself from meeting him any more. </p>
               <p> Yet, uncertain whether I was wrong or right, it was with fear and trembling that
                  I opened the garden-gate,—judge, then, of my feelings, when the first object I saw
                  was Lord Orville!—he, too, looked extremely disconcerted, and said, in a he
                  sitating manner, <q rend="inline"> "Pardon me, Madam,—I did not imagine you would
                     have been here so soon,—or,—or I would not have come." </q> —And then, with a
                  hasty bow, he passed me, and proceeded to the garden. </p>
               <p> I was scarce able to stand, so greatly did I feel myself shocked; but, upon my
                  saying, almost involuntarily, <q rend="inline">"Oh my Lord!"</q> —he turned back,
                  and, after a short pause, said, <q rend="inline"> "Did you speak to <hi>me,</hi>
                     Madam?" </q>
               </p>
               <p> I could not immediately answer; I seemed <hi>choaked,</hi> and was even forced to
                  support myself by the garden-gate. </p>
               <p> Lord Orville, soon recovering his dignity, said, <q rend="inline"> "I know not
                     how to apologise for being, just now, at this place;—and I cannot
                     immediately,—if <hi>ever,</hi> —clear myself from the imputation of im
                     pertinent curiosity, to which I fear you will attri bute it: however, I will,
                     at present, only entreat your pardon, without detaining you any longer." </q>
                  Again he bowed, and left me. </p>
               <p> For some moments, I remained fixed to the same spot, and in the same position,
                  immovably, as if I had been transformed to stone. </p>
               <p> My first impulse was to call him back, and in stantly tell him the whole affair;
                  but I checked this desire, though I would have given the world to have indulged
                  it; something like pride aided what I thought due to Mr. Macartney, and I de
                  termined not only to keep his secret, but to delay <pb n="137"/> any sort of
                  explanation, till Lord Orville should condescend to request it. </p>
               <p> Slowly he walked, and before he entered the house, he looked back, but hastily
                  withdrew his eyes, upon finding I observed him. </p>
               <p> Indeed, my dear Sir, you cannot easily ima gine a situation more uncomfortable
                  than mine was at that time; to be suspected by Lord Or ville of any clandestine
                  actions, wounded my soul; I was too much discomposed to wait for Mr. Macartney,
                  nor, in truth, could I endure to have the design of my staying so well known. Yet,
                  so extremely was I agitated, that I could hardly move, and, I have reason to
                  believe, Lord Orville, from the parlour window, saw me totter ing along, for,
                  before I had taken five steps, he came out, and hastening to me, said, <q
                     rend="inline"> "I fear you are not well; pray allow me, (offering his arm) to
                     assist you." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"No, my Lord,"</q> said I, with all the resolu tion I could
                  assume; yet I was affected by an attention, at that time, so little expected, and
                  forced to turn away my head to conceal my emotion. </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "You <hi>must,</hi> " </q> said he, with earnestness, <q
                     rend="inline"> "in deed you must,—I am sure you are not well;—refuse me not the
                     honour of assisting you; </q> and, almost forcibly he took my hand, and drawing
                  it under his arm, obliged me to lean upon him. That I submitted, was partly the
                  effect of sur prise at an earnestness so uncommon in Lord Orville, and partly,
                  that I did not just then, dare trust my voice to make any objection. </p>
               <p> When we came to the house, he led me into the parlour, and to a chair, and begged
                  to know if I would not have a glass of water. </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138"/>
                  <q rend="inline">"No, my Lord, I thank you,"</q> said I, <q rend="inline">"I am
                     perfectly recovered;"</q> and, rising, I walked to the window, where, for some
                  time, I pretend ed to be occupied in looking at the garden. </p>
               <p> Determined as I was to act honourably by Mr. Macartney, I yet most anxiously
                  wished to be restored to the good opinion of Lord Orville; but his silence, and
                  the thoughtfulness of his air, discouraged me from speaking. </p>
               <p> My situation soon grew disagreeable and em barrassing, and I resolved to return
                  to my cham ber till breakfast was ready. To remain longer, I feared, might seem
                     <hi>asking</hi> for his enquiries; and I was sure it would ill become me to be
                  more ea ger to speak, than he was to hear. </p>
               <p> Just as I reached the door, turning to me, hastily, he said, <q rend="inline">
                     "Are you going, Miss An ville?" </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"I am, my Lord,"</q> answered I, yet I stop ped. </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "Perhaps to return to—but I beg your par don!" </q> he spoke
                  with a degree of agitation that made me readily comprehend he meant to <hi>the
                     garden,</hi> and I instantly said, <q rend="inline">"To my own room, my
                     Lord."</q> And again I would have gone; but, convinced by my answer that I un
                  derstood him, I believe he was sorry for the insi nuation; he approached me with a
                  very serious air, though, at the same time, he forced a smile, and said, <q
                     rend="inline"> "I know not what evil genius pursues me this morning, but I seem
                     destined to do or say something I ought not: I am so much asham ed of myself,
                     that I can scarce solicit your for giveness." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"My forgiveness! my Lord?"</q> cried I, abash ed, rather than
                  elated by his condescension, <q rend="inline"> "sure ly you cannot,—you are not
                     serious?" </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139"/>
                  <q rend="inline"> "Indeed never more so; yet, if I may be my own interpreter, Miss
                     Anville's countenance pro nounces my pardon." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "I know not, my Lord, how any one can pardon, who has never been
                     offended." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "You are very good; yet I could expect no less from a sweetness
                     of disposition which baffles all comparison: will you not think I am an en
                     croacher, and that I take advantage of your good ness, should I once more
                     remind you of the pro mise you vouchsafed me yesterday?" </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "No, indeed; on the contrary, I shall be very happy to acquit
                     myself in your Lordship's opinion." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Acquittal you need not,"</q> said he, leading me again to the
                  window, <q rend="inline"> "yet I own my curio sity is strongly excited." </q>
               </p>
               <p> When I was seated, I found myself much at a los what to say; yet, after a short
                  silence, as suming all the courage in my power, <q rend="inline">"Will you not, my
                     Lord,"</q> said I, <q rend="inline"> "think me trifling and capricious, should
                     I own I have repented the promise I made, and should I entreat your Lord ship
                     not to insist upon my strict performance of it?—I spoke so hastily, that I did
                     not, at the time, consider the impropriety of what I said" </q>
               </p>
               <p> As he was entirely silent, and profoundly at tentive, I continued to speak
                  without interrup tion. </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "If your Lordship, by any other means, knew the circumstances
                     attending my acquain tance with Mr. Macartney, I am most sure you would
                     yourself disapprove my relating them. He is a gentleman, and has been very
                     unfortu nate,—but I am not,—I think not,—at liberty to say more: yet I am sure,
                     if he knew your Lord ship <pb n="140"/> wished to hear any particulars of his
                     affairs, he would readily consent to my acknowledging them;—shall, my Lord, ask
                     his permission?" </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> " <hi>His</hi> affairs," </q> repeated Lord Orville; <q
                     rend="inline"> "by no means, I have not the least curiosity about them." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "I beg your Lordship's pardon,—but indeed I had understood the
                     contrary." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "Is it possible, Madam, you could suppose the affairs of an
                     utter stranger can excite my cu riosity." </q>
               </p>
               <p> The gravity and coldness with which he asked this question, very much abashed me;
                  but Lord Orville is the most delicate of men, and presently recollecting himself,
                  he added, <q rend="inline"> "I mean not to speak with indifference of any friend
                     of yours,—far from it; any such will always command my good wishes: yet I own I
                     am rather disappoint ed; and though I doubt not the justice of your reasons, to
                     which I implicitly submit, you must not wonder, that when, upon the point of
                     being honoured with your confidence, I should feel the greatest regret at
                     finding it withdrawn." </q>
               </p>
               <p> Do you think, my dear Sir, I did not, at that moment, require all my resolution
                  to guard me from frankly telling him whatever he wished to hear? yet I rejoice
                  that I did not; for, added to the actual wrong I should have done, Lord Or ville
                  himself, when he had heard, would, I am sure, have blamed me. Fortunately, this
                  thought occurred to me, and I said, <q rend="inline"> "Your Lordship shall
                     yourself be my judge; the pro mise I made, though voluntary, was rash and
                     inconsiderate; yet, had it concerned myself, I would not have hesitated in
                     fulfilling it; but the gentleman whose affairs I should be obliged to re late—"
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141"/>
                  <q rend="inline">"Pardon me,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "for interrupting
                     you; yet allow me to assure you, I have not the slightest desire to be
                     acquainted with his affairs, further than what belongs to the motives which
                     induced you yesterday morning—" </q> He stopped; but there was no occasion to
                  say more. </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"That, my Lord,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline"> "I will tell you
                     honesty. Mr. Macartney had some particular business with me,—and I could not
                     take the liber ty to ask him hither." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"And why not?—Mrs. Beaumont, I am sure,—"</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "I could not, my Lord, think of intruding upon Mrs. Beaumont's
                     complaisance; and so, with the same hasty folly I promised your Lord ship, I
                     much <hi>more</hi> rashly, promised to meet him." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"And did you?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"No, my Lord,"</q> said I, colouring, <q rend="inline"> "I re
                     turned before he came." </q>
               </p>
               <p> Again, for some time, we were both silent; yet, unwilling to leave him to
                  reflections which could not but be to my disadvantage, I summoned sufficient
                  courage to say, <q rend="inline"> "There is no young creature, my Lord, who so
                     greatly wants, or so earnestly wishes for, the advice and assistance of her
                     friends, as I do; I am new to the world, and unused to acting for myself,—my
                     intentions are never wilfully blameable, yet I err perpetually!—I have
                     hitherto, been blest with the most affecti onate of friends, and, indeed, the
                     ablest of men, to guide and instruct me upon every occasion;—but he is too
                     distant, now, to be applied to at the moment I want his aid; and <hi>here,</hi>
                     —there is not a human being whose counsel I can ask!" </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Would to Heaven,"</q> cried he, with a coun tenance from which
                  all coldness and gravity were <pb n="142"/> banished, and succeeded by the mildest
                  benevo lence, <q rend="inline"> "that <hi>I</hi> were worthy,—and capable,—of
                     supplying the place of such a friend to Miss Anville!" </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"You do me but too much honour,"</q> said I; <q rend="inline">
                     "yet I hope your Lordship's candour,—perhaps I ought to say indulgence,—will
                     make some al lowance, on account of my inexperience, for be haviour so
                     inconsiderate:—May I, my Lord, hope that you will?" </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "May <hi>I,</hi> " </q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "hope that
                     you will pardon the ill-grace with which I have submitted to my disappointment?
                     and that you will permit me," </q> (kissing my hand) <q rend="inline">"thus to
                     seal my peace?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> " <hi>Our</hi> peace, my Lord," </q> said I, with revived
                  spirits. </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"This, then,"</q> said he, again pressing it to his lips, <q
                     rend="inline"> "for <hi>our</hi> peace: and now,—are we not friends?" </q>
               </p>
               <p> Just then, the door opened, and I had only time to withdraw my hand, ere the
                  ladies came in to breakfast. </p>
               <p> I have been, all day, the happiest of human beings!—to be thus reconciled to Lord
                  Orville, and yet to adhere to my resolution,—what could I wish for more?—he too,
                  has been very chear ful, and more attentive, more obliging to me than ever. Yet
                  Heaven forbid I should again be in a similar situation, for I cannot express how
                  much uneasiness I have suffered from the fear of incurring his ill opinion. </p>
               <p> But what will poor Mr. Macartney think of me? happy as I am, I much regret the ne
                  cessity I have been under, of disappointing him. </p>

            <opener>
               <dateline> Berry Hill, <date>Sept. 28.</date>
               </dateline>
            </opener>
            <p> DEAD to the world, and equally insensible to its pleasures or its pains, I long
               since bid adieu to all joy, and defiance to all sorrow, but what should spring from
               my Evelina,—sole source, to me, of all earthly felicity. How strange, then, is it,
               that the letter in which she tells me she is the <hi>happiest of human beings,</hi>
               should give me the most mortal inquietude! </p>
            <p> Alas, my child!—that innocence, the first, best gift of Heaven, should, of all
               others, be the blindest to its own danger,—the most exposed to treachery,—and the
               least able to defend itself, in a world where it is little known, less valued, and
               perpe tually deceived. </p>
            <p> Would to Heaven you were here!—then, by degrees, and with gentleness, I might enter
               upon a subject too delicate for distant discussion. Yet it is too interesting, and
               the situation too critical, to allow of delay.—Oh my Evelina, your situ ation is
               critical indeed!—your peace of mind is at stake, and every chance for your future
               happiness may depend upon the conduct of the present mo ment. </p>
            <p> Hitherto I have forborne to speak with you upon the most important of all concerns,
               the state of your heart:—alas, I needed no information! I have been silent, indeed,
               but I have not been blind. </p>
            <p> Long, and with the deepest regret, have I per ceived <pb n="144"/> the ascendency
               which Lord Orville has gained upon your mind.—You will start at the mention of his
               name,—you will tremble every word you read;—I grieve to give pain to my gen tle
               Evelina, but I dare not any longer spare her. </p>
            <p> Your first meeting with Lord Orville was de cisive. Lively, fearless, free from all
               other impres sions, such a man as you describe him could not fail exciting your
               admiration, and the more dange rously, because he seemed as unconscious of his power
               as you of your weakness; and therefore you had no alarm, either from <hi>his</hi>
               vanity, or <hi>your own</hi> prudence. </p>
            <p> Young, animated, entirely off your guard, and thoughtless of consequences,
                  <hi>imagination</hi> took the reins, and <hi>reason,</hi> slow-paced, though
               sure-foot ed, was unequal to a race with so eccentric and flighty a companion. How
               rapid was then my Eve lina's progress through those regions of fancy and passion
               whither her new guide conducted her!—She saw Lord Orville at a ball,—and he was
                  <hi>the most amiable of men!</hi> —She met him again at ano ther,—and <hi>he had
                  every virtue under Heaven!</hi>
            </p>
            <p> I mean not to depreciate the merit of Lord Or ville, who, one mysterious instance
               alone ex cepted, seems to have deserved the idea you form ed of his character; but it
               was not time, it was not the knowledge of his worth, obtained your regard; your new
               comrade had not patience to wait any trial; her glowing pencil, dipt in the vivid
               colours of her creative ideas, painted to you, at the moment of your first
               acquaintance, all the excellencies, all the good and rare qualities, which a great
               length of time, and intimacy, could alone have really discovered. </p>
            <p> You flattered yourself, that your partiality was the effect of esteem, founded upon
               a general love <pb n="145"/> of merit, and a principle of justice; and your heart,
               which fell the sacrifice of your error, was totally gone ere you suspected it was in
               danger. </p>
            <p> A thousand times have I been upon the point of shewing you the perils of your
               situation; but the same inexperience which occasioned your mis take, I hoped, with
               the assistance of time and ab sence, would effect a cure: I was, indeed, most
               unwilling to destroy your illusion, while I dared hope it might itself contribute to
               the restoration of your tranquillity; since your ignorance of the danger and force of
               your attachment, might pos sibly prevent that despondency with which young people, in
               similar circumstances, are apt to per suade themselves that what is only difficult,
               is ab solutely impossible. </p>
            <p> But now, since you have again met, and are become more intimate than ever, all my
               hope from silence and seeming ignorance is at an end. </p>
            <p> Awake, then, my dear, my deluded child, awake to the sense of your danger, and exert
               your self to avoid the evils with which it threatens you,—evils which, to a mind like
               yours, are most to be dreaded, secret repining, and concealed, yet consuming regret!
               Make a noble effort for the re covery of your peace, which now, with sorrow I see it,
               depends wholly upon the presence of Lord Orville. This effort, may, indeed, be pain
               ful, but trust to my experience, when I assure you it is requisite. </p>
            <p> You must quit him!—his sight is baneful to your repose, his society is death to your
               future tranquillity! Believe me, my beloved child, my heart aches for your suffering,
               while it dictates its necessity. </p>
            <p> Could I flatter myself that Lord Orville would, indeed, be sensible of your worth,
               and act with a <pb n="146"/> nobleness of mind, which should prove it reci procal,
               then would I leave my Evelina to the un molested enjoyment of the chearful society
               and in creasing regard of a man she so greatly admires; but this is not an age in
               which we may trust to appearances, and imprudence is much sooner re gretted than
               repaired. Your health, you tell me, is much mended,—can you then consent to leave
               Bristol?—not abruptly, that I do not desire, but in a few days from the time you
               receive this? I will write to Mrs. Selwyn, and tell her how much I wish your return;
               and Mrs. Clinton can take sufficient care of you. </p>
            <p> I have meditated upon every possible expedient that might tend to your happiness,
               ere I fixed upon exacting from you a compliance which I am con vinced will be most
               painful to you; but I can sa tisfy myself in none. This will at least be safe, and as
               to success,—we must leave it to time. </p>
            <p> I am very glad to hear of Mr. Macartney's wel fare. </p>
            <p> Adieu, my dearest child; Heaven preserve and strengthen you! </p>

            <opener>
               <dateline> Clifton, <date>Sept. 28.</date>
               </dateline>
            </opener>
            <p> SWEETLY, most sweetly, have two days more passed since I wrote; but I have been too
               much engaged to be exact in my journal. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147"/> To-day has been less tranquil. It was destined for the decision of the
               important bet, and has been productive of general confusion throughout the house. It
               was settled that the race should be run at five o'clock in the afternoon. Lord Mer
               ton breakfasted here, and stayed till noon. He wanted to engage the ladies to <hi>bet
                  on his side,</hi> in the true spirit of gaming, without seeing the ra cers. But he
               could only prevail on Lady Louisa, as Mrs. Selwyn said she never laid a wager against
               her own wishes, and Mrs. Beaumont would not <hi>take sides.</hi> As for <hi>me,</hi>
               I was not applied to. It is impossible for negligence to be more pointed, than that
               of Lord Merton to me, in the presence of Lady Louisa. </p>
            <p> But, just before dinner, I happened to be alone in the drawing-room, when his
               Lordship suddenly returned, and coming in with his usual familiarity, he was
               beginning, <q rend="inline">"You see, Lady Louisa,—"</q> but stopping short, <q
                  rend="inline">"Pray, where's every body gone?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Indeed I don't know, my Lord."</q>
            </p>
            <p> He then shut the door, and, with a great alter ation in his face and manner,
               advanced eagerly towards me, and said, <q rend="inline"> "How glad I am, my sweet
                  girl, to meet you, at last, alone! By my soul, I began to think there was a plot
                  against me, for I've never been able to have you a minute to myself." </q> And,
               very freely, he seized my hand. </p>
            <p> I was so much surprised at this address, after having been so long totally
               neglected, that I could make no other answer than staring at him with un feigned
               astonishment. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why now,"</q> continued he, <q rend="inline"> "if you was not the
                  cruellest little angel in the world, you would have helped me to some expedient:
                  for you see how I am watched here; Lady Louisa's <pb n="148"/> eyes are never off
                  me. She gives me a charming foretaste of the pleasures of a wife! however, it
                  won't last long." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Disgusted to the greatest degree, I attempted to draw away my hand, but I believe I
               should not have succeeded, had not Mrs. Beaumont made her appearance. He turned from
               me with the greatest assurance, and said, <q rend="inline"> "How are you, Ma'am?—how
                  is Lady Louisa?—you see I can't live a moment out of the house." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Could you, my dearest Sir, have believed it possible for such effrontery to be in
               man? </p>
            <p> Before dinner, came Mr. Coverley, and before five o'clock, Mr. Lovel and some other
               company. The place marked out for the race, was a gravel walk in Mrs. Beaumont's
               garden, and the length of the ground twenty yards. When we were summoned to the
                  <hi>course,</hi> the two poor old women made their appearance. Though they seemed
               very healthy for their time of life, they yet looked so weak, so infirm, so feeble,
               that I could feel no sensation but that of pity at the sight. However, this was not
               the general sense of the company, for they no sooner came forward, than they were
               greeted with a laugh from every beholder, Lord Orville excepted, who looked very
               grave during the whole transaction. Doubtless he must be greatly dis contented at the
               dissipated conduct and extrava gance, of a man with whom he is, soon, to be so nearly
               connected. </p>
            <p> For some time, the scene was truly ridiculous; the agitation of the parties
               concerned, and the bets that were laid upon the old women, were absurd beyond
               measure. <hi>Who are you for?</hi> and <hi>whose side are you of?</hi> was echoed
               from mouth to mouth by the whole company. Lord Merton and Mr. Coverley were both so
               excessively gay and noisy, <pb n="149"/> that I soon found they had been too free in
               drink ing to their success. They handed, with loud shouts, the old women to the
               race-ground, and encouraged them, by liberal promises, to exert themselves. </p>
            <p> When the signal was given them to set off, the poor creatures, seeble and
               frightened, ran against each other, and, neither of them able to support the shock,
               they both fell on the ground. </p>
            <p> Lord Merton and Mr. Coverley flew to their assistance. Seats were brought for them,
               and they each drank a glass of wine. They complained of being much bruised, for,
               heavy and helpless, they had not been able to save themselves, but fell with their
               whole weight upon the gravel. However, as they seemed equal sufferers, both parties
               were too eager to have the affair deferred. </p>
            <p> Again, therefore, they set off, and hobbled along, nearly even with each other, for
               some time, yet frequently, and to the inexpressible di version of the company, they
               stumbled and tot tered; and the confused hallowing of <q rend="inline"> " <hi> Now Co
                     verley! </hi> " </q>
               <q rend="inline"> " <hi>Now Merton!</hi> " </q> rung from side to side during the
               whole affair. </p>
            <p> Not long after, a foot of one of the poor wo men slipt, and, with great force, she
               came again to the ground. Involuntarily, I sprung forward to assist her, but Lord
               Merton, to whom she did not belong, stopped me, calling out <q rend="inline">"No foul
                  play! no foul play!"</q>
            </p>
            <p> Mr. Coverley, then, repeating the same words, went himself to help her, and insisted
               that the other should stop. A debate ensued; but the poor creature was too much hurt
               to move, and declared her utter inability to make another at tempt. Mr. Coverley was
               quite brutal; he swore <pb n="150"/> at her with unmanly rage, and seemed scarce able
               to refrain even from striking her. </p>
            <p> Lord Merton then, in great rapture, said it was a <hi>hollow thing;</hi> but Mr.
               Coverley contended that the fall was accidental, and time should be allow ed for the
               woman to recover. However, all the company being against him, he was pronounced the
               loser. </p>
            <p> We then went to the drawing-room, to tea. After which, the evening being delightful,
               we all walked in the garden. Lord Merton was quite riotous, and Lady Louisa in high
               spirits; but Mr. Coverley endeavoured in vain to conceal his cha grin. </p>
            <p> As Lord Orville was thoughtful, and walked by himself, I expected that, as usual,
                  <hi>I</hi> should pass unnoticed, and be left to my own medita tions; but this was
               not the case, for Lord Mer ton, entirely off his guard, giddy equally from wine and
               success, was very troublesome to me; and, regardless of the presence of Lady Louisa,
               which, hitherto, has restrained him even from common civility, he attached himself to
               me, du ring the walk, with a freedom of gallantry that put me extremely out of
               countenance. He paid me the most high-flown compliments, and fre quently and forcibly
               seized my hand, though I repeatedly, and with undissembled anger, drew it back. Lord
               Orville, I saw, watched us with earnestness, and Lady Louisa's smiles were con verted
               into looks of disdain. </p>
            <p> I could not bear to be thus situated, and com plaining I was tired, I quickened my
               pace, with intention to return to the house; but Lord Mer ton hastily following,
               caught my hand, and say ing the <hi>day was his own,</hi> vowed he would not let me
               go. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="151"/>
               <q rend="inline"> "You <hi>must,</hi> my Lord," </q> cried I, extremely flurried. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"You are the most charming girl in the world,"</q> said he, <q
                  rend="inline">"and never looked better than at this moment."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q> cried Mrs. Selwyn, advancing to us, <q rend="inline">
                  "you don't consider, that the better Miss Anville looks, the more striking is the
                  contrast with your Lordship; therefore, for your own sake, I would advise you not
                  to hold her." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Egad, my Lord,"</q> cried Mr. Coverley, <q rend="inline"> "I don't
                  see what right you have to the best <hi>old,</hi> and the best <hi>young</hi>
                  woman too, in the same day." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> " <hi>Best young woman!</hi> " </q> repeated Mr. Lovel; <q
                  rend="inline"> "'pon honour, Jack, you have made a most unfortunate speech;
                  however, if Lady Louisa can pardon you,—and her Ladyship is all good ness,—I am
                  sure nobody else can, for you have committed an outrageous solecism in good man
                  ners." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"And pray, Sir,"</q> said Mrs. Selwyn, <q rend="inline"> "un der
                  what denomination may your own speech pass?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> Mr. Lovel, turning another way, affected not to hear her: and Mr. Coverley, bowing
               to Lady Louisa, said, <q rend="inline"> "Her Ladyship is well acquainted with my
                  devotion,—but egad, I don't know how it is,—I had always an unlucky turn at an
                  epigram, and never could resist a smart play upon words in my life." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Pray, my Lord,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline">"let go my hand!
                  pray, Mrs. Selwyn, speak for me."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q> said Mrs. Selwyn, <q rend="inline"> "in detain ing
                  Miss Anville any longer, you only lose time, for we are already as well convinced
                  of your va lour <pb n="152"/> and your strength as if you were to hold her an
                  age." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q> said Mrs. Beaumont, <q rend="inline"> "I must beg
                  leave to interfere; I know not if Lady Lou isa can pardon you, but, as this young
                  Lady is at my house, I do not chuse to have her made uneasy." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> " <hi>I</hi> pardon him!" </q> cried Lady Louisa, <q rend="inline"
                  >"I declare I am monstrous glad to get rid of him."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Egad, my Lord,"</q> cried Mr. Coverley, <q rend="inline"> "while
                  you are grasping at a shadow, you'll lose a substance; you'd best make your peace
                  while you can." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Pray, Mr. Coverley, be quiet,"</q> said Lady Louisa, peevishly, <q
                  rend="inline">"for I declare I won't speak to him. Brother,"</q> (taking hold of
               Lord Orville's arm) <q rend="inline">"will you walk in with me?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Would to Heaven,"</q> cried I, frightened to see how much Lord
               Merton was in liquor, <q rend="inline"> "that I, too, had a brother!—and then I
                  should not be exposed to such treatment!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> Lord Orville, instantly quitting Lady Louisa, said, <q rend="inline"> "Will Miss
                  Anville allow <hi>me</hi> the honour of taking that title?" </q> and then, without
               waiting for any answer, he disengaged me from Lord Merton, and, handing me to Lady
               Louisa, <q rend="inline">"Let me,"</q> added he, <q rend="inline"> "take equal care
                  of <hi>both</hi> my sisters;" </q> and then, desiring her to take hold of one arm,
               and begging me to make use of the other, we reached the house in a moment. Lord Mer
               ton, disordered as he was, attempted not to stop us. </p>
            <p> As soon as we entered the house, I withdrew my arm, and courtsied my thanks, for my
               heart was too full for speech. Lady Louisa, evidently hurt at her brother's
               condescension, and piqued extremely by Lord Merton's behaviour, silent ly <pb n="153"
               /> drew away her's, and biting her lips, with a look of infinite vexation, walked
               sullenly up the hall. </p>
            <p> Lord Orville asked her if she would not go into the parlour. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No,"</q> answered she, haughtily; <q rend="inline">"I leave you and
                  your new sister together,"</q> and then she walked up stairs. </p>
            <p> I was quite confounded at the pride and rude ness of this speech. Lord Orville
               himself seemed thunderstruck; I turned from him, and went into the parlour; he
               followed me, saying, <q rend="inline"> "Must I, now, apologise to Miss Anville for
                  the liberty of my interference?—or ought I to apologise that I did not, as I
                  wished, interfere sooner?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O my Lord,"</q> cried I, with an emotion I could not repress, <q
                  rend="inline"> "it is from you alone I meet with any respect,—all others treat me
                  with imper tinence or contempt!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I am sorry I had not more command of myself, as he had reason, just then, to suppose
               I particu larly meant his sister, which, I am sure, must very much hurt him. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Good Heaven,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "that so much
                  sweetness and merit can fail to excite the love and admiration so justly their
                  due! I cannot,—I dare not express to you half the indignation I feel at this
                  moment!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I am sorry, my Lord,"</q> said I, more calmly, <q rend="inline">
                  "to have raised it; but yet,—in a situation that calls for protection, to meet
                  only with mortifi cations,—indeed I am but ill formed to bear them!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "My <hi>dear</hi> Miss Anville," </q> cried he, warmly, <q
                  rend="inline"> "allow <hi>me</hi> to be your friend; think of me as if I were
                  indeed your brother, and let me entreat you to accept my best services, if there
                  is any thing in <pb n="154"/> which I can be so happy as to shew my regard,—my
                  respect for you!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> Before I had time to speak, the rest of the party entered the parlour, and, as I did
               not wish to see any thing more of Lord Merton, at least before he had slept, I
               determined to leave it. Lord Orville, seeing my design, said, as I passed him, <q
                  rend="inline">"Will you go?"</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Had not I best, my Lord?"</q> said I. <q rend="inline">"I am
                  afraid,"</q> said he, smiling, <q rend="inline"> "since I must now speak as your
                     <hi>brother,</hi> I am afraid you <hi>had;</hi> —you see you may trust me,
                  since I can advise against my own interest." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I then left the room, and have been writing ever since. And methinks I can never
               lament the rudeness of Lord Merton, as it has more than ever confirmed to me the
               esteem of Lord Orville. </p>

            <p> OH Sir, what a strange incident have I to re cite! what a field of conjecture to
               open! </p>
            <p> Yesterday evening, we all went to an assembly. Lord Orville presented tickets to the
               whole fami ly, and did me the honour, to the no small sur prise of all here, I
               believe, to dance with me. But every day abounds in fresh instances of his
               condescending politeness, and he now takes every opportunity of calling me his
                  <hi>friend,</hi> and his <hi>sister.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="155"/> Lord Merton offered a ticket to Lady Louisa; but she was so much
               incensed against him, that she refused it with the utmost disdain; neither could he
               prevail upon her to dance with him; she sat still the whole evening, and deigned not
               to look at, or speak to him. To me, her behaviour is almost the same, for she is
               cold, distant, and haughty, and her eyes express the greatest con tempt. But for Lord
               Orville, how miserable would my residence here make me! </p>
            <p> We were joined, in the ball-room, by Mr. Co verley, Mr. Lovel, and Lord Merton, who
               look ed as if he was doing penance, and sat all the evening next to Lady Louisa,
               vainly endeavouring to appease her anger. </p>
            <p> Lord Orville began the minuets; he danced with a young Lady who seemed to engage the
               ge neral attention, as she had not been seen here before. She is pretty, and looks
               mild and good humoured. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Pray, Mr. Lovel,"</q> said Lady Louisa, <q rend="inline">"who is
                  that?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Miss Belmont,"</q> answered he, <q rend="inline"> "the young
                  heiress; she came to the Wells yesterday." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Struck with the name, I involuntarily repeated it, but nobody heard me. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"What is her family?"</q> said Mrs. Beau mont. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Have you not heard of her, Ma'am?"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline">
                  "she is only daughter and heiress of Sir John Belmont." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Good Heaven, how did I start! the name struck my ear like a thunder-bolt. Mrs. Sel
               wyn, who immediately looked at me, said, <q rend="inline"> "Be calm, my dear, and we
                  will learn the truth of all this." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156"/> Till then, I had never imagined her to be ac quainted with my story;
               but she has since told me, that she knew my unhappy mother, and was well informed of
               the whole affair. </p>
            <p> She asked Mr. Lovel a multitude of questions, and I gathered from his answers, that
               this young Lady was just come from abroad, with Sir John Belmont, who was now in
               London; that she was under the care of his sister, Mrs. Paterson; and that she would
               inherit a considerable estate. </p>
            <p> I cannot express the strange feelings with which I was agitated during this recital.
               What, my dear est Sir, can it possibly mean? Did you ever hear of any
               after-marriage?—or must I suppose, that, while the lawful child is rejected, another
               is adopt ed?—I know not what to think! I am bewildered with a contrariety of ideas! </p>
            <p> When we came home, Mrs. Selwyn passed more than an hour in my room, conversing upon
               this subject. She says that I ought instantly to go to town, find out my father, and
               have the affair cleared up. She assures me I have too strong a resemblance to my
               dear, though unknown mother, to allow of the least hesitation in my being owned, when
               once I am seen. For my part, I have no wish but to act by your direction. </p>
            <p> I can give no account of the evening; so dis turbed, so occupied am I by this
               subject, that I can think of no other. I have entreated Mrs. Sel wyn to observe the
               strictest secrecy, and she has promised that she will. Indeed, she has too much sense
               to be idly communicative. </p>
            <p> Lord Orville took notice of my being absent and silent, but I ventured not to
               entrust him with the cause. Fortunately, he was not of the party at the time Mr.
               Lovel made the discovery. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157"/> Mrs. Selwyn says that if you approve my going to town, she will herself
               accompany me. I had a thousand times rather ask the protection of Mrs. Mirvan, but,
               after this offer, that will not be possible. </p>
            <p> Adieu, my dearest Sir. I am sure you will write immediately, and I shall be all
               impatience till your letter arrives. </p>

            <div type="section">
               <p> GOOD God, my dear Sir, what a wonderful tale have I again to relate! even yet, I
                  am not recovered from my extreme surprise. </p>
               <p> Yesterday morning, as soon as I had finished my hasty letter, I was summoned to
                  attend a walk ing party to the Hotwells. It consisted only of Mrs. Selwyn and Lord
                  Orville. The latter walk ed by my side all the way, and his conversation
                  dissipated my uneasiness, and insensibly restored my serenity. </p>
               <p> At the pump-room, I saw Mr. Macartney; I courtsied to him twice ere he would
                  speak to me. When he did, I began to apologise for having dis appointed him; but I
                  did not find it very easy to excuse myself, as Lord Orville's eyes, with an ex
                  pression of anxiety that distressed me, turned from him to me, and me to him,
                  every word I spoke. Convinced, however, that I had really trifled with <pb n="158"
                  /> Mr. Macartney, I scrupled not to beg his pardon. He was, then, not merely
                  appeased, but even grateful. </p>
               <p> He requested me to see him to-morrow: but I had not the folly to be again guilty
                  of an indis cretion which had, already, caused me so much uneasiness; and
                  therefore, I told him, frankly, that it was not in my power, at present, to see
                  him, but by accident: and, to prevent his being offended, I hinted to him the
                  reason I could not receive him as I wished to do. </p>
               <p> When I had satisfied both him and myself upon this subject, I turned to Lord
                  Orville, and saw, with concern, the gravity of his countenance. I would have
                  spoken to him, but knew not how; I believe, however, he read my thoughts, for in a
                  little time, with a sort of serious smile, he said, <q rend="inline"> "Does not
                     Mr. Macartney complain of his dis appointment?" </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Not much, my Lord."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"And how have you appeased him?"</q> Finding I hesitated what to
                  answer, <q rend="inline">"Am I not your brother?"</q> continued he, <q
                     rend="inline">"and must I not enquire into your affairs?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Certainly, my Lord,"</q> said I, laughing, <q rend="inline"> "I
                     only wish it were better worth your Lord ship's while." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "Let me, then, make immediate use of my privilege. When shall
                     you see Mr. Macartney again?" </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Indeed, my Lord, I can't tell."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "But,—do you know that I shall not suffer <hi>my sister</hi> to
                     make a private appointment?" </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Pray, my Lord,"</q> cried I, earnestly, <q rend="inline"> "use
                     that word no more! indeed you shock me extre mely." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159"/>
                  <q rend="inline">"That would I not do for the world,"</q> cried he; <q
                     rend="inline"> "yet you know not how warmly, how deeply I am interested, not
                     only in all your concerns, but in all your actions." </q>
               </p>
               <p> This speech,—the most particular one Lord Orville had ever made to me, ended our
                  conver sation for that time, for I was too much struck by it to make any answer. </p>
               <p> Soon after, Mr. Macartney, in a low voice, entreated me not to deny him the
                  gratificati on of returning the money. While he was speaking, the young Lady I saw
                  yesterday at the assembly, with a large party, entered the pump-room. Mr.
                  Macartney turned as pale as death, his voice faltered, and he seemed not to know
                  what he said. I was myself almost equally disturbed, by the croud of confused
                  ideas that occured to me. Good Heaven, thought I, why should he be thus agi
                  tated?—is it possible this can be the young Lady he loved? </p>
               <p> In a few minutes, we quitted the pump room, and though I twice wished Mr.
                  Macartney good morning, he was so absent he did not hear me. </p>
               <p> We did not immediately return to Clifton, as Mrs. Selwyn had business at a
                  pamphlet-shop. While she was looking at some new poems, Lord Orville again asked
                  me when I should see Mr. Macartney? </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Indeed, my Lord,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline"> "I know not;
                     but I would give the universe for a few moments conversation with him!" </q> I
                  spoke this with a sim ple sincerity, and was not aware of the force of my own
                  words. </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"The universe!"</q> repeated he, <q rend="inline"> "Good God,
                     Miss Anville, do you say this to <hi>me?</hi> " </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160"/>
                  <q rend="inline">"I would say it,"</q> returned I, <q rend="inline">"to any body,
                     my Lord."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"I beg your pardon,"</q> said he, in a voice that shewed him ill
                  pleased, <q rend="inline">"I am answered!"</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q> cried, I, <q rend="inline"> "you must not judge
                     hardly of me. I spoke inadvertently; but if you knew the painful suspence I
                     suffer at this moment, you would not be surprised at what I have said." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "And would a meeting with Mr. Macartney relieve you from that
                     suspence?" </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "Yes, my Lord, two words might be suffici ent." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Would to Heaven,"</q> cried he, after a short pause, <q
                     rend="inline"> "that I were worthy to know their im port!" </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "Worthy, my Lord!—O, if that were all, your Lordship could ask
                     nothing I should not be ready to answer! if I were but at liberty to speak, I
                     should be <hi>proud</hi> of your Lordship's enquiries; but indeed I am not, I
                     have no right to commu nicate the affairs of Mr. Macartney,—your Lord ship
                     cannot suppose I have." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"I will own to you,"</q> answered he, <q rend="inline"> "I know
                     not <hi>what</hi> to suppose; yet there seems a frankness even in your
                     mystery,—and such an air of open ness in your countenance, that I am willing to
                     hope,—" </q> He stopped a moment, and then added, <q rend="inline"> "This
                     meeting you say, is essential to your re pose?" </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "I did not say <hi>that,</hi> my Lord; but yet I have the most
                     important reasons for wishing to speak to him." </q>
               </p>
               <p> He paused a few minutes, and then said, with warmth, <q rend="inline"> "Yes, you
                        <hi>shall</hi> speak to him!—I will myself assist you!—Miss Anville, I am
                     sure can not form a wish against propriety, I will ask no questions, I will
                     rely upon her own purity; and <pb n="161"/> uninformed, blindfold as I am, I
                     will serve her with all my power!" </q> and then he went into the shop, leaving
                  me so strangely affected by his ge nerous behaviour, that I almost wished to
                  follow him with my thanks. </p>
               <p> When Mrs. Selwyn had transacted her affairs, we returned home. </p>
               <p> The moment dinner was over, Lord Orville went out, and did not come back till
                  just as we were summoned to supper. This is the longest time he has spent from the
                  house since I have been at Clifton, and you cannot imagine, my dear Sir, how much
                  I missed him. I scarce knew before how infinitely I am indebted to him alone for
                  the happiness I have enjoyed since I have been at Mrs. Beaumont's. </p>
               <p> As I generally go down stairs last, he came to me the moment the ladies had
                  passed by, and said, <q rend="inline">"Shall you be at home to-morrow
                     morning?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"I believe so, my Lord."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"And will you, then, receive a visitor for me?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"For you, my Lord!"</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "Yes;—I have made acquaintance with Mr. Macartney, and he has
                     promised to call upon me to-morrow about three o'clock." </q>
               </p>
               <p>And then, taking my hand, he led me down stairs.</p>
               <p> O Sir,—was there ever such another man as Lord Orville?—Yes, <hi>one</hi> other
                  now resides at Berry-Hill! </p>
               <p> This morning there has been a great deal of company here, but at the time
                  appointed by Lord Orville, doubtless with that consideration, the parlour is
                  almost always empty, as every body is dressing. </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162"/> Mrs. Beaumont, however, was not gone up stairs, when Mr. Macartney
                  sent in his name. </p>
               <p> Lord Orville immediately said, <q rend="inline"> "Beg the fa vour of him to walk
                     in. You see, Madam, that I consider myself as at home. </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"I hope so,"</q> answered Mrs. Beaumont, <q rend="inline">"or I
                     should be very uneasy."</q>
               </p>
               <p> Mr. Macartney then entered. I believe we both felt very conscious to whom the
                  visit was paid: but Lord Orville received him as his own guest, and not merely
                  entertained him as such while Mrs. Beaumont remained in the room, but for some
                  time after she went; a delicacy that sav ed me from the embarrassment I should
                  have felt, had he immediately quitted us. </p>
               <p> In a few minutes, however, he gave Mr. Ma cartney a book,—for I, too, by way of
                  pretence for continuing in the room, pretended to be read ing,—and begged he would
                  be so good as to look it over, while he answered a note, which he would dispatch
                  in a few minutes, and return to him. </p>
               <p> When he was gone, we both parted with our books, and Mr. Macartney, again
                  producing the paper with the money, besought me to accept it. </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Pray,</q> "said I, still declining it, <q rend="inline"> "did
                     you know the young lady who came into the pump room yesterday morning? </q>

               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Know her!"</q> repeated he, changing colour, <q rend="inline"
                     >"Oh, but too well!"</q>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">Why, Madam, do you ask?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "I must beseech you to satisfy me further upon this subject;
                     pray tell me who she is." </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline"> "Inviolably as I meant to keep my secret, I can refuse you,
                     Madam, nothing;—that lady <pb n="163"/> —is the daughter of Sir John

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Gracious Heaven!"</q> cried I, involuntarily laying my hand on
                  his arm, <q rend="inline">"you are then—",</q>
                  <hi>my brother,</hi> I would have said, but my voice fail ed me, and I burst into
                  tears. </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Oh, Madam,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline">"what can this
                     mean?—What can thus distress you?"</q>
               </p>
               <p> I could not answer him, but held out my hand to him. He seemed greatly surprised,
                  and talked in high terms of my condescension. </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Spare yourself,"</q> cried I, wiping my eyes, <q rend="inline">
                     "spare yourself this mistake,—you have a <hi>right</hi> to all I can do for
                     you; the similarity of our cir cumstances—" </q>
               </p>
               <p> We were then interrupted by the entrance of Mrs. Selwyn; and Mr. Macartney,
                  finding no probability of our being left alone, was obliged to take leave, tho', I
                  believe, very reluctantly, while in such suspence. </p>
               <p> Mrs. Selwyn then, by dint of interrogatories, drew from me the state of this
                  affair. She is so penetrating, that there is no possibility of evading to give her
                  satisfaction. </p>
               <p> Is not this a strange event? Good Heaven, how little did I think that the visits
                  I so unwilling ly paid at Mr. Branghton's would have introduc ed me to so near a
                  relation! I will never again re gret the time I spent in town this summer: a cir
                  cumstance so fortunate will always make me think of it with pleasure. </p>

            <div type="section">
               <p> I have just received your letter,—and it has al most broken my heart!—Oh! Sir!
                  the illusion is over indeed!—How vainly have I flattered, how <pb n="164"/>
                  miserably deceived myself! Long since, doubtful of the situation of my heart, I
                  dreaded a scruti ny,—but now, now that I have so long escaped, I began indeed, to
                  think my safety insured, to hope that my fears were causeless, and to believe that
                  my good opinion and esteem of Lord Orville might be owned without suspicion, and
                  felt with out danger:—miserably deceived, indeed! </p>
               <p>
                  <hi> His sight is baneful to my repose,—his society is death to my future
                     tranquility! </hi> Oh, Lord Or ville! could I have believed that a friendship
                  so grateful to my heart,—so soothing to my dis tresses,—a friendship which, in
                  every respect, did me so much honour, would only serve to embitter all my future
                  moments!—What a strange, what an unhappy circumstance, that my gratitude, though
                  so justly excited, should be so fatal to my peace! </p>
               <p> Yes, Sir, I <hi>will</hi> quit him;—would to Hea ven I could at this moment!
                  without seeing him again,—without trusting to my now con scious emotion!—Oh, Lord
                  Orville, how little do you know the evils I owe to you! how little suppose, that,
                  when most dignified by your at tention, I was most to be pitied,—and, when most
                  exalted by your notice, you were most my enemy! </p>
               <p> You, Sir, relied upon my ignorance;—I, alas, upon your experience; and, whenever
                  I doubted the weakness of my heart, the idea that <hi>you</hi> did not suspect it,
                  reassured me,—res stored my courage, and confirmed my error!—Yet am I most
                  sensible of the kindness of your silence? </p>
               <p> Oh, Sir! why have I ever quitted you!—why been exposed to dangers to which I am
                  so unequal? </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165"/> But I will leave this place,—leave Lord Or ville,—leave him,
                  perhaps, for ever!—no mat ter; your counsel, your goodness, may teach me how to
                  recover the peace and the serenity of which my unguarded folly has beguiled me. To
                  you alone do I trust,—in you alone confide for every future hope I may form. </p>
               <p> The more I consider of parting with Lord Or vile, the less fortitude do I feel to
                  bear the sepa ration;—the friendship he has shewn me, his po liteness,—his
                  sweetness of manners, his concern in my affairs,—his solicitude to oblige me,—all,
                  all to be given up!— </p>
               <p> No, I cannot tell him I am going,—I dare not trust myself to take leave of him,—I
                  will run away without seeing him:—implicitly will I follow your advice, avoid his
                  sight, and shun his society! </p>
               <p> To-morrow morning I will set off for Berry Hill. Mrs. Selwyn and Mrs. Beaumont
                  shall alone know my intention. And to-day,—I will spend in my own room. The
                  readiness of my obedience is the only atonement I can offer for the weakness which
                  calls for its exertion. </p>
               <p> Can you, will you, most honoured, most dear Sir!—sole prop by which the poor
                  Evelina is supported,—can you, without reproach, without displeasure, receive the
                  child you have so care fully reared,—from whose education better fruit might have
                  been expected, and who, blushing for her unworthiness, fears to meet the eye by
                  which she has been cherished?—Oh yes, I am sure you will! Your Evelina's errors
                  are those of the judgment,—and you, I well know, pardon all but those of the
                  heart! </p>

            <p> I HAVE only time, my dearest Sir, for three words, to overtake my last letter, and
               prevent your expecting me immediately; for, when I communicated my intention to Mrs.
               Sel wyn, she would not hear of it, and declared, it would be highly ridiculous for me
               to go be fore I received an answer to my intelligence, concerning the journey from
               Paris. She has, therefore, insisted upon my waiting till your next letter arrives. I
               hope you will not be displeased at my compliance, though it is rather against my own
               judgment; but Mrs. Selwyn quite overpowered me with the force of her argu ments. I
               will, however, see very little of Lord Orville; I will never come down stairs before
               breakfast; give up all my walks in the garden,—seat myself next to Mrs. Selwyn, and
               not merely avoid his conversation, but shun his presence. I will exert all the
               prudence, and all the resolution in my power,—to prevent this short delay from giving
               you any further uneasiness. </p>
            <p> Adieu, my dearest Sir. I shall not now leave Clifton till I have your directions.

               </dateline>
            </opener>
            <p> YESTERDAY, from the time I received your kind, though heart-piercing letter, I kept
               my room,—for I was equally unable and unwilling to see Lord Orville: but this
               morning, finding I seemed destined to pass a few days longer here, I endeavoured to
               calm my spirits, and to appear as usual; though I determined to avoid him as much as
               should be in my power. Indeed, as I entered the parlour, when called to breakfast, my
               thoughts were so much occupied with your letter, that I felt as much confusion at his
               sight, as if he had himself been informed of its con tents. </p>
            <p> Mrs. Beaumont made me a slight compliment upon my recovery, for I had pleaded
               illness to excuse keeping my room: Lady Louisa spoke not a word: but Lord Orville,
               little imagining himself the cause of my indisposition, enquired concerning my health
               with the most distinguish ing politeness. I hardly made any answer, and, for the
               first time since I have been here, contriv ed to sit at some distance from him. </p>
            <p> I could not help observing that my reserve surprised him; yet he persisted in his
               civilities, and seemed to wish to remove it. But I paid him but very little
               attention; and the moment breakfast was over, instead of taking a book, or walking in
               the garden, I retired to my own room. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="168"/> Soon after, Mrs. Selwyn came to tell me that Lord Orville had been
               proposing I should take an airing, and persuading her to let him drive us both in his
               phaeton. She delivered the mes sage with an archness that made me blush, and added,
               that an airing, in <hi> my Lord Orville's car riage, </hi> could not fail to revive
               my spirits. There is no possibility of escaping her discernment; she has frequently
               rallied me upon his Lordship's at tention,—and, alas!—upon the pleasure with which I
               have received it! However, I absolute ly refused the offer. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Well,"</q> said she, laughing, <q rend="inline"> "I cannot just now
                  indulge you with any solicitation; for, to tell you the truth, I have business to
                  transact at the Wells, and am glad to be excused myself. I would ask you to walk
                  with <hi>me,</hi> —but, since <hi>Lord Orville</hi> is refused, <hi>I</hi> have
                  not the presumption to hope for success." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Indeed,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline"> "you are mistaken; I will
                  attend <hi>you</hi> with pleasure." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O rare coquetry!"</q> cried she, <q rend="inline"> "surely it must
                  be inherent in our sex, or it could not have been imbibed at Berry Hill." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I had not spirits to answer her, and therefore put on my hat and cloak in silence. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I presume,"</q> continued she, drily, <q rend="inline">"his
                  Lordship may walk with us?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"If so, Madam,"</q> said I, <q rend="inline"> "you will have a
                  companion, and I will stay at home." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"My dear child,"</q> cried she, <q rend="inline"> "did you bring the
                  certificate of your birth with you?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Dear Madam, no!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why then, we shall never be known again at Berry Hill." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I felt too conscious to enjoy her pleasantry; but I believe she was determined to
               torment me; <pb n="169"/> for she asked if she should inform Lord Orville that I
               desired him not to be of the party? </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "By no means, Madam;—but, indeed, I had rather not walk myself."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"My dear,"</q> cried she, <q rend="inline"> "I really do not know
                  you this morning,—you have certainly been taking a lesson of Lady Louisa." </q>
            </p>
            <p> She then went down stairs; but presently re turning, told me she had acquainted Lord
               Orville that I did not choose to go out in the phaeton, but preferred a walk,
                  <hi>tete-a-tete</hi> with her, by way of <hi>variety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p> I said nothing, but was really vexed. She bid me go down stairs, and said she would
               follow im mediately. </p>
            <p> Lord Orville met me in the hall. <q rend="inline">"I fear,"</q> said he, <q
                  rend="inline">"Miss Anville is not yet quite well?"</q> and he would have taken my
               hand, but I turned from him, and courtsying slightly, went into the parlour. </p>
            <p> Mrs. Beaumont and Lady Louisa were at work: Lord Merton was talking with the latter;
               for he has now made his peace, and been again received into favour. </p>
            <p> I seated myself, as usual, by the window. Lord Orville, in a few minutes, came to
               me, and said, <q rend="inline">"Why is Miss Anville so grave?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Not grave, my Lord,"</q> said I, <q rend="inline"> "only stu pid;"
               </q> and I took up a book. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"You will go,"</q> said he, after a short pause, <q rend="inline"
                  >"to the assembly to-night?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No, my Lord, certainly not."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Neither, then, will I; for I should be sorry to sully the
                  remembrance I have of the happiness I enjoyed at the last." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Mrs. Selwyn then coming in, general enquiries were made, to all but me, of who would
               go to <pb n="170"/> the assembly. Lord Orville instantly declared he had letters to
               write at home; but every one else <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF"
                  extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ettled to go. </p>
            <p> I then hastened Mrs. Selwyn away, tho' not be fore she had said to Lord Orville, <q
                  rend="inline"> "Pray has your Lordship obtained Miss Anville's leave to favour us
                  with your company?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I have not, Madam,"</q> answered he, <q rend="inline">"had the
                  vanity to ask it."</q>
            </p>
            <p> During our walk, Mrs. Selwyn tormented me unmercifully. She told me, that since I
               declined any addition to our party, I must, doubtless, be conscious of my own powers
               of entertainment; and begged me, therefore, to exert them freely. I repented a
               thousand times having consented to walk alone with her; for though I made the most
               painful efforts to appear in spirits, her raillery quite overpowered me. </p>
            <p> The first place we went to was the pump-room. It was full of company; and the moment
               we en tered, I heard a murmuring of, <q rend="inline"> " <hi>That's she!</hi> " </q>
               and, to my great confusion, I saw every eye turn ed towards me. I pulled my hat over
               my face, and, by the assistance of Mrs. Selwyn, endeavour ed to screen myself from
               observation: neverthe less, I found I was so much the object of general attention,
               that I entreated her to hasten away. But, unfortunately, she had entered into conver
               sation, very earnestly, with a gentleman of her acquaintance, and would not listen to
               me, but said, that if I was tired of waiting, I might walk on to the milliner's with
               the Miss Watkins, two young ladies I had seen at Mrs. Beaumont's who were going
               thither. </p>
            <p> I accepted the offer very readily, and away we went. But we had not gone three
               yards, ere we were followed by a party of young men, who <pb n="171"/> took every
               possible opportunity of looking at us, and, as they walked behind, talked aloud, in a
               manner at once unintelligible and absurd. <q rend="inline">"Yes,"</q> cried one, <q
                  rend="inline">"'tis certainly she!"</q> —mark but her <hi>blushing cheek!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "And then her <hi>eye,</hi> —her <hi>downcast eye!</hi> " </q>
               cried another. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"True, oh most true,"</q> said a third, <q rend="inline">
                  <hi>every beauty is her own!</hi> " </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"But then,"</q> said the first, <q rend="inline"> "her
                     <hi>mind,</hi> —now the difficulty is, to find out the truth of <hi>that,</hi>
                  —for she will not say a word." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "She is <hi>timid,</hi> " </q> answered another; <q rend="inline">
                  "mark but her <hi>timid air.</hi> " </q>
            </p>
            <p> During this conversation, we all walked on, si lent and quick; as we knew not to
               whom it was particularly addressed, we were all equally asham ed, and equally
               desirous to avoid such unaccoun table observations. </p>
            <p> Soon after, we were caught in a violent shower of rain. We hurried on, and the care
               of our cloaths occupying our hands, we were separated from one another. These
               gentlemen offered their services in the most pressing manner, begging us to make use
               of their arms; and two of them were so particularly troublesome to me, that, in my
               haste to avoid them, I unfortunately stumbled, and fell down. They both assisted in
               helping me up; and that very instant, while I was yet between them, upon raising my
               eyes, the first object they met was Sir Clement Willough by! </p>
            <p> He started; so, I am sure, did I. <q rend="inline">"Good God!"</q> exclaimed he,
               with his usual quickness, <q rend="inline">"Miss Anville!—I hope to Heaven you are
                  not hurt?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172"/>
               <q rend="inline">"No,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline"> "not at all; but I am ter ribly
                  dirtied." </q> I then, without much difficulty, disengaged myself from my
               tormentors, who im mediately gave way to Sir Clement, and entirely quitted us. </p>
            <p> He teized me to make use of his arm; and, when I declined it, asked, very
               significantly, if I was much acquainted with those gentlemen who had just left me? </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No,"</q> answered I, <q rend="inline"> "they are quite un known to
                  me." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"And yet,"</q> said he, <q rend="inline"> "you allowed <hi>them</hi>
                  the honour of assisting you. Oh, Miss Anville, to me alone will you ever be thus
                  cruel?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Indeed, Sir Clement, their assistance was <hi>forced</hi> upon me,
                  for I would have given the world to have avoided them." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Good God!"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "why did I not sooner
                  know your situation?—But I only arrived here this morning, and I had not even
                  learnt where you lodged." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Did you know, then, that I was at Bris tol?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Would to Heaven,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "that I
                     <hi>could</hi> remain in ignorance of your proceedings with the same
                  contentment you do of mine! then should I not for ever journey upon the wings of
                  hope, to meet my own despair! <hi>You</hi> cannot even judge of the cruelty of my
                  fate, for the ease and serenity of your mind, incapacitates you from feel ing for
                  the agitation of mine." </q>
            </p>
            <p> The ease and serenity of <hi>my</hi> mind! alas, how little do I merit those words! </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"But;"</q> added he, <q rend="inline"> "had <hi>accident</hi>
                  brought me hither, had I not known of your journey, the voice of fame would have
                  proclaimed it to me in stantly upon my arrival." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"The voice of fame!"</q> repeated I. </p>

               <pb n="173"/>
               <q rend="inline"> "Yes, for your's was the first name I heard at the pump-room. But,

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Indeed,"</q> said I, <q rend="inline">"I do not understand
                  you."</q> But, just then arriving at the milliner's, our con versation ended; for
               I ran up stairs to wipe the dirt off my gown. I should have been glad to have
               remained there till Mrs. Selwyn came, but the Miss Watkins called me into the shop,
               to look at caps and ribbons. </p>
            <p> I found Sir Clement busily engaged in looking at lace ruffles. Instantly, however,
               approaching me, <q rend="inline">"How charmed I am,"</q> said he, <q rend="inline">
                  "to see you look so well! I was told you were ill,—but I never saw you in better
                  health,—never more infi nitely lovely!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I turned away to examine the ribbons, and soon after Mrs. Selwyn made her
               appearance. I found that she was acquainted with Sir Clement, and her manner of
               speaking to him, convinced me that he was a favourite with her. </p>
            <p> When their mutual compliments were over, she turned to me, and said, <q
                  rend="inline"> "Pray, Miss An ville, how long can you live without nourish ment?"
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Indeed, Ma'am,"</q> said I, laughing, <q rend="inline">"I have

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Because so long, and no longer,"</q> answered she, <q rend="inline"

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why, what is the matter, Ma'am?"</q>

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174"/> I begged her to explain herself: and she then told me, that a copy of
               verses had been dropt in the pump-room, and read there aloud: <q rend="inline">"The
                  beauties of the well,"</q> said she, <q rend="inline"> "are all menti oned, but

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Is it then possible,"</q> cried Sir Clement, <q rend="inline">"that

            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I hardly know,"</q> answered I, <q rend="inline"> "whether

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I assure you,"</q> said Mrs. Selwyn, <q rend="inline"> "if you give

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I wrote down in my tablets,"</q> said Sir Cle ment, <q
                  rend="inline"> "the stanzas which concern Miss Anville, this morning at the
                  pump-room; and I will do myself the honour of copying them for her this evening."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "But why the part that concerned <hi> Miss Anvil le? </hi> " </q>
               said Mrs. Selwyn; <q rend="inline">"Did you ever see her before this morning?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Oh yes,"</q> answered he, <q rend="inline"> "I have had that
                  happiness frequently at Captain Mirvan's. Too, too frequently!" </q> added he, in
               a low voice, as Mrs. Selwyn turned to the milliner: and, as soon as she was occupied
               in examining some trimmings, he came to me, and, almost whe ther I would or not,
               entered into conversation with me. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I have a thousand things,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline">"to say

            </p>
            <p> Mrs. Selwyn then advancing to us, he assumed a more disengaged air, and asked if he
               should not have the pleasure of seeing her, in the evening, at the assembly? </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Oh yes,"</q> cried she, <q rend="inline"> "we shall certainly be

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I hope, then,"</q> returned he, <q rend="inline">"that you will do

            </p>
            <p> I thanked him, but said I should not be at the assembly. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Not be at the assembly!"</q> cried Mrs. Selwyn, <q rend="inline">
                  "Why, have <hi>you,</hi> too, letters to write?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> She looked at me with a significant archness that made me colour; and I hastily
               answered, <q rend="inline">"No, indeed, Ma'am!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"You have not!"</q> cried she, yet more drily, <q rend="inline">
                  "then pray, my dear, do you stay at home to <hi>help,</hi> —or to <hi>hinder</hi>
                  others?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="176"/>
               <q rend="inline">"To do neither, Ma'am,"</q> answered I, in much confusion; <q
                  rend="inline"> "so, if you please, I will <hi>not</hi> stay at home." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"You allow me, then,"</q> said Sir Clement, <q rend="inline">"to
                  hope for the honour of your hand?"</q>
            </p>
            <p> I only bowed,—for the dread of Mrs. Selwyn's raillery made me not dare to refuse
               him. </p>
            <p> Soon after this, we walked home; Sir Cle ment accompanied us, and the conversation
               that passed between Mrs. Selwyn and him was sup ported in so lively a manner, that I
               should have been much entertained, had my mind been more at ease: but alas! I could
               think of nothing but the capricious, the unmeaning appearance which the alteration in
               my conduct must make in the eyes of Lord Orville! And, much as I wish to avoid him,
               greatly as I desire to save myself from having my weakness known to him,—yet I can
               not endure to incur his ill opinion,—and, unac quainted as he is with the reasons by
               which I am actuated, how can he fail contemning a change, to him so unaccountable? </p>
            <p> As we entered the garden, he was the first ob ject we saw. He advanced to meet us,
               and I could not help observing, that at sight of each other, both he and Sir Clement
               changed colour. </p>
            <p> We went into the parlour, where we found the same party we had left. Mrs. Selwyn
               presented Sir Clement to Mrs. Beaumont; Lady Louisa and Lord Merton he seemed well
               acquainted with already. </p>
            <p> The conversation was upon the general subjects, of the weather, the company at the
               Wells, and the news of the day. But Sir Clement, drawing his chair next to mine, took
               every opportunity of addressing himself to me in particular. </p>
            <p> I could not but remark the striking difference of <pb n="177"/>
               <hi>his</hi> attention, and that of Lord Orville: the lat ter has such gentleness of
               manners, such delicacy of conduct, and an air so respectful, that, when he flatters
               most, he never distresses, and when he most confers honour, appears to receive it!
               The former <hi>obtrudes</hi> his attention, and <hi>forces</hi> mine; it is so
               pointed, that it always confuses me, and so public, that it attracts general notice.
               Indeed I have sometimes thought that he would rather <hi>wish,</hi> than dislike to
               have his partiality for me known, as he takes great care to prevent my be ing spoken
               to by any body but himself. </p>
            <p> When, at length, he went away, Lord Or ville took his seat, and said with a
               half-smile, <q rend="inline"> "Shall <hi>I</hi> call Sir Clement,—or will
                     <hi>you</hi> call me an usurper, for taking this place?—You make me no
                  answer?—Must I then suppose that Sir Clement—" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"It is little worth your Lordship's while,"</q> said I, <q
                  rend="inline"> "to suppose any thing upon so insignificant an occasion." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Pardon me,"</q> cried he,— <q rend="inline"> "to <hi>me</hi>
                  nothing is insignificant in which you are concerned." </q>
            </p>
            <p> To this I made no answer, neither did he say any thing more, till the ladies retired
               to dress; and then, when I would have followed them, he stopped me, saying, <q
                  rend="inline">"One moment, I entreat you!"</q>
            </p>
            <p> I turned back, and he went on. <q rend="inline"> "I greatly fear that I have been so

                  know not how to suppose it possible I can un wittingly have done the thing in the
                  world that, designedly, I would most wish to avoid." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No, indeed, my Lord, you have not!"</q> said I. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"You sigh,"</q> cried he, taking my hand, <pb n="178"/>
               <q rend="inline"> "would to Heaven I were the sharer of your un easiness whencesoever
                  it springs! with what earn estness would I not struggle to alleviate it!—Tell me,
                  my dear Miss Anville,—my new-adopted sis ter, my sweet and most amiable
                  friend!—tell me, I beseech you, if I can afford you any assistance?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"None, none, my Lord!"</q> cried I, with drawing my hand, and moving
               towards the door. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Is it then impossible I can serve you?—per haps you wish to see
                  Mr. Macartney again?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No, my Lord."</q> And I held the door open. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "I am not, I own, sorry for that. Yet, oh, Miss Anville, there
                     <hi>is</hi> a question,—there is a con jecture,—I know not how to mention,
                  because I dread the result!—But I see you are in haste;—perhaps in the evening I
                  may have the honour of a longer conversation.—Yet one thing will you have the
                  goodness to allow me to ask?—Did you, this morning when you went to the Wells,—did
                  you <hi>know</hi> who you should meet there?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Who, my Lord?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "I beg your pardon a thonsand times for a curiosity so
                  unlicensed,—but I will say no more at present." </q>
            </p>
            <p> He bowed, expecting me to go,—and then, with quick steps, but a heavy heart, I came
               to my own room. His question, I am sure, meant Sir Clement Willoughby; and, had I not
               impos ed upon upon myself the severe task of avoiding, flying Lord Orville with all
               my power, I would instantly have satisfied him of my ignorance of Sir Clement's
               journey. And yet more did I long to say something of the assembly, since I found he
               depended upon my spending the evening at home. </p>
            <p> I did not go down stairs again till the family was assembled to dinner. My dress, I
               saw, struck Lord Orville with astonishment; and I was my self <pb n="179"/> so much
               ashamed of appearing whimsical and unsteady, that I could not look up. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I understood,"</q> said Mrs. Beaumont, <q rend="inline">"that Miss
                  Anville did not go out this evening?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Her intention in the morning,"</q> said Mrs. Selwyn, <q
                  rend="inline"> was to stay at home; but there is a fas cinating power in an
                     <hi>assembly,</hi> which upon second thoughts, is not to be resisted." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"The assembly!"</q> cried Lord Orville, <q rend="inline">"are you
                  then going to the assembly?"</q>
            </p>
            <p> I made no answer; and we all took our places at table. </p>
            <p> It was not without difficulty that I contrived to give up my usual seat; but I was
               determined to adhere to the promise in my yesterday's letter, though I saw that Lord
               Orville seemed quite con founded at my visible endeavours to avoid him. </p>
            <p> After dinner, we all went into the drawing room together, as there were no gentlemen
               to de tain his Lordship; and then, before I could place myself out of his way, he
               said, <q rend="inline"> "You are then really going to the assembly?—May I ask if you
                  shall dance?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I believe not,—my Lord."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"If I did not fear,"</q> continued he, <q rend="inline"> "that you
                  would be tired of the same partner at two follow ing assemblies, I would give up
                  my letter-writing till to-morrow, and solicit the honour of your hand." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "If I <hi>do</hi> dance," </q> said I, in great confusion, <q
                  rend="inline">"I believe I am engaged."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Engaged!"</q> cried he, with earnestness, <q rend="inline">"May I
                  ask to whom?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"To—Sir Clement Willoughby, my Lord?"</q>
            </p>
            <p> He said nothing, but looked very little pleased, and did not address himself to me
               any more all the <pb n="180"/> afternoon. Oh, Sir!—thus situated, how com fortless
               were the feelings of your Evelina! </p>
            <p> Early in the evening, with his accustomed assiduity, Sir Clement came to conduct us
               to the assembly. He soon contrived to seat himself next me, and, in a low voice, paid
               me so many compliments, that I knew not which way to look. </p>
            <p> Lord Orville hardly spoke a word, and his countenance was grave and thoughtful; yet
               when ever I raised my eyes, his, I perceived, were di rected towards me, though
               instantly, upon meet ing mine, he looked another way. </p>
            <p> In a short time, Sir Clement, taking from his pocket a folded paper, said, almost in
               a whis per, <q rend="inline"> "Here, loveliest of women, you will see a faint, a
                  successless attempt, to paint the ob ject of all my adoration! yet, weak as are
                  the lines for the purpose, I envy beyond expres sion the happy mortal who has
                  dared make the effort." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I will look at them,"</q> said I, <q rend="inline">"some other
                  time."</q> For, conscious that I was observed by Lord Orville, I could not bear he
               should see me take a written paper, so privately offered, from Sir Clement. But Sir
               Clement is an im practicable man, and I never yet succeeded in any attempt to
               frustrate whatever he had plan ned. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No,"</q> said he, still in a whisper, <q rend="inline">"you must
                  take it now, while Lady Louisa is away,"</q> (for she and Mrs. Selwyn were gone up
               stairs to finish their dress,) <q rend="inline">"as she must by no means see
                  them."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Indeed,"</q> said I, <q rend="inline">"I have no intention to shew
                  them."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="181"/>
               <q rend="inline">"But the only way,"</q> answered he, <q rend="inline"> "to avoid
                  suspicion, is to take them in her ab sence. I would have read them aloud myself,
                  but that they are not proper to be seen by any body in this house, yourself and
                  Mrs. Selwyn excepted." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Then again he presented me the paper, which I now was obliged to take, as I found
               declin ing it was vain. But I was sorry that this action should be seen, and the
               whispering remarked, though the purport of the conversation was left to conjecture. </p>
            <p> As I held it in my hand, Sir Clement teaz ed me to look at it immediately; and told
               me, that the reason he could not produce the lines publicly, was, that, among the
               ladies who were mentioned, and supposed to be rejected, was Lady Louisa Larpent. I am
               much concerned at this circumstance, as I cannot doubt but that it will render me
               more disagreeable to her than ever, if she should hear of it. </p>
            <p> I will now copy the verses, which Sir Clement would not let me rest till I had read. </p>
            <q>
               <lg>
                  <l>SEE, last advance, with bashful grace,</l>
                  <l>Downcast eye, and blushing cheek,</l>
                  <l>Timid air, and beauteous face,</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Though ev'ry beauty is her own,</l>
                  <l>And though her mind each virtue fills,</l>
                  <l>Anville,—to her power unknown,</l>
                  <l>Artless, strikes,—unconscious kills!</l>
               </lg>
            </q>
            <p> I am sure, my dear Sir, you will not won der that a panegyric such as this, should,
               in <pb n="182"/> reading, give me the greatest confusion; and, un fortunately, before
               I had finished it, the ladies re turned </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"What have you there, my dear?"</q> said Mrs. Selwyn. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Nothing, Ma'am,"</q> said I, hastily solding, and putting it in my
               pocket. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "And has <hi>nothing,</hi> " </q> cried she, <q rend="inline"> "the
                  power of <hi>rouge?</hi> " </q>
            </p>
            <p> I made no answer; a deep sigh which escap ed Lord Orville, at that moment, reached
               my ears, and gave me sensations—which I dare not mention! </p>
            <p> Lord Merton then handed Lady Louisa, and Mrs. Beaumont, to the latter's carriage.
               Mrs. Selwyn led the way to Sir Clement's, who handed me in after her. </p>
            <p> During the ride, I did not once speak; but when I came to the assembly-room, Sir
               Clement took care that I should not preserve my silence. He asked me immediately to
               dance; I begged him to excuse me, and seek some other partner. But on the contrary,
               he told me he was very glad I would sit still, as he had a million of things to say
               to me. </p>
            <p> He then began to tell me how much he had suf fered from absence; how greatly he was
               alarmed when he heard I had left town, and how cruelly difficult he had found it to
               trace me; which, at last, he could only do by sacrificing another week to Captain
               Mirvan. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"And Howard Grove,"</q> still continued he, <q rend="inline">
                  "which, at my first visit, I thought the most delightful spot upon earth, now
                  appeared to be the most dismal; the face of the country seemed al tered: the
                  walks, which I had thought most pleasant, were now most stupid: Lady Howard, <pb
                     n="183"/> who had appeared a chearful and respectable old lady, now seemed in
                  the common John Trot style of other aged dames: Mrs. Mirvan, whom I had esteemed
                  as an amiable piece of still-life, now became so insipid, that I could hardly keep
                  awake in her company: the daughter too, whom I had regarded as a good-humoured,
                  pretty sort of girl, now seemed too insignificant for no tice: and as to the
                  Captain, I had always thought him a booby,—but now, he appeared a sa vage!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Indeed, Sir Clement,"</q> cried I, angrily, <q rend="inline"> "I
                  will not hear you talk thus of my best friends." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I beg your pardon,"</q> said he, <q rend="inline"> "but the con
                  trast of my two visits was too striking, not to be mentioned." </q>
            </p>
            <p>He then asked me what I thought of the verses?</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Either,"</q> said I, <q rend="inline"> "that they are written iron
                  ically, or by some madman." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Such a profusion of compliments ensued, that I was obliged to propose dancing, in my
               own de fence. When we stood up, <q rend="inline">"I intended,"</q> said he, <q
                  rend="inline"> "to have discovered the author by his looks; but I find you so much
                  the general load stone of attention, that my suspicions change their object every
                  moment. Surely you must your self have some knowledge who he is?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I told him, No. But, my dear Sir, I must own to you, I have no doubt but that Mr.
               Macartney, must be the author; no one else would speak of me so partially; and,
               indeed, his poetical turn puts it, with me, beyond dis pute. </p>
            <p> He asked me a thousand questions concerning Lord Orville; how long he had been at
               Bristol? <pb n="184"/> —what time I had spent at Clifton?—whether he rode out every
               morning?—whether I ever trusted myself in a phaeton?—and a multitude of other
               enquiries, all made with his usual freedom and impetuosity. </p>
            <p> Fortunately, as I much wished to retire early, Lady Louisa makes a point of being
               among the first who quit the rooms, and therefore we got home in very tolerable time. </p>
            <p> Lord Orville's reception of us was grave and cold: far from distinguishing me, as
               usual, by particular civilities, Lady Louisa herself could not have seen me enter the
               room with more fri gid unconcern, nor have more scrupulously a voided honouring me
               with any notice. But, chiefly I was struck to see, that he suffered Sir Clement, who
               stayed supper, to sit between us, without any effort to prevent him, though, till
               then, he had seemed to be even tenacious of a seat next mine. </p>
            <p> This little circumstance affected me more than I can express: yet I endeavoured to
                  <hi> re joice </hi> at it, since neglect and indifference from him may be my best
               friends.—But, alas!—so suddenly, so abruptly to forfeit his attention!—to lose his
               friendship!—Oh, Sir, these thoughts pierced my soul!—scarce could I keep my seat; for
               not all my efforts could restrain the tears from trickling down my cheeks: however,
               as Lord Orville saw them not, (for Sir Clement's head was constantly between us,) I
               tried to col lect my spirits, and succeeded so far as to keep my seat with decency,
               till Sir Clement took leave: and then, not daring to trust my eyes to meet those of
               Lord Orville, I retired. </p>
            <p> I have been writing ever since; for, certain that I could not sleep, I would not go
               to bed. <pb n="185"/> Tell me, my dearest Sir, if you possibly can, tell me that you
               approve my change of con duct,—tell me that my altered behaviour to Lord Orville is
               right,—that my flying his soci ety, and avoiding his civilities, are actions which
                  <hi>you</hi> would have dictated.—Tell me this, and the sacrifices I have made
               will comfort me in the midst of my regret,—for never, never can I cease to regret
               that I have lost the friendship of Lord Orville!—Oh, Sir, I have slighted,—have
               rejected,—have thrown it away!—No matter; it was an honour I merited not to pre
               serve, and I now see,—that my mind was une qual to sustaining it without danger. </p>
            <p> Yet, so strong is the desire you have implant ed in me, to act with uprightness and
               propriety, that, however the weakness of my heart may distress and afflict me, it
               will never, I humbly trust, render me wilfully culpable. The wish of doing well
               governs every other, as far as concerns my conduct,—for am I not <hi>your</hi>
               child?—the creature of your own forming?—Yet, oh Sir, friend, parent of my heart!—my
               feel ings are all at war with my duties; and, while I most struggle to acquire
               self-approbation, my peace, my hopes, my happiness,—are lost! </p>
            <p> 'Tis you alone can compose a mind so cruelly agitated; you, I well know, can feel
               pity for the weakness to which you are a stranger; and, though you blame the
               affliction, soothe and com fort the afflicted. </p>

            <p> YOUR last communication, my dearest child, is indeed astonishing; that an
               acknowledged daughter, and heiress of Sir John Belmont should be at Bristol, and
               still my Evelina bear the name of Anville, is to me inexplicable; yet the mys tery of
               the letter to Lady Howard prepared me to expect something extraordinary upon Sir John
               Belmont's return to England. </p>
            <p> Whoever this young lady may be, it is cer tain she now takes a place to which you
               have a right indisputable. An <hi>after-marriage</hi> I never heard of; yet,
               supposing such a one to have hap pened, Miss Evelyn was certainly the first wife, and
               therefore her daughter must, at least, be en titled to the name of Belmont. </p>
            <p> Either there are circumstances in this affair at present utterly incomprehensible,
               or else some strange and most atrocious fraud has been prac tised; which of these two
               is the case, it now be hoves us to enquire. </p>
            <p> My reluctance to this step, gives way to my conviction of its propriety, since the
               reputation of your dear, and much-injured mother must now either be fully cleared
               from blemish, or receive its final and indelible wound. </p>
            <p> The public appearance of a daughter of Sir John Belmont will revive the remembrance
               of Miss Evelyn's story to all who have heard it,—who the <hi>mother</hi> was, will be
               universally demanded, <pb n="187"/> —and if any other Lady Belmont shall be
               named,—the birth of my Evelina will receive a stigma, against which, honour, truth,
               and in nocence, may appeal in vain! a stigma which will eternally blast the fair fame
               of her vir tuous mother, and cast upon her blameless self, the odium of a title,
               which not all her purity can rescue from established shame and dis honour. </p>
            <p> No, my dear child, no; I will not quietly suffer the ashes of your mother to be
               treated with ignominy. Her spotless character shall be justi fied to the world,—her
               marriage shall be ac knowledged, and her child shall bear the name to which she is
               lawfully entitled. </p>
            <p> It is true, that Mrs. Mirvan would conduct this affair with more delicacy than Mrs.
               Sel wyn;—yet, perhaps, to save time, is of all considerations, the most important,
               since the longer this mystery is suffered to continue, the more difficult my be
               rendered its expla nation. The sooner, therefore, my dear, you can set out for town,
               the less formidable will be your task. </p>
            <p> Let not your timidity, my dear love, depress your spirits: I shall, indeed, tremble
               for you, at a meeting so singular, and so affecting, yet there can be no doubt of the
               success of your application:—I enclose a letter from your un happy mother, written,
               and reserved purpose ly, for this occasion: Mrs. Clinton, too, who attended her in
               her last illness, must accom pany you to town.—But, without any other certificate of
               your birth, that which you carry in your countenance, as it could not be effected by
               artifice, so it cannot admit of the smallest doubt. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188"/> And now, my Evelina, committed, at length, to the care of your real
               parent, receive the fer vent prayers, wishes, and blessings, of him who so fondly
               adopted you! </p>
            <p> May'st thou, oh child of my bosom! may'st thou, in this change of situation,
               experience no change of disposition! but receive with humility, and support with
               meekness, the elevation to which thou art rising! May thy manners, language, and
               deportment, all evince that modest equanimi ty, and chearful gratitude, which not
               merely de serve, but dignify prosperity! May'st thou, to the last moments of an
               unblemished life, retain thy genuine simplicity, thy singleness of heart, thy
               guileless sincerity! and may'st thou, stranger to ostentation, and superior to
               insolence, with true greatness of soul, shine forth conspicuous on ly in beneficence! </p>

            <p> IN the firm hope that the moment of anguish which approaches will prove the period
               of my suf ferrings, once more I address myself to Sir John Belmont, in behalf of the
               child, who, if it sur vives its mother, will hereafter be the bearer of this letter. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="189"/> Yet in what terms,—oh most cruel of men!—can the lost Caroline address
               you, and not ad dress you in vain? Oh deaf to the voice of com passion,—deaf to the
               sting of truth,—deaf to every tie of honour,—say, in what terms may the lost Caroline
               address you, and not address you in vain? </p>
            <p> Shall I call you by the loved, the respected ti tle of husband?—No, you disclaim
               it!—the fa ther of my infant?—No, you doom it to infamy!—the lover who rescued me
               from a forced mar riage?—No, you have yourself betrayed me!—the friend from whom I
               hoped succour and protec tion?—No, you have consigned me to misery and destruction! </p>
            <p> Oh hardened against every plea of justice, re morse, or pity! how, and in what
               manner, may I hope to move thee? Is there one method I have left untried? remains
               there one resource unessayed? No; I have exhausted all the bit terness of reproach,
               and drained every sluice of compassion! </p>
            <p> Hopeless, and almost desperate, twenty times have I flung away my pen;—but the
               feelings of a mother, a mother agonizing for the fate of her child, again animating
               my courage, as often I have resumed it. </p>
            <p> Perhaps when I am no more, when the measure of my woes is compleated, and the still,
               silent, un reproaching dust has received my sad remains,—then, perhaps, when
               accusation is no longer to be feared, nor detection to be dreaded, the voice of
               equity, and the cry of nature may be heard. </p>
            <p> Listen, oh Belmont, to their dictates! repro bate not your child, though you have
               reprobated its mother. The evils that are past, perhaps, <pb n="190"/> when too late,
               you may wish to recall; the young creature you have persecuted, perhaps, when too
               late, you may regret that you have destroyed;—you may think with horror of the
               deceptions you have practised, and the pangs of remorse may follow me to the tomb:—oh
               Belmont, all my re sentment softens into pity at the thought! what will become of
               thee, good Heaven, when with the eye of penitence, thou reviewest thy past con duct! </p>
            <p> Hear, then, the solemn, the last address with which the unhappy Caroline will
               importune thee. </p>
            <p> If, when the time of thy contrition arrives,—for arrive it must!—when the sense of
               thy trea chery shall rob thee of almost every other, if then thy tortured heart shall
               sigh to expiate thy guilt,—mark the conditions upon which I leave thee my
               forgiveness. </p>
            <p> Thou know'st I am thy wife!—clear, then to the world the reputation thou hast
               sullied, and re ceive as thy lawful successor the child who will present thee this my
               dying request. </p>
            <p> The worthiest, the most benevolent, the best of men, to whose consoling kindness I
               owe the little tranquility I have been able to preserve, has plighted me his faith
               that, upon no other conditi ons, he will part with his helpless charge. </p>
            <p> Should'st thou, in the features of this deserted innocent, trace the resemblance of
               the wretched Caroline,—should its face bear the marks of its birth, and revive in thy
               memory the image of its mother, wilt thou not, Belmont, wilt thou not therefore
               renounce it?—Oh babe of my fondest affection! for whom already I experience all the
               tenderness of maternal pity!—look not like thy unfortunate mother,—left the parent
               whom the <pb n="191"/> hand of death may spare, shall be snatched from thee by the
               more cruel means of unnatural anti pathy! </p>
            <p> I can write no more. The small share of se renity I have painfully acquired, will
               not bear the shock of the dreadful ideas that crowd upon me. </p>
            <p>Adieu,—for ever!—</p>
            <p> Yet oh!—shall I not, in this last farewell, which thou wilt not read till every
               stormy passion is extinct,—and the kind grave has embosomed all my sorrows,—shall I
               not offer to the man once so dear to me, a ray of consolation to those afflictions he
               has in reserve? Suffer me, then, to tell thee, that my pity far exceeds my
               indignation,—that I will pray for thee in my last moments,—and that the recollection
               of the love I once bore thee, shall swallow up every other! </p>
            <p>Once more, adieu!</p>

               <p> THIS morning I saw from my window, that Lord Orville was walking in the garden;
                  but I would not go down stairs till breakfast was ready: and then, he paid me his
                  compliments almost as coldly as Lady Louisa paid her's. </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="192"/> I took my usual place, and Mrs. Beaumont, Lady Louisa, and Mrs.
                  Selwyn, entered into their usual conversation.—Not so your Evelina: disre garded,
                  silent, and melancholy, she sat like a cy pher, whom to nobody belonging, by
                  nobody was noticed. </p>
               <p> Ill brooking such a situation, and unable to sup port the neglect of Lord
                  Orville, the moment breakfast was over, I left the room; and was going up stairs,
                  when, very unpleasantly, I was stopped by Sir Clement Willoughby, who, flying into
                  the hall, prevented my proceeding. </p>
               <p> He enquired very particularly after my health, and entreated me to return into
                  the parlour. Un willingly I consented, but thought any thing pre ferable to
                  continuing alone with him; and he would neither leave me, nor suffer me to pass
                  on. Yet, in returning, I felt not a little ashamed of appearing thus to take the
                  visit of Sir Cle ment to myself. And, indeed, he took pains, by his manner of
                  addressing me, to give it that air. </p>
               <p> He stayed, I believe, two hours; nor would he, perhaps, even then have gone, had
                  not Mrs. Beaumont broken up the party, by proposing an airing in her coach. Lady
                  Louisa consented to accompany her: but Mrs. Selwyn, when applied to, said, <q
                     rend="inline"> "If my Lord, or Sir Clement, will join us, I shall be happy to
                     make one;—but really, a trio of females will be nervous to the last degree."
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p> Sir Clement readily agreed to attend them; indeed, he makes it his evident study
                  to court the favour of Mrs. Beaumont. Lord Orville excused himself from going out;
                  and I retired to my own room. What he did with himself I know not, for I would not
                  go down stairs till din ner <pb n="193"/> was ready: his coldness, though my own
                  change of behaviour has occasioned it, so cruelly depresses my spirits, that I
                  know not how to sup port myself in his presence. </p>
               <p> At dinner, I found Sir Clement again of the party. Indeed he manages every thing
                  his own way; for Mrs. Beaumont, though by no means easy to please, seems quite at
                  his disposal. </p>
               <p> The dinner, the afternoon, and the evening, were to me the most irksome
                  imaginable: I was tormented by the assiduity of Sir Clement, who not only
                     <hi>took,</hi> but <hi>made</hi> opportunities of speaking to me,—and I was
                  hurt,—oh how inexpressibly hurt!—that Lord Orville not only forbore, as hi therto,
                     <hi>seeking,</hi> he even <hi>neglected</hi> all occasions of talking with me! </p>
               <p> I begin to think, my dear Sir, that the sudden alteration in my behaviour was ill
                  judged and im proper; for, as I had received no offence, as the cause of the
                  change was upon <hi>my</hi> account, not <hi>his,</hi> I should not have assumed,
                  so abruptly, a reserve for which I dared assign no reason,—nor have shun ned his
                  presence so obviously, without considering the strange appearance of such a
                  conduct. </p>
               <p> Alas, my dearest Sir, that my reflections should always be too late to serve me!
                  dearly, indeed, do I purchase experience! and much I fear I shall suffer yet more
                  severely, from the heedless indis cretion of my temper, ere I attain that prudence
                  and consideration, which, by foreseeing distant consequences, may rule and direct
                  in present ex igencies. </p>

               <p> Yesterday morning, every body rode out, ex cept Mrs. Selwyn and myself: and we
                  two sat for some time together in her room; but as soon as I <pb n="194"/> could,
                  I quitted her, to saunter in the garden; for she diverts herself so unmercifully
                  with rally ing me, either upon my gravity,—or concerning Lord Orville,—that I
                  dread having any conversa tion with her. </p>
               <p> Here I believe I spent an hour by myself; when, hearing the garden-gate open, I
                  went into an arbour at the end of a long walk, where ruminating, very
                  unpleasantly, upon my future prospects, I remained quietly seated but a few
                  minutes, ere I was interrupted by the appearance of Sir Clement Willoughby. </p>
               <p> I started; and would have left the arbour, but he prevented me. Indeed I am
                  almost certain he had heard in the house where I was, as it is not, otherwise,
                  probable he would have strolled down the garden alone. </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Stop, stop,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "loveliest and most

               </p>
               <p> Then, making me keep my place, he sat down by me, and would have taken my hand;
                  but I drew it back, and said I could not stay. </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Can you, then,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "refuse me even

                     will themselves be the last to discover it." </q>

               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"How little,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline"> "are those Ladies

                  entreated her, in a manner hardly to be understood, to walk towards the ar bour.
                  She asked no questions, for she is quick as lightening in taking a hint, but
                  instantly hastened into the garden. </p>
               <p> Imagine, my dear Sir, how wretched I must be till I saw her return! scarce could

               <p> And, now, my dear Sir, I have a conversation to write, the most interesting to me
                  that I ever heard. The comments and questions with which Mrs. Selwyn interrupted

                  deliberately art ful, though so flighty! Greatly, however, is he mistaken, all
                  confident as he seems, for the girl, obscure, poor, dependent as she is, far from
                  wish ing the honour of his alliance, would, not only <hi>now,</hi> but
                     <hi>always</hi> have rejected it. </p>
               <p> As to Lord Orville,—but I will not trust my pen to mention him,—tell me, my dear
                  Sir, what <hi>you</hi> think of him?—tell me if he is not the no blest of men?—and
                  if you can either wonder at, or blame my admiration? </p>
               <p> The idea of being seen by either party, im mediately after so singular a
                  conversation, was both awkward and distressing to me; but I was obliged to appear
                  at dinner. Sir Clement, I saw was absent and uneasy; he watched me, he watch ed
                  Lord Orville, and was evidently disturbed in his mind. Whenever he spoke to me, I
                  turned <pb n="203"/> from him with undisguised disdain, for I am too much
                  irritated against him, to bear with his ill meant assiduities any longer. </p>
               <p> But, not once,—not a moment did I dare meet the eyes of Lord Orville! All
                  consciousness my self, I dreaded his penetration, and directed mine every way—but
                  towards his. The rest of the day, I never quitted Mrs. Selwyn. </p>
               <p> Adieu, my dear Sir: to-morrow I expect your directions whether I am to return to
                  Berry Hill, or once more visit London. </p>

            <p> AND now, my dearest Sir, if the perturba tion of my spirits will allow me, I will
               finish my last letter from Clifton Hill. </p>
            <p> This morning, though I did not go down stairs early, I was the only person in the
               parlour when Lord Orville entered it. I felt no small confusion at seeing him alone,
               after having so long and successfully avoided such a meeting. As soon as the usual
               compliments were over, I would have left the room, but he stopped me by saying, <q
                  rend="inline">"If I disturb you, Miss Anville, I am gone."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q> said I, rather embarrassed, <q rend="inline">"I was
                  just going."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I flattered myself,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "I should have
                  had a moment's conversation with you." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="204"/> I then turned back; and he seemed himself in some perplexity: but after
               a short pause, <q rend="inline">"You are very good,"</q> said he, <q rend="inline">
                  "to indulge my re quest; I have, indeed, for some time past, most ardently desired
                  an opportunity of speaking to you." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Again he paused; but I said nothing, so he went on. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "You allowed me, Madam, a few days since, you allowed me to lay
                  claim to your friendship,—to interest myself in your concerns,—to call you by the
                  affectionate title of sister,—and the ho nour you did me, no man could have been
                  more sensible of; I am ignorant, therefore, how I have been so unfortunate as to
                  forfeit it:—but at present, all is changed! you fly me,—your averted eye shuns to
                  meet mine, and you sedulous ly avoid my conversation." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I was extremely disconcerted at this grave, and but too just accusation, and I am
               sure I must look very simple;—but I made no answer. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"You will not, I hope,"</q> continued he, <q rend="inline"> "con
                  demn me unheard; if there is any thing I have done,—or any thing I have neglected,
                  tell me, I beseech you, <hi>what,</hi> and it shall be the whole study of my
                  thoughts how to deserve your par don." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Oh, my Lord,"</q> cried I, penetrated at once with shame and
               gratitude, <q rend="inline"> "your too, too great politeness oppresses me!—you have
                  done nothing,—I have never dreamt of offence;—if there is any pardon to be asked,
                  it is rather for <hi>me,</hi> than for <hi>you,</hi> to ask it." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"You are all sweetness and condescension!"</q> cried he, <q
                  rend="inline"> "and I flatter myself, you will again allow me to claim those
                  titles, which I find my self so unable to forego. Yet, occupied as I am, <pb
                     n="205"/> with an idea that gives me the severest uneasiness, I hope you will
                  not think me impertinent, if I still solicit, still entreat, nay implore you tell
                  me, to what cause your late sudden, and to me most painful reserve, was owing?"
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Indeed, my Lord,"</q> said I, stammering, <q rend="inline">"I
                  dont,—I can't,—indeed, my Lord,—"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I am sorry to distress you,"</q> said he, <q rend="inline"> "and
                  ashamed to be so urgent,—yet I know not how to be satisfied while in
                  ignorance,—and the <hi>time</hi> when the change happened, makes me apprehend—may
                  I, Miss Anville, tell you <hi>what</hi> it makes me apprehend?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Certainly, my Lord."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Tell me, then,"</q> —and pardon a question most essentially
               important to me;—Had, or had not, Sir Clement Willoughby, any share in caus ing your
               inquietude? </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No, my Lord,"</q> answered I, with firmness, <q rend="inline">"none
                  in the world."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"A thousand, thousand thanks!"</q> cried he: <q rend="inline"> "you
                  have relieved me from a weight of con jecture which I supported very painfully.
                  But one thing more; is it, in any measure, to Sir Clement that I may attribute the
                  alteration in your behaviour to myself, which, I could not but observe, began the
                  very day of his arrival at the Hotwells?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"To Sir Clement, my Lord,"</q> said I, <q rend="inline"> "at tribute
                  nothing. He is the last man in the world who would have any influence over my
                  conduct." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "And will you, then, restore to me that share of confidence and
                  favour with which you honour ed me before he came?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> Just then, to my great relief,—for I knew not what to say,—Mrs. Beaumont opened the
               door, <pb n="206"/> and, in a few minutes, we went to breakfast. </p>
            <p> Lord Orville was all gaiety; never did I see him more lively or more agreeable. Very
               soon after, Sir Clement Willoughby called to pay his respects, he said, to Mrs.
               Beaumont. I then came to my own roon, where, indulging my re flections, which now
               soothed, and now alarmed me, I remained very quietly, till I received your most kind
               letter. </p>
            <p> Oh, Sir, how sweet are the prayers you offer for your Evelina! how grateful to her
               are the blessings you pour upon her head!—You <hi>commit me to my real parent.</hi>
               —Ah, Guardian, Friend, Protector of my youth!—by whom my helpless infancy was
               cherished, my mind formed, my ve ry life preserved,— <hi>you</hi> are the parent my
               heart acknowledges, and to you do I vow eternal duty, gratitude, and affection. </p>
            <p> I look forward to the approaching interview with more fear than hope; but important
               as is this subject, I am, just now, wholly engross ed with another, which I must
               hasten to com municate. </p>
            <p> I immediately acquainted Mrs. Selwyn with the purport of your letter. She was
               charmed to find your opinion agreed with her own, and settled that we should go to
               town to-morrow morning. And a chaise i <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF"
                  extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> actually ordered to be here by one o'clock. </p>
            <p> She then desired me to pack up my cloaths; and said she must go, herself, to
                  <hi>make speeches,</hi> and <hi>tell lies</hi> to Mrs. Beaumont. </p>
            <p> When I went down stairs to dinner, Lord Or ville, who was still in excellent
               spirits, reproached me for secluding myself so much from the com pany. He sat next
               me,—he <hi>would</hi> sit next me,—at table; and he might, I am sure, repeat what <pb
                  n="207"/> heonce said of me before, <hi> that he almost exhausted himself in
                  fruitless endeavours to entertain me; </hi> —for, indeed, I was not to be
               entertained: I was totally spiritless and dejected; the idea of the approaching
               meeting,—and oh Sir, the idea of the approaching parting,—gave a heaviness to my
               heart, that I could neither conquer nor repress. I even regretted the half
               explanation that had passed, and wished Lord Orville had support ed his own reserve,
               and suffered me to support mine. </p>
            <p> However, when, during dinner, Mrs. Beau mont spoke of our journey, my gravity was no
               longer singular; a cloud instantly overspread the countenance of Lord Orville, and he
               became near ly as thoughtful and as silent as myself. </p>
            <p> We all went together to the drawing-room. After a short and unentertaining
               conversation, Mrs. Selwyn said she must prepare for her jour ney, and begged me to
               see for some books she had left in the parlour. </p>
            <p> And here, while I was looking for them, I was followed by Lord Orville. He shut the
               door after he came in, and approaching me with a look of great anxiety, said, <q
                  rend="inline">"Is this true, Miss Anville, are you going?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I believe so, my Lord,"</q> said I, still looking for the books. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"So suddenly, so unexpectedly must I lose you?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No great loss, my Lord,"</q> cried I, endea vouring to speak
               chearfully. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Is it possible,"</q> said he, gravely, <q rend="inline"> "Miss An
                  ville can doubt my sincerity?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I can't imagine,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline"> "what Mrs. Sel wyn
                  has done with these books." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="208"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Would to Heaven,"</q> continued he, <q rend="inline"> "I might
                  flatter myself you would allow me to prove it?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I must run up stairs,"</q> cried I, greatly confused, <q
                  rend="inline">"and ask what she has done with them."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"You are going, then,"</q> cried he, taking my hand, <q
                  rend="inline"> "and you give me not the smallest hope of your return!—will you
                  not, then, my too lovely friend!—will you not, at least, teach me, with fortitude
                  like your own, to support your ab sence?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q> cried I, endeavouring to disen gage my hand, <q
                  rend="inline">"pray let me go!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I will,"</q> cried he, to my inexpressible con fusion, dropping on
               one knee, <q rend="inline">"if you wish to leave me!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Oh, my Lord,"</q> exclaimed I, <q rend="inline"> "rise, I beseech
                  you, rise!—such a posture to me!—surely your Lordship is not so cruel as to mock
                  me!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Mock you!"</q> repeated he earnestly, <q rend="inline"> "no, I
                  revere you! I esteem and I admire you above all human beings!—you are the friend
                  to whom my soul is attached as to its better half! you are the most amiable, the
                  most perfect of women! and you are dearer to me than language has the power of
                  telling!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I attempt not to describe my sensations at that moment; I scarce breathed; I doubted
               if I ex isted,—the blood forsook my cheeks, and my feet refused to sustain me: Lord
               Orville, hastily rising, supported me to a chair, upon which I sunk, almost lifeless. </p>
            <p> For a few minutes, we neither of us spoke; and then, seeing me recover, Lord
               Orville, though in terms hardly articulate, entreated my pardon <pb n="209"/> for his
               abruptness. The moment my strength re turned, I attempted to rise, but he would not
               per mit me. </p>
            <p> I cannot write the scene that followed, though every word is engraven on my heart:
               but his protestations, his expressions, were too flattering for repetition: nor would
               he, in spite of my re peated efforts to leave him, suffer me to escape;—in short, my
               dear Sir, I was not proof against his solicitations—and he drew from me the most
               sacred secret of my heart! </p>
            <p> I know not how long we were together, but Lord Orville was upon his knees, when the
               door was opened by Mrs. Selwyn! To tell you, Sir, the shame with which I was
               overwhelmed, would be impossible;—I snatched my hand from Lord Orville,—he, too,
               started and rose, and Mrs. Selwyn, for some instants, stood facing us both in
               silence. </p>
            <p> At last, <q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q> said she, sarcastically, <q rend="inline">
                  "have you been so good as to help Miss Anville to look for my books?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Yes, Madam,"</q> said he, attempting to ral ly, <q rend="inline"
                  >"and I hope we shall soon be able to find them."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Your Lordship is extremely kind,"</q> said she, drily, <q
                  rend="inline"> "but I can by no means consent to take up any more of your time."
               </q> Then looking on the window-seat, she presently found the books, and added, <q
                  rend="inline"> "Come, here are just three, and so, like the servants in the
                  Drummer, this important affair may give employment to us all." </q> She then
               presented one to Lord Orville, another to me, and taking a third herself, with a most
               provoking look, she left the room. </p>
            <p> I would instantly have followed her; but Lord Orville, who could not help laughing,
               begged me <pb n="210"/> to stay a minute, as he had many important mat ters to
               discuss. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "No, indeed, my Lord, I cannot,—perhaps I have already stayed too
                  long." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Does Miss Anville so soon repent her good ness?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "I scarce know what I do, my Lord,—I am quite bewildered!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"One hour's conversation,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "will I
                  hope compose your spirits, and confirm my hap piness. When, then, may I hope to
                  see you alone?—shall you walk in the garden to-morrow before breakfast?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "No, no, my Lord; you must not, a se cond time, reproach me with
                  making an <hi> appoint ment. </hi> " </q>
            </p>
            <p>

                  that honour only for Mr. Macartney?" </q>

            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Mr. Macartney,"</q> said I, <q rend="inline"> "is poor, and thinks

               <q rend="inline">"Poverty,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "I will not plead; but if

                  them, the most important is, whether she depends wholly on herself, or whether
                  there is any other person for whose inte rest I must solicit?" </q>

            <p>

               <pb n="211"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Suffer, suffer me then,"</q> cried he, with warmth, <q

            </p>
            <p> At length, but with difficulty, I broke from him. I went, however, to my own room,
               for I was too much agitated to follow Mrs. Selwyn. Good God, my dear Sir, what a
               scene! surely the meeting for which I shall prepare to-morrow, cannot so greatly
               affect me! To be loved by Lord Orville,—to be the honoured choice of his noble
               heart,—my happiness seemed too infinite to be borne, and I wept, even bitterly I
               wept, from the excess of joy which over-powered me. </p>
            <p> In this state of almost painful felicity, I conti nued, till I was summoned to tea.
               When I re entered the drawing-room, I rejoiced much to find it full of company, as
               the confusion with which I met Lord Orville was rendered the less observ able. </p>
            <p> Immediately after tea, most of the company played at cards, and then,—and till
               supper time, Lord Orville devoted himself wholly to me. </p>
            <p> He saw that my eyes were red, and would not let me rest till he had made me confess
               the cause; and when, though most reluctantly, I had acknowledged my weakness, I could
               with difficul ty refrain from weeping again at the gratitude he expressed. </p>
            <p> He earnestly desired to know if my journey could not be postponed; and when I said
               no, en treated permission to attend me to town. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Oh, my Lord,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline"> "what a re quest!"

            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"The sooner,"</q> answered he, <q rend="inline"> "I make my devotion

            </p>
            <p> To this I was silent, and he re-urged his re quest. </p>

               <q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q> said I, <q rend="inline"> "you ask what I have no

            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline"> "I mean not to affect any

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"My beloved Miss Anville,"</q> cried he eagerly, <q rend="inline">
                  "pardon my impatience!—You shall tell me no thing you would wish to conceal,—I

               <q rend="inline"> "There is <hi>nothing,</hi> my Lord, I wish to conceal;—to

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="213"/> He then requested, that, since I would not al low him to accompany me
               to town, I would permit him to write to me, and promise to answer his letters. </p>
            <p> A sudden recollection of the two letters which had already passed between us,
               occurring to me, I hastily answered, <q rend="inline">"No, indeed, my Lord!—"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I am extremely sorry,"</q> said he, gravely, <q rend="inline">
                  "that you think me too presumptuous. I must own I had flattered myself that to
                  soften the in quietude of an absence which seems attended by so many inexplicable
                  circumstances, would not have been to incur your displeasure." </q>
            </p>
            <p> This seriousness hurt me; and I could not forbear saying, <q rend="inline"> "Can you
                  indeed desire, my Lord, that I should, a second time, expose myself, by an

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "A <hi>second time! unguarded readiness!</hi> " </q> re peated he;
                  <q rend="inline">"you amaze me!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Has your Lordship then quite forgot the fool ish letter I was so
                  imprudent as to send you when in town?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I have not the least idea,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline">"of what
                  you mean."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why then, my Lord,"</q> said I, <q rend="inline">"we had better let
                  the subject drop."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Impossible!"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "I cannot rest with
                  out an explanation!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> And then, he obliged me to speak very openly of both the letters; but, my dear Sir,
               imagine my surprise, when he assured me, in the most so lemn manner, that far from
               having ever written me a single line, he had never received, seen, or heard of my
               letter! </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="214"/> This subject, which caused mutual astonish ment and perplexity to us
               both, entirely engrossed us for the rest of the evening; and he made me promise to
               shew him the letter I had received in his name to-morrow morning, that he might en
               deavour to discover the author. </p>
            <p> After supper, the conversation became gene ral. </p>
            <p> And now, my dearest Sir, may I not call for your congratulations upon the events of
               this day? a day never to be recollected by me but with the most grateful joy! I know
               how much you are in clined to think well of Lord Orville, I cannot, therefore,
               apprehend that my frankness to him will displease you. Perhaps the time is not very
               distant when your Evelina's choice may receive the sanction of her best friend's
               judgment and approbation,—which seems now all she has to wish! </p>
            <p> In regard to the change in my situation which must first take place, surely I cannot
               be blamed for what has passed! the partiality of Lord Or ville must not only reflect
               honour upon me, but upon all to whom I do, or may belong. </p>
            <p> Adieu, most dear Sir. I will write again when I arrive at London. </p>

            <p> YOU will see, my dear Sir, that I was mista ken in supposing I should write no more
               from this <pb n="215"/> place, where my residence, now, seems more un certain than
               ever. </p>
            <p> This morning, during breakfast, Lord Orville took an opportunity to beg me, in a low
               voice, to allow him a moment's conversation before I left Clifton; <q rend="inline"
                  >"May I hope,"</q> added he, <q rend="inline"> "that you will stroll into the
                  garden after breakfast?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I made no answer, but I believe my looks gave no denial; for, indeed, I much wished
               to be sa tisfied concerning the letter. The moment, there fore, that I could quit the
               parlour I ran up stairs for my calash; but before I reached my room, Mrs. Selwyn
               called after me, <q rend="inline"> "If you are go ing to walk, Miss Anville, be so
                  good as to bid Jenny bring down my hat, and I'll accompany you." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Very much disconcerted, I turned into the draw ing-room, without making any answer,
               and there I hoped to wait unseen, till she had otherwise dis posed of herself. But,
               in a few minutes, the door opened, and Sir Clement Willoughby en tered. </p>
            <p> Starting at the sight of him, in rising hastily, I let drop the letter which I had
               brought for Lord Orville's inspection, and, before I could recover it, Sir Clement,
               springing forward, had it in his hand. He was just presenting it to me, and, at the
               same time, enquiring after my health, when the signature caught his eye, and he read
               aloud <q rend="inline">"Orville."</q>
            </p>
            <p> I endeavoured, eagerly, to snatch it from him, but he would not permit me, and,
               holding it fast, in a passionate manner exclaimed, <q rend="inline"> "Good God, Miss
                  Anville, is it possible you can value such a letter as this?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> The question surprised and confounded me, and I was too much ashamed to answer him;
               but <pb n="216"/> finding he made an attempt to secure it, I pre vented him, and
               vehemently demanded him to re turn it. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Tell me first,"</q> said he, holding it above my reach, <q
                  rend="inline"> "tell me if you have, since, received any more letters from the
                  same person?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No, indeed,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline">"never!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "And will you, also, sweetest of women, promise that you never

               <q rend="inline">"Sir Clement,"</q> cried I, greatly confused, <q rend="inline">"pray

            </p>

               <q rend="inline"> "Why such solicitude about this hateful let ter? can it possibly

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No matter, Sir,"</q> cried I, in great perplex ity, <q

            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I must conclude, then,"</q> said he, <q rend="inline"> "that the

                  to make you prize it." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Sir Clement,"</q> cried I, colouring, <q rend="inline"> "you are

            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O Miss Anville,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "you blush!—you
                  stammer!—Great Heaven! it is then all as I feared!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="217"/>
               <q rend="inline">"I know not,"</q> cried I, half frightened, <q rend="inline"> "what
                  you mean; but I beseech you to give me the letter, and to compose yourself." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"The letter,"</q> cried he, gnashing his teeth, <q rend="inline">
                  "you shall never see more. You ought to have burnt it the moment you had read it!"
               </q> And, in an instant, he tore it into a thousand pieces. </p>
            <p> Alarmed at a fury so indecently outrageous, I would have run out of the room; but he
               caught hold of my gown, and cried, <q rend="inline"> "Not yet, not yet must you go! I
                  am but half-mad yet, and you must stay to finish your work. Tell me, there fore,
                  does Orville know your fatal partiality?—Say <hi>yes,</hi> " </q> added he,
               trembling with passion, <q rend="inline">"and I will fly you for ever!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"For Heaven's sake, Sir Clement,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline">
                  "release me!—if you do not, you will force me to call for help." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Call then,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "inexorable and most

                  had answered me. Tell me, then, does Orville know you love him?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> At any other time, an enquiry so gross would have given me inexpressible confusion;
               but now, the wildness of his manner terrified me, and I only said, <q rend="inline">

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Enough,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "I understand you!—the art

                  him the most envied of men!—One thing more, and I have done:—Will he marry you?
               </q>
            </p>
            <p> What a question! my cheeks glowed with in dignation, <pb n="218"/> and I felt too
               proud to make any an swer. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I see, I see how it is,"</q> cried he, after a short pause, <q
                  rend="inline">"and I find I am undone for ever!"</q> Then, letting loose my gown,
               he put his hand to his forehead, and walked up and down the room in a hasty and
               agitated manner. </p>
            <p> Though now at liberty to go, I had not the courage to leave him: for his evident
               distress ex cited all my compassion. And this was our situa tion, when Lady Louisa,
               Mr. Coverley, and Mrs. Beaumont, entered the room. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Sir Clement Willoughby,"</q> said the latter, <q rend="inline">"I
                  beg pardon for making you wait so long, but—"</q>
            </p>
            <p> She had not time for another word; Sir Cle ment, too much disordered to know or care
               what he did, snatched up his hat, and brushing hastily past her, flew down stairs,
               and out of the house. </p>
            <p> And with him went my sincerest pity, though I earnestly hope I shall see him no
               more. But what, my dear Sir, am I to conclude from his strange speeches concerning
               the letter? does it not seem as if he was himself the author of it? How else should
               he be so well acquainted with the contempt it me rits? Neither do I know another
               human being who could serve any interest by such a deception. I remember too, that
               just as I had given my own letter to the maid, Sir Clement came into the shop;
               probably he prevailed upon her, by some bribery, to give it to him, and afterwards,
               by the same means, to deliver to me an answer of his own writing. Indeed I can in no
               other manner account for this affair. Oh, Sir Clement, were you not yourself unhappy,
               I know not how I could pardon an artifice that has caused me so much uneasiness! </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="219"/> His abrupt departure occasioned a kind of gene ral consternation. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Very extraordinary behaviour this!"</q> cried Mrs. Beaumont. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Egad,"</q> said Mr. Coverley, <q rend="inline"> "the Baronet has a
                  mind to tip us a touch of the heroicks this morning! </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I declare,"</q> cried Lady Louisa, <q rend="inline"> "I never saw
                  any thing so monstrous in my life! it's quite abominable,—I fancy the man's
                  mad;—I'm sure he has given me a shocking fright!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> Soon after, Mrs. Selwyn came up stairs, with Lord Merton. The former, advancing
               hastily to me, said, <q rend="inline"> "Miss Anville, have you an alma nack?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Me!—no, Ma'am."</q>

            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Who has one, then?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Egad,"</q> cried Mr. Coverley, <q rend="inline"> "I never bought
                  one in my life; it would make me quite melancholy to have such a time-keeper in my
                  pocket. I would as soon walk all day before an hour-glass." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"You are in the right,"</q> said Mrs. Selwyn, <q rend="inline"> "not
                  to <hi>watch time,</hi> lest you should be betrayed, unawares, into reflecting how
                  you employ it." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Egad, Ma'am,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "if Time thought no
                  more of me, than I do of Time, I be lieve I should bid defiance, for one while to

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Pray, Mr. Coverley,"</q> said Mrs. Selwyn, <q rend="inline"> "why
                  do you think it necessary to tell me this so often?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Often!"</q> repeated he, <q rend="inline"> "Egad, Madam, I don't
                  know, why I said it now,—but I'm sure I can't recollect that I ever owned as much
                  before." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="220"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Owned it before!"</q> cried she, <q rend="inline"> "why, my dear
                  Sir, you own it all day long; for every word, every look, every action proclaims
                  it." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I know not if he understood the full severity of her satire, but he only turned off
               with a laugh: and she then applied to Mr. Lovel, and asked if <hi>he</hi> had an
               almanack? </p>
            <p> Mr. Lovel, who always looks alarmed when she addresses him, with some hesitation,
               answer ed, <q rend="inline"> "I assure you, Ma'am, I have no manner of antipathy to
                  an almanack,—none in the least, I assure you;—I dare say I have four or five."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Four or five!—pray may I ask what use you make of so many?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Use!—really, Ma'am, as to that,—I don't make any particular use of
                  them,—but one must have them, to tell one the day of the month;—I'm sure, else, I
                  should never keep it in my head." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "And does your time pass so smoothly un marked, that, without an

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Really, Ma'am,"</q> cried he, colouring, <q rend="inline"> "I don't
                  see any thing so very particular in having a few almanacks; other people have
                  them, I be lieve, as well as me." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Don't be offended,"</q> cried she, <q rend="inline"> "I have but
                  made a little digression. All I want to know, is the state of the moon,—for if it
                  is at the <hi>full</hi> I shall be saved a world of conjectures, and know at once
                  to what cause to attribute the inconsisten cies I have witnessed this morning. In
                  the first place, I heard Lord Orville excuse himself from going out, because he
                  had business of importance to transact at home,—yet have I seen him saunter ing
                  alone in the garden this half-hour. Miss An ville, on the other hand, I invited to
                  walk out <pb n="221"/> with me; and, after seeking her every where round the
                  house, I find her quietly seated in the drawing-room. And, but a few minutes
                  since, Sir Clement Willoughby, with even more than his usual politeness, told me
                  he was come to spend the morning here,—when, just now, I met him flying down
                  stairs, as if pursued by the Fu ries; and, far from repeating his compliments, or
                  making any excuse, he did not even answer a question I asked him, but rushed past
                  me, with the rapidity of a thief from a bailiff!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I protest,"</q> said Mrs. Beaumont, <q rend="inline"> "I can't
                  think what he meant; such rudeness from a man of any family is quite
                  incomprehensible." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q> cried Lady Louisa to Lord Mer ton, <q rend="inline">
                  "do you know he did the same by <hi>me?</hi> —I was just going to ask him what was
                  the matter, but he ran past me so quick, that I declare he quite dazzled my eyes.
                  You can't think, my Lord, how he frighted me; I dare say I look as pale—don't I
                  look very pale, my Lord?" </q>

            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Pray, Mr. Lovel,"</q> said Mrs. Selwyn, <q rend="inline"> "if the

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Egad,"</q> cried Mr. Coverley, <q rend="inline"> "I suppose they

            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q> said Mrs. Selwyn, <q rend="inline"> "if experi ence

            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why, faith my Lord,"</q> said Mr. Lovel, <q rend="inline"> "I
                  think, in general, your House is not much addicted to study; we of the lower House
                  have indubitably most application; and, if I did not speak before a superior
                  power," </q> (bowing low to Lord Merton) <q rend="inline"> I should presume to

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Mr. Lovel,"</q> said Mrs. Selwyn, <q rend="inline"> "you de serve
                  immortality for that discovery! But for this observation, and the confession of

                  able logician, were synonymous terms." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Lord Merton, turning upon his heel, asked Lady Louisa, if she should <hi>take the

            <p>

            <p>
               <pb n="223"/>
               <q rend="inline"> "I have the honour to be quite of your Lord ship's opinion," </q>
               "said Mr. Lovel, looking ma liciously at Mrs. Selwyn, <q rend="inline"> "for I have
                  an insu perable aversion to strength, either of body or mind in a female." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Faith, and so have I,"</q> said Mr. Coverley; <q rend="inline">
                  "for egad I'd as soon see a woman chop wood, as hear her chop logic." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"So would every man in his senses,"</q> said Lord Merton; <q
                  rend="inline"> "for a woman wants nothing to recommend her but beauty and
                  good-nature; in every thing else she is either impertinent or unna tural. For my

                  live!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"It has always been agreed,"</q> said Mrs Sel wyn, looking round her
               with the utmost con tempt, <q rend="inline"> "that no man ought to be connected with
                  a woman whose understanding is superior to his own. Now I very much fear, that to
                  accommodate all this good company, according to such a rule, would be utterly
                  impracticable, unless we should chuse subjects from Swift's hospital of idiots."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p> How many enemies, my dear Sir, does this un bounded severity excite! Lord Merton,
               however, only whistled; Mr. Coverley sang; and Mr. Lo vel, after biting his lips some
               time, said, <q rend="inline"> "'Pon honour, that lady—if she was <hi>not</hi> a

                  severity,—that is rather, I must say,—rather— <hi>oddish.</hi> " </q>
            </p>
            <p> Just then, a servant brought Lady Louisa a note, upon a <hi>waiter,</hi> which is a
               ceremony always used to her Ladyship; and I took the opportunity of this interruption
               to the conversation, to steal out of the room. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="224"/> I went immediately to the parlour, which I found quite empty; for I did
               not dare walk in the garden after what Mrs. Selwyn had said. </p>
            <p> In a few minutes, a servant announced Mr. Macartney, saying, as he entered the room,
               that he would acquaint Lord Orville he was there. </p>
            <p> Mr. Macartney rejoiced much at finding me alone. He told me he had taken the liberty
               to enquire for Lord Orville, by way of pretext for coming to the house. </p>
            <p> I then very eagerly enquired if he had seen his father. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I have, Madam,"</q> said he; <q rend="inline"> "and the ge nerous

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "I could not, Madam, expect that he would: the cruel transaction

            <p>

               <pb n="225"/>
               <q rend="inline">"You have, you have a sister!"</q> cried I, from an impulse of pity
               which I could not repress, <q rend="inline"> "a sister who is most warmly interested
                  in all your concerns, and who only wants opportunity to ma nifest her friendship

            </p>
            <p>

                  affection of a sister,—I felt it, in deed, before I knew I was one.—Why, my dear

            </p>
            <p> I would have proceeded with further questions, but the entrance of Lord Orville
               prevented me. The moment he saw us, he started, and would have retreated; but,
               drawing my hand from Mr. Macartney's I begged him to come in. </p>
            <p> For a few moments we were all silent, and, I believe all in equal confusion. Mr.
               Macartney, however, recollecting himself, said, <q rend="inline"> "I hope your
                  Lordship will forgive the liberty I have taken in making use of your name?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> Lord Orville, rather coldly, bowed, but said nothing. </p>
            <p> Again we were all silent, and then Mr. Macart ney took leave. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I fancy,"</q> said Lord Orville, when he was gone, <q rend="inline"
                  >"I have shortened Mr. Macartney's visit?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No, my Lord, not at all."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I had presumed,"</q> said he, with some hesi tation, <q
                  rend="inline"> "I should have seen Miss Anville in the garden;—but I knew not she
                  was so much better engaged." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Before I could answer, a servant came to tell me the chaise was ready, and that Mrs.
               Selwyn was enquiring for me. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I will wait on her immediately,"</q> cried I, and away I was
               running; but Lord Orville, stopping me, said, with great emotion, <q rend="inline"
                  >"Is it thus, Miss Anville, you leave me?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline"> "how can I help
                  it?—perhaps, soon, some better opportunity may offer—" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Good Heaven!"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "do you indeed take
                  me for a Stoic? What better opportunity <pb n="227"/> may I hope for?—is not the
                  chaise come?—are you not going? have you even deigned to tell me whither?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "My journey, my Lord, will now be de ferred. Mr. Macartney has
                  brought me intel ligence which renders it, at present, unneces sary." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Mr. Macartney,"</q> said he, gravely, <q rend="inline"> "seems to
                  have great influence,—yet he is a very young counsellor." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Is it possible, my Lord, Mr. Macartney can give you the least
                  uneasiness?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"My dearest Miss Anville,"</q> said he, taking my hand, <q
                  rend="inline"> "I see, and I adore the purity of your mind, superior as it is to
                  all little arts, and all ap prehensions of suspicion; and I should do myself, as
                  well as you, injustice, if I were capable of har bouring the smallest doubts of
                  that goodness which makes you mine for ever: nevertheless, pardon me, if I own
                  myself surprised,—nay, alarmed, at these frequent meetings with so young a man as
                  Mr. Macartney." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q> cried I, eager to clear myself, <q rend="inline">"Mr.
                  Macartney is my brother!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Your brother! you amaze me!—What strange mystery, then, makes his
                  relationship a secret?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> Just then, Mrs. Selwyn opened the door. <q rend="inline">"O, you are here!"</q>
               cried she; <q rend="inline"> "Pray is my Lord so kind as to assist you in
                     <hi>preparing</hi> for your journey,—or in <hi>retarding</hi> it?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I should be most happy,"</q> said Lord Or ville, smiling, <q
                  rend="inline"> "if it were in my power to do the <hi>latter.</hi> " </q>
            </p>
            <p> I then acquainted her with Mr. Macartney's communication. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="228"/> She immediately ordered the chaise away, and then took me into her own
               room, to consider what should be done. </p>
            <p> A few minutes sufficed to determine her, and she wrote the following note. </p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <head>To Sir John Belmont, Bart.</head>
                  <p> MRS. Selwyn presents her compliments to Sir John Belmont, and, if he is at
                     leisure, will be glad to wait on him this morning, upon business of importance.
                  </p>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p> She then ordered her man to enquire at the pump room for a direction, and went
               herself to Mrs. Beaumont to apologise for deferring her journey. </p>
            <p> An answer was presently returned, that he would be glad to see her. </p>
            <p> She would have had me immediately accom pany her to the Hotwells; but I entreated
               her to spare me the distress of so abrupt an introduction, and to pave the way for my
               reception. She con sented rather reluctantly, and, attended only by her servant,
               walked to the Wells. </p>
            <p> She was not absent two hours, yet so miserably did time seem to linger, that I
               thought a thousand accidents had happened, and feared she would ne ver return. I
               passed the whole time in my own room, for I was too much agitated even to con verse
               with Lord Orville. </p>
            <p> The instant that, from my window, I saw her returning, I flew down stairs, and met
               her in the garden. </p>
            <p>We both walked to the arbour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="229"/> Her looks, in which disappointment and anger were expressed, presently
               announced to me the failure of her embassy. Finding that she did not speak, I asked
               her, in a faultering voice, Whether or not I had a father? </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "You have <hi>not,</hi> my dear!" </q> said she, ab ruptly. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Very well, Madam,"</q> said I, with tolerable calmness, <q
                  rend="inline"> "let the chaise, then, be ordered again,—I will go to Berry
                  Hill,—and there, I trust, I shall still find one!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> It was some time ere she could give, or I could hear, the account of her visit; and
               then she related it in a hasty manner; yet I believe I can recollect every word. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "I found Sir John alone. He received me with the utmost politeness.
                  I did not keep him a moment in suspence as to the purport of my visit. But I had
                  no sooner made it known, than, with a supercilious smile, he said, <q
                     rend="inline"> "And have you, Madam, been prevailed upon to revive that ridi
                     culous old story?" </q> Ridiculous, I told him, was a term which he would find
                  no one else do him the favour to make use of, in speaking of the horri ble actions
                  belonging to the <hi>old story</hi> he made so light of; <q rend="inline"
                     >"actions,"</q> continued I, <q rend="inline"> "which would dye still deeper
                     the black annals of Nero or Cali gula." </q> He attempted in vain to rally, for
                  I pur sued him with all the severity in my power, and ceased not painting the
                  enormity of his crime, till I stung him to the quick, and, in a voice of passion
                  and impatience, he said, <q rend="inline"> "No more, Madam,—this is not a subject
                     upon which I need a monitor." </q>
                  <q rend="inline">"Make, then,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline"> "the only reparation
                     in your power.—Your daughter is now at Clifton; send for her hither, and, in
                     the face of the world, proclaim the legitimacy <pb n="230"/> of her birth, and
                     clear the reputation of your injured wife." </q>
                  <q rend="inline">"Madam,"</q> said he, <q rend="inline"> "you are much mistaken,
                     if you suppose I waited for the honour of this visit, before I did what little
                     jus tice now depends upon me, to the memory of that unfortunate woman: her
                     daughter has been my care from her infancy; I have taken her into my house; she
                     bears my name, and she will be my sole heiress." </q> For some time this
                  assertion appeared so absurd, that I only laughed at it; but at last, he assured
                  me, I had myself been im posed upon, for that the very woman who at tended Lady
                  Belmont in her last illness conveyed the child to him while he was in London,
                  before she was a year old. <q rend="inline">"Unwilling,"</q> he added, <q
                     rend="inline"> "at that time to confirm the rumour of my be ing married, I sent
                     the woman with the child to France; as soon as she was old enough, I put her
                     into a convent, where she has been properly edu cated; and now I have taken her
                     home, I have acknowledged her for my lawful child, and paid, at length, to the
                     memory of her unhappy mother, a tribute of fame which has made me wish to hide
                     myself hereafter from all the world." </q> This whole story sounded so
                  improbable, that I did not scruple to tell him I discredited every word. He then
                  rung his bell, and enquiring if his hair dresser was come, said he was sorry to
                  leave me, but that, if I would favour him with my compa ny to-morrow, he would do
                  himself the honour of introducing Miss Belmont to <hi>me,</hi> instead of
                  troubling me to introduce her to <hi>him.</hi> I rose in great indignation, and,
                  assuring him I would make his conduct as public as it was infamous, I left the
                  house." </q>
            </p>
            <p> "Good Heaven, how strange a recital! how incomprehensible an affair! The Miss
               Belmont, <pb n="231"/> then, who is actually at Bristol, passes for the daughter of
               my unhappy mother!—passes, in short, for your Evelina! Who she can be or what this
               tale can mean, I have not any idea. </p>
            <p> Mrs. Selwyn soon after left me to my own reflections. Indeed they were not very
               pleasant. Quietly as I had borne her relation, the mo ment I was alone I felt most
               bitterly both the dis grace and the sorrow of a rejection so cruelly in explicable. </p>
            <p> I know not how long I might have continued in this situation, had I not been
               awakened from my melancholy reverie by the voice of Lord Or ville. <q rend="inline"
                  >"May I come in,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline">"or shall I interrupt you?"</q> I
               was silent, and he seated himself next me. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I fear,"</q> he continued, <q rend="inline"> "Miss Anville will
                  think I persecute her; yet so much as I have to say, and so much as I wish to
                  hear, with so few opportunities for either, she cannot wonder,—and I hope she will
                  not be offended,—that I seize with such avidity every moment in my power to
                  converse with her. You are grave," </q> added he, taking my hand; <q rend="inline"
                  > "I hope you do not regret the delay of your journey?—I hope the pleasure it
                  gives to <hi>me,</hi> will not be a subject of pain to <hi>you?</hi> —You are
                  silent?—Something, I am sure, has afflicted you:—Would to Heaven I were able to
                  console you!—Would to Heaven I were worthy to participate in your sorrows!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> My heart was too full to bear this kindness, and I could only answer by my tears. <q
                  rend="inline"> "Good Hea ven," </q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "how you alarm
                  me!—My love, my sweet Miss Anville, deny me no longer to be the sharer of your
                  griefs!—tell me, at least, that you have not withdrawn your esteem!—that you do
                  not repent the goodness you have shewn <pb n="232"/> me!—that you still think me
                  the same grate ful Orville whose heart you have deigned to ac cept!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Oh, my Lord,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline">"your generosity
                  overpowers me!"</q> And I wept like an infant. For now that all my hopes of being
               acknowledged seemed finally crushed, I felt the nobleness of his disinterested
               attachment so forcibly, that I could scarce breathe under the weight of gratitude
               that oppressed me. </p>
            <p> He seemed greatly shocked, and in terms the most flattering, the most respectfully
               tender, he at once soothed my distress, and urged me to tell him its cause. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q> said I, when I was able to speak, <q rend="inline">
                  "you little know what an outcast you have ho noured with your choice!—a child of
                  bounty,—an orphan from infancy,—dependent, even for subsistence dependent, upon
                  the kindness of com passion!—Rejected by my natural friends,—dis owned for ever by
                  my nearest relation,—Oh, my Lord, so circumstanced, can I deserve the dis tinction
                  with which you honour me? No, no; I feel the inequality too painfully;—you must
                  leave me, my Lord, you must suffer me to return to obscurity,—and there, in the
                  bosom of my first, best,—my only friend,—I will pour forth all the grief of my
                  heart!—while you, my Lord, must seek elsewhere—" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I could not proceed; my whole soul recoiled against the charge I would have given,
               and my voice refused to utter it. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Never!"</q> cried he, warmly; <q rend="inline"> "my heart is

                  them is not of the number, that I feel myself more strongly, more invincibly
                  attached to you than ever!—Tell me but where I may find this noble friend, whose
                  virtues you have already taught me to re verence,—and I will fly to obtain his
                  consent and intercession,—that henceforward our fates may be indissolubly
                  united,—and, then shall it be the sole study of my life to endeavour to soften
                  your past,—and guard you from future misfor tunes!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I had just raised my eyes, to answer this most generous of men, when the first
               object they met was Mrs. Selwyn! </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"So, my dear,"</q> cried she, <q rend="inline"> "what, still
                  courting the rural shades!—I thought, ere now, you would have been satiated with
                  this retired seat, and I have been seeking you all over the House. But I now see
                  the only way to meet with <hi>you,</hi> —is to enquire for <hi>Lord Orville.</hi>
                  However, don't let me disturb your meditations; you are possibly planning some
                  pastoral dialogue." </q>
            </p>
            <p>And, with this provoking speech, she walked on.</p>
            <p> In the greatest confusion, I was quitting the ar bour, when Lord Orville said, <q
                  rend="inline"> "permit <hi>me</hi> to follow Mrs. Selwyn;—it is time to put an end
                  to all impertinent conjectures; will you allow me to speak to her openly? </q>
            </p>
            <p>I assented in silence; and he left me.</p>
            <p> I then went to my own room, where I conti nued till I was summoned to dinner; after
               which, Mrs. Selwyn invited me to her's. </p>
            <p> The moment she had shut the door, <q rend="inline">"Your Ladyship,"</q> said she, <q
                  rend="inline"> "will, I hope, be seat ed." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Ma'am!"</q> cried I, staring. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="234"/>
               <q rend="inline"> "O the sweet innocent! so you don't know what I mean?—but, my dear,
                  my sole view is to accustom you a little to your dignity elect, lest, when you are
                  addressed by your title, you should look another way, from an apprehension of
                  listening to a discourse not meant for you to hear." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Having, in this manner, diverted herself with my confusion, till her raillery was
               almost exhaust ed, she congratulated me, very seriously, upon the attachment of Lord
               Orville, and painted to me, in the strongest terms, his disinterested desire of being
               married to me immediately. She had told him, she said, my whole story; and yet he was
               willing, nay eager, that our union should take place of any further application to my
               fami ly. <q rend="inline">"Now, my dear,"</q> continued she, <q rend="inline"> "I
                  advise you, by all means, to marry him directly; nothing can be more precarious
                  than our success with Sir John; and the young men of this age are not to be
                  trusted with too much time for de liberation, where their interests are concern
                  ed." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Good God, Madam,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline"> "do you think I
                  would <hi>hurry</hi> Lord Orville? </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Well, do as you will;"</q> said she, <q rend="inline"> "luckily you
                  have an excellent subject for Quixotism;—otherwise, this delay might prove your
                  ruin: but Lord Orville is almost as romantic as if he had been born and bred at
                  Berry Hill." </q>
            </p>
            <p> She then proposed, as no better expedient seemed likely to be suggested, that I
               should ac company her at once, in her visit to the Hot-wells to-morrow morning. </p>
            <p> The very idea made me tremble; yet she re presented so strongly the necessity of
               pursuing this unhappy affair with spirit, or giving it totally up, <pb n="235"/>
               that, wanting her force of argument, I was al most obliged to yield to her proposal. </p>
            <p> In the evening, we all walked in the garden: and Lord Orville, who never quitted my
               side, told me, he had been listening to a tale, which, though it had removed the
               perplexities that had so long tormented him, had penetrated him with sorrow and
               compassion. I acquainted him with Mrs. Selwyn's plan for to-morrow, and confessed the
               extreme terror it gave me. He then, in a manner almost unanswerable, besought me to
               leave to him the conduct of the affair, by consenting to be his before an interview
               took place. </p>
            <p> I could not but acknowledge my sense of his generousity; but I told him I was wholly
               depen dent upon you, and that I was certain your opi nion would be the same as mine,
               which was, that it would be highly improper I should dispose of myself for ever, so
               very near the time which must finally decide by whose authority I ought to be guided.
               The subject of this dreaded meeting, with the thousand conjectures and apprehensions
               to which it gives birth, employed all our conver sation then, as it has all my
               thoughts since. </p>
            <p> Heaven only knows how I shall support myself, when the long-expected,—the
               wished,—yet ter rible moment arrives, that will prostrate me at the feet of the
               nearest, the most reverenced of all relations, whom my heart yearns to know, and
               longs to love! </p>

            </opener>
            <p> I COULD not write yesterday, so violent was the agitation of my mind,—but I will
               not, now, lose a moment till I have hastened to my best friend an account of the
               transactions of a day, I can never recollect without emotion. </p>
            <p> Mrs. Selwyn determined upon sending no mes sage, <q rend="inline">"Lest,"</q> said
               she, <q rend="inline"> "Sir John, fatigued with the very idea of my reproaches,
                  should en deavour to avoid a meeting: all we have to do, is to take him by
                  surprize. He cannot but see who you are, whether he will do you justice or not."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p> We went early, and in Mrs. Beaumont's chariot; into which, Lord Orville, uttering
               words of the kindest encouragement, handed us both. </p>
            <p> My uneasiness, during the ride, was excessive, but, when we stopped at the door, I
               was almost senseless with terror! the meeting at last, was not so dreadful as that
               moment! I believe I was car ried into the house; but I scarce recollect what was done
               with me: however, I know we remain ed some time in the parlour, ere Mrs. Selwyn could
               send any message up stairs. </p>
            <p> When I was somewhat recovered, I entreat ed her to let me return home, assuring her
               I felt myself quite unequal to supporting the in terview. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="237"/>
               <q rend="inline">"No,"</q> said she, <q rend="inline"> "you must stay now; your fears
                  will but gain strength by delay, and we must not have such a shock as this
                  repeated." </q> Then, turning to the servant, she sent up her name. </p>
            <p> An answer was brought, that he was going out in great haste, but would attend her
               immediate ly. I turned so sick, that Mrs. Selwyn was ap prehensive I should have
               fainted; and opening a door which led to an inner apartment, she beg ged me to wait
               there till I was somewhat com posed, and till she had prepared for my recep tion. </p>
            <p> Glad of every moment's reprieve, I willingly agreed to the proposal, and Mrs. Selwyn
               had but just time to shut me in, ere her presence was ne cessary. </p>
            <p> The voice of a <hi>father,</hi> —Oh dear and re vered name!—which then, for the
               first time, struck my ears,—affected me in a manner I cannot describe, though it was
               only employ ed to give orders to a servant as he came down stairs. </p>
            <p> Then, entering the parlour, I heard him say, <q rend="inline"> "I am sorry, madam, I
                  made you wait, but I have an engagement which now calls me away: however, if you
                  have any commands for me, I shall be glad of the honour of your company some other
                  time." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I am come, Sir,"</q> answered Mrs. Selwyn, <q rend="inline">"to
                  introduce to you your daughter."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I am infinitely obliged to you,"</q> answered he, <q rend="inline">
                  "but I have just had the satisfaction of breakfasting with her. Ma'am, your most
                  obe dient." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"You refuse, then, to see her?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="238"/>
               <q rend="inline"> "I am much indebted to you, Madam, for this desire of encreasing my
                  family, but you must excuse me if decline taking advantage of it. I have already a
                  daughter, to whom I owe every thing; and it is not three days since, that I had
                  the pleasure of discovering a son; how many more sons and daughters may be brought
                  to me, I am yet to learn;—but I am, already, perfectly well satisfied with the
                  size of my fa mily." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Had you a thousand children, Sir John,"</q> said Mrs. Selwyn,
               warmly, <q rend="inline"> "this only one, of which Lady Belmont was the mother, ought
                  to be most distinguished; and, far from avoiding her sight, you should thank your
                  stars, in humble gratitude, that there vet remains in your power, the smallest
                  opportunity of doing the injured wife you have destroyed, the poor justice of
                  acknow ledging her child!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I am very unwilling, Madam,"</q> answered he, <q rend="inline"> "to
                  enter into any discussion of this point; but you are determined to compel me to
                  speak. There lives not, at this time, the human being who should talk to
                     <hi>me</hi> of the regret due to the me mory of that ill-fated woman; no one
                  can feel it so severely as myself: but let me, nevertheless, assure you I have
                  already done all that remained in my power to prove the respect she merited from
                  me; her child I have educated, and owned for my lawful heiress, if, Madam, you can
                  sug gest to me any other means by which I may more fully do her justice, and more
                  clearly manifest her innocence, name them to me, and though they should wound my
                  character still deeper, I will per form them readily." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"All this sounds vastly well,"</q> returned Mrs. Selwyn, <q
                  rend="inline"> "but I must own it is rather too enig matical <pb n="239"/> for
                     <hi>my</hi> faculties of comprehension. You can, however, have no objection to
                  seeing this young lady?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"None in the world."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Come forth, then, my dear,"</q> cried she, opening the door, <q
                  rend="inline">"come forth, and see your father!"</q> Then, taking my trembling
               hand, she led me forward. I would have withdrawn it, and retreated, but as he
               advanced instantly towards me, I found myself already before him. </p>
            <p> What a moment for your Evelina!—an invo luntary scream escaped me, and covering my
               face with my hands, I sunk on the floor. </p>
            <p> He had, however, seen me first; for in a voice scarce articulate he exclaimed, <q
                  rend="inline">"My God! does Caroline Evelyn still live!"</q>
            </p>
            <p> Mrs. Selwyn said something, but I could not listen to her; and, in a few minutes, he
               added, <q rend="inline"> "Lift up thy head,—if my sight has not blasted thee,—lift up
                  thy head, thou image of my long lost Caroline!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> Affected beyond measure, I half arose, and embraced his knees, while yet on my own. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Yes, yes,"</q> cried he, looking earnestly in my face, <q
                  rend="inline"> "I see, I see thou art her child! she lives—she breathes—she is
                  present to my view!—Oh God, that she indeed lived!—Go, child, go," </q> added he,
               wildly starting, and pushing me from him, <q rend="inline"> "take her away, Madam,—I
                  cannot bear to look at her!" </q> And then, breaking hastily from me, he rushed
               out of the room. </p>
            <p> Speechless, motionless myself, I attempted not to stop him: but Mrs. Selwyn,
               hastening after him, caught hold of his arm. <q rend="inline">"Leave me, Madam,"</q>
               cried he, with quickness, <q rend="inline"> "and take care of the poor child;—bid her
                  not think me un kind,—tell her I would at this moment plunge a <pb n="240"/>
                  dagger in my heart to serve her,—but she has set my brain on fire, and I can see
                  her no more!" </q> Then, with violence almost frantic, he ran up stairs. </p>
            <p> Oh Sir, had I not indeed cause to dread this in terview?—an interview so unspeakably
               painful and afflicting to us both! Mrs. Selwyn would have immediately returned to
               Clifton; but I in treated her to wait some time, in the hope that my unhappy father,
               when his first emotion was over, would again bear me in his sight. How ever, he soon
               after sent his servant to enquire how I did, and to tell Mrs. Selwyn he was much
               indis posed, but would hope for the honour of seeing her to-morrow, at any time she
               would please to appoint. </p>
            <p> She fixed upon ten o'clock in the morning, and then, with a heavy heart, I got into
               the chariot. Those afflicting words, <hi>I can see her no more</hi> were never a
               moment absent from my mind. </p>
            <p> Yet the sight of Lord Orville, who handed us from the carriage, gave some relief to
               the sadness of my thoughts. I could not, however, enter upon the painful subject, but
               begging Mrs. Sel wyn to satisfy him, I went to my own room. </p>
            <p> As soon as I communicated to the good Mrs. Clinton the present situation of my
               affairs, an idea occurred to her, which seemed to clear up all the mystery of my
               having been so long disowned. </p>
            <p> The woman, she says, who attended my ever to-be-regretted mother in her last
               illness, and who nursed me the first four months of my life, soon after being
               discharged from your house, left Berry Hill entirely with her baby, who was but six
               weeks older than myself. Mrs. Clinton remem bers, that her quitting the place
               appeared, at the time, very extraordinary to the neighbours, but, <pb n="241"/> as
               she was never heard of afterwards, she was, by degrees, quite forgotten. </p>
            <p> The moment this was mentioned, it struck Mrs. Selwyn, as well as Mrs. Clinton
               herself, that my father had been imposed upon, and that the nurse who said she had
               brought his child to him, had, in fact, carried her own. </p>
            <p> The name by which I was known, the secrecy observed in regard to my family, and the
               retire ment in which I lived, all conspired to render this scheme, however daring and
               fraudulent, by no means impracticable, and, in short, the idea was no sooner started,
               than conviction seemed to fol low it. </p>
            <p> Mrs. Selwyn determined immediately to disco ver the truth or mistake of this
               conjecture; there fore, the moment she had dined, she walked to the Hotwells,
               attended by Mrs. Clinton. </p>
            <p> I waited in my room till her return, and then heard the following account of her
               visit. </p>
            <p> She found my poor father in great agitation. She immediately informed him of the
               occasion of her so speedy return, and of her suspicions of the woman who had
               pretended to convey to him his child. Interrupting her with quickness, he said he had
               just sent her from his presence: that the certainty I carried in my countenance, of
               my real birth, made him, the moment he had recovered from a surprise which had almost
               deprived him of reason, suspect, himself, the imposition she men tioned. He had,
               therefore, sent for the woman, and questioned her with the utmost austerity: she
               turned pale, and was extremely embarrassed, but still she persisted in affirming,
               that she had really brought him the daughter of Lady Belmont. His perplexity, he
               said, almost distracted him; he had <hi>always</hi> observed that his daughter bore
               no re semblance <pb n="242"/> of either of her parents, but, as he had never doubted
               the veraci <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> y of the nurse, this cir cumstance did not give birth to any suspicion. </p>
            <p> At Mrs. Selwyn's desire, the woman was again called, and interrogated with equal art
               and seve rity; her confusion was evident, and her answers often contradictory, yet
               she still declared she was no impostor. <q rend="inline">"We will see that in a
                  minute,"</q> said Mrs. Selwyn, and then desired Mrs. Clinton might be called up
               stairs. The poor wretch, changing colour, would have escaped out of the room, but,
               being prevented, dropt on her knees, and implored forgiveness. A confession of the
               whole affair was then extorted from her. </p>
            <p> Doubtless, my dear Sir, you must remember <hi>Dame Green,</hi> who was my first
               nurse? The de ceit she has practised, was suggested, she says, by a conversation she
               overheard, in which my un happy mother besought you, that, if her child survived her,
               you would take the sole care of its education; and, in particular, if it should be a
               female, you would by no means part with her early in life. You not only consented,
               she says, but assured her you would even retire abroad with me yourself, if my father
               should importunately demand me. Her own child, she said, was then in her arms, and
               she could not forbear wishing it were possible to give <hi>her</hi> the fortune which
               seemed so little valued for me. This wish once raised, was not easily suppressed; on
               the contrary, what at first appeared a mere idle desire, in a short time seemed a
               feasible scheme. Her husband was dead, and she had little regard for any body but her
               child; and, in short, having saved money for the journey, she contrived to enquire a
               direction to my father, and, telling her neighbours she was <pb n="243"/> going to
               settle in Devonshire, she set out on her expedition. </p>
            <p> When Mrs. Selwyn asked her, how she dared to perpetrate such a fraud, she protested
               she had no ill designs, but that, as <hi>Miss</hi> would be never the worse for it,
               she thought it a pity <hi>nobody</hi> should be the better. </p>
            <p> Her success we are already acquainted with. Indeed every thing seemed to contribute
               to wards it: my father had no correspondent at Berry Hill, the child was instantly
               sent to France, where be ing brought up in as much retirement as myself, nothing but
               accident could discover the fraud. </p>
            <p> And here, let me indulge myself in observing, and rejoicing to observe, that the
               total neglect I thought I met with, was not the effect of insensi bility or
               unkindness, but of imposition and error; and that, at the very time we concluded I
               was unnaturally rejected, my deluded father meant to shew me most favour and
               protection. </p>
            <p> He acknowledges that lady Howard's letter flung him into some perplexity; he
               immediately communicated it to Dame Green, who confessed it was the greatest shock
               she had ever received in her life; yet she had the art and boldness to assert, that
               Lady Howard must herself have been deceiv ed: and as she had, from the beginning of
               her enterprize, declared she had stolen away the child without your knowledge, she
               concluded that some deceit was <hi>then</hi> intended him; and this thought
               occasioned his abrupt answer. </p>
            <p> Dame Green owned, that from the moment the journey to England was settled, she gave
               herself up for lost. All her hope was to have had her daughter married before it took
               place, for which reason she had so much promoted Mr. Macart ney's addresses: for
               though such a match was in adequate <pb n="244"/> to the pretensions of <hi>Miss
                  Belmont,</hi> she well knew it was far superior to those <hi>her daughter</hi>
               could form, after the discovery of her birth. </p>
            <p> My first enquiry was, if this innocent daughter was yet acquainted with the affair?
               No, Mrs. Sel wyn said, nor was any plan settled how to divulge it to her. Poor
               unfortunate girl! how hard is her fate! she is entitled to my kindest offices, and I
               shall always consider her as my sister. </p>
            <p> I then asked whether my father would again al low me to see him? </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why, no, my dear, not yet,"</q> answered she; <q rend="inline"> "he
                  declares the sight of you is too much for him: however, we are to settle every
                  thing concerning you to-morrow, for this woman took up all our time to-day." </q>
            </p>
            <p> This morning, therefore, she is again gone to the Hotwells. I am waiting in all
               impatience for her return; but as I know you will be anxious for the account this
               letter contains, I will not de lay sending it. </p>

            <p> HOW agitated, my dear Sir, is the present life of your Evelina! every day seems
               important, and one event only a prelude to another. </p>
            <p> Mrs. Selwyn, upon her return this morning from the Hotwell, entering my room very
               abrupt ly, <pb n="245"/> said, <q rend="inline">"O my dear, I have terrible news for
                  you!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"For me, Ma'am!—Good God! what now?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Arm yourself,"</q> cried she, <q rend="inline"> "with all your
                  Berry Hill philosophy;—con over every lesson of fortitude or resignation you ever
                  learnt in your life,—for know,—you are next week to be married to Lord Orville!"
               </q>
            </p>
            <p> Doubt, astonishment, and a kind of perturba tion I cannot describe, made this abrupt
               commu nication alarm me extremely, and, almost breath less, I could only exclaim, <q
                  rend="inline"> "Good God, Ma dam, what do you tell me?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"You may well be frightened, my dear,"</q> said she, ironically, <q
                  rend="inline"> "for really there is something mighty terrific, in becoming, at
                  once, the wife of the man you adore,—and a Countess!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I entreated her to spare her raillery, and tell me her real meaning. She could not
               prevail with her self to grant the <hi>first</hi> request, though she readily
               complied with the second. </p>
            <p> My poor father, she said, was still in the ut most uneasiness. He entered upon his
               affairs with great openness, and told her he was equally di sturbed how to dispose
               either of the daughter he had discovered, or the daughter he was now to give up: the
               former he dreaded to trust himself with again beholding, and the latter he knew not
               how to shock with the intelligence of her dis grace. Mrs. Selwyn then acquainted him
               with my situation in regard to Lord Orville; this de lighted him extremely, and, when
               he heard of his Lordship's eagerness, he said he was himself of opinion, the sooner
               the union took place the better: and, in return, he informed her of the af fair of
               Mr. Macartney. <q rend="inline"> "And, after a very long <pb n="246"/> conversation,
               </q> continued Mrs. Selwyn, <q rend="inline"> "we agreed, that the most eligible
                  scheme for all par ties, would be to have both the real and the ficti tious
                  daughter married without delay. There fore, if either of you have any inclination
                  to pull caps for the title of Miss Belmont, you must do it with all speed, as next
                  week will take from both of you all pretensions to it." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Next week!"—dear Madam, what a strange plan!—without my being
                  consulted—without ap plying to Mr. Villars,—without even the concur rence of Lord
                  Orville!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "As to consulting <hi>you,</hi> my dear, it was out of all
                  question, because, you know, young ladies hearts and hands are always to be given
                  with re luctance;—as to Mr. Villars, it is sufficient we know him for your
                  friend;—and as for Lord Or ville, he is a party concerned." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"A party concerned!—you amaze me!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why, yes; for as I found our consultation likely to redound to his
                  advantage, I persuaded Sir John to send for him." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Send for him!—Good God!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Yes, and Sir John agreed. I told the ser vant, that if he could
                  not hear of his Lordship in the house, he might be pretty certain of encoun tering
                  him in the arbour.—Why do you colour, my dear?—Well, he was with us in a moment; I
                  introduced him to Sir John, and we proceeded to business." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "I am very, very sorry for it!—Lord Orville must, himself, think
                  this conduct strangely preci pitate." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "No, my dear, you are mistaken, Lord Or ville has too much good
                  sense. Every thing was then discussed in a rational manner. You are to be married
                  privately, tho' not secretly, and then <pb n="247"/> go to one of his Lordship's
                  country seats: and poor little Miss Green and your brother, who have no house of
                  their own, must go to one of Sir John's." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "But why, my dear Madam, why all this haste? why may we not be
                  allowed a little longer ti me?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I could give you a thousand reasons,"</q> an swered she, <q
                  rend="inline"> "but that I am tolerably certain <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi>
                  will be more than you can controvert, even with all the logic of genuine coquetry.
                  In the first place, you doubtless wish to quit the house of Mrs. Beaumont,—to
                  whose, then, can you with such propriety remove, as to Lord Or ville's?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Surely, Madam,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline"> "I am not more
                  destitute now, than when I thought myself an orphan?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Your father, my dear,"</q> answered she, <q rend="inline"> "is
                  willing to save the little impostor as much of the mortification of her disgrace
                  as it is in his power: now if you immediately take her place, according to your
                  right, as Miss Belmont, why not all that either of you can do for her, will
                  prevent her be ing eternally stigmatized, as the bantling of Dame Green,
                  wash-woman and wet nurse of Berry Hill, Dorsetshire. Now such a genealogy will not
                  be very flattering, even to Mr. Macartney, who, all dismal as he is, you will find
                  by no means wanting in pride and self consequence." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"For the universe,"</q> interrupted I, <q rend="inline"> "I would
                  not be accessary to the degradation you mention; but, surely, Madam, I may return
                  to Berry Hill." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"By no means,"</q> said she; <q rend="inline"> "for though com
                  passion may make us wish to save the poor girl the confusion of an immediate and
                  public fall, yet jus tice demands you should appear, henceforward, <pb n="248"/>
                  in no other light than that of Sir John Belmont's daughter. Besides, between
                  friends, I, who know the world, can see that half this prodigious delicacy for the
                  little usurper, is the mere result of self-interest; for while <hi>her</hi>
                  affairs are husht up, Sir John's, you know, are kept from being brought further to
                  light. Now the double marriage we have projected, obviates all rational
                  objections. Sir John will give you, immediately, £ 30,000; all settlements, and so
                  forth, will be made for you in the name of Evelina Belmont;—Mr. Ma cartney will,
                  at the same time, take poor Polly Green,—and yet, at first, it will only be
                  generally known, that <hi>a daughter of</hi> Sir <hi>John Belmont</hi> 's is
                  married." </q>
            </p>
            <p> In this manner, though she did not convince me, yet the quickness of her arguments
               silenced and perplexed me. I enquired, however, if I might not be permitted to again
               see my father, or whether I must regard myself as banished his pre sence for ever? </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"My dear,"</q> said she, <q rend="inline"> "he does not know you; he
                  concludes that you have been brought up to detest him, and therefore he is rather
                  pre pared to dread, than to love you." </q>
            </p>
            <p> This answer made me very unhappy; I wish ed, most impatiently, to remove his
               prejudice, and endeavour, by dutiful assiduity, to engage his kindness, yet knew not
               how to propose seeing him, while conscious he wished to avoid me. </p>
            <p> This evening, as soon as the company was en gaged with cards, Lord Orville exerted
               his ut most eloquence to reconcile me to this hasty plan; but how was I startled,
               when he told me that next <hi>Tuesday</hi> was the day appointed by my father to be
               the most important of my life! </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="249"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Next Tuesday!</q> repeated I, quite out of breath, <q rend="inline"
                  >"Oh my Lord!—"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"My sweet Evelina,"</q> said he, <q rend="inline"> "the day which
                  will make me the happiest of mortals, would probably appear awful to you, were it
                  to be deferred a twelvemonth: Mrs. Selwyn has, doubtless, acquainted you with the
                  many motives which, independent of my eagerness, require it to be speedy; suffer,
                  therefore, its acceleration, and generously complete my felicity, by endea vouring
                  to suffer it without repugnance." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Indeed, my Lord, I would not wilfully raise objections, nor do I
                  desire to appear insensible of the honour of your good opinion;—but there is
                  something in this plan, so very hasty,—so unrea sonably precipitate,—besides, I
                  shall have no time to hear from Berry Hill,—and believe me, my Lord, I should be
                  for ever miserable, were I, in an affair so important, to act without the sanction
                  of Mr. Villars' advice." </q>
            </p>
            <p> He offered to wait on you himself; but I told him I had rather write to you. And
               then he pro posed, that, instead of my immediately accom panying him to Lincolnshire,
               we should, first, pass a month at <hi>my native Berry Hill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p> This was, indeed, a grateful proposal to me, and I listened to it with undisguised
               pleasure. And,—in short, I was obliged to consent to a com promise, in merely
               deferring the day till Thurs day! He readily undertook to engage my father's
               concurrence in this little delay, and I besought him, at the same time, to make use
               of his influ ence to obtain me a second interview, and to re present the deep concern
               I felt in being thus ba nished his sight. </p>
            <p> He would then have spoken of <hi>settlements,</hi> but <pb n="250"/> I assured him,
               I was almost ignorant even of the word. </p>
            <p> And now, my dearest Sir, what is your opinion of these hasty proceedings? believe
               me, I half re gret the simple facility with which I have suffered myself to be
               hurried into compliance, and, should you start but the smallest objection, I will yet
               in sist upon being allowed more time. </p>
            <p> I must now write a concise account of the state of my affairs to Howard Grove, and
               to Madame Duval. </p>
            <p> Adieu, dearest and most honoured Sir! every thing, at present, depends upon your
               single deci sion, to which, though I yield in trembling, I yield implicitly. </p>

            <p> YESTERDAY morning, as soon as breakfast was over, Lord Orville went to the Hotwells,
               to wait upon my father with my double petition. </p>
            <p> Mrs. Beaumont then, in general terms, propos ed a walk in the garden. Mrs. Selwyn
               said she had letters to write, but Lady Louisa arose to ac company her. </p>
            <p> I had some reason to imagine, from the notice with which her Ladyship had honoured
               me during breakfast, that her brother had acquainted her with my present situation:
               and her behaviour now confirmed my conjecture; for, when I would have gone up stairs,

               after me, with an affected surprise, <q rend="inline">"Miss Anville, don't you walk
                  with us?"</q>
            </p>
            <p> There seemed something so little-minded in this sudden change of conduct, that, from
               an invo luntary emotion of contempt, I thanked her, with a coldness like her own, and
               declined her offer. Yet, observing that she blushed extremely at my refusal, and
               recollecting she was sister to Lord Orville, my indignation subsided, and upon Mrs.
               Beaumont's repeating the invitation, I accepted it. </p>
            <p> Our walk proved extremely dull; Mrs. Beau mont, who never says much, was more silent
               than usual; Lady Louisa strove in vain to lay aside the restraint and distance she
               has hitherto preserv ed; and as to me, I was too conscious of the cir cumstances to
               which I owed their attention, to feel either pride or pleasure from receiving it. </p>
            <p> Lord Orville was not long absent; he joined us in the garden, with a look of gaiety
               and good-hu mour that revived us all. <q rend="inline">"You are just the party,"</q>
               said he, <q rend="inline">"I wished to see together. Will you, Madam,"</q> taking my
               hand, <q rend="inline"> "allow me the honour of introducing you, by your real name,
                  to two of my nearest relations? Mrs. Beaumont, give me leave to present to you the
                  daughter of Sir John Belmont; a young lady who, I am sure, must long since have
                  engaged your esteem and ad miration, tho' you were a stranger to her birth." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"My Lord,"</q> said Mrs. Beaumont, graciously saluting me, <q
                  rend="inline"> "the young lady's rank in life,—your Lordsh p's recommendation,—or
                  her own merit, would any one of them have been suffi cient to have entitled her to
                  my regard; and I hope she has always met with that respect in my house which is so
                  much her due; though, had I been <pb n="252"/> sooner made acquainted with her
                  family, I should, doubtless, have the better known how to have secured it." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Miss Belmont,"</q> said Lord. Orville, <q rend="inline"> "can
                  receive no lustre from family, whatever she may give to it. Louisa, you will, I am
                  sure, be hap py to make yourself an interest in the friendship of Miss Belmont,
                  whom I hope shortly," </q> kissing my hand, and joining it with her Ladyship's, <q
                  rend="inline"> "to have the happiness of presenting to you by yet another name,
                  and by the most endearing of all titles." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I believe it would be difficult to say whose cheeks were, at that moment, of the
               deepest dye, Lady Louisa's or my own; for the conscious pride with which she has
               hitherto slighted me, gave to her an embarrassment which equalled the confusion that
               an introduction so unexpected gave to me. She saluted me, however, and, with a faint
               smile, said, <q rend="inline"> "I shall esteem myself very happy to profit by the
                  honour of Miss Belmont's acquaintance." </q>
            </p>
            <p> I only courtsied, and we walked on; but it was evident, from the little surprise
               they expressed, that they had been already informed of the state of the affair. </p>
            <p> We were, soon after, joined by more compa ny: and Lord Orville then, in a low voice,
               took an opportunity to tell me the success of his visit. In the first place, Thursday
               was agreed to; and, in the second, my father, he said, was much con cerned to hear of
               my uneasiness, sent me his bles sing, and complied with my request of seeing him,
               with the same readiness he should agree to any other I could make. Lord Orville,
               therefore, settled that I should wait upon him in the evening, <pb n="253"/> and, at
               his particular request, unaccompanied by Mrs. Selwyn. </p>
            <p> This kind message, and the prospect of so soon seeing him, gave me sensations of
               mixed pleasure and pain, which wholly occupied my mind till the time of my going to
               the Hotwells. </p>
            <p> Mrs. Beaumont lent me her chariot, and Lord Orville absolutely insisted upon
               attending me. <q rend="inline">"If you go alone,"</q> said he, <q rend="inline">
                  "Mrs. Selwyn will certainly be offended; but, if you allow me to conduct you, tho'
                  she may give the freer scope to her raillery, she cannot possibly be affronted:
                  and we had much better suffer her laughter, than provoke her satire." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Indeed, I must own I had no reason to regret being so accompanied; for his
               conversation sup ported my spirits from drooping, and made the ride seem so short,
               that we actually stopt at my father's door, ere I knew we had proceeded ten yards. </p>
            <p> He handed me from the carriage, and conduct ed me to the parlour, at the door of
               which I was met by Mr. Macartney. <q rend="inline"> "Ah, my dear bro ther," </q>
               cried I, <q rend="inline">"how happy am I to see you here!"</q>
            </p>
            <p> He bowed and thanked me. Lord Orville, then, holding out his hand, said, <q
                  rend="inline"> "Mr. Macart ney, I hope we shall be better acquainted; I pro mise
                  myself much pleasure from cultivating your friendship. </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Your Lordship does me but too much ho nour," </q> answered Mr.
               Macartney. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"But where,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline"> "is my sister? for so I
                  must already call, and always consider her:—I am afraid she avoids me;—you must
                  endeavour, my dear brother, to prepossess her in my favour, and reconcile her to
                  owning me." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="254"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Oh, Madam,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "you are all goodness
                  and benevolence! but at present, I hope you will excuse her, for I fear she has
                  hardly for titude sufficient to see you: in a short time, per haps—" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "In a <hi>very</hi> short time, then," </q> said Lord Or ville, <q
                  rend="inline"> "I hope you will yourself introduce her, and that we shall have the
                  pleasure of wishing you both joy: allow me, my Evelina, to say <hi>we,</hi> and
                  permit me, in your name, as well as my own, to entreat that the first guests we
                  shall have the hap piness of receiving, may be Mr. and Mrs. Ma Macartney." </q>
            </p>
            <p>A servant then came to beg I would walk up stairs.</p>
            <p> I besought Lord Orville to accompany me; but he feared the displeasure of Sir John,
               who had desired to see me alone. He led me, however, to the head of the stairs, and
               made the kindest ef forts to give me courage; but indeed he did not succeed, for the
               interview appeared to me in all its terrors, and left me no feeling but apprehen
               sion. </p>
            <p> The moment I reached the landing-place, the drawing-room door was opened, and my
               father, with a voice of kindness, called out, <q rend="inline">"My child, is it
                  you?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir,"</q> cried I, springing forward, and kneeling at his
               feet, <q rend="inline">"it is your child, if you will own her!"</q>
            </p>
            <p> He knelt by my side, and folding me in his arms, <q rend="inline">"own thee!"</q>
               repeated he, <q rend="inline"> "yes, my poor girl, and Heaven knows with what bitter
                  contrition!" </q> Then, raising both himself and me, he brought me into the
               drawing-room, shut the door, and took me to the window, where, look ing at me with
               great earnestness, <q rend="inline"> "Poor unhap py <pb n="255"/> Caroline!" </q>
               cried he, and, to my inexpressible concern, he burst into tears. Need I tell you, my
               dear Sir, how mine flowed at the sight? </p>
            <p> I would again have embraced his knees; but, hurrying from me, he flung himself upon
               a so pha, and leaning his face on his arms, seemed, for some time, absorbed in
               bitterness of grief. </p>
            <p> I ventured not to interrupt a sorrow I so much respected, but waited in silence, and
               at a dis tance, till he recovered from its violence. But then it seemed, in a moment,
               to give way to a kind of frantic fury; for, starting suddenly, with a sternness which
               at once surprised and frightened me, <q rend="inline">"Child,"</q> cried he, <q
                  rend="inline"> "hast thou yet suffi ciently humbled thy father?—if thou hast, be
                  contented with this proof of my weakness, and no longer force thyself into my
                  presence!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> Thunderstruck by a command so unexpected, I stood still and speechless, and doubted
               whether my own ears did not deceive me: </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Oh, go, go!"</q> cried he, passionately, <q rend="inline"> "in
                  pity—in compassion,—if thou valuest my senses, leave me,—and for ever!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I will, I will!"</q> cried I, greatly terrified; and I moved
               hastily towards the door: yet stop ping when I reached it, and, almost involuntarily,
               dropping on my knees, <q rend="inline">"Vouchsafe,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline">
                  "oh, Sir, vouchsafe but once to bless your daugh ter, and her sight shall never
                  more offend you!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Alas,"</q> cried he, in a softened voice, <q rend="inline"> "I am
                  not worthy to bless thee!—I am not worthy to call thee daughter!—I am not worthy
                  that the fair light of heaven should visit my eyes!—Oh God! that I could but call
                  back the time ere thou wast born,—or else bury its remembrance in eternal obli
                  vion!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="256"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Would to Heaven,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline"> "that the sight of
                  me were less terrible to you! that, in stead of irritating, I could soothe your
                  sorrows!—Oh Sir, how thankfully would I then prove my duty, even at the hazard of
                  my life!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Are you so kind?"</q> cried he, gently; <q rend="inline"> "come
                  hither, child,—rise, Evelina;—alas, it is for <hi>me</hi> to kneel, not you!—and I
                     <hi>would</hi> kneel,—I would crawl upon the earth,—I would kiss the
                  dust,—could I, by such submission, obtain the forgive ness of the representative
                  of the most injured of women!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Oh, Sir,"</q> exclaimed I, <q rend="inline"> "that you could but
                  read my heart!—that you could but see the fi lial tenderness and concern with
                  which it over flows! you would not then talk thus,—you would not then banish me
                  your presence, and exclude me from your affection!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Good God,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "is it then possible
                  that you do not hate me?—Can the child of the wronged Caroline look at,—and not
                  execrate me? Wast thou not born to abhor, and bred to curse me? did not thy mother
                  bequeath thee her blessing, on condition that thou shouldst detest and avoid me?"
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Oh no, no, no!"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline"> "think not so
                  unkindly of her, nor so hardly of me." </q> I then took from my pocket-book her
               last letter, and, pressing it to my lips, with a trembling hand, and still upon my
               knees, I held it out to him. </p>
            <p> Hastily snatching it from me, <q rend="inline"> "Great Hea ven!" </q> cried he, <q
                  rend="inline"> 'tis her writing!—Whence comes this?—who gave it you?—why had I it
                  not soon er?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I made no answer; his vehemence intimidated me, and I ventured not to move from the
               suppli ant posture in which I had put myself. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="257"/> He went from me to the window, where his eyes were for some time
               rivetted upon the directi on of the letter, though his hand shook so vio lently he
               could hardly hold it. Then, bringing it to me, <q rend="inline">"Open it,"</q> —cried
               he,— <q rend="inline"> "for I can not!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I had, myself, hardly strength to obey him; but, when I had, he took it back, and
               walked hastily up and down the room, as if dreading to read it. At length, turning to
               me, <q rend="inline">"Do you know,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline">"its
                  contents?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No, Sir,</q> answered I; <q rend="inline">"it has never been
                  unsealed."</q>
            </p>
            <p> He then again went to the window, and began reading. Having hastily run it over, he
               cast up his eyes with a look of desperation; the letter fell from his hand, and he
               exclaimed, <q rend="inline"> "yes! thou art sainted!—thou art blessed!—and I am
                  cursed for ever!" </q> He continued some time fixed in this melancholy position;
               after which, casting him self with violence upon the ground, <q rend="inline">"Oh
                  wretch,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "unworthy life and light, in what dungeon
                  canst thou hide thy head?" </q>
            </p>
            <p> I could restrain myself no longer; I rose and went to him; I did not dare to speak,
               but with pity and concern unutterable, I wept and hung over him. </p>
            <p> Soon after, starting up, he again seized the letter, exclaiming, <q rend="inline">
                  "Acknowledge thee, Caro line!—yes, with my heart's best blood would I acknowledge
                  thee!—Oh that thou couldst witness the agony of my soul!—Ten thousand daggers
                  could not have wounded me like this letter!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> Then, after again reading it, <q rend="inline">"Evelina,"</q> he cried, <q
                  rend="inline"> "she charges me to receive thee;—wilt thou, in obedience to her
                  will, own for thy fa ther the destroyer of thy mother?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="258"/> What a dreadful question! I shuddered, but could not speak. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"To clear her fame, and receive her child,"</q> continued he,
               looking stedfastly at the letter, <q rend="inline"> "are the conditions upon which
                  she leaves me her forgiveness: her fame, I have already clear ed;—and oh how
                  willingly would I take her child to my bosom,—fold her to my heart,—call upon her
                  to mitigate my anguish, and pour the balm of comfort on my wounds, were I not
                  conscious I deserve not to receive it, and that all my affliction is the result of
                  my own guilt!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> It was in vain I attempted to speak; hor ror and grief took from me all power of
               utte rance. </p>
            <p> He then read aloud from the letter, <q rend="inline"> " <hi>Look not like thy
                     unfortunate mother!</hi> —Sweet soul, with what bitterness of spirit hast thou
                  written!—Come hither, Evelina: Gracious Heaven!" </q> looking earnestly at me, <q
                  rend="inline"> "never was likeness more striking!—the eye,—the face,—the form,—Oh
                  my child, my child!" </q> Imagine, Sir,—for I can never describe my feelings, when
               I saw him sink upon his knees before me! <q rend="inline"> "Oh dear re semblance of

                  thou representative of my departed wife, speak to me in her name, and say that the
                  remorse which tears my soul, tortures me not in vain!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Oh rise, rise, my beloved father,"</q> cried I, attempting to
               assist him, <q rend="inline"> "I cannot bear to see you thus;—reverse not the law of

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"May Heaven bless thee, my child!—"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline">
                  "for <hi>I</hi> dare not." </q> He then rose, and embracing me most
               affectionately, added, <q rend="inline"> "I see, I see that thou art all kindness,
                  softness, and tenderness; I need not have feared thee, thou art all the fondest
                  father could wish, and I will try to frame my mind to less painful sensations at
                  thy sight. Perhaps the time may come when I may know the comfort of such a
                  daughter,—at present, I am only fit to be alone: dreadful as are my reflections,
                  they ought merely to torment my self.—Adieu, my child;—be not angry,—I cannot stay
                  with thee,—oh Evelina! thy countenance is a dagger to my heart!—just so, thy
                  mother look ed,—just so—" </q>
            </p>
            <p> Tears and sighs seemed to choak him!—and waving his hand, he would have left
               me,—but, clinging to him, <q rend="inline">"Oh, Sir,"</q> cried I, <q rend="inline">
                  "will you so soon abandon me?—am I again an orphan?—oh my dear, my long-lost
                  father, leave me not, I beseech you! take pity on your child, and rob her not of
                  the parent she so fondly hoped would cherish her!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"You know not what you ask,"</q> cried he; <q rend="inline"> "the
                  emotions which now rend my soul are more than my reason can endure: suffer me,
                  then, to leave you,—impute it not to unkindness, but think of me as well as thou
                  canst.—Lord Orville has behaved nobly;—I believe he will make thee happy." </q>
               Then, again embracing me, <q rend="inline">"God bless thee, my dear child,"</q> cried
               he, <q rend="inline"> "God bless thee, my Evelina!—endeavour to love,—at least not to
                  hate me,—and to make me an in terest in thy filial bosom by thinking of me as thy
                  father." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="260"/> I could not speak; I kissed his hands on my knees; and then, with yet
               more emotion, he again blessed me, and hurried out of the room,—leaving me almost
               drowned in tears. </p>
            <p> Oh Sir, all goodness as you are, how much will you feel for your Evelina, during a
               scene of such agitation! I pray Heaven to accept the tribute of his remorse, and
               restore him to tranquility! </p>
            <p> When I was sufficiently composed to return to the parlour, I found Lord Orville
               waiting for me with the utmost anxiety;—and then, a new scene of emotion, though of a
               far different nature, awaited me; for I learnt, by Mr. Macartney, that this noblest
               of men had insisted the so-long-sup posed Miss Belmont should be considered
                  <hi>indeed</hi> as my sister, and as the co-heiress of my father! though not in
                  <hi>law,</hi> in <hi>justice,</hi> he says, she ought ever to be treated as the
               daughter of Sir John Bel mont. </p>
            <p> Oh Lord Orville!—it shall be the sole study of my happy life, to express, better
               than by words, the sense I have of your exalted benevolence, and greatness of mind!

            <div type="section">
               <p> THIS morning, early, I received the follow ing letter from Sir Clement
                  Willoughby. </p>
               <floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <pb n="261"/>
                     <head>To Miss Anville.</head>
                     <p> I HAVE this moment received intelligence that preparations are actually
                        making for your marriage with Lord Orville. </p>
                     <p> Imagine not that I write with the imbecile idea of rendering those
                        preparations abortive. No, I am not so mad. My sole view is to explain the
                        motive of my conduct in a particular instance, and to obviate the accusation
                        of treachery which may be laid to my charge. </p>
                     <p> My unguarded behaviour when I last saw you, has, probably, already
                        acquainted you, that the letter I then saw you reading was written by my
                        self. For your further satisfaction, let me have the honour of informing
                        you, thatt the one you had designed for Lord Orville, had fallen into my
                        hands. </p>
                     <p> However I may have been urged on by a passi on the most violent that ever
                        warmed the heart of man, I can by no means calmly submit to be stig matised
                        for an action seemingly so dishonourable; and it is for this reason that I
                        trouble you with my justification. </p>
                     <p> Lord Orville,—the happy Orville, whom you are so ready to bless,—had made
                        me believe he loved you not,—nay, that he held you in con tempt. </p>
                     <p> Such were my thoughts of his sentiments of you, when I got possession of
                        the letter you meant to send him; I pretend not to vindicate either the
                        means I used to obtain it, or the action of break ing the seal;—but I was
                        impelled by an impetuous <pb n="262"/> curiosity to discover the terms upon
                        which you wrote to him. </p>
                     <p> The letter, however, was wholly unintelligible to me, and the perusal of it
                        only added to my perplexity. </p>
                     <p> A tame suspence I was not born to endure, and I determined to clear my
                        doubts at all hazards and events. </p>
                     <p>I answered it, therefore, in Orville's name.</p>
                     <p> The views which I am now going to acknow ledge, must, infallibly, incur
                        your displeasure,—yet I scorn all palliation. </p>
                     <p> Briefly, then,—I concealed your letter to pre vent a discovery of your
                        capacity,—and I wrote you an answer which I hoped would prevent your wishing
                        for any other. </p>
                     <p> I am well aware of everything which can be said upon this subject. Lord
                        Orville will, possi bly, think himself ill used;—but I am extremely
                        indifferent as to his opinion, nor do I now write by way of offering any
                        apology to him, but merely to make known to yourself the reasons by which I
                        have been governed. </p>
                     <p> I intend to set off next week for the Continent. Should his Lordship have
                        any commands for me in the mean time, I shall be glad to receive them. I say
                        not this by way of defiance,—I should blush to be suspected of so doing
                        through an indirect channel,—but simply that, if you shew him this letter,
                        he may know I dare defend, as well as ex cuse my conduct. </p>

                  </body>
               </floatingText>
               <p> What a strange letter! how proud and how piqued does its writer appear! To what
                  alternate <hi>meanness</hi> and <hi>rashness</hi> do the passions lead, when
                  reason and self-denial do not oppose them! Sir <pb n="263"/> Clement is conscious
                  he has acted dishonourably, yet the same unbridled vehemence which urged him to
                  gratify a blameable curiosity, will sooner prompt him to risk his life, than
                  confess his mis conduct. The rudeness of his manner of writing to me springs from
                  the same cause: the proof he has received of my indifference to him, has stung him
                  to the soul, and he has neither the delicacy nor forbearance to disguise his dis
                  pleasure. </p>
               <p> I determined not to shew this letter to Lord Orville, and thought it most prudent
                  to let Sir Clement know I should not. I therefore wrote the following note. </p>
               <floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <head>To Sir Clement Willoughby.</head>
                     <opener>
                        <salute>Sir,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p> THE letter you have been pleased to address to me, is so little calculated
                        to afford Lord Or ville any satisfaction, that you may depend up on my
                        carefully keeping it from his sight. I will bear you no resentment for what
                        is past; but I most earnestly entreat, nay implore, that you will not write
                        again, while in your present frame of mind, by <hi>any</hi> channel, direct
                        or indirect. </p>
                     <p> I hope you will have much pleasure in your pur posed expedition, and I beg
                        leave to assure you of my good wishes. </p>
                  </body>
               </floatingText>
               <p> Not knowing by what name to sign, I was ob liged to send it without any. </p>
               <p> The <hi>preparations</hi> which Sir Clement mentions, go on just as if your
                  consent were arrived: it is in <pb n="264"/> vain that I expostulate; Lord Orville
                  says, should any objections be raised, all shall be given up, but that, as his
                  hopes forbid him to expect any, he must proceed as if already assured of your con
                  currence. </p>
               <p> We have had, this afternoon, a most interesting conversation, in which we have
                  traced our sen timents of each other from our first acquain tance. I have made him
                  confess how ill he thought of me, upon my foolish giddiness at Mrs. Stanley's
                  ball; but he flatters me with assurances, that every succeeding time he saw me, I
                  appeared to something less and less disadvan tage. </p>
               <p> When I expressed my amazement that he could honour with his choice a girl who
                  seemed so infi nitely, in <hi>every</hi> respect, beneath his alliance, he frankly
                  owned, that he had fully intended making more minute enquiries into my family and
                  connec tions, and particularly concerning <hi>those people</hi> he saw with me at
                  Marybone, before he acknow ledged his prepossession in my favour: but the
                  suddenness of my intended journey, and the un certainty of seeing me again, put
                  him quite off his guard, and <q rend="inline"> "divesting him of prudence, left
                     him nothing but love." </q> These were his words; and yet, he has repeatedly
                  assured me, that his par tiality has known no bounds from the time of my residing
                  at Clifton. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <p> Mr. Macartney has just been with me, on an embassy from my father. He has sent me
                  his kindest love, and assurances of favour, and desired to know if I am happy in
                  the prospect of chang ing my situation, and if there is any thing I can <pb
                     n="265"/> name which he can do for me. And, at the same time, Mr. Macartney
                  delivered to me a draught on my father's banker for a thousand pounds, which he
                  insisted that I should receive entirely for my own use, and expend in equipping
                  myself properly for the new rank of life to which I seem destined. </p>
               <p> I am sure I need not say how much I was pene trated by this goodness; I wrote my
                  thanks, and acknowledged, frankly, that if I could see <hi>him</hi> restored to
                  tranquility, my heart would be without a wish. </p>

            <p> THE time approaches now, when I hope we shall meet,—yet I cannot sleep,—great joy is
               as restless as sorrow,—and therefore I will continue my journal. </p>
            <p> As I had never had any opportunity of see ing Bath, a party was formed last night
               for shewing me that celebrated city; and this morn ing, after breakfast, we set out
               in three pha etons. Lady Louisa and Mrs. Beaumont, with Lord Merton; Mr. Coverly with
               Mr. Lo vel; and Mrs. Selwyn and myself, with Lord Orville. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="266"/> We had hardly proceeded half a mile, when a gentleman in a post-chaise,
               which came gal loping after us, called out to the servants, <q rend="inline"> "Hol

            </p>
            <p> I immediately recollected the voice of Cap tain Mirvan, and Lord Orville stopt the
               pha eton. He was out of the chaise, and with us in a moment. <q rend="inline">"So,
                  Miss Anville,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "how do you do? So I hear you're
                  Miss Bel mont now;—pray how does old Madame French do?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Madame Duval,"</q> said I, <q rend="inline">"is, I believe, very

            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "I hope she's in <hi>good case,</hi> " </q> said he, wink ing
               significantly, <q rend="inline"> "and won't flinch at seeing service: she has laid by
                  long enough to refit and be made tight. And pray how does poor Monsieur Doleful

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"You have been very obliging!"</q> said I, laughing. </p>

               <q rend="inline">"O, I promise you,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "our Moll would

                  you into the secret, I fully intended to have treated the old buck with another
                  frolic." </q>
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>

               <q rend="inline">"Good God, Sir, why did not you tell me sooner?"</q> cried I; and
               immediately, with Lord Orville's assistance, I jumpt out of the phaeton, and ran to
               the dear girl. Lord Orville opened the chaise-door, and I am sure I need not tell you
               what unfeigned joy accompanied our meeting. </p>
            <p> We both begged we might not be parted during the ride, and Lord Orville was so good
               as to invite Captain Mirvan into his phae ton. </p>
            <p> I think I was hardly ever more rejoiced than at this so seasonable visit from my
               dear Maria; who had no sooner heard the situation of my affairs, than, with the
               assistance of Lady Howard and her kind mother, she besought her father with such
               earnestness to consent to the journey, that he had not been able to withstand their
               united en treaties; though she owned that, had he not ex pected to have met with
               Madame Duval, she be lieves he would not so readily have yielded. They arrived at
               Mrs. Beaumont's but a few minutes af ter we were out of sight, and overtook us
               without much difficulty. </p>

               <pb n="268"/> I say nothing of our conversation, because you may so well suppose both
               the subjects we chose, and our manner of discussing them. </p>
            <p> We all stopped at a great hotel, where we were obliged to enquire for a room, as
               Lady Louisa, <hi>fatigued to death,</hi> desired to <hi>take something</hi> before we
               began our rambles. </p>
            <p> As soon as the party was assembled, the Cap tain, abruptly saluting me, said, <q
                  rend="inline"> "So, Miss Bel mont, I wish you joy; so I hear you've quarrelled
                  with your new name already?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Me!—no, indeed, Sir."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Then please for to tell me the reason you're in such a hurry to
                  change it." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Miss Belmont!"</q> cried Mr. Lovel, looking round him with the
               utmost astonishment, <q rend="inline"> "I beg pardon,—but, if it is not
                  impertinent,—I must beg leave to say, I always understood that Lady's name was
                  Anville." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"'Fore George,"</q> cried the Captain, <q rend="inline"> "it runs in
                  my head, I've seen you somewhere before! and now I think on't, pray a'n't you the
                  person I saw at the play one night, and who did n't know, all the time, whether it
                  was a tragedy or a come dy, or a concert of fidlers?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I believe, Sir,"</q> said Mr. Lovel, stammering, <q rend="inline">
                  "I had once,—I think—the pleasure of seeing you last spring." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Ay, and if I live an hundred springs,"</q> an swered he, <q
                  rend="inline"> "I shall never forget it; by Jingo, it has served me for a most

                  "pray, if a body may be so bold, how much a night may you give at present to keep

               <q rend="inline">"Me, Sir!"</q> said Mr. Lovel, very much dis composed; <q

            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "O, you don't!—why then I'll make free for to explain myself.
                  Gentlemen and Ladies, I'll tell you what; do you know this here gentleman, simple
                  as he sits there, pays five shillings a night to let his friends know he's alive!
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"And very cheap too,"</q> said Mrs. Selwyn, <q rend="inline"> "if we
                  consider the value of the intelli gence." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Lady Louisa, being now refreshed, we proceed ed upon our expedition. </p>
            <p> The charming city of Bath answered all my ex pectations. The Crescent, the prospect
               from it, and the elegant symmetry of the Circus, delighted me. The Parades, I own,
               rather disappointed me; one of them is scarce preferable to some of the best paved
               streets in London, and the other, though it affords a beautiful prospect, a charming
               view of Prior Park and of the Avon, yet wanted something in <hi>itself</hi> of more
               striking elegance than a mere broad pavement, to satisfy the ideas I had formed of
               it. </p>
            <p> At the pump-room, I was amazed at the pub lic exhibition of the ladies in the bath:
               it is true, their heads are covered with bonnets, but the very idea of being seen, in
               such a situation, by whoever pleases to look, is indelicate. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"'Fore George,"</q> said the Captain, look ing into the bath, <q
                  rend="inline"> "this would be a most ex cellent place for old Madame French to
                  dance a fandango in! By Jingo, I would n't wish for better sport than to swing her
                  round this here pond!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="270"/>
               <q rend="inline">"She would be very much obliged to you,"</q> said Lord Orville, <q
                  rend="inline">"for so extraordinary a mark of your favour."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why, to let you know,"</q> answered the Cap tain, <q rend="inline">
                  "she hit my fancy mightily; I never took so much to an old tabby before." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Really, now,"</q> cried Mr. Lovel, looking also into the bath, <q
                  rend="inline"> "I must confess it is, to me, very incomprehensible why the ladies
                  chuse that frightful unbecoming dress to bathe in! I have of ten pondered very
                  seriously upon the subject, but could never hit upon the reason." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Well, I declare,"</q> said Lady Louisa, <q rend="inline"> "I should
                  like of all things to set something new a going; I always hated bathing, because
                  one can get no pretty dress for it; now do, there's a good creature, try to help
                  me to something." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Who? me!—O dear Ma'am,"</q> said he, simpering, <q rend="inline">
                  "I can't pretend to assist a person of your Ladyship's taste; besides, I have not
                  the least head for fashions,—I really don't think I ever invented three in my
                  life!—but I never had the least turn for dress,—never any notion of fancy or
                  elegance." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "O fie, Mr. Lovel! how can you talk so?—don't we all know that you
                  lead the <hi>ton</hi> in the <hi>beau monde?</hi> —I declare, I think you dress
                  better than any body." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "O dear Ma'am, you confuse me to the last degree! <hi>I</hi> dress
                  well!—I protest I don't think I'm ever fit to be seen!—I'm often shocked to death
                  to think what a figure I go. If your Ladyship will believe me, I was full half an
                  hour this morning thinking what I should put on!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Odds my life,"</q> cried the Captain, <q rend="inline"> "I wish I'd

                  Half an hour thinking what you'd put on? and who the deuce, do you think, cares
                  the snuff of a candle whether you've any thing on or not?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O pray, Captain,"</q> cried Mrs. Selwyn, <q rend="inline"> "don't
                  be angry with the gentleman for <hi> think ing, </hi> whatever be the cause, for,
                  I assure you, he makes no common practice of offending in that way." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Really, Ma'am, you are prodigiously kind!"</q> said Mr. Lovel,
               angrily. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Pray, now,"</q> said the Captain, <q rend="inline"> "did you ever
                  get a ducking in that there place your self?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"A ducking, Sir!"</q> repeated Mr. Lovel; <q rend="inline"> "I
                  protest I think that's rather an odd term!—but if you mean a <hi>bathing,</hi> it
                  is an honour I have had many times." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "And pray, if a body may be so bold, what do you do with that
                  frizle-frize top of your own? Why, I'll lay you what you will, there is fat and
                  grease enough on your crown, to buoy you up, if you were to go in head down
                  wards." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"And I don't know,"</q> cried Mrs. Selwyn, <q rend="inline"> "but
                  that might be the easiest way, for I'm sure it would be the lightest." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"For the matter of that there,"</q> said the Captain, <q
                  rend="inline"> "you must make him a soldier, be fore you can tell which is the

                  whisk him so dexterously over into the pool, that he should light plump upon his
                  foretop, and turn round like a tetotum." </q>
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>

               <q rend="inline">"Will you?"</q> returned he; <q rend="inline"> "why then, 'fore

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"He, he!"</q> faintly laughed Mr. Lovel, as he moved abruptly from
               the window, <q rend="inline"> "'pon ho nour, this is pleasant enough; but I don't see

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"There, Lovel, you are out;"</q> cried Mr. Coverly; <q rend="inline"
                  > "any man may lay what wager about you he pleases; your consent is nothing to the

            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Ay,"</q> said Mrs. Selwyn, <q rend="inline"> "or that your mind is

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I protest,"</q> said Mr. Lovel, angrily, <q rend="inline"> "I think
                  it's a very disagreeable privilege, and I must beg that nobody may take such a

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Like enough you may,"</q> cried the Cap tain; <q rend="inline">
                  "but what's that to the purpose? sup pose I've a mind to lay that you've never a

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "You'll allow me, at least, Sir, to take the liberty of asking how

            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Knocking them all down my throat, Sir!"</q> repeated Mr. Lovel,
               with a look of horror, <q rend="inline"> "I protest I never heard any thing so
                  shocking in my life; and I must beg leave to observe, that no wager, in my

            </p>
            <p> Here Lord Orville interfered, and hurried us to our carriages. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="273"/> We returned in the same order we came.—Mrs. Beaumont invited all the
               party to dinner, and has been so obliging as to beg Miss Mirvan may continue at her
               house during her stay. The Captain will lodge at the Wells. </p>
            <p> The first half-hour after our return, was de voted to hearing Mr. Lovel's apologies
               for dining in his riding-dress. </p>
            <p> Mrs. Beaumont then, addressing herself to Miss Mirvan and me, enquired how we liked
               Bath? </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I hope,"</q> said Mr. Lovel, <q rend="inline">"the Ladies do not

            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No!—what should ail 'em?"</q> cried the Cap tain; <q rend="inline">
                  "do you suppose they put their eyes in their pockets?" </q>

            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "No, Sir; but I fancy you will find no per son,—that is, no person

            </p>
            <p> Mr. Lovel again smiled; but seemed superior to making any answer. </p>

               <q rend="inline">"The Bath amusements,"</q> said Lord Orville, <q rend="inline">
                  "have a sameness in them, which, after a short time, renders them rather insipid:

            </p>

                  >"has your Ladyship heard the news?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"News!—what news?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why, the report circulating at the Wells concerning a certain
                  person?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O Lord, no; pray tell me what it is!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "O no, Ma'am, I beg your La'ship will ex cuse me; 'tis a profound
                  secret, and I would not have mentioned it, if I had not thought you knew it." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Lord, now, how can you be so monstrous?—I declare, now, you're a
                  provoking creature! <pb n="275"/> But come, I know you'll tell me;—won't you now?"
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Your La'ship knows I am but too happy to obey you; but, 'pon
                  honour, I can't speak a word, if you won't all promise me the most inviola ble
                  secrecy." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I wish you'd wait for that from me,"</q> said the Captain, <q
                  rend="inline"> "and I'll give you my word you'd be dumb for one while. Secrecy,
                  quoth a!—Fore George, I wonder you a'n't ashamed to men tion such a word, when you
                  talk of telling it to a woman. Though, for the matter of that, I'd as lieve blab
                  it to the whole sex at once, as to go for to tell it to such a thing as you." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Such a thing as me, Sir!"</q> said Mr. Lovel, letting fall his
               knife and fork, and looking very important: <q rend="inline"> "I really have not the
                  honour to understand your expression." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"It's all one for that,"</q> said the Captain; <q rend="inline">"you
                  may have it explained whenever you like it."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"'Pon honour, Sir,"</q> returned Mr. Lovel, <q rend="inline"> "I
                  must take the liberty to tell you, that I should be extremely offended, but that I
                  suppose it to be some sea-phrase, and therefore I'll let it pass with out further
                  notice." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Lord Orville then, to change the discourse, asked Miss Mirvan if she should spend
               the ensuing winter in London?" </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"No, to be sure,"</q> said the Captain, <q rend="inline"> "what
                  should she for? she saw all that was to be seen before." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Is London, then,"</q> said Mr. Lovel smiling, at Lady Louisa, <q
                  rend="inline"> "only to be regarded as a <hi>sight?</hi> " </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why pray, Mr. Wiseacre, how are you pleased for to regard it
                  yourself?—Answer me to that?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="276"/>
               <q rend="inline"> "O Sir, <hi>my</hi> opinion I fancy you would hardly find
                  intelligible. I don't understand <hi>sea-phrases</hi> enough to define it to your
                  comprehension. Does n't your La'ship think the task would be rather difficult?"
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O Lard, yes,"</q> cried Lady Louisa, <q rend="inline"> "I de clare
                  I'd as soon teach my parrot to talk Welch." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Ha! ha! ha! admirable!—Pon honour, your La'ship's quite in luck to
                  day;—but that, indeed, your La'ship is every day. Though, to be sure, it is but
                  candid to acknowledge, that the gentlemen of the ocean have a set of ideas, as
                  well as a dialect, so opposite to <hi>ours,</hi> that it is by no means surprising
                     <hi>they</hi> should regard London as a mere <hi>show,</hi> that may be seen by
                  being <hi>looked at.</hi> Ha! ha! ha! </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Ha! ha!</q> echoed Lady Louisa: <q rend="inline"> Well, I de clare
                  you are the drollest creature!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "He! he! 'pon honour I can't help laughing at the conceit of
                     <hi>seeing London</hi> in a few weeks!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"And what a plague should hinder you?"</q> cri ed the Captain; <q
                  rend="inline">"do you want to spend a day in every street?"</q>
            </p>
            <p> Here again Lady Louisa and Mr. Lovel inter changed smiles. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why, I warrant you, if I had the shewing of it, I'd haul you from
                  St. James's to Wapping the very first morning." </q>
            </p>
            <p> The smiles were now, with added contempt, repeated; which the Captain observing,
               looked very fiercely at Mr. Lovel, and said, <q rend="inline"> "Hark'ee, my spark,
                  none of your grinning!—'tis a lingo I don't understand; and if you give me any
                  more of it, I shall go near to lend you a box o' the ear." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I protest, Sir,"</q> said Mr. Lovel, turning ex tremely pale, <q
                  rend="inline"> "I think it's taking a very particular <pb n="277"/> liberty with a
                  person, to talk to one in such a style as this!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"It's like you may,"</q> returned the Captain; <q rend="inline">
                  "but give a good gulp and I warrant you'll swal low it." </q> Then, calling for a
               glass of ale, with a very provoking and significant nod, he drank to his easy
               digestion. </p>
            <p> Mr. Lovel made no answer, but looked ex tremely sullen: and soon after, we left the
               gen tlemen to themselves. </p>
            <p> I had then two letters delivered to me; one from Lady Howard and Mrs. Mirvan, which
               con tained the kindest congratulations; and the other from Madame Duval,—but not a
               word from <hi>you,</hi> —to my no small surprise and concern. </p>
            <p> Madame Duval seems greatly rejoiced at my late intelligence: a violent cold, she
               says, pre vented her coming to Bristol. The Branghtons, she tells me, are all well;
               Miss Polly is soon to be married to Mr. Brown, but Mr. Smith has changed his
               lodgings, <q rend="inline">"which,"</q> she adds, <q rend="inline"> "has made the
                  house extremely dull. However, that's not the worse news; <hi>pardie,</hi> I wish
                  it was! but I've been used like nobody,—for Monsieur Du Bois has had the baseness
                  to go back to France with out me." </q> In conclusion, she assures me, as you
               prognosticated she would, that I shall be sole heiress of all she is worth, when Lady
               Orville. </p>
            <p> At tea-time, we were joined by all the gentle men but Captain Mirvan, who went to
               the Ho tel where he was to sleep, and made his daughter accompany him, to separate
               her <hi>trumpery,</hi> as he called it, from his cloaths. </p>
            <p> As soon as they were gone, Mr. Lovel, who still appeared extremely sulky, said, <q
                  rend="inline"> "I protest, I never saw such a vulgar, abusive fellow in my life,
                  as that Captain: 'pon honour, I believe he <pb n="278"/> came here for no purpose
                  in the world but to pick a quarrel; however, for my part, I vow I won't humour
                  him." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I declare,"</q> cried Lady Louisa, <q rend="inline"> "he put me in
                  a monstrous fright,—I never heard any body talk so shocking in my life!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I think,"</q> said Mrs. Selwyn, with great so lemnity, <q
                  rend="inline"> "he threatened to box your ears, Mr. Lovel,—did not he?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Really, Ma'am,"</q> said Mr. Lovel, colour ing, <q rend="inline">
                  "if one was to mind every thing those low kind of people say,—one should never be
                  at rest for one impertinence or other,—so I think the best way is to be above
                  taking any notice of them." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"What,"</q> said Mrs. Selwyn, with the same gravity, <q
                  rend="inline">"and so receive the blow in silence!"</q>
            </p>
            <p> During this discourse, I saw the Captain's chaise drive up to the gate, and ran down
               stairs to meet Maria. She was alone, and told me, that her father, who, she was sure,
               had some scheme in agitation against Mr. Lovel, had sent her on before him. We
               continued in the garden till his return, and were joined by Lord Orville, who begged
               me not to insist on a patience so unnatu ral, as submitting to be excluded our
               society. And let me, my dear Sir, with a grateful heart, let me own, I never before
               passed half an hour in such perfect felicity. </p>
            <p> I believe we were all sorry when we saw the Captain return; yet his inward
               satisfaction, from however different a cause, did not seem inferior to what ours had
               been. He chucked Maria un der the chin, rubbed his hands, and was scarce able to
               contain the fullness of his glee. We all attended him to the drawing-room, where, hav
               ing composed his countenance, without any pre vious <pb n="279"/> attention to Mrs.
               Beaumont, he marched up to Mr. Lovel, and abruptly said, <q rend="inline"> "Pray have
                  you ever a brother in these here parts?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Me, Sir?—no, thank Heaven, I'm free from all incumbrances of that
                  sort." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Well,"</q> cried the Captain, <q rend="inline"> "I met a person
                  just now, so like you, I could have sworn he had been your twin-brother." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "It would have been a most singular pleasure to me," </q> said Mr.
               Lovel, <q rend="inline"> "if I also could have seen him; for, really, I have not the
                  least notion what sort of a person I am, and I have a prodigi ous curiosity to
                  know." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Just then, the Captain's servant opening the door, said, <q rend="inline"> "A little
                  gentleman below desires to see one Mr. Lovel." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Beg him to walk up stairs,"</q> said Mrs. Beau mont. <q
                  rend="inline"> "But pray what is the reason William is out of the way?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>The man shut the door without any answer.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I can't imagine who it is,"</q> said Mr. Lovel; <q rend="inline">
                  "I recollect no little Gentleman of my acquaint ance now at Bristol,—except,
                  indeed, the Mar quis of Carlton,—but I don't much fancy it can be him. Let me see,
                  who else is there so very little?"— </q>
            </p>
            <p> A confused noise among the servants now drew all eyes towards the door; the
               impatient Captain hastened to open it, and then, clapping his hands, called out, <q
                  rend="inline"> "'Fore George, 'tis the same per son I took for your relation!"
               </q>
            </p>
            <p> And then, to the utter astonishment of every body but himself, he hauled into the
               room a monkey! full dressed, and extravagantly <hi>à-la-mode!</hi>
            </p>
            <p> The dismay of the company was almost gene ral. Poor Mr. Lovel seemed thunderstruck
               with <pb n="280"/> indignation and surprise; Lady Louisa began a scream, which for
               some time was incessant; Miss Mirvan and I jumped involuntarily upon the seats of our
               chairs; Mrs. Beaumont herself followed our example; Lord Orville placed himself
               before me as a guard; and Mrs. Selwyn, Lord Merton, and Mr. Coverley, burst into a
               loud, immode rate, ungovernable fit of laughter, in which they were joined by the
               Captain, till, unable to sup port himself, he rolled on the floor. </p>
            <p> The first voice which made its way thro' this general noise, was that of Lady
               Louisa, which her fright and screaming rendered extremely shrill. <q rend="inline"
                  >"Take it away!"</q> cried she, <q rend="inline"> "take the mon ster away,—I shall
                  faint, I shall faint if you don't!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> Mr. Lovel, irritated beyond endurance, an grily demanded of the Captain what he
               meant?" </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Mean?"</q> cried the Captain, as soon as he was able to speak, <q
                  rend="inline">"why only to shew you in your proper colours."</q> Then rising, and
               pointing to the monkey, <q rend="inline"> "Why now, Ladies and Gen tlemen, I'll be
                  judged by you!—Did you ever see any thing more like? Odds my life, if it was n't
                  for this here tail, you would n't know one from t'other." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Sir,"</q> cried Mr. Lovel, stamping, <q rend="inline">"I shall take
                  a time to make you feel my wrath."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Come, now,"</q> continued the regardless Cap tain, <q rend="inline"
                  > "just for the fun's sake, doff your coat and waistcoat, and swop with Monsieur

                  which." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Not know myself from a monkey?—I assure you, Sir, I'm not to be
                  used in this manner, and I won't bear it,—curse me if I will!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="281"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Why heyday,"</q> cried the Captain, <q rend="inline"> "what, is
                  Master in a passion?—well, don't be angry,—come, he shan't hurt you;—here, shake a

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Who I?"</q> cried Mr. Lovel, almost mad with vexation, <q
                  rend="inline"> "as I'm a living creature, I would not touch him for a thousand
                  worlds!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Send him a challenge,"</q> cried Mr. Coverley, <q rend="inline"
                  >"and I'll be your second."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Ay, do,"</q> said the Captain, <q rend="inline"> "and I'll be
                  second to my friend Monsieur Clapperclaw here. Come, to it at once!—tooth and
                  nail!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"God forbid!"</q> cried Mr. Lovel, retreating, <q rend="inline">"I
                  would sooner trust my person with a mad bull!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I don't like the looks of him myself,"</q> said Lord Merton, <q
                  rend="inline">"for he grins most horribly."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Oh I'm frightened out of my senses!"</q> cried Lady Louisa, <q

            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Captain,"</q> said Lord Orville, <q rend="inline"> "the ladies are
                  alarmed, and I must beg you would send the monkey away." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "Why, where can be the mighty harm of one monkey more than
                  another?" </q> answered the Cap tain; <q rend="inline"> howsomever, if it's
                  agreeable to the ladies, suppose we turn them out together?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"What do you mean by that, Sir?"</q> cried Mr. Lovel, lifting up his
               cane. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline"> "What do <hi>you</hi> mean?" </q> cried the Captain, fiercely: <q
                  rend="inline">be so good as to down with your cane."</q>
            </p>
            <p> Poor Mr. Lovel, too much intimidated to stand his ground, yet too much enraged to
               submit, turn ed hastily round, and, forgetful of consequences, vented his passion by
               giving a furious blow to the monkey. </p>
            <p> The creature, darting forwards, sprung instant ly upon him, and olinging round his
               neck, fasten ed his teeth to one of his ears. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="282"/> I was really sorry for the poor man, who, though an egregious fop, had
               committed no of fence that merited such chastisement. </p>
            <p> It was impossible, now, to distinguish whose screams were loudest, those of Mr.
               Lovel or the terrified Lady Louisa, who, I believe, thought her own turn was
               approaching: but the unrelent ing Captain roared with joy. </p>
            <p> Not so Lord Orville: ever humane, generous, and benevolent, he quitted his charge,
               whom he saw was wholly out of danger, and seizing the monkey by the collar, made him
               loosen the ear, and then, with a sudden swing, flung him out of the room, and shut
               the door. </p>
            <p> Mr. Lovel was now a dreadful object; his face was besmeared with tears, the blood
               from his ear ran trickling down his cloaths, and he sunk upon the floor, crying out,
                  <q rend="inline"> "Oh I shall die, I shall die!—Oh I'm bit to death!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Captain Mirvan,"</q> said Mrs. Beaumont, with no little
               indignation, <q rend="inline"> "I must own I don't perceive the wit of this action;
                  and I am sorry to have such cruelty practised in my house." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why, Lord, Ma'am,"</q> said the Captain, when his rapture abated
               sufficiently for speech, <q rend="inline"> "how could I tell they'd fall out so?—by
                  Jingo, I brought him to be a messmate for t'other." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Egad,"</q> said Mr. Coverley, <q rend="inline"> "I would not have
                  been served so for a thousand pounds!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why then there's the odds on't,"</q> said the Cap tain, <q
                  rend="inline"> "for you see he is served so for nothing. But come," </q> (turning
               to Mr. Lovel,) <q rend="inline"> "be of good heart, all may end well yet, and you and
                  Monsieur Longtail be as good friends as ever." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I'm surprised, Mrs. Beaumont,"</q> cried Mr. Lovel, starting up, <q
                  rend="inline"> "that you can suffer a per son under your roof to be treated so
                  inhumanly." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"What argufies so many words?"</q> said the <pb n="283"/> unfeeling
               Captain, <q rend="inline"> "it is but a slit of the ear; it only looks as if you had
                  been in the pillory." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Very true,"</q> added Mrs. Selwyn, <q rend="inline"> and who knows
                  but it may acquire you the credit of being an anti-ministerial writer?" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I protest,"</q> cried Mr. Lovel, looking ruefully at his dress, <q
                  rend="inline">"my new riding-suit's all over blood!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Ha, ha, ha!"</q> cried the captain, <q rend="inline"> "see what
                  comes of studying for an hour what you shall put on." </q>
            </p>
            <p> Mr. Lovel then walked to the glass, and look ing at the place, exclaimed, <q
                  rend="inline"> "Oh Heaven, what a monstrous wound! my ear will never be fit to be
                  seen again!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Why then,"</q> said the Captain, <q rend="inline">"you must hide
                  it;—'tis but wearing a wig."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"A wig!"</q> repeated the affrighted Mr. Lovel, <q rend="inline"> "
                     <hi>I</hi> wear a wig?—no, not if you would give me a thousand pounds an hour!"
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I declare,"</q> said Lady Louisa, <q rend="inline"> "I never heard
                  such a shocking proposal in my life!" </q>
            </p>
            <p> "Lord Orville then, seeing no prospect that the altercation would cease, proposed to
               the Cap tain to walk. He assented; and having given Mr. Lovel a nod of exultation,
               accompanied his Lordship down stairs. </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"'Pon honour,"</q> said Mr. Lovel, the moment the door was shut, <q
                  rend="inline"> "that fellow is the greatest brute in nature! he ought not to be
                  admitted into a civilized society." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Lovel,"</q> said Mr. Coverley, affecting to whisper, <q
                  rend="inline"> "you must certainly pink him: you must not put up with such an
                  affront." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Sir,"</q> said Mr. Lovel, <q rend="inline"> "with any common
                  person, I should not deliberate an instant; but, re ally, with a fellow who has
                  done nothing but fight all his life, 'pon honour, Sir, I can't think of it!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Lovel,"</q> said Lord Merton, in the same voice, <q rend="inline">
                  "you <hi>must</hi> call him to account." </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="284"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Every man,"</q> said he, pettishly, <q rend="inline"> "is the best
                  judge of his own affairs, and I don't ask the ho nour of any person's advice."
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Egad, Lovel,"</q> said Mr. Coverley, <q rend="inline">"you're in
                  for it!—you can't possibly be off!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Sir,"</q> cried he, very impatiently, <q rend="inline"> "upon any
                  proper occasion, I should be as ready to shew my courage as any body;—but as to
                  fighting for such a trifle as this,—I protest I should blush to think of it!" </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"A trifle!"</q> cried Mrs. Selwyn; <q rend="inline"> "good Hea ven!
                  and have you made this astonishing riot about a <hi>trifle?</hi> " </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Ma'am,"</q> answered the poor wretch, in great confusion, <q
                  rend="inline"> "I did not know at first but that my cheek might have been bit:—but
                  as 'tis no worse, why it does not a great deal signify. Mrs. Beau mont, I have the
                  honour to wish you a good even ing; I'm sure my carriage must be waiting." </q>
               And then, very abruptly, he left the room. </p>
            <p> What a commotion has this mischief-loving Captain raised! Were I to remain here
               long, even the society of my dear Maria could scarce com pensate for the disturbances
               he excites. </p>
            <p> When he returned, and heard of his quiet exit, his triumph was intolerable. <q
                  rend="inline">"I think, I think,"</q> cried he, <q rend="inline"> "I have peppered
                  him well! I'll war rant he won't give an hour to-morrow morning to settling what
                  he shall put on; why his coat," </q> turn ing to me, <q rend="inline"> "would be a
                  most excellent match for old Madame Furbelow's best Lyons' silk. 'Fore George, I'd
                  desire no better sport, than to have that there old cat here, to go her snacks!"
               </q>
            </p>
            <p> All the company then, Lord Orville, Miss Mir van, and myself excepted, played at
               cards, and <hi>we</hi> —oh how much better did we pass our time!" </p>
            <p> While we were engaged in a most delightful conversation, a servant brought me a
               letter, which <pb n="285"/> he told me had, by some accident, been mislaid. Judge my
               feelings, when I saw, my dearest Sir, your revered hand-writing! My emotions soon
               betrayed to Lord Orville whom the letter was from: the importance of the contents he
               well knew, and assuring me I should not be seen by the card-players, he besought me
               to open it with out delay. </p>
            <p> Open it, indeed, I did;—but read it I could not,—the willing, yet aweful consent you
               have granted,—the tenderness of your expressions,—the certainty that no obstacle
               remained to my eter nal union with the loved owner of my heart, gave me sensations
               too various, and though joyful, too little placid for observation. Finding myself un
               able to proceed, and blinded by the tears of gra titude and delight which started
               into my eyes, I gave over the attempt of reading, till I retired to my own room: and,
               having no voice to an swer the enquiries of Lord Orville, I put the let ter into his
               hands, and left it to speak both for me and itself. </p>
            <p> Lord Orville was himself affected by your kindness; he kissed the letter as he
               returned it, and, pressing my hand affectionately to his heart, <q rend="inline">"You
                  are now,"</q> (said he, in a low voice) <q rend="inline"> "all my own! Oh my
                  Evelina, how will my soul find room for its happiness?—it seems already burst
                  ing!" </q> I could make no reply; indeed I hardly spoke another word the rest of
               the evening; so lit tle talkative is the fullness of contentment. </p>
            <p> O my dearest Sir, the thankfulness of my heart I must pour-forth at our meeting,
               when, at your feet, my happiness receives its confir mation from your blessing, and
               when my noble minded, my beloved Lord Orville, presents to you the highly-honoured
               and thrice-happy Evelina. </p>
            <p> A few lines I will endeavour to write on Thurs day, <pb n="286"/> which shall be
               sent off express, to give you, should nothing intervene, yet more certain assu rance
               of our meeting. </p>
            <p> Now then, therefore, for the first—and probab ly the last time I shall ever own the
               name, permit me to sign myself, </p>

            <p> Yes, my child, thy happiness is engraved, in golden characters, upon the tablets of

               humble, but ardent prayer which yet animates my devotions: that the height of bliss
               to which thou art rising may not render thee giddy, but that the purity of thy mind
               may form the brightest splendor of thy pros perity!—and that the weak and aged frame
               of thy almost idolizing parent, nearly worn out by time, past afflictions, and
               infirmities, may yet be able to sustain a meeting with all its better part holds

               words in blessings on my child!—closing these joy-streaming eyes in her pre sence,
               and breathing my last faint sighs in her loved arms! </p>
            <p> Grieve not, oh child of my care, grieve not at the inevitable moment; but may thy
               own end be equally propitious! Oh may'st thou when full of days, and full of honour,
               sink down as gently to rest,—be loved as kindly, watched as tenderly as thy happy
               father! And may'st thou, when thy glass is run, be sweetly but not bitterly mourned,
