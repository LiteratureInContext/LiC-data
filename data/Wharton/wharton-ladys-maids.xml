                            typhoid</ref>. I'd been three months in hospital, and when I came out I
                        looked so weak and tottery that the two or three ladies I applied to were
                        afraid to engage me. Most of my money was gone, and after I'd boarded for
                        two months, hanging about the employment-agencies, and answering any
                        advertisement that looked any way respectable, I pretty nearly lost heart,
                        for fretting hadn't made me fatter, and I didn't see why my luck should ever
                        turn. It did though—or I thought so at the time. A Mrs. Railton, a friend of
                        the lady that first brought me out to the <placeName>States</placeName>, met
                        me one day and stopped to speak to me: she was one that had always a
                        friendly way with her. She asked me what ailed me to look so white, and when
                        I told her, "Why, Hartley," says she, "I believe I've got the very place for
                        you. Come in tomorrow and we'll talk about it." </p>
                    <p>The next day, when I called, she told me the lady she'd in mind was a niece
                        of hers, a Mrs. Brympton, a youngish lady, but something of an invalid, who
                        lived all the year round at her <ref target="a0004" corresp="n0004">
                            country-place</ref> on the <placeName>Hudson</placeName>, owing to not
                        being able to stand the fatigue of town life.</p>
                    <p> "Now, Hartley," Mrs. Railton said, in that cheery way that always made me
                        feel things must be going to take a turn for the better—"now understand me;
                        it's not a cheerful place I'm sending you to. The house is big and gloomy;
                        my niece is nervous, <ref target="a0005" corresp="n0005"> vaporish</ref>;
                        her husband—well, he's generally away; and the two children are dead. A year
                        ago, I would as soon have thought of shutting a rosy active girl like you
                        into a vault; but you're not particularly brisk yourself just now, are you?
                        and a quiet place, with country air and wholesome food and early hours,
                        ought to be the very thing for you. Don't mistake me," she added, for I
                        suppose I looked a trifle downcast; "you may find it dull, but you won't be
                        unhappy. My niece is an angel. Her former maid, who died last spring, had
                        been with her twenty years and worshipped the ground she walked on. She's a
                        kind mistress to all, and where the mistress is kind, as you know, the
                        servants are generally good-humored, so you'll probably get on well enough
                        with the rest of the household. And you're the very woman I want for my
                        niece: quiet, well-mannered, and educated above your station. You read aloud
                        well, I think? That's a good thing; my niece likes to be read to. She wants
                        a maid that can be something of a companion: her last was, and I can't say
                        how she misses her. It's a lonely life . . . Well, have you decided?"</p>
                    <p>"Why, ma'am," I said, "I'm not afraid of solitude."</p>
                    <p>"Well, then, go; my niece will take you on my recommendation. I'll telegraph
                        her at once and you can take the afternoon train. She has no one to wait on
                        her at present, and I don't want you to lose any time."</p>
                    <p>I was ready enough to start, yet something in me hung back; and to gain time
                        I asked, "And the gentleman, ma'am?"</p>
                    <p>"The gentleman's almost always away, I tell you," said Mrs. Ralston,
                        quick-like—"and when he's there," says she suddenly, "you've only to keep
                        out of his way."</p>
                    <p>I took the afternoon train and got out at D—— station at about four o'clock.
                        A <ref target="a0006" corresp="n0006"> groom in a dog-cart</ref> was
                        waiting, and we drove off at a smart pace. It was a dull October day, with
                        rain hanging close overhead, and by the time we turned into the
                            <placeName>Brympton Place</placeName> woods the daylight was almost
                        gone. The drive wound through the woods for a mile or two, and came out on a
                        gravel court shut in with thickets of tall black-looking shrubs. There were
                        no lights in the windows, and the house <hi rend="italic">did</hi> look a
                        bit gloomy.</p>
                    <p>I had asked no questions of the groom, for I never was one to get my notion
                        of new masters from their other servants: I prefer to wait and see for
                        myself. But I<pb n="550" facs="pageImages/Bell_550.jpg"/>could tell by the
                        look of everything that I had got into the right kind of house, and that
                        things were done handsomely. A pleasant-faced cook met me at the back door
                        and called the house-maid to show me up to my room. "You'll see madam
                        later," she said. "Mrs. Brympton has a visitor."</p>
                    <p>I hadn't fancied Mrs. Brympton was a lady to have many visitors, and somehow
                        the words cheered me. I followed the house-maid upstairs, and saw, through a
                        door on the upper landing, that the main part of the house seemed
                        well-furnished, with dark panelling and a number of old portraits. Another
                        flight of stairs led us up to the servants' wing. It was almost dark now,
                        and the house-maid excused herself for not having brought a light. "But
                        there's matches in your room," she said, "and if you go careful you'll be
                        all right. Mind the step at the end of the passage. Your room is just
                        beyond."</p>
                    <p>I looked ahead as she spoke, and half-way down the passage, I saw a woman
                        standing. She drew back into a doorway as we passed, and the house-maid
                        didn't appear to notice her. She was a thin woman with a white face, and a
                        darkish stuff gown and apron. I took her for the housekeeper and thought it
                        odd that she didn't speak, but just gave me a long look as she went by. My
                        room opened into a square hall at the end of the passage. Facing my door was
                        another which stood open: the house-maid exclaimed when she saw it.</p>
                    <p>"There—Mrs. Blinder's left that door open again!" said she, closing it.</p>
                    <p>"Is Mrs. Blinder the housekeeper?"</p>
                    <p>"There's no housekeeper: Mrs. Blinder's the cook."</p>
                    <p>"And is that her room?"</p>
                    <p>"Laws, no," said the house-maid, cross-like. "That's nobody's room. It's
                        empty, I mean, and the door hadn't ought to be open. Mrs. Brympton wants it
                        kept locked."</p>
                    <p>She opened my door and led me into a neat room, nicely furnished, with a
                        picture or two on the walls; and having lit a candle she took leave, telling
                        me that the servants'-hall tea was at six, and that Mrs. Brympton would see
                        me afterward.</p>
                    <p>I found them a pleasant-spoken set in the servants' hall, and by what they
                        let fall I gathered that, as Mrs. Railton had said, Mrs. Brympton was the
                        kindest of ladies; but I didn't take much notice of their talk, for I was
                        watching to see the pale woman in the dark gown come in. She didn't show
                        herself, however, and I wondered if she ate apart; but if she wasn't the
                        housekeeper, why should she? Suddenly it struck me that she might be a
                        trained nurse, and in that case her meals would of course be served in her
                        room. If Mrs. Brympton was an invalid it was likely enough she had a nurse.
                        The idea annoyed me, I own, for they're not always the easiest to get on
                        with, and if I'd known, I shouldn't have taken the place. But there I was,
                        and there was no use pulling a long face over it; and not being one to ask
                        questions, I waited to see what would turn up.</p>
                    <p>When tea was over, the house-maid said to the <ref target="a0007"
                            corresp="n0007"> footman</ref>: "Has Mr. Ranford gone?" and when he said
                        yes, she told me to come up with her to Mrs. Brympton.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Brympton was lying down in her bedroom. Her lounge stood near the fire
                        and beside it was a shaded lamp. She was a delicate-looking lady, but when
                        she smiled I felt there was nothing I wouldn't do for her. She spoke very
                        pleasantly, in a low voice, asking me my name and age and so on, and if I
                        had everything I wanted, and if I wasn't afraid of feeling lonely in the
                        country.</p>
                    <p>"Not with you I wouldn't be, madam," I said, and the words surprised me when
                        I'd spoken them, for I'm not an impulsive person; but it was just as if I'd
                        thought aloud.</p>
                    <p>She seemed pleased at that, and said she hoped I'd continue in the same mind;
                        then she gave me a few directions about her toilet, and said Agnes the
                        house-maid would show me next morning where things were kept.</p>
                    <p>"I am tired to-night, and shall dine upstairs," she said. "Agnes will bring
                        me my tray, that you may have time to unpack and settle yourself; and later
                        you may come and undress me."</p>
                    <p>"Very well, ma'am," I said. "You'll ring, I suppose?"</p>
                    <p>I thought she looked odd.</p>
                    <p>"No—Agnes will fetch you," says she quickly, and took up her book again.</p>
                    <p>Well—that was certainly strange: a <pb n="551" facs="pageImages/Bell_551.jpg"
                        />lady's maid having to be fetched by the house-maid whenever her lady
                        wanted her! I wondered if there were no <ref target="a0008" corresp="n0008">
                            bells</ref>in the house; but the next day I satisfied myself that there
                        was one in every room, and a special one ringing from my mistress's room to
                        mine; and after that it did strike me as queer that, whenever Mrs. Brympton
                        wanted anything, she rang for Agnes, who had to walk the whole length of the
                        servants' wing to call me.</p>
                    <p>But that wasn't the only queer thing in the house. The very next day I found
                        out that Mrs. Brympton had no nurse; and then I asked Agnes about the woman
                        I had seen in the passage the afternoon before. Agnes said she had seen no
                        one, and I saw that she thought I was dreaming. To be sure, it was dusk when
                        we went down the passage, and she had excused herself for not bringing a
                        light; but I had seen the woman plain enough to know her again if we should
                        meet. I decided that she must have been a friend of the cook's, or of one of
                        the other women-servants: perhaps she had come down from town for a night's
                        visit, and the servants wanted it kept secret. Some ladies are very stiff
                        about having their servants' friends in the house overnight. At any rate, I
                        made up my mind to ask no more questions.</p>
                    <p>In a day or two, another odd thing happened. I was chatting one afternoon
                        with Mrs. Blinder, who was a friendly disposed woman, and had been longer in
                        the house than the other servants, and she asked me if I was quite
                        comfortable and had everything I needed. I said I had no fault to find with
                        my place or with my mistress, but I thought it odd that in so large a house
                        there was no sewing-room for the lady's maid.</p>
                    <p>"Why," says she, "there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> one; the room you're in is
                        the old sewing-room."</p>
                    <p>"Oh," said I; "and where did the other lady's maid sleep?"</p>
                    <p>At that she grew confused, and said hurriedly that the servants' rooms had
                        all been changed about last year, and she didn't rightly remember.</p>
                    <p>That struck me as peculiar, but I went on as if I hadn't noticed: "Well,
                        there's a vacant room opposite mine, and I mean to ask Mrs. Brympton if I
                        mayn't use that as a sewing-room."</p>
                    <p>To my astonishment, Mrs. Blinder went white, and gave my hand a kind of
                        squeeze. "Don't do that, my dear," said she, trembling-like. "To tell you
                        the truth, that was Emma Saxon's room, and my mistress has kept it closed
                        ever since her death."</p>
                    <p>"And who was Emma Saxon?"</p>
                    <p>"Mrs. Brympton's former maid."</p>
                    <p>"The one that was with her so many years?" said I, remembering what Mrs.
                        Railton had told me.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Blinder nodded.</p>
                    <p>"What sort of woman was she?"</p>
                    <p>"No better walked the earth," said Mrs. Blinder. "My mistress loved her like
                        a sister."</p>
                    <p>"But I mean—what did she look like?"</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Blinder got up and gave me a kind of angry stare. "I'm no great hand at
                        describing," she said; "and I believe my pastry's rising." And she walked
                        off into the kitchen and shut the door after her.</p>
                </div>

                <div type="part">
                    <head>II</head>
                    <p>I HAD been near a week at <placeName>Brympton</placeName> before I saw my
                        master. Word came that he was arriving one afternoon, and a change passed
                        over the whole household. It was plain that nobody loved him below stairs.
                        Mrs. Blinder took uncommon care with the dinner that night, but she snapped
                        at the kitchen-maid in a way quite unusual with her; and Mr. Wace, the
                        butler, a serious, slow-spoken man, went about his duties as if he'd been
                        getting ready for a funeral. He was a great Bible-reader, Mr. Wace was, and
                        had a beautiful assortment of texts at his command; but that day he used
                        such dreadful language that I was about to leave the table, when he assured
                        me it was all out of Isaiah; and I noticed that whenever the master came Mr.
                        Wace took to the prophets.</p>
                    <p>About seven, Agnes called me to my mistress's room; and there I found Mr.
                        Brympton. He was standing on the hearth; a big fair bull-necked man, with a
                        red face and little bad-tempered blue eyes: the kind of man a young
                        simpleton might have thought handsome, and would have been like to pay dear
                        for thinking it.</p>
                    <p>He swung about when I came in, and looked me over in a trice. I knew what the
                        look meant, from having experienced <pb n="552"
                            facs="pageImages/Bell_552.jpg"/>it once or twice in my former places.
                        Then he turned his back on me, and went on talking to his wife; and I knew
                        what <hi rend="italic">that</hi> meant, too. I was not the kind of morsel he
                        was after. The typhoid had served me well enough in one way: it kept that
                        kind of gentleman at arm's-length.</p>
                    <p>"This is my new maid, Hartley," says Mrs. Brympton in her kind voice; and he
                        nodded and went on with what he was saying.</p>
                    <p>In a minute or two he went off, and left my mistress to dress for dinner, and
                        I noticed as I waited on her that she was white, and chill to the touch.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brympton took himself off the next morning, and the whole house drew a
                        long breath when he drove away. As for my mistress, she put on her hat and
                        furs (for it was a fine winter morning) and went out for a walk in the
                        gardens, coming back quite fresh and rosy, so that for a minute, before her
                        color faded, I could guess what a pretty young lady she must have been, and
                        not so long ago, either.</p>
                    <p>She had met Mr. Ranford in the grounds, and the two came back together, I
                        remember, smiling and talking as they walked along the terrace under my
                        window. That was the first time I saw Mr. Ranford, though I had often heard
                        his name mentioned in the hall. He was a neighbor, it appeared, living a
                        mile or two beyond <placeName>Brympton</placeName>, at the end of the
                        village; and as he was in the habit of spending his winters in the country
                        he was almost the only company my mistress had at that season. He was a
                        slight tall gentleman of about thirty, and I thought him rather
                        melancholy-looking till I saw his smile, which had a kind of surprise in it,
                        like the first warm day in spring. He was a great reader, I heard, like my
                        mistress, and the two were forever borrowing books of one another, and
                        sometimes (Mr. Wace told me) he would read aloud to Mrs. Brympton by the
                        hour, in the big dark library where she sat in the winter afternoons. The
                        servants all liked him, and perhaps that's more of a compliment than the
                        masters suspect. He had a friendly word for every one of us, and we were all
                        glad to think that Mrs. Brympton had a pleasant companionable gentleman like
                        that to keep her company when the master was away. Mr. Ranford seemed on
                        excellent terms with Mr. Brympton too; though I couldn't but wonder that two
                        gentlemen so unlike each other should be so friendly. But then I knew how
                        the real quality can keep their feelings to themselves.</p>
                    <p>As for Mr. Brympton, he came and went, never staying more than a day or two,
                        cursing the dulness and the solitude, grumbling at everything, and (as I
                        soon found out) drinking a deal more than was good for him. After Mrs.
                        Brympton left the table he would sit half the night over the old
                            <placeName>Brympton</placeName> port and madeira, and once, as I was
                        leaving my mistress's room rather later than usual, I met him coming up the
                        stairs in such a state that I turned sick to think of what some ladies have
                        to endure and hold their tongues about.</p>
                    <p>The servants said very little about their master; but from what they let drop
                        I could see it had been an unhappy match from the beginning. Mr. Brympton
                        was coarse, loud and pleasure-loving; my mistress quiet, retiring, and
                        perhaps a trifle cold. Not that she was not always pleasant-spoken to him: I
                        thought her wonderfully forbearing; but to a gentleman as free as Mr.
                        Brympton I daresay she seemed a little offish.</p>
                    <p>Well, things went on quietly for several weeks. My mistress was kind, my
                        duties were light, and I got on well with the other servants. In short, I
                        had nothing to complain of; yet there was always a weight on me. I can't say
                        why it was so, but I know it was not the loneliness that I felt. I soon got
                        used to that; and being still languid from the fever, I was thankful for the
                        quiet and the good country air. Nevertheless, I was never quite easy in my
                        mind. My mistress, knowing I had been ill, insisted that I should take my
                        walk regular, and often invented errands for me:—a yard of ribbon to be
                        fetched from the village, a letter posted, or a book returned to Mr.
                        Ranford. As soon as I was out of doors my spirits rose, and I looked forward
                        to my walks through the bare moist-smelling woods; but the moment I caught
                        sight of the house again my heart dropped down like a stone in a well. It
                        was not a gloomy house exactly, yet I never entered it but a feeling of
                        gloom came over me.</p>
                    <pb n="553" facs="pageImages/Bell_553.jpg"/>
                    <p>Mrs. Brympton seldom went out in winter; only on the finest days did she walk
                        an hour at noon on the south terrace. Excepting Mr. Ranford, we had no
                        visitors but the doctor, who drove over from D—— about once a week. He sent
                        for me once or twice to give me some trifling direction about my mistress,
                        and though he never told me what her illness was, I thought, from a waxy
                        look she had now and then of a morning, that it might be the heart that
                        ailed her. The season was soft and unwholesome, and in January we had a long
                        spell of rain. That was a sore trial to me, I own, for I couldn't go out,
                        and sitting over my sewing all day, listening to the drip, drip of the
                        eaves, I grew so nervous that the least sound made me jump. Somehow, the
                        thought of that locked room across the passage began to weigh on me. Once or
                        twice, in the long rainy nights, I fancied I heard noises there; but that
                        was nonsense, of course, and the daylight drove such notions out of my head.
                        Well, one morning Mrs. Brympton gave me quite a start of pleasure by telling
                        me she wished me to go to town for some shopping. I hadn't known till then
                        how low my spirits had fallen. I set off in high glee, and my first sight of
                        the crowded streets and the cheerful-looking shops quite took me out of
                        myself. Toward afternoon, however, the noise and confusion began to tire me,
                        and I was actually looking forward to the quiet of
                            <placeName>Brympton</placeName>, and thinking how I should enjoy the
                        drive home through the dark woods, when I ran across an old acquaintance, a
                        maid I had once been in service with. We had lost sight of each other for a
                        number of years, and I had to stop and tell her what had happened to me in
                        the interval. When I mentioned where I was living she rolled up her eyes and
                        pulled a long face.</p>
                    <p>"What! The Mrs. Brympton that lives all the year at her place on the
                            <placeName>Hudson</placeName>? My dear, you won't stay there three
                        months."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, but I don't mind the country," says I, offended somehow at her tone.
                        "Since the fever I'm glad to be quiet."</p>
                    <p>She shook her head. "It's not the country I'm thinking of. All I know is
                        she's had four maids in the last six months, and the last one, who was a
                        friend of mine, told me nobody could stay in the house."</p>
                    <p>"Did she say why?" I asked.</p>
                    <p>"No—she wouldn't give me her reason. But she says to me, <hi rend="italic"
                            >Mrs. Ansley</hi>, she says,<hi rend="italic">if ever a young woman as
                            you know of thinks of going there, you tell her it’s not worth while to
                            unpack her boxes.</hi>."</p>
                    <p>"Is she young and handsome?" said I, thinking of Mr. Brympton.</p>
                    <p>"Not her! She's the kind that mothers engage when they've gay young gentlemen
                        at college."</p>
                    <p>Well, though I knew the woman was an idle gossip, the words stuck in my head,
                        and my heart sank lower than ever as I drove up to
                            <placeName>Brympton</placeName> in the dusk. There <hi rend="italic"
                            >was</hi> something about the house—I was sure of it now...</p>
                    <p>When I went in to tea I heard that Mr. Brympton had arrived, and I saw at a
                        glance that there had been a disturbance of some kind. Mrs. Blinder's hand
                        shook so that she could hardly pour the tea, and Mr. Wace quoted the most
                        dreadful texts full of brimstone. Nobody said a word to me then, but when I
                        went up to my room Mrs. Blinder followed me.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, my dear," says she, taking my hand, "I'm so glad and thankful you've
                        come back to us!"</p>
                    <p>That struck me, as you may imagine. "Why," said I, "did you think I was
                        leaving for good?"</p>
                    <p>"No, no, to be sure," said she, a little confused, "but I can't a-bear to
                        have madam left alone for a day even." She pressed my hand hard, and, "Oh,
                        Miss Hartley," says she, "be good to your mistress, as you're a Christian
                        woman." And with that she hurried away, and left me staring.</p>
                    <p>A moment later Agnes called me to Mrs. Brympton. Hearing Mr. Brympton's voice
                        in her room, I went round by the dressing-room, thinking I would lay out her
                        dinner-gown before going in. The dressing-room is a large room with a window
                        over the portico that looks toward the gardens. Mr. Brympton's apartments
                        are beyond. When I went in, the door into the bedroom was ajar, and I heard
                        Mr. Brympton saying angrily:—"One would suppose he was the only person fit
                        for you to talk to."</p>
                    <p>"I don't have many visitors in winter," Mrs. Brympton answered quietly.</p>
                    <pb n="554" facs="pageImages/Bell_554.jpg"/>
                    <p>"You have <hi rend="italic">me</hi>!" he flung at her, sneering.</p>
                    <p>"You are here so seldom," said she.</p>
                    <p>"Well—whose fault is that? You make the place about as lively as a family
                        vault—"</p>
                    <p>With that I rattled the toilet-things, to give my mistress warning and she
                        rose and called me in.</p>
                    <p>The two dined alone, as usual, and I knew by Mr. Wace's manner at supper that
                        things must be going badly. He quoted the prophets something terrible, and
                        worked on the kitchen-maid so that she declared she wouldn't go down alone
                        to put the cold meat in the ice-box. I felt nervous myself, and after I had
                        put my mistress to bed I was half-tempted to go down again and persuade Mrs.
                        Blinder to sit up awhile over a game of cards. But I heard her door closing
                        for the night, and so I went on to my own room. The rain had begun again,
                        and the drip, drip, drip seemed to be dropping into my brain. I lay awake
                        listening to it, and turning over what my friend in town had said. What
                        puzzled me was that it was always the maids who left. . .</p>
                    <p>After a while I slept; but suddenly a loud noise wakened me. My bell had
                        rung. I sat up, terrified by the unusual sound, which seemed to go on
                        jangling through the darkness. My hands shook so that I couldn't find the
                        matches. At length I struck a light and jumped out of bed. I began to think
                        I must have been dreaming; but I looked at the bell against the wall, and
                        there was the little hammer still quivering.</p>
                    <p>I was just beginning to<ref target="a0009" corresp="n0009"> huddle</ref> on
                        my clothes when I heard another sound. This time it was the door of the
                        locked room opposite mine softly opening and closing. I heard the sound
                        distinctly, and it frightened me so that I stood stock still. Then I heard a
                        footstep hurrying down the passage toward the main house. The floor being
                        carpeted, the sound was very faint, but I was quite sure it was a woman's
                        step. I turned cold with the thought of it, and for a minute or two I
                        dursn't breathe or move. Then I came to my senses.</p>
                    <p>"Alice Hartley," says I to myself, "someone left that room just now and ran
                        down the passage ahead of you. The idea isn't pleasant, but you may as well
                        face it. Your mistress has rung for you, and to answer her bell you've got
                        to go the way that other woman has gone."</p>
                    <p>Well—I did it. I never walked faster in my life, yet I thought I should never
                        get to the end of the passage or reachMrs. Brympton's room. On the way I
                        heard nothing and saw nothing: all was dark and quiet as the grave. When I
                        reached my mistress's door the silence was so deep that I began to think I
                        must be dreaming, and was half-minded to turn back. Then a panic seized me,
                        and I knocked.</p>
                    <p>There was no answer, and I knocked again, loudly. To my astonishment the door
                        was opened by Mr. Brympton. He started back when he saw me, and in the light
                        of my candle his face looked red and savage.</p>
                    <p>"<hi rend="italic">You</hi>!" he said, in a queer voice. "<hi rend="italic"
                            >How many of you are there, in God's name</hi>?"</p>
                    <p>At that I felt the ground give under me; but I said to myself that he had
                        been drinking, and answered as steadily as I could; "May I go in, sir? Mrs.
                        Brympton has rung for me."</p>
                    <p>"You may all go in, for what I care," says he, and, pushing by me, walked
                        down the hall to his own bedroom. I looked after him as he went, and to my
                        surprise I saw that he walked as straight as a sober man.</p>
                    <p>I found my mistress lying very weak and still, but she forced a smile when
                        she saw me, and signed to me to pour out some drops for her. After that she
                        lay without speaking, her breath coming quick, and her eyes closed. Suddenly
                        she groped out with her hand, and <hi rend="italic">"Emma</hi>," says she,
                        faintly.</p>
                    <p>"It's Hartley, madam," I said. "Do you want anything?"</p>
                    <p>She opened her eyes wide and gave me a startled look.</p>
                    <p>"I was dreaming," she said. "You may go, now, Hartley, and thank you kindly.
                        I'm quite well again, you see." And she turned her face away from me.</p>

                <div type="part">
                    <head>III</head>
                    <p>There was no more sleep for me that night, and I was thankful when daylight
                        came.</p>
                    <pb n="555" facs="pageImages/Bell_555.jpg"/>
                    <p>Soon afterward, Agnes called me to Mrs. Brympton. I was afraid she was ill
                        again, for she seldom sent for me before nine, but I found her sitting up in
                        bed, pale and drawn-looking, but quite herself.</p>
                    <p>"Hartley," says she quickly, "will you put on your things at once and go down
                        to the village for me ? I want this prescription made up—" here she
                        hesitated a minute and blushed—"and I should like you to be back again
                        before Mr. Brympton is up."</p>
                    <p>"Certainly, madam," I said.</p>
                    <p>"And—stay a moment—" she called me back as if an idea had just struck
                        her—"while you're waiting for the mixture, you'll have time to go on to Mr.
                        Ranford's with this note."</p>
                    <p>It was a two-mile walk to the village, and on my way I had time to turn
                        things over in my mind. It struck me as peculiar that my mistress should
                        wish the prescription made up without Mr. Brympton's knowledge ; and,
                        putting this together with the scene of the night before, and with much else
                        that I had noticed and suspected, I began to wonder if the poor lady was
                        weary of her life, and had come to the mad resolve of ending it. The idea
                        took such hold on me that I reached the village on a run, and dropped
                        breathless into a chair before the chemist's counter. The good man, who was
                        just taking down his shutters, stared at me so hard that it brought me to
                        myself.</p>
                    <p>"Mr. Limmel," I says, trying to speak indifferent, "will you run your eye
                        over this, and tell me if it's quite right ?"</p>
                    <p>He put on his spectacles and studied the prescription.</p>
                    <p>"Why, it's one of Dr. Walton's," says he. "What should be wrong with it
                        ?"</p>
                    <p>"Well—is it dangerous to take ?"</p>
                    <p>"Dangerous—how do you mean ?"</p>
                    <p>I could have shaken the man for his stupidity.</p>
                    <p>"I mean—if a person was to take too much of it—by mistake of course—" says I,
                        my heart in my throat.</p>
                    <p>"Lord bless you, no. It's only lime-water. You might feed it to a baby by the
                        bottleful."</p>
                    <p>I gave a great sigh of relief, and hurried on to Mr. Ranford's. But on the
                        way another thought struck me. If there was nothing to conceal about my
                        visit to the chemist's, was it my other errand that Mrs. Brympton wished me
                        to keep private? Somehow, that thought frightened me worse than the other.
                        Yet the two gentlemen seemed fast friends, and I would have staked my head
                        on my mistress's goodness. I felt ashamed of my suspicions, and concluded
                        that I was still disturbed by the strange events of the night. I left the
                        note at Mr. Ranford's—and, hurrying back to Brympton, slipped in by a side
                        door without being seen, as I thought.</p>
                    <p>An hour later, however, as I was carrying in my mistress's breakfast, I was
                        stopped in the hall byMr. Brympton.</p>
                    <p>"What were you doing out so early ?" he says, looking hard at me.</p>
                    <p>"Early—me, sir ?" I said, in a tremble.</p>
                    <p>"Come, come," he says, an angry red spot coming out on his forehead, "didn't
                        I see you scuttling home through the shrubbery an hour or more ago ?"</p>
                    <p>I'm a truthful woman by nature, but at that a lie popped out ready-made. "No,
                        sir, you didn't," said I, and looked straight back at him.</p>
                    <p>He shrugged his shoulders and gave a sullen laugh. "I suppose you think I was
                        drunk last night ?" he asked suddenly.</p>
                    <p>"No, sir, I don't," I answered, this time truthfully enough.</p>
                    <p>He turned away with another shrug. "A pretty notion my servants have of me!"
                        I heard him mutter as he walked off.</p>
                    <p>Not till I had settled down to my afternoon's sewing did I realize how the
                        events of the night had shaken me. I couldn't pass that locked door without
                        a shiver. I knew I had heard someone come out of it, and walk down the
                        passage ahead of me. I thought of speaking to Mrs. Blinder or to Mr. Wace,
                        the only two in the house who appeared to have an inkling of what was going
                        on, but I had a feeling that if I questioned them they would deny
                        everything, and that I might learn more by holding my tongue and keeping my
                        eyes open. The idea of spending another night opposite the locked room
                        sickened me, and once I was seized with the notion of packing my trunk and
                        taking the first train to town ; but it wasn't in me to throw over a kind
                        mistress in that manner, and I tried to go on with my sewing as if nothing
                        had happened.</p>
                    <pb n="556" facs="pageImages/Bell_556.jpg"/>
                    <p>I hadn't worked ten minutes before the sewing-machine broke down. It was one
                        I had found in the house, a good machine, but a trifle out of order: Mrs.
                        Blinder said it had never been used since Emma Saxon's death. I stopped to
                        see what was wrong, and as I was working at the machine a drawer which I had
                        never been able to open slid forward and a photograph fell out. I picked it
                        up and sat looking at it in a maze. It was a woman's likeness, and I knew I
                        had seen the face somewhere—the eyes had an asking look that I had felt on
                        me before. And suddenly I remembered the pale woman in the passage.</p>
                    <p>I stood up, cold all over, and ran out of the room. My heart seemed to be
                        thumping in the top of my head, and I felt as if I should never get away
                        from the look in those eyes. I went straight to Mrs. Blinder. She was taking
                        her afternoon nap, and sat up with a jump when I came in.</p>
                    <p>"Mrs. Blinder," said I, "who is that ?" And I held out the photograph.</p>
                    <p>She rubbed her eyes and stared.</p>
                    <p>"Why, Emma Saxon," says she. "Where did you find it?"</p>
                    <p>I looked hard at her for a minute. "Mrs. Blinder," I said, "I've seen that
                        face before."</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Blinder got up and walked over to the looking-glass. "Dear me ! I must
                        have been asleep," she says. "My front is all over one ear. And now do run
                        along, Miss Hartley, dear, for I hear the clock striking four, and I must go
                        down this very minute and put on the Virginia ham for Mr. Brympton's
                        dinner."</p>

                <div type="part">
                    <head>IV</head>
                    <p>To all appearances, things went on as usual for a week or two. The only
                        difference was that Mr. Brympton stayed on, instead of going off as he
                        usually did, and that Mr. Ranford never showed himself. I heard Mr. Brympton
                        remark on this one afternoon when he was sitting in my mistress's room
                        before dinner.</p>
                    <p>"Where's Ranford?" says he. "He hasn't been near the house for a week. Does
                        he keep away because I'm here ?"</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Brympton spoke so low that I couldn't catch her answer.</p>
                    <p>"Well," he went on, "two's company and three's trumpery; I'm sorry to be in
                        Ranford's way, and I suppose I shall have to take myself off again in a day
                        or two and give him a show." And he laughed at his own joke.</p>
                    <p>The very next day, as it happened, Mr. Ranford called. The footman said the
                        three were very merry over their tea in the library, and Mr. Brympton
                        strolled down to the gate with Mr. Ranford when he left.</p>
                    <p>I have said that things went on as usual; and so they did with the rest of
                        the household; but as for myself, I had never been the same since the night
                        my bell had rung. Night after night I used to lie awake, listening for it to
                        ring again, and for the door of the locked room to open stealthily. But the
                        bell never rang, and I heard no sound across the passage. At last the
                        silence began to be more dreadful to me than the most mysterious sounds. I
                        felt that <hi rend="italic">someone</hi> were cowering there, behind the
                        locked door, watching and listening as I watched and listened, and I could
                        almost have cried out, "Whoever you are, come out and let me see you face to
                        face, but don't lurk there and spy on me in the darkness!"</p>
                    <p>Feeling as I did, you may wonder I didn't give warning. Once I very nearly
                        did so ; but at the last moment something held me back. Whether it was
                        compassion for my mistress, who had grown more and more dependent on me, or
                        unwillingness to try a new place, or some other feeling that I couldn't put
                        a name to, I lingered on as if spell-bound, though every night was dreadful
                        to me, and the days but little better.</p>
                    <p>For one thing, I didn't like Mrs. Brympton's looks. She had never been the
                        same since that night, no more than I had. I thought she would brighten up
                        after Mr. Brympton left, but though she seemed easier in her mind, her
                        spirits didn’t revive, nor her strength either. She had grown attached to
                        me, and seemed to like to have me about; and Agnes told me one day that,
                        since Emma Saxon's death, I was the only maid her mistress had taken to.
                        This gave me a warm feeling for the poor lady, though after all there was
                        little I could do to help her.</p>
                    <pb n="557" facs="pageImages/Bell_557.jpg"/>

                    <pb n="558" facs="pageImages/Bell_558.jpg"/>
                    <p>After Mr. Brympton's departure, Mr. Ranford took to coming again, though less
                        often than formerly. I met him once or twice in the grounds, or in the
                        village, and I couldn't but think there was a change in him too ; but I set
                        it down to my disordered fancy.</p>
                    <p>The weeks passed, and Mr. Brympton had now been a month absent. We heard he
                        was cruising with a friend in the <placeName><ref target="a0010"
                                corresp="n0010">West Indies</ref></placeName>, and Mr. Wace said
                        that was a long way off, but though you had the wings of a dove and went to
                        the uttermost parts of the earth, you couldn't get away from the Almighty.
                        Agnes said that as long as he stayed away from
                            <placeName>Brympton</placeName>, the Almighty might have him and welcome
                        ; and this raised a laugh, though Mrs. Blinder tried to look shocked, and
                        Mr. Wace said the bears would eat us.</p>
                    <p>We were all glad to hear that the <placeName>West Indies</placeName> were a
                        long way off, and I remember that, in spite of Mr. Wace's solemn looks, we
                        had a very merry dinner that day in the hall. I don't know if it was because
                        of my being in better spirits, but I fancied Mrs. Brympton looked better
                        too, and seemed more cheerful in her manner. She had been for a walk in the
                        morning, and after luncheon she lay down in her room, and I read aloud to
                        her. When she dismissed me I went to my own room feeling quite bright and
                        happy, and for the first time in weeks walked past the locked door without
                        thinking of it. As I sat down to my work I looked out and saw a few
                        snow-flakes falling. The sight was pleasanter than the eternal rain, and I
                        pictured to myself how pretty the bare gardens would look in their white
                        mantle. It seemed to me as if the snow would cover up all the dreariness,
                        indoors as well as out.</p>
                    <p>The fancy had hardly crossed my mind when I heard a step at my side. I looked
                        up, thinking it was Agnes.</p>
                    <p>"Well, Agnes—" said I, and the words froze on my tongue; for there, in the
                        door, stood Emma Saxon.</p>
                    <p>I don't know how long she stood there. I only know I couldn't stir or take my
                        eyes from her. Afterward I was terribly frightened, but at the time it
                        wasn't fear I felt, but something deeper and quieter. She looked at me long
                        and long, and her face was just one dumb prayer to me—but how in the world
                        was I to help her ? Suddenly she turned, and I heard her walk down the
                        passage. This time I wasn't afraid to follow—I felt that I must know what
                        she wanted. I sprang up and ran out. She was at the other end of the
                        passage, and I expected her to take the turn toward my mistress's room ; but
                        instead of that she pushed open the door that led to the<ref target="a0011"
                            corresp="n0011">backstairs</ref>. I followed her down the stairs, and
                        across the passageway to the back door. The kitchen and hall were empty at
                        that hour, the servants being off duty, except for the footman, who was in
                        the pantry. At the door she stood still a moment, with another look at me;
                        then she turned the handle, and stepped out. For a minute I hesitated. Where
                        was she leading me to ? The door had closed softly after her, and I opened
                        it and looked out, half-expecting to find that she had disappeared. But I
                        saw her a few yards off, hurrying across the court-yard to the path through
                        the woods. Her figure looked black and lonely in the snow, and for a second
                        my heart failed me and I thought of turning back. But all the while she was
                        drawing me after her; and catching up an old shawl of Mrs. Blinder's I ran
                        out into the open.</p>
                    <p>Emma Saxon was in the wood-path now. She walked on steadily, and I followed
                        at the same pace, till we passed out of the gates and reached the high-road.
                        Then she struck across the open fields to the village. By this time the
                        ground was white, and as she climbed the slope of a bare hill ahead of me I
                        noticed that she left no foot-prints behind her. At sight of that, my heart
                        shrivelled up within me, and my knees were water. Somehow, it was worse here
                        than indoors. She made the whole countryside seem lonely as the grave, with
                        none but us two in it, and no help in the wide world.</p>
                    <p>Once I tried to go back ; but she turned and looked at me, and it was as if
                        she had dragged me with ropes. After that I followed her like a dog. We came
                        to the village, and she led me through it, past the church and the<ref
                            target="a0012" corresp="n0012"> blacksmith's shop</ref>, and down the
                        lane to Mr. Ranford's. Mr. Ranford's house stands close to the road: a plain
                        old-fashioned building, with a <pb n="559" facs="pageImages/Bell_559.jpg"
                            />flagged path leading to the door between box-borders. The
                        lane was deserted, and as I turned into it, I saw Emma Saxon pause under the
                        old elm by the gate. And now another fear came over me. I saw that we had
                        reached the end of our journey, and that it was my turn to act. All the way
                        from <placeName>Brympton</placeName> I had been asking myself what she
                        wanted of me, but I had followed in a trance, as it were, and not till I saw
                        her stop at Mr. Ranford's gate did my brain begin to clear itself. It stood
                        a little way off in the snow, my heart beating fit to strangle me, and my
                        feet frozen to the ground; and she stood under the elm and watched me.</p>
                    <p>I knew well enough that she hadn't led me there for nothing. I felt there was
                        something I ought to say or do—but how was I to guess what it was? I had
                        never thought harm of my mistress and Mr. Ranford, but I was sure now that,
                        from one cause or another, some dreadful thing hung over them. <hi

                    <p>It turned me faint to think of speaking to her; but I<ref target="a0013"
                            corresp="n0013"> plucked up heart</ref> and dragged myself across the
                        few yards between us. As I did so, I heard the house-door open, and saw Mr.
                        Ranford approaching. He looked handsome and cheerful, as my mistress had
                        looked that morning, and at sight of him the blood began to flow again in my
                        veins.</p>
                    <p>"Why, Hartley," said he, "what's the matter? I saw you coming down the lane
                        just now, and came out to see if you had taken root in the snow." He stopped
                        and stared at me. "What are you looking at?" he says.</p>
                    <p>I turned toward the elm as he spoke, and his eyes followed me; but there was
                        no one there. The lane was empty as far as the eye could reach.</p>
                    <p>A sense of helplessness came over me. She was gone, and I had not been able
                        to guess what she wanted. Her last look had pierced me to the marrow; and
                        yet it had not told me! All at once, I felt more desolate than when she had
                        stood there watching me. It seemed as if she had left me all alone to carry
                        the weight of the secret I couldn't guess. The snow went round me in great
                        circles, and the ground fell away from me. . . .</p>
                    <p>A drop of brandy and the warmth of Mr. Ranford's fire soon brought me to, and
                        I insisted on being driven back at once to <placeName>Brympton</placeName>.
                        It was nearly dark, and I was afraid my mistress might be wanting me. I
                        explained to Mr. Ranford that I had been out for a walk and had been taken
                        with a fit of giddiness as I passed his gate. This was true enough; yet I
                        never felt more like a liar than when I said it.</p>
                    <p>When I dressed Mrs. Brympton for dinner she remarked on my pale looks and
                        asked what ailed me. I told her I had a headache, and she said she would not
                        require me again that evening, and advised me to go to bed.</p>
                    <p>It was a fact that I could scarcely keep on my feet; yet I had no fancy to
                        spend a solitary evening in my room. I sat downstairs in the hall as long as
                        I could hold my head up; but by nine I crept upstairs, too weary to care
                        what happened if I could but get my head on a pillow. The rest of the
                        household went to bed soon afterward; they kept early hours when the master
                        was away, and before ten I heard Mrs. Blinder's door close, and Mr. Wace's
                        soon after.</p>
                    <p>It was a very still night, earth and air all muffled in snow. Once in bed I
                        felt easier, and lay quiet, listening to the strange noises that come out in
                        a house after dark. Once I thought I heard a door open and close again
                        below: it might have been the glass door that led to the gardens. I got up
                        and peered out of the window; but it was in the dark of the moon, and
                        nothing visible outside but the streaking of snow against the panes.</p>
                    <p>I went back to bed and must have dozed, for I jumped awake to the furious
                        ringing of my bell. Before my head was clear I had sprung out of bed, and
                        was dragging on my clothes. <hi rend="italic">It is going to happen
                        now</hi>, I heard myself saying; but what I meant I had no notion. My hands
                        seemed to be covered with glue—I thought I should never get into my clothes.
                        At last I opened my door and peered down the passage. As far as my
                        candle-flame carried, I could see nothing unusual ahead of me. I hurried on,
                        breathless ; but as I pushed open the<ref target="a0014" corresp="n0014"
                            >baize door</ref>leading to the main hall my heart stood still, for
                        there at the head of the stairs was Emma <pb n="560"
                            facs="pageImages/Bell_560.jpg"/>Saxon, peering dreadfully down into the
                        darkness.</p>
                    <p>For a second I couldn't stir; but my hand slipped from the door, and as it
                        swung shut the figure vanished. At the same instant there came another sound
                        from below stairs—a stealthy mysterious sound, as of a latch-key turning in
                        the house-door. I ran to Mrs. Brympton's room and knocked.</p>
                    <p>There was no answer, and I knocked again. This time I heard some one moving
                        in the room; the bolt slipped back and my mistress stood before me. To my
                        surprise I saw that she had not undressed for the night. She gave me a
                        startled look.</p>
                    <p>"What is this, Hartley?" she says in a whisper. "Are you ill? What are you
                        doing here at this hour?"</p>
                    <p>"I am not ill, madam ; but my bell rang."</p>
                    <p>At that she turned pale, and seemed about to fall.</p>
                    <p>"You are mistaken," she said harshly ; "I didn't ring. You must have been
                        dreaming." I had never heard her speak in such a tone. "Go back to bed," she
                        said, closing the door on me.</p>
                    <p>But as she spoke I heard sounds again in the hall below: a man's step this
                        time; and the truth leaped out on me.</p>
                    <p>"Madam," I said, pushing past her, "there is someone in the house—"</p>
                    <p>"Someone—?"</p>
                    <p>"Mr. Brympton, I think—I hear his step below—"</p>
                    <p>A dreadful look came over her, and without a word, she dropped flat at my
                        feet. I fell on my knees and tried to lift her: by the way she breathed I
                        saw it was no common faint. But as I raised her head there came quick steps
                        on the stairs and across the hall: the door was flung open, and there stood
                        Mr. Brympton, in his travelling-clothes, the snow dripping from him. He drew
                        back with a start as he saw me kneeling by my mistress.</p>
                    <p>"What the devil is this?" he shouted. He was less high-colored than usual,
                        and the red spot came out on his forehead.</p>
                    <p>"Mrs. Brympton has fainted, sir," said I.</p>
                    <p>He laughed unsteadily and pushed by me. "It's a pity she didn't choose a more
                        convenient moment. I'm sorry to disturb her, but—"</p>
                    <p>I raised myself up, aghast at the man's action.</p>
                    <p>"Sir," said I, "are you mad? What are you doing?"</p>
                    <p>"Going to meet a friend," said he, and seemed to make for the
                        dressing-room.</p>
                    <p>At that my heart turned over. I don't know what I thought or feared; but I
                        sprang up and caught him by the sleeve.</p>
                    <p>"Sir, sir," said I, "for pity's sake look at your wife !"</p>
                    <p>He shook me off furiously.</p>
                    <p>"It seems that's done for me," says he, and caught hold of the dressing-room
                        door.</p>
                    <p>At that moment I heard a slight noise inside. Slight as it was, he heard it
                        too, and tore the door open; but as he did so he dropped back. On the <ref
                            target="a0015" corresp="n0015"> threshold</ref>stood Emma Saxon. All was
                        dark behind her but I saw her plainly, and so did he. He threw up his hands
                        as if to hide his face from her; and when I looked again she was gone.</p>
                    <p>He stood motionless, as if the strength had run out of him; and in the
                        stillness my mistress suddenly raised herself, and opening her eyes fixed a
                        look on him. Then she fell back, and I saw the death-flutter pass over her.
                        . . .</p>
                    <p>We buried her on the third day, in a driving snow-storm. There were few
                        people in the church, for it was bad weather to come from town, and I've a
                        notion my mistress was one that hadn't many near friends. Mr. Ranford was
                        among the last to come, just before they carried her up the aisle. He was in
                        black, of course, being such a friend of the family, and I never saw a
                        gentleman so pale. As he passed me, I noticed that he leaned a trifle on a
                        stick he carried; and I fancy Mr. Brympton noticed it too, for the red spot
                        came out sharp on his forehead, and all through the service he kept staring
                        across the church at Mr. Ranford, instead of following the prayers as a
                        mourner should.</p>
                    <p>When it was over and we went out to the graveyard, Mr. Ranford had
                        disappeared, and as soon as my poor mistress's body was underground, Mr.
                        Brympton jumped into the carriage nearest the gate and drove off without a
                        word to any of us. I heard him call out, "To the station," and we servants
                        went back alone to the house.</p>

                    iron grates. Horseshoes are made by blacksmiths called farriers. Up until about
                    the beginning of the 20th century, this shop was a common sight in farming and
                    rural areas and in towns and villages. Today, artisans have revived this ancient
                        tradition.<ref

                    cloth that is attached to the side of a swing door. Popular during the mid-18th
                    and 19th century, also in Jane Austen’s world, this insulating fabric prevented
                    noises from disturbing individuals on either side. It also refers to the
                    metaphorical dividing line between two domains, master and servant.<ref

                    Gothic tales it is the liminal space between good and evil. Liminal comes from
                    the Latin limen, which literally means "threshold." It refers to someone or
                    something being on a boundary between two things - often two extremes, like a
                    transitory, 'in-between' state. Manuel Aguirre (Liminal Terror: The Poetics of
                    Gothic Space), a literary critic, cites liminality as a defining feature of
                    Gothic literature. Doors and windows are often literal and metaphorical
                        thresholds.<ref
